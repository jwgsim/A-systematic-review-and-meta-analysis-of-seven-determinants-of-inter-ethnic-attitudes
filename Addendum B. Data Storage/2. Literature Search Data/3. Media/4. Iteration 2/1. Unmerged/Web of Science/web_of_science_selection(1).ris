AB  - The question of whether press coverage of racial/ethnic minorities has improved remains. This study tackles it by examining (a) how journalists' race/ethnicity affects campaign news coverage of race-related issues and (b) whether the nature of coverage is moderated by minority candidates and the racial composition of audiences. We pair local news coverage of 3,400 state legislative candidates with news data from 663 news outlets. We find newsroom diversity by itself does not influence the coverage of race-related issues. But in areas with large numbers of minority audiences, media outlets with diverse newsrooms are significantly more likely to cover race-related issues.

AB  - Background: The success of behavioral interventions and policies designed to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on how well individuals are informed about both the consequences of infection and the steps that should be taken to reduce the impact of the disease.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate associations between public knowledge about COVID-19, adherence to social distancing, and public trust in government information sources (eg, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), private sources (eg, FOX and CNN), and social networks (eg, Facebook and Twitter) to inform future policies related to critical information distribution.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey (N=1243) between April 10 and 14, 2020. Data collection was stratified by US region and other demographics to ensure representativeness of the sample.
   Results: Government information sources were the most trusted among the public. However, we observed trends in the data that suggested variations in trust by age and gender. White and older populations generally expressed higher trust in government sources, while non-White and younger populations expressed higher trust in private sources (eg, CNN) and social networks (eg, Twitter). Trust in government sources was positively associated with accurate knowledge about COVID-19 and adherence to social distancing. However, trust in private sources (eg, FOX and CNN) was negatively associated with knowledge about COVID-19. Similarly, trust in social networks (eg, Facebook and Twitter) was negatively associated with both knowledge and adherence to social distancing.
   Conclusions: During pandemics such as the COVID-19 outbreak, policy makers should carefully consider the quality of information disseminated through private sources and social networks. Furthermore, when disseminating urgent health information, a variety of information sources should be used to ensure that diverse populations have timely access to critical knowledge.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. People's response toward social distancing in the emerging pandemic is uncertain. In this study, we evaluated the influence of information (formal and informal) sources on situational awareness of the public for adopting health-protective behaviors such as social distancing. For this purpose, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted. The hypothesis proposed suggests that adoption of social distancing practices is an outcome of situational awareness which is achieved by the information sources. Results suggest that information sources, formal (P = .001) and informal (P = 0.007) were found to be significantly related to perceived understanding. Findings also indicate that social distancing is significantly influenced by situational awareness, P = .000. It can, therefore, be concluded that an increase in situational awareness in times of public health crisis using formal information sources can significantly increase the adoption of protective health behavior and in turn contain the spread of infectious diseases.

AB  - Information dissemination has drawn increasing attention of scholars and the government for its importance to disaster response. Understanding the dynamics of information dissemination can help the government disseminate information effectively. Considering people tend to share information with the intimate under disaster, social distance which measures the intimacy between individuals is introduced in this paper. An information dissemination model with preference selection based on social distance is also proposed. Through extensive simulations, we discover the information dissemination process will be suppressed if people prefer disseminating information to individuals with short social distance. In order to facilitate the information dissemination, award to spreaders is found useful for its significant acceleration in dissemination speed. In addition, we examine the efficiency of strategies the government adopts to disseminate information. Comparing to inform-way (q fraction of nodes informed in descending order of H-index), the government is recommended to disseminate information by broadcast-way (all nodes accepting information with a probability lambda(b)). Our work contributes to understanding the dynamics of information dissemination, and provides the government with suggestions to disseminate information effectively under disaster.

AB  - Objective: To assess the reach of three different types of road safety interventions (social marketing, education and law enforcement) implemented as part of the Iniciativa Mexicana de Seguridad Vial y Prevencion de Lesiones en el Transito (Mexican Initiative for Road Safety and the Prevention of Road Traffic Injuries) among youth in two Mexican cities (Guadalajara-Zapopan, Jalisco and Leon, Guanajuato), and to examine students' self-reported attitude change after being exposed to these interventions.
   Methods: A cross-sectional design was utilized to evaluate the reach of the city-wide interventions among a random sample of public and private high school and college students from October to December 2011. A total of 5,114 students completed a self-administered questionnaire.
   Results: In both cities, students reported a greater exposure to social marketing (73% in Guadalajara-Zapopan and 64% in Leon) as compared to educational interventions (29.3% in Leon and 21.6% in Guadalajara-Zapopan) and law enforcement activities (similar to 12% in both). Among respondents, self-reported attitude change was higher after being exposed to educational interventions than law enforcement. Social marketing yielded the lowest prevalence of self-reported attitude change.
   Discussion: Our results show a potential moderate impact, measured as self-reported attitude change, resulting from the three intervention approaches under study. Future studies should address the intensity of exposure as well as the translation of attitude change into safer behaviors. Information generated by this study could be useful for local authorities in the intervention areas to inform their activities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present study, researchers aim to understand the attitude of users towards information technology application in two university libraries of north India, namely Himachal Pradesh University, Shimla and Panjabi University, Patiala. Survey method of research was used to collect data from the users. The sample consisted of 391 users,which included PG Students, Research Scholars and Faculty Members in the Faculties of Social Sciences and Sciences in both the universities. The data were collected through structured questionnaires and further analysed using the Chi-Square test and Kruskal-Wallis test. The data analysis and discussion reveals that despite a few number of library users being involved in the decision-making of IT application in libraries and availability of few training programmes on the know-how of IT systems, a positive attitude towards information technology application prevails among the library users in both the university libraries. In the end, some key recommendations are presented for deriving more benefits from future IT initiatives in libraries.

KW  - IDEOLOGY
AB  - We examined predictors of political attitude change by assessing the independent and interactive effect of social dominance orientation (SDO) as a context-dependent versus an individual difference construct. In a longitudinal study, British students' political orientation was assessed before entering university (T1) and after being at university for 2 months (T2) and 6 months (T3; N = 109). Results showed that initial SDO (T1) did not predict political attitudes change nor did it predict self-selected entry into course with hierarchy enhancing or hierarchy-attenuating ideologies. More support was obtained for a contextually determined model whereby SDO (T2) mediated the relationship between social class (T1) and political attitude change (T3). We also found support for mediated moderation in accounting for effects of initial SDO on political attitude change. Findings suggest that SDO as a concept that is sensitive to group dynamics is best suited to explain shifts in political attitudes.

AB  - This paper explores how trust in formal information sources (government and media) and informal information sources (interpersonal) about COVID-19 influences compliance with preventive measures. This cross-sectional study uses convenience sampling of 478 adult participants. Data analyses using structural equation modeling with multigroup comparisons examine hypothesized relationships between trust in information sources and preventative behaviors and social distancing. Results suggest that understanding of COVID-19 causes is related to trust in formal information sources, but not to trust in informal information. Self-efficacy for prevention is related to trust in informal information sources, but not to trust in formal information sources. Worry about contracting COVID-19 is related to trust in formal information sources, but not to informal ones. Engaging in preventive measures is linked to both self-efficacy for prevention and worry, while social distancing was related only to worry. These findings have important implications for public health policy guidelines centered on clear and truthful media messages. The findings also facilitate comparative analyses of reactions to information sources across a decade of evolving attitudes toward media and government, between two cultures (Hong Kong vs. the USA), and between two different global pandemics.

AB  - In this research, the effects of microcelebrity endorsements on customers' attitude and booking intentions toward hotels are examined. Specifically, Study 1 manipulated the effect of information source (hotel official website vs. microcelebrity) and hotel type (chain vs. independent). Results indicated that microcelebrity endorsements yielded more positive attitude toward independent hotels. This effect was investigated further in Study 2 where the moderating effect of misleading photos on the relationship between information source and consumers' trust and repurchase intentions was examined. Results demonstrated that when participants were shown misleading photos, there was a higher level of trust toward the hotel when the information source was microcelebrity. When the photos were nonmisleading, the level of trust toward the hotel was unaffected by the source of the information. Taken together, these data contribute to the growing social media literature as well as the influence of microcelebrities on consumers' responses. Hospitality managers might also consider the potential benefits of including microcelebrities into their strategic planning.

The data were collected using a structured questionnaire in 2006. FINDINGS: Eleven percent of the nurses felt that work was very mentally strenuous and 45% felt that it was rather mentally strenuous. Male nurses reported more stress and dissatisfaction than female nurses. Nurses with very positive attitudes towards Internet use reported less stress and more job satisfaction than nurses with neutral attitudes towards Internet use. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: By supporting positive attitudes to information technology in nurses' daily work, we may increase their job satisfaction and thereby reduce their stress experiences.

AB  - Understanding how exposure and information affect public attitudes towards returning large carnivores in Europe is critical for human-carnivore coexistence, especially for developing efficient and de-escalating communication strategies. The ongoing recolonization of wolves (Canis lupus) in Germany provides a unique opportunity to test the role of different information sources and trust on people's attitudes towards wolves. We conducted a phone survey (n = 1250) and compared country-wide attitudes towards wolves with attitudes in a specific region where wolves initially recolonized and have been present since 2000. In particular, we investigate the relationship between information sources, trust and people's attitudes while accounting for factors like knowledge, exposure and socio-cultural determinants of respondents. We found significant differences in attitudes and knowledge about wolves as well as in the use and frequency of information sources between the two population samples. Higher knowledge, information from books and films, science-based information, and higher trust in information sources related positively with positive attitudes towards wolves. Comparatively, information from press or TV news was associated with more negative attitudes. Providing science-based information to the public and building trust in information is likely to be one measure, among others, to dampen extreme attitudes and improve people's appreciation of costs and benefits of human-carnivore coexistence. Management of conflictual situations emerging from large carnivore recolonization in Europe and beyond should consider incorporating assessments of people's use of and trust in information in addition to existing tools to pave new ways for constructive human-carnivore coexistence.

AB  - This study investigated how college students' exposure to recycling/reuse information through various sources, such as education, media, and interpersonal communication sources, affects their subjective norms, recycling/reuse attitude, intention and behavior. A self-administered online survey was conducted to ask questions about exposure frequency to recycling/reuse information sources, subjective norms, attitude, intention, and behavior based on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). The final sample consisted of 725 participants from MTurk. Structural equation modeling was used to test six hypotheses. The results showed that obtaining recycling/reuse information through media sources led college students to have a positive attitude, positively affecting their recycling/reuse intention and behavior, whereas the information obtained from college education sources positively influenced their intention and behavior via inducing either positive subjective norms or positive subjective norms and subsequently attitude. Interpersonal communication sources were neither effective in developing positive subjective norms nor recycling/reuse attitude. Significant findings may provide important insights into how educators, environmental agencies, and brand managers can more effectively manage information sources to promote college students' recycling and reuse attitude, intention, and behavior.

AB  - Background
   England's Time To Change (TTC) social marketing campaign emphasised social contact between people with and without mental health problems to reduce stigma and discrimination.
   Aims
   We aimed to assess the effectiveness of the mass media component and also that of the mass social contact events.
   Method
   Online interviews were performed before and after each burst of mass media social marketing to evaluate changes in knowledge, attitudes and behaviour and associations between campaign awareness and outcomes. Participants at social contact events were asked about the occurrence and quality of contact, attitudes, readiness to discuss mental health and intended behaviour towards people with mental health problems.
   Results
   Prompted campaign awareness was 38-64%. A longitudinal improvement was noted for one intended behaviour item but not for knowledge or attitudes. Campaign awareness was positively associated with greater knowledge (beta=0.80, 95% CI 0.52-1.08) and more favourable attitudes (commonality OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.10-1.70; dangerousness OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.22-1.63) and intended behaviour (beta=0.75, 95% CI 0.53-0.96). Social contact at events demonstrated a positive impact (M=2.68) v. no contact (M=2.42) on perceived attitude change; t(211)=3.30, P=0.001. Contact quality predicted more positive attitude change (r=0.33, P<0.01) and greater confidence to challenge stigma (r = 0.38, P<0.01).
   Conclusions
   The favourable short-term consequences of the social marketing campaign suggest that social contact can be used by anti-stigma programmes to reduce stigma.

KW  - Race relations

KW  - news media
KW  - cultivation theory
AB  - Data from several polling companies have suggested a precipitous decline in perceptions of race relations over the past decade. This study sought to examine whether national perceptions of race relations were shaped more by actual fatal shootings of unarmed Black men or by news media coverage of police shootings or, put more directly, whether it had a factual basis or was driven by societal narratives. Time series analysis examined the correlation between perceptions of race relations against both actual fatal police shootings of unarmed Black men as opposed to a leading national newspaper's coverage of police shootings. Results indicated that perceptions of race relations were correlated with news media coverage but not actual fatal police shootings of unarmed Black men. However, the examination of residuals revealed no correlation between these. These results suggest that race relations are associated with news media coverage in ways that reflect underlying cultural shifts rather than direct association.

KW  - CONTEXT
AB  - Cereal cultivation, mainly of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.), occupies a large area in Moghan Plain, Iran, with frequent use of pesticides, but research pertaining to pesticide use and farmers' attitudes in the area is scarce. The main objective of the present study was to analyze farmers' knowledge of pesticide hazards and use of information sources regarding pesticide use in cereal production in Moghan Plain in northwestern Iran for better understanding what drives farmed attitudes in pesticide use. To this end, a survey of 400 farmers was conducted. Pesticide use mainly concerned the most common herbicides used in cereal production in the area (2,4-D and MCPA), the most common fungicides used in wheat (mancozeb and propiconazole), and the most common insecticides used in maize (indoxacarb and chlorpyrifos). The surveyed farmers appeared divided, with almost half (49.2%) having rather negative attitude towards pesticide use and the other half (50.8%) exhibiting rather positive attitude. Experienced farmers and farmers with large cultivated land showed more positive attitude towards pesticide use. More than half of the farmers (53.0%) had rather weak knowledge of pesticide hazards, whereas one fifth (19.5%) had good knowledge. Retailers of agricultural inputs were the first priority of farmers among information sources, followed by neighboring farmers and personal experience. Structural equation modeling (SEM) showed a positive relationship between farmers' knowledge of pesticide hazards (causal impact 0.84) as well as farmers' use of information sources (causal impact 0.52) with their attitudes towards the use of pesticides. Data provide novel information on the role of risk knowledge in farmers' attitudes towards the use of pesticides and extends existing information on the role of farmers' use of information sources in decisions for pesticide use. Improving farmers' knowledge of pesticide risk and providing valid sources of information are fundamental for minimizing pesticide overuse in cereal production in Moghan Plain, Iran.

AB  - Anti-immigrant racism has become a prominent issue in Northern Ireland since 1998. It is an issue that is routinely understood and tackled through a 'race relations' framework. The first part of this article outlines and discusses the data on immigration and on recorded racist incidents in Northern Ireland, within a race relations framework. The second part of the article argues that the race relations framework is inherently limited because it treats racism as a crime to be punished, rather than as a manifestation of contradictions within capitalism as a social system.

When examined concurrently, these race-related variables accounted for more than one fourth of the variance in involvement in African American activism scores. Results indicated that cultural race-related stress, Immersion-Emersion Anti-White, Internalization Afrocentricity, and Internalization Multiculturalist Inclusive were the only significant and unique positive predictors of involvement in African American activism. In addition, Internalization Afrocentricity attitudes mediated the cultural race-related stress -> activism link and both Immersion-Emersion Anti-White and Internalization Afrocentricity attitudes mediated the institutional race-related stress -> activism link.

AB  - Introduction. This study investigated librarians' attitudes towards application of information technology in academic libraries and interrelationship between their attitudes and different factors of their professional and personal traits.
   Method. Primary data was collected from 288 academic librarians working across Pakistan.
   Analysis. Answers from 219 valid questionnaires were used for data analysis through frequency runs, cross-tabulation, Pearson correlation coefficient, and t-test..
   Results. The findings revealed, overall, that respondents showed slightly positive attitudes towards information technology. However, several librarians were confused over the ownership of information technology applications in libraries. A significant relationship was determined between librarians' information technology attitudes and availability and usage of information technology in libraries, expenditure on information technology, librarians' expertise in information technology, their awareness about new technologies, experience in computer usage, information technology training, academic qualifications, and experience as librarians. No significant relationship was found between librarians' information technology attitudes and library budget, size of libraries, type of libraries, location and librarians' gender.
   Conclusions. One of the outcomes of this study is that the information technologyattitudes of librarians have been found to be positively associated with the libraries' information technologyavailability level and librarians' expertise in information technology. Therefore, a significant effort is needed to enhance the librarians' positivity towards application of information technologyin libraries. This requires librarians' exposure to, and experience of latest technologies. Librarians' role in information technology-related decision making needs to be enhanced.

AB  - Police accountability is among the most prominent criminal justice issues in America today. Accounts of police misconduct captured by new communication and information technologies have played a central role in elevating this issue. On the continental US, the Black Lives Matter movement has driven these events, lodging the political debate in the larger context of racial inequality. In Hawaii, a parallel but distinctive series of events has occurred. A push for greater police accountability has emerged, but it has been more closely associated with gender relations than race relations and has involved women in political office rather than street protests. The Hawaii case also provides some generalizable lessons, particularly regarding the context-specific roles that gender and race relations play, and the potential for video evidence in promoting police reform.

AB  - The following article illuminates how race-related media effects research creates a space for race to be represented within quantitative literature. However, it presents barriers towards inclusion regarding the examination of diverse audiences and distinct media content, while also normalizing existing patterns of hierarchy by concentrating on the implications of White viewers. To address this, the following text presents a synthesis of previous race-related media effects research and discusses applicable theoretical frameworks. More importantly, this piece offers suggestions for future direction where diverse audiences and media content are centered, various inclusive social contexts are contemplated, and the expansiveness of mass media platforms, as well as the adoption of theories, inside and outside of the discipline, are brought into the dialogue. These recommendations are offered to champion creating a more equitable landscape regarding the future of race-related media effects research.

AB  - This study investigated the relationship between college students' perception of race-related barriers in career and educational development and their immediate (first-semester grade point average [GPA]) and long-term academic performance (4-year cumulative GPA) and the role of parents' instrumental and emotional support in moderating such effects. Participants were 820 undergraduate students at a Mid-Atlantic university in the United States. Path analysis of the proposed moderated mediation model indicated that (1) perception of race-related barriers was significantly and negatively correlated with students' 4-year cumulative GPA, (2) parents' instrumental support negatively predicted students' 4-year GPA, whereas emotional support positively predicted students' 4-year GPA, and (3) parental emotional support significantly buffered the negative direct effect of race-related barriers on students' 4-year GPA. Research and practical implications were discussed.

AB  - This study was conducted to clarify the relationship of student attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control to the intention of university student's use of innovative information technology for learning and their thoughts about integrating innovative information technology into instruction in Germany. Research subjects were 270 students pursuing different academic degrees at Ilmenau University of Technology. The data were collected by web-based questionnaires. Quantitative analytical methods, including descriptive statistics, reliability analysis, one-way ANOVA, regression analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and a structural equation model were employed using SPSS and AMOS statistic software. The results show that the perceived behavioral control variable has a relationship to students' behavioral intention. Attitudes toward the behavior and perceived behavioral control can predict the intention of the use of innovative IT and for learning in TU Ilmenau students. In addition, most students have positive attitudes toward the use of innovative IT in their tuition, and believe that university instructors and students should be trained to use integrating innovative IT in teaching.

AB  - Attorneys suffer from high rates of stress and mental health problems, and Black attorneys, who make up only five percent of all attorneys in the United States, are especially vulnerable due to underrepresentation and experiences of bias. The present study examined perceived stress as a mediator of the impostor phenomenon, race-related stress, and mental health among a sample of 142 Black attorneys (114 women, 25 men). Gender, age, impostor phenomenon, race-related stress, and perceived stress accounted for 51% and 57% of the variance in depression and anxiety, respectively. Perceived stress fully mediated the links between the impostor phenomenon and depression, cultural racism and depression, and impostor feelings and anxiety and partially mediated the link between cultural racism and anxiety. Results suggest that perceived stress is an important mechanism for understanding why the impostor phenomenon and race-related stress negatively impact the mental health of Black attorneys.

AB  - Democracies around the world are facing a rising wave of right-wing populism and new nationalism, which often relies on strategic exploitation of anti-immigration sentiments. While media have long been acknowledged as important channels of anti-immigration rhetoric, the evidence of the actual impact of news consumption on attitudes to migration and support for populist parties is still inconclusive, and largely limited to pre-digital media ecologies. Combining a representative two-wave panel survey (N=819), digital tracking of real-time electronic measurement of television, radio and online media exposure, and an analysis of news content, this study explores the effect of news consumption on anti-immigration attitudes and electoral behaviour during the EP2019 election campaign in the Czech Republic. Our analysis reveals that being exposed to news about migration - particularly on websites and on commercial television stations - increases the likelihood of voting for populist parties, while exposure to public service media leads to less negative attitudes towards immigration. At the same time, being exposed to more news sources intensifies, rather than reduces, anti-immigrant attitudes. This result challenges the assumption that a more diverse news media diet could serve as an antidote to selective exposure and "echo chambers", commonly linked with radicalization of political views.

AB  - Selective exposure to one-sided news coverage, especially of controversial geopolitical events, may contribute to growing social polarization. Existing research on echo chambersfragmented information environments that amplify homogeneous perspectivesfocuses on the degree to which individuals and social media platforms shape informational segregation. Here, we explore whether news organizations directly contribute to echo chambers through the hyperlinks they embed in online articles. Using network and text analysis, we examined coverage of the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO, and found that online news media exhibited weak community structure and high connectivity across news outlets. However, analyses also indicated that media sources were more likely to link to coverage that was similar to their own in terms of emotional valence and stereotype-relevant aspects of the events. While hyperlinking to diverse news sources may ameliorate fragmented information environments, selectively linking to similar coverage may contribute to growing polarization.

AB  - Technology, particularly information technology (IT), is changing rapidly and offers many advantages for users. IT has the potential to improve one's quality of life, but only if used. Research has shown that, in most developed and developing nations, senior use of IT lags behind that of other segments of society. This "gray divide" is a concern for government, business, and others. Concern about senior adoption and use of IT has been the motivation for numerous studies and is the motivation for this study of Chinese seniors. This exploratory study examines urban Chinese seniors' IT use, computers and mobile phones in particular, but also their attitudes and behaviors as they relate to the use of those devices. More specifically it examines several potential factors that motivate or hinder senior's use of information technology, including self-efficacy, satisfaction, comfort with technology, and both positive and negative attitudes. This study provides some insight into the quantity and diversity of Chinese senior technology use in urban China. Particularly noteworthy, the study found that technology ownership was quite high, and in general the Chinese seniors studied had positive attitudes and beliefs concerning information technology. This is generally good news for the Chinese government, which must efficiently provide services for the growing population of Chinese seniors, as well as for businesses that wish to capitalize on one of the largest senior populations in the world.

AB  - Social media sites, such as Twitter, represent a growing setting in which racism and related stress may manifest. The aims of this exploratory qualitative study were to (1) understand the essence of Twitter users' lived experience with and response to content about race and racism on the platform, and (2) explore their perceptions of how discussions about race and racism on Twitter may impact health and well-being. We conducted six focus groups and four interviews with adult Twitter users (n = 27) from Berkeley, California, and Greenville, South Carolina. We managed the data with NVivo and conducted an interpretative phenomenological analysis to identify themes. Participants described Twitter content as displaying both overt and subtle expressions of racism, particularly for Black and Latinx people, and serving as an echo chamber where similar viewpoints are amplified. Participants described how Twitter users may feel emboldened to type offensive tweets based on the perception of anonymity, and that these tweets were sometimes met with community disapproval used to provide a collective calibration to restore the social norms of the online space. Participants perceived harmful mental, emotional, and physical health impacts of exposure to racist content on Twitter. Our participants responded to harmful race-related content through blocking users and following others in order to curate their Twitter feeds, actively engaging in addressing content, and reducing Twitter use. Twitter users reported witnessing racism on the platform and have found ways to protect their mental health and cope with discussions of race and racism in this social media environment.

AB  - Diversity professionals are often expected to respond to campus race-related student activism. However, little is known about how they perceive their roles and relationships, or enact strategies as they engage in this work. Informed primarily by Williams's (2013) Strategic Diversity Compass and secondarily by Critical Race Theory (CRT), we conducted a qualitative case study of campus diversity professionals who had responded to race-related student activism. We found they relied most heavily on political leadership strategies, navigating existing structures of power and racism in the academy, educating the campus community, and translating student activists' needs to institutional leaders.

AB  - Context-Knowledge is linked consistently with organ donation attitudes, willingness, and consent. Negative information about donation and the recipients of donation can affect public opinion and donation willingness. However, it is unclear which information sources are most important in forming knowledge, particularly in Australia where little prior research exists.
   Objectives-To identify information sources that may inform Australians' organ donation knowledge and attitudes toward transplant recipients.
   Participants-1487 Australian residents aged 18 years or older who completed an online survey.
   Main Outcome Measures-Self-reported knowledge, information sources, and attitudes toward transplant recipients.
   Results-Participants felt fairly well informed about organ donation, particularly if they registered donation wishes, were female, and were older. More than half reported their driver's license, television news, and discussion with family/friends as donation information sources. However, information sources contributing to knowledge were personal experience, online, hospital, government campaign, discussion with family/friends, Medicare, doctor's surgery, and the newspaper. Differences based on registration status, sex, and age, were found. Discussion with family/friends and movies or television shows, as well as not having seen information in a newspaper or doctor's surgery, contributed to positive attitudes toward recipients, although the variance explained was small.
   Conclusions-People felt more informed by personal, medical, and government information sources than by mass media. Family discussion was not only a common information source but also contributed significantly and positively to both donation knowledge and attitudes toward recipients. Further exploration of information sources contributing to donation knowledge and community attitudes toward, transplant recipients among young men is needed.

AB  - Historically, African American activism has played a pivotal role in advancing social change in the United States. As such, there is an interest in examining possible factors that may engender activism among African Americans. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to extend research by Szymanski and Lewis (2015), which explored potential predictors of activism among African Americans. With a sample of 458 African American undergraduates, race-related stress, racial identity dimensions, and social justice variables were examined. A four-stage, multiple linear hierarchical regression model and two multiple mediation bootstrap analyses were employed. Race-related stress and racial identity attitudes significantly and uniquely predicted involvement in African American activism, complementing existing literature. Beyond that, social justice beliefs predicted African American activism over and above racial identity and race-related stress. More specifically, social justice subjective norms (i.e., social influence) was the most important predictor of activism for African American undergraduates. Implications for social justice development within institutions of higher education are discussed.

AB  - In British politics, it is clear that the idea of the 'Big Society' encompasses many aspects of state activity and civil society, including the work of constabularies. Implications of ideas related to the Big Society implemented in police policy and practice, particularly in the area of police race relations, are considered in this article. No matter what changes that may take place, they will be mediated by the police occupational culture, which itself might be changed by Big Society ideas and concurrent, significant cuts to police budgets. The article begins with a consideration of whether we adequately understand how police organizations change. Janet Chan's use of Bourdieu's ideas on the relationship between 'field' and 'habitus' is criticized. In light of this discussion, the article considers aspects of police race relations. In particular, the implications of 'seeing like a citizen' and 'participative policing', Big Society ideas identified by Martin Innes, are discussed.

AB  - The current study aimed to advance the eating pathology literature through investigating the association between a salient stressor for Black American women (race-related stress) and eating pathology, while also examining the potential mediating role of depressive symptoms on this association. In addition, the study aimed to examine the potential protective role of cultural worldview in this model. A community sample of 119 Black women between the ages of 18 and 60 years (M = 36.34, SD = 12.51) were recruited for the study. Results supported a significant indirect effect of race-related stress on eating pathology through depressive symptoms. Moderated mediation analyses revealed a conditional effect of depression at various levels of worldview. Contrary to our hypotheses, participants with a more collectivistic and spiritual worldview often engaged in more eating pathology as a result of self-reported depressive symptoms stemming from experiences of race-related stress. Implications and future directions are discussed.

AB  - Purpose - This study applies an Employee Satisfaction Index (ESI) model to quantify the level of job satisfaction and explores the factors that influence employee satisfaction, performance and loyalty to an information technology recruitment and outsourcing organization in Portugal.
   Design/methodology/approach - As an instrument of data collection, questionnaire was applied to the company's employees, which was divided into two parts: the first part consisted of a previous questionnaire, with questions related to sociodemographic characterization; the second part consisted of the ESI. The company operates only in the information technology (IT) market, and there are currently 300 consultants with different skills.
   Findings - The results confirm that the company's employees are globally satisfied, and this satisfaction contributes positively and significantly to the reinforcement of contextual performance and to their loyalty to this organization.
   Originality/value - Job satisfaction takes on a growing interest in understanding quality of life, strategic management and organizational performance. Job satisfaction contributes to the professional finding, that is, in employees' activity and in adopting positive attitudes toward customer satisfaction, thus promoting organizational performance.

AB  - This study explores the antecedents and consequences of race-related reasons for historically Black college and university (HBCU) choice. A total of 109 undergraduate students attending a historically Black university completed questionnaires assessing their race-related reasons for choosing the university and their intention to engage in race-related activities, as well as individual difference measures. Students with less contact with other Blacks growing up or more central racial identities were more likely to cite race-related reasons for HBCU college choice. Furthermore, lack of contact and higher racial centrality predicted greater intention to engage in behaviors to develop racial identity (e.g., race-oriented clubs and personal reading). Critically, race-related reasons for college choice mediated the impact of both contact and centrality on behavioral intentions. Finally, non-race-related reasons for college choice (i.e., academic and financial) were distinct from race-related reasons and failed to predict race-relevant behavioral intentions. Thus, the race-related reasons behind this critical life choice form a bridge between the race-relevant aspects of the past and intentions to engage in racial identity-developing behaviors in the future.

AB  - Introduction: Internal Family Systems (IFS) Therapy has grown in popularity over the last several decades, demonstrating promising utility, especially in the treatment of mood disorders. However, IFS researchers have yet to explore its relevance specifically for Black populations in the United States. Objective: The present study investigated relationships between self-leadership, racial identity attitudes, race related stress, and mental health outcomes. Specifically, this study examined self-leadership as a potential mediator in the relationship between Black racial identity attitudes and the experience of race-related stress and mental health outcomes Methods: Participants (N = 79) were Black-identifying undergraduate students who completed self-report inventories. Mediation analyses were conducted using SPSS. Results: Self-leadership significantly predicted less severe negative mental health outcomes. Additionally, self-leadership fully mediated the relationship between the pre-encounter attitude of self-hatred and mental health outcomes, and self-leadership partially mediated the relationship between multiculturalist inclusive attitudes and stress due to institutional racism. Conclusion: Findings point to the potential utility of a major component of IFS, self-leadership, for future Black clinical populations.

AB  - Background Many details of the negative relationship between perceived racial/ethnic discrimination and health are poorly understood.
   Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine racial/ethnic differences in the relationship between perceived discrimination and self-reported health, identify dimensions of discrimination that drive this relationship, and explore psychological mediators.
   Methods Asian, Black, and Latino(a) adults (N = 734) completed measures of perceived racial/ethnic discrimination, self-reported health, depression, anxiety, and cynical hostility.
   Results The association between perceived discrimination and poor self-reported health was significant and did not differ across racial/ethnic subgroups. Race-related social exclusion and threat/harassment uniquely contributed to poor health for all groups. Depression, anxiety, and cynical hostility fully mediated the effect of social exclusion on health, but did not fully explain the effect of threat.
   Conclusions Our results suggest that noxious effects of race-related exclusion and threat transcend between-group differences in discriminatory experiences. The effects of race-related exclusion and threat on health, however, may operate through different mechanisms.

AB  - In most developed and developing nations seniors lag behind the general population in information technology (IT) adoption and use. This phenomenon has been labeled the "gray divide" by various authors. This study examines the use of IT by seniors in Taiwan. We conducted a survey to examine Taiwanese seniors' computer and cell phone ownership and use as well as attitudes and behaviors that result from and influence use, to better understand the extent to which Taiwanese seniors have and will utilize IT. We found that seniors in Taiwan had generally high usage and access to computers and cell phones; however, the duration of use these two devices was relatively low. Our focus was on computers and mobile phones because they are the most commonly used personal IT appliances. These devices are the "face" of IT to users. This study also examined self-efficacy, satisfaction, and comfort with these devices, as well as positive and negative attitudes, because research has shown these to influence the use of IT. Taiwanese seniors had generally positively attitudes and beliefs toward information technology.

AB  - The principal objective of this study was to gain insight into attitude changes occurring during IT acceptance from the perspective of elaboration likelihood model (ELM). In particular, the primary target of this study was the process of IT acceptance through an education program. Although the Internet and computers are now quite ubiquitous, and thus many people can come to an acceptance of IT organically - including acceptance of such products as new released online services or software, some software - most notably programming languages and spreadsheets - may require education programs, and the efficacy of that education may determine the rate of acceptance. Thus, education programs for such IT may be regarded as not only teaching and training how to use the product from a technical standpoint, but also as a process by which program participants are persuaded to have a positive attitude towards accepting the new IT. This study adopted an ELM based longitudinal approach to capture the changes in the roles of persuasion routes and attitude during IT acceptance - in this case, the education program. To validate empirically the suggested model, junior students majoring in business administration, all of whom were taking an Excel class, were surveyed twice - just after mid-term and just after their final exam. These data were analysed via partial least-square method to deduce some possible implications. Our results supported all the hypotheses put forward.

AB  - Background: Social distancing is an effective preventative policy for COVID-19 that is enforced by governments worldwide. However, significant variations are observed in adherence to social distancing across individuals and countries. Due to the lack of treatment, rapid spread, and prevalence of COVID-19, panic and fear associated with the disease causes great stress. Subsequent effects will be a variation around the coping and mitigation strategies for different individuals following different paths to manage the situation.
   Objective: This study aims to explore how threat and coping appraisal processes work as mechanisms between information and citizens' adherence to COVID-19-related recommendations (ie, how the information sources and social media influence threat and coping appraisal processes with COVID-19 and how the threat and coping appraisal processes influence adherence to policy guidelines). In addition, this study aims to explore how citizens in three different countries (the United States, Kuwait, and South Korea), randomly sampled, are effectively using the mechanisms.
   Methods: Randomly sampled online survey data collected by a global firm in May 2020 from 162 citizens of the United States, 185 of Kuwait, and 71 of South Korea were analyzed, resulting in a total sample size of 418. A seemingly unrelated regression model, controlling for several counterfactuals, was used for analysis. The study's focal estimated effects were compared across the three countries using the weighted distance between the parameter estimates.
   Results: The seemingly unrelated regression model estimation results suggested that, overall, the intensity of information source use for the COVID-19 pandemic positively influenced the threat appraisal for the disease (P<.001). Furthermore, the intensity of social media use for the COVID-19 pandemic positively influenced the coping appraisal for the disease (P<.001). Higher COVID-19 threat appraisal had a positive effect on social distancing adherence (P<.001). Higher COVID-19 coping appraisal had a positive effect on social distancing adherence (P<.001). Higher intensity of COVID-19 knowledge positively influenced social distancing adherence (P<.001). There were country-level variations. Broadly, we found that the United States had better results than South Korea and Kuwait in leveraging the information to threat and coping appraisal to the adherence process, indicating that individuals in countries like the United States and South Korea may be more pragmatic to appraise the situation before making any decisions.
   Conclusions: This study's findings suggest that the mediation of threat and coping strategies are essential, in varying effects, to shape the information and social media strategies for adherence outcomes. Accordingly, coordinating public service announcements along with information source outlets such as mainstream media (eg, TV and newspaper) as well as social media (eg, Facebook and Twitter) to inform citizens and, at the same time, deliver balanced messages about the threat and coping appraisal is critical in implementing a staggered social distancing and sheltering strategy.

AB  - Cross-sectional and longitudinal research has shown that race-related stress is associated with increased depressive symptoms among racial/ethnic minorities. Rumination has long been considered a maladaptive self-regulatory response to race-related stress, and growing evidence suggests that it may be an important link in the relation between race-related stress and depression. More adaptive forms of self-regulation, such as active coping, may counteract the negative impact of rumination. We examined the influence of rumination on the relation between race-related stress and depressive symptoms in a sample (N = 69) of young adult (mean age = 20 +/- 1.5 years) African American women. We also considered the possible moderating effects of John Henryism, a form of persistent and determined goal striving, and vagally mediated heart rate variability, a purported biomarker of coping. Anticipatory race-related stress was indirectly associated with depressive symptoms through rumination: estimate = 0.07, 95% confidence interval [0.01, 0.16]. Both John Henryism and vagally mediated heart rate variability moderated the relationship between race-related stress and rumination; however, only John Henryism reliably influenced the indirect association between race-related stress and depression through rumination. We discuss these findings in the context of growing research examining the interplay between cultural and biological factors in the risk for poorer mental health.

AB  - Do discussions in echo chambers break down barriers on the acceptance political violence? We know from research within political science, social psychology and communication that deliberation in echo chambers-called enclave deliberation-works as a driver for the amplification of existing political attitudes. Moreover, scholars of radicalization have argued that enclave deliberation can lead to extremist ideas and the acceptance of political violence in response to political grievances. Yet, amplification of attitudes, even into extremist ideas, is not the same as accepting violence. We still lack causal backing for the widespread claim that enclave deliberation fuels acceptance of political violence. Utilizing a novel laboratory experiment with 188 participants, this article delivers causal evidence suggesting that enclave deliberation increases politically aggrieved group members' acceptance of violence. In addition, I find causal evidence supporting the claim that enclave deliberation amplifies existing political attitudes and makes group members' opinions less diverse.

AB  - Objectives: Participants in breast cancer screening programmes may benefit from early detection but may also be exposed to the risks of overdiagnosis and false positives. We surveyed a sample of Spanish women to assess knowledge, information sources, attitudes and psychosocial impact.
   Materials and methods: A total of 434 breast cancer screening programme participants aged 45-69 years were administered questionnaires regarding knowledge, information sources, attitudes and psychosocial impact. Scores of 5 or more (out of 10) and 12 or less (out of 24) were established as indicating adequate knowledge and a positive attitude, respectively. Psychosocial impact was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Cancer Worry Scale.
   Results: Only 42 women (9.7%) had adequate knowledge. The mean (SD) knowledge score was 2.97 (1.16). Better educated women and women without previous false positives had higher scores. The main sources of information were television, press, Andalusian Health Service documentation and family and friends. Most participants (99.1%) had a positive attitude, with a mean (SD) score of 3.21 (2.66). Mean (SD) scores for anxiety, depression and cancer worry were 1.86 (3.26), 0.72 (1.99) and 9.4 (3.04), respectively.
   Conclusion: Women have a very positive attitude to breast cancer screening, but are poorly informed and use television as their main information source. They experience no negative psychosocial impact from participation in such programmes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Public support for responses to the coronavirus pandemic has sharply diverged on partisan lines in many countries, with conservatives tending to oppose lockdowns, social distancing, mask mandates and vaccines, and liberals far more supportive. This polarization may arise from the way in which the attitudes of each side is echoed back to them, especially on social media. In this paper, I argue that echo chambers are not to blame for this polarization, even if they are causally responsible for it. They are not to blame, because belief calibration in an echo chamber is a rational process; moreover, the epistemically constitutive properties of echo chambers are not optional for epistemically social animals like us. There is no special problem of echo chambers; rather, there is a problem of misleading evidence (especially higher-order evidence). Accordingly, we ought to respond to misinformation about COVID neither by attempting to dismantle echo chambers nor by attempting to make people more rational, but rather by attempting to supplant unreliable higher-order evidence with better evidence.

PLS-SEM revealed that negative anchors related to space travel influence negative attitude while the objectification of SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, and Tesla influence the positive attitudes. Organizations with an interest in space tourism need to use scientific knowledge and scientists, documentary broadcasts, and serious news media for broadening their appeal, as more tangible scientific messages derive the higher response and impact.

AB  - In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. hotels have deployed service models that facilitate social distancing by using information technology. Based on emotion theories, this study built a conceptual model that explains consumers' intentions to use several personal and public technologies for social distancing in hotels (e.g., electronic menus, mobile apps). The model tested relationships between trust in the hotel, trust in system, technology anxiety, anticipated positive and negative emotions, and intentions to use technologies for social distancing. Using data collected from 1000 U.S. hotel guests, it was found that intentions to use technologies for social distancing were predominantly influenced by positive anticipated emotions, which in turn were influenced by trust in the hotel and technology anxiety. Several implications for academia and industry are provided.

AB  - Managing immigration is a challenge at the political, economic, and social levels. Clarifying the social psychological antecedents behind the onset of negative attitudes towards immigrants might help overcome this challenge. The present study investigates the relationships between people's experience of social exclusion, feelings of generalized interpersonal trust, and anti-immigrant attitudes across 23 European countries. We used data from the European Social Survey 8 (2016), employing a representative sample of the European population. A 1-1-1 multilevel mediation model showed that: (a) the higher the experience of social exclusion, the lower the generalized trust towards others; (b) the experience of social exclusion related positively and directly with anti-immigration attitudes; and (c) generalized interpersonal trust mediated the relationship between experienced social exclusion and anti-immigrant attitudes so that the experience of being socially excluded reduced feelings of generalized interpersonal trust that, in turn, promoted hostile attitudes towards immigrants. Taken together, these results create a platform for future research on the emergence of negative attitudes towards immigrants and factors that might facilitate the development of a climate of integration and acceptance.

AB  - In times of increasing polarization and political acrimony, fueled by distrust of government and media disinformation, it is ever more important to understand the cognitive mechanisms behind political attitude change. In two experiments, we present evidence that false beliefs about one's own prior attitudes and confabulatory reasoning can lead to lasting changes in political attitudes. In Experiment 1 (N = 140), participants stated their opinions about salient political issues, and using the Choice Blindness Paradigm we covertly altered some of their responses to indicate an opposite position. In the first condition, we asked the participants to immediately verify the manipulated responses, and in the second, we also asked them to provide underlying arguments behind their attitudes. Only half of the manipulations were corrected by the participants. To measure lasting attitude change, we asked the participants to rate the same issues again later in the experiment, as well as one week after the first session. Participants in both conditions exhibited lasting shifts in attitudes, but the effect was considerably larger in the group that confabulated supporting arguments. We fully replicated these findings in Experiment 2 (N = 232). In addition, we found that participants' analytical skill correlated with their correction of the manipulation, whereas political involvement did not. This study contributes to the understanding of how confabulatory reasoning and self-perceptive processes can interact in lasting attitude change. It also highlights how political expressions can be both stable in the context of everyday life, yet flexible when argumentative processes are engaged.

AB  - Background: A common reason for bystanders failure to perform CPR in real or hypothetical situations is their lack of confidence in themselves. CPR self-training, which uses learner-operated virtual media rather than a live instructor, has not been assessed for its ability to influence learners' attitudes toward performing CPR in a real emergency. The aim of this study was to compare attitude effects associated with traditional, live instruction versus self-training or no instruction.
   Method: Data from 1069 lay learners were collected. Learners were assigned randomly to a traditional instructor-led course, a video-based self-training course, or a no-training control group. All learners completed pre-training and post-training questionnaires that assessed competence, confidence, and willingness to perform CPR. Learners' objective performance of CPR was also assessed, post-training, via a recording manikin.
   Results: ANOVA revealed that, in all 3 groups, all 3 attitudes changed significantly from pre- to post-questionnaire; further, the amount of attitude change did not differ reliably among the 3 groups (P < .05). Of the objective measures, ventilation performance was the only one consistently and positively correlated with attitudes (P < .05). Despite focus group comments that suggested self-trained learners' concerns about the rudimentary nature of their training, these concerns did not manifest as a hindrance to positive attitude change.
   Conclusions: Live training does not pose any measurable advantage for developing learners' positive attitudes. The counterintuitive finding that controls experienced similar levels of attitude change suggests that mere exposure to CPR testing can have positive effects on attitudes.

AB  - Trust in information sources about COVID-19 may influence the public attitude toward the disease and the imposed restrictions, thus determining the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in a given country. Acknowledging an increase in trust in the government or the so-called rally 'round the flag' effect around the world at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study explores possible determinants of this effect in Latvia, looking at such variables as the perceived disease risk, gender, age, education, income, and language spoken in the family. Presuming that risk perception may be amplified by trust in various information sources, we investigate a spill-over of the rally 'round the flag' effect on healthcare professionals, media, and interpersonal networks. Studying data from a nationally representative sociological survey conducted in September 2020, we confirm a positive relationship between trust in all information sources, except friends, relatives, and colleagues, and perceived disease risk. Correlations are also strong regarding trust in almost all information sources and the measured socio-demographic variables, except gender. Interpersonal trust seems to be relatively stable, and in most cases the correlations are statistically insignificant. With this study we suggest that increase in trust in government institutions as well as other information sources, even in crisis situations, does not depend on any single element, but instead presents a more complex phenomenon.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to identify factors behind the intention to sign e-petitions, focusing on three aspects, i.e. information (argument quality), the source of information (source credibility) and personal perspective (personal relevance and altruism). Design/methodology/approach Data collection is done by using a quantitative approach through an online questionnaire. This study involved 211 respondents who were internet users in Indonesia who had signed an e-petition. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling approach with IBM Amos version 22.0. Findings The findings revealed that there are three factors shaping internet users' attitudes toward e-petitions, namely, altruism, AQ and personal relevance, of which altruism was the strongest factor. Those who have a positive attitude toward e-petitions seemed to have higher intention to sign e-petitions. Additionally, we discovered that internet users believe credible e-petition initiators deliver better arguments, which drive them to sign e-petitions.
   Originality/value This study attempts to fill the research gap by examining factors from three domains, i.e. information source (the e-petitioners), information/AQ and personal perspective (personal motivation) of the e-petition signers. The authors enrich the research model with altruism factors that influence attitude in signing petitions. This study illustrates the characteristic of Indonesian internet user's and provides important implications for how the e-petitions site should improve the functionality of the sites.

AB  - Background Nurses are exposed to the changing demands in technology as they execute their patient-related duties in the workplace. Integration of Information Technology (IT) in healthcare systems improves the quality of care provided. Nursing students with prior exposure to computers tend to have a positive influence IT.
   Methodology A descriptive study design using a quantitative approach and structured questionnaire was used to measure the nurses' attitudes towards computer usage. A census of 45 post-basic first year nursing management students were participated in this study.
   Results The students demonstrated a positive attitude towards the use of a computer. But access to and use of a computer and IT was limited and nurses in clinics had no access to IT. A lack of computer skills was identified as a factor that hinders access to IT.
   Conclusion Nursing students agreed that computer literacy should be included in the curriculum to allow them to become independent computer users. The Department of Health should have IT in all health-care facilities and also train all health-care workers to use IT.
   Implications for Nurse Managers With the positive attitudes expressed by the students, nurse managers need to create a conducive environment to ensure such a positive attitude continues to excel.

AB  - Aims This study discusses factors inhibiting computer usage for work-related tasks among computer-literate professional nurses within rural healthcare facilities in South Africa. Background In the past two decades computer literacy courses have not been part of the nursing curricula. Computer courses are offered by the State Information Technology Agency. Despite this, there seems to be limited use of computers by professional nurses in the rural context. Methods Focus group interviews held with 40 professional nurses from three government hospitals in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Results Contributing factors were found to be lack of information technology infrastructure, restricted access to computers and deficits in regard to the technical and nursing management support. The physical location of computers within the health-care facilities and lack of relevant software emerged as specific obstacles to usage. Conclusion Provision of continuous and active support from nursing management could positively influence computer usage among professional nurses. A closer integration of information technology and computer literacy skills into existing nursing curricula would foster a positive attitude towards computer usage through early exposure. Implications for nursing management Responses indicated that change of mindset may be needed on the part of nursing management so that they begin to actively promote ready access to computers as a means of creating greater professionalism and collegiality.

AB  - Because of efficiency and easiness that it provides, Information Technology (IT) usage has a vital meaning for all sectors. To derive benefits from IT completely, it has to be discovered in all aspects. The purpose of this study is to investigate the reasons behind accountants' IT usage and in this context, compare two social psychology based theories; the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The data, obtained through a questionnaire that was responded to by 437 accountants, shows that if an accountant has a positive attitude and Subjective Norms (SN) towards IT usage, his/her intention towards IT usage is also positive, and the degree of intention is in proportion to the degree of perceived behavioral control. According to the stepwise regression analysis, TPB has higher predictive power than TRA.

AB  - Attitude change and persuasion are among the most studied topics in social psychology. Surprisingly, though, as a field we have virtually zero insight into perceived attitude change that is, how people assess the magnitude of a shift in someone's attitude or opinion. The current research provides an initial investigation of this issue. Across 6 primary experiments and a series of supplemental studies (total N = 2880), we find consistent support for a qualitative change hypothesis, whereby qualitative attitude change (change of valence; e.g., from negative to positive) is perceived as greater than otherwise equivalent non-qualitative attitude change (change within valence; e.g., from negative to less negative or from positive to more positive). This effect is mediated by ease of processing: Qualitative attitude change is easier for people to detect and understand than non-qualitative attitude change, and this ease amplifies the degree of perceived change. We examine downstream consequences of this effect and discuss theoretical, methodological, and practical implications.

AB  - Background: The United States (US) Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 has spurred adoption of electronic health records. The corresponding meaningful use criteria proposed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services mandates use of computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems. Yet, adoption in the US and other Western countries is low and descriptions of successful implementations are primarily from the inpatient setting; less frequently the ambulatory setting. We describe prescriber and staff perceptions of implementation of a CPOE system for medications (electronic-or e-prescribing system) in the ambulatory setting.
   Methods: Using a cross-sectional study design, we conducted eight focus groups at three primary care sites in an independent medical group. Each site represented a unique stage of e-prescribing implementation - pre/transition/post. We used a theoretically based, semi-structured questionnaire to elicit physician (n = 17) and staff (n = 53) perceptions of implementation of the e-prescribing system. We conducted a thematic analysis of focus group discussions using formal qualitative analytic techniques (i.e. deductive framework and grounded theory). Two coders independently coded to theoretical saturation and resolved discrepancies through discussions.
   Results: Ten themes emerged that describe perceptions of e-prescribing implementation: 1) improved availability of clinical information resulted in prescribing efficiencies and more coordinated care; 2) improved documentation resulted in safer care; 3) efficiencies were gained by using fewer paper charts; 4) organizational support facilitated adoption; 5) transition required time; resulted in workload shift to staff; 6) hardware configurations and network stability were important in facilitating workflow; 7) e-prescribing was time-neutral or time-saving; 8) changes in patient interactions enhanced patient care but required education; 9) pharmacy communications were enhanced but required education; 10) positive attitudes facilitated adoption.
   Conclusions: Prescribers and staff worked through the transition to successfully adopt e-prescribing, and noted the benefits. Overall impressions were favorable. No one wished to return to paper-based prescribing.

AB  - The recent ethnic tensions in Myanmar especially in the Rakhine state has once again placed the country onto the centre stage of global media attention. The aim of this paper is to look at race relations in contemporary Myanmar with a special focus on the Rohingya community. The paper argues that problematic race relations in the country today should be analysed within a certain historical context and should be seen as part of a historical continuum. This paper places a lot of importance on this historical continuum. In this connection, the British colonial policies of divide and conquer, politicians and their obsession with Buddhism and trying to make it the state religion shortly after independence in 1948, and the xenophobic policies followed by the military junta after 1962 deserve special mention. The paper further argues that the current state of affairs and escalation in violence has happened recently because of the convergence of the activities and ideologies of certain political groups like the military junta, the National League for Democracy, the Arakan League for Democracy, and the role played by certain Buddhist extremist groups like the MaBaTha in Burmese politics. To ease the existing tension in the Rakhine, the central government would need to take a more federally minded approach and introduce meaningful democracy and development in the frontier parts of the country where there is a strong ethnic minority presence.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate consumer characteristics (gender, subjective knowledge of product category, susceptibility to social influence, attitude to internet shopping and internet use) having a bearing on the proportion of online information searches conducted using personal and impersonal information sources, and to explore which of these factors impact the use of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM).
   Design/methodology/approach - A real-time longitudinal design is used to survey 274 consumers about their information searches when shopping for high involvement goods.
   Findings - Susceptibility to normative social influence and internet use prove the main drivers of the inclination to resort to the internet to conduct searches using personal information sources. Subjective knowledge also positively impacts the proportion of time spent online conducting searches using personal information sources. Men and consumers with a positive attitude to internet shopping use a greater proportion of impersonal online information sources. Complementary analyses show that the use of eWOM is driven by almost all consumer characteristics (except gender) investigated.
   Originality/value - By using a real-time longitudinal approach, this study directly addresses calls for more research into information searches by investigating multi-channel source use in actual purchase situations and minimizing bias relating to forgotten information, while facilitating the collection of more valid data on consumer information search behaviour. The paper also ranks as one of the first to revisit the drivers of the proportion of online information sources in personal and impersonal sources in the era of Web 2.0.

AB  - The present study was designed to examine shifting, the phenomenon of altering or modifying one's self-presentation in different social contexts, as a mediator of the predictive effects of African American women's acculturation on their perceived race-related stress. To explore this issue, measures of African American acculturation, shifting, and race-related stress were examined within a structural model. The current study quantitatively examined the relationships of these variables among a sample of 366 African American women. Results of a structural equation model indicated full mediation; greater levels of immersion in African American acculturation resulted in greater levels of shifting, which, in turn, generated increased levels of race-related stress. These data extend previous work and expand the literature regarding African American women's shifting. Implications for clinical work and future research with African American women are also discussed.

AB  - This paper reports on three studies examining people's belief about race as biological. Study 1 (N = 155) found that the relationship between early exposure to diversity as a child and belief in race as biological was moderated by socioeconomic status. Study 2 (N = 210) found that belief in race as biological was related to greater social distance toward out-group members, and this relationship was mediated by out-group discomfort. Study 3 found that participants (N = 31) had significant decreases in belief in race as biological immediately following a daylong race relations workshop and in a 6-week follow-up, and this "unlearning" trajectory was particularly prominent among students who experienced greater social distance from out-groups. Results are interpreted and discussed in relation to reconceptualizing beliefs about race as rationalizing rather than proactive ideologies and for promoting positive race relations through education aimed at deessentializing race.

Design/methodology/approach Drawing from the social exchange theory, this study conceptualized the benefits of using technologies for social distancing, health risks, social rewards and privacy concerns as antecedents of value of using technologies for social distancing in hotels. The structural model was validated by using data from more than 1,000 nationwide US consumers. Findings Benefits and consumers' privacy concerns of using technologies for social distancing in hotels were the strongest predictors of value. Social rewards also had a significant but relatively lower effect on value. Health risks was found to have no influence on value. Originality/value The study is the first to examine the role of technologies in mitigating the effects of coronavirus. Thus, it extends the information technology and hospitality literature by examining the role of these technologies in safeguarding individual and public health.

AB  - A B S T R A C T In authoritarian regimes, without voting as a channel to gather public preferences, online public expression may become a major type of public opinion the government collects. However, online information can be biased and thereby mislead decision-makers. Combining data from a survey of judges and a national population survey, this article provides evidence that i) Chinese judges rely on online public opinion to infer public attitudes toward the death penalty, ii) online information is biased - online opinion is more punitive than the general public opinion, and, iii) biased online information seems to have a strong influence on judges' perception of strong public support for the death penalty, and this may explain why Chinese scholars, lawyers, and other practitioners have persistently overestimated public punitiveness. The findings reveal a less discussed peril of the internet echo chamber: its misleading effect on the information collection process of the government, especially in autocracies.

The author found that the use of modern information technology does not have a significant impact on Chinese and Japanese middle classes' trust in their national and local governments. However, the impact of technology on the middle classes' pride in their government system, and the wish to live under their current political system vary wildly between China and Japan. Modern information technology significantly reduces the Chinese middle class's pride in their government and their wish to live under the current political system, but it does not have the same impact on Japanese middle class. These findings provide effective guidance and references for the improvement of national image. Based on ROC (relative operating characteristics) curve analysis, the logistic regression model presents a good fitting effect.

AB  - Purpose - Governments around the world have used social distancing methods to slow the spread of COVID-19. Some people, however, have ignored repeated warnings about the need to maintain social distance. The purpose of this study was to segment individuals based on their perceptions of social distancing with respect to shared constructs, such as attitudes and demographic profiles. The findings can assist social marketing efforts to target specific groups for health campaigns.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study used a priori methods, meaning that the type and number of segments were determined in advance. Amazon's Mturk was used to collect data from an online sample of US residents (n = 759) in May 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Findings - Individuals' perceptions of social distancing were segmented as follows: Segment 1 = majority social distancing followers; Segment 2 = social distancing inbetweeners; and Segment 3 = minority social distancing rebels. Interestingly, some of these segments were strongly affiliated with political parties. In addition, the results show attitudes toward social distancing appear to be influenced by individuals' beliefs regarding their susceptibility to coronavirus and the potential severity of the symptoms or disease's impact on their lives.
   Research limitations/implications - This study makes several theoretical and practical contributions to the literature on these issues. In particular, it involved the application of the health belief model to the context of attitudes toward social distancing, which were found to be influenced by individuals' beliefs regarding whether they are susceptible to coronavirus infection and whether the symptoms or disease could have a significant effect on their lives.
   Practical implications - The results of this study will assist public health researchers, social marketers and policymakers in efforts to improve the effectiveness of health campaigns. Public health campaigns in the USA need to be bi-partisan. The finding that the social distancing rebels were mostly Republicans is consistent with an earlier report that those who identify with this party were less convinced than those who identified with the Democratic party regarding the efficacy of maintaining social distancing measures and more concerned about the adverse effects of these measures on the economy.
   Originality/value - Only a few studies have segmented populations based on their perceptions of social distancing. This study was designed to understand the distinguishing features of such segments to enhance health messaging and content and convince those reluctant to engage in social distancing to view the issue from the perspective of marketing and medical practitioners.

AB  - The aim of this study was to better understand nurses' and other staff members' attitudes toward the usefulness of information and communication technology in home-care settings. Research has found that beliefs about the expected benefits of information and communication technology impact the use of technology. Furthermore, inexperience with using information and communication technology may cause negative attitudes. This article is based on a questionnaire to 155 nurses and other staff members in home-care in Sogn og Fjordane county in Norway. The results revealed minimal use of information and communication technology at work; however, participants had positive attitudes regarding the potential benefits of information and communication technology use in home-care. Individuals' extensive use of and familiarity with different solutions in private lives could be an important context for explaining employees' attitudes. Given that information and communication technology is both a welfare service and a market good, this may explain individuals' positive attitudes toward information and communication technology despite their lack of experience with it at work. Experiences with information and communication technology as a market good and the way new technologies can affect work routines will affect the implementation of information and communication technology in home-care.

AB  - The information dissemination in social networks is affected by many factors. However, node attitude which is an important influence factor of information dissemination in social network have not been fully considered in the previous works. Aiming at the problem of the influence of node attitude on information dissemination, this paper proposes an information propagation model based on evolutionary game. Firstly, from the individual point of view, the node's attitude update rules are defined according to non-Bayesian social learning rules. Secondly, an inter-node game matrix based on attitude value is established. Based on the evolution analysis paradigm, an information dissemination model based on node attitude is established. The equilibrium solution of dynamic equations is replicated for both positive and negative attitudes, and the corresponding equilibrium points are stabilized. The validity of the proposed model is verified by numerical analysis and simulation experiments. They all show that the different attitudes of nodes play an important role in information dissemination.

AB  - The summer of 1976 is an under-cited moment of significance in the history of race and immigration in post-war England. A series of major incidents appeared to highlight lasting racial fractures in English society, often exacerbated by the provocative editorial decisions of the press. This article, focused particularly on events in the Lancashire town of Blackburn, analyses some of the ways in which constructions of a 'crisis of race relations' were developed in local and national newspapers during this tumultuous summer.

AB  - With the development of information technology in Taiwan, night markets have improved their service performance by building information technology technologies, including Wi-Fi, cloud payment and mobile payment services, and QR codes. One of the most commonly used social networking sites among young people in Taiwan is Instagram (IG). In this study, we investigated whether users trust IG to provide sufficient security, and we found that the correctness of the trust information has a significant impact on their software use. This study focused on Taiwan''s unique night market sightseeing experience and explored the use of Instagram by night market consumers. Questionnaire surveys and systematic sampling methods were used to survey consumers, and the number of valid questionnaires was 340. The results showed that the perceived usefulness and ease of use of IG Stories affected user attitudes, and user attitudes positively impacted behavioral intentions. Moreover, the attitude of night market consumers toward IG Stories was affected by trust, which in turn adjusted user behavior intentions. This research was the first to explore the experience of night market consumers using IG Stories. We concluded that night market vendors should strengthen their trust factor in order to have a positive attitude toward consumers and foster the higher behavioral intentions of consumers, which is essential for the successful promotion and marketing of night markets.

AB  - Background: Social distancing is an effective preventative policy for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that is enforced by governments worldwide. However, significant variations are observed in following the policy across individuals and countries. Arguably, differences in citizens' adherence actions will be influenced by their perceptions about government's plans and the information available to guide their behaviors-more so in the digital age in the realm of mass influence of social media on citizens. Insights into the underlying factors and dynamics involved with citizens' adherence process will inform the policy makers to follow appropriate communication and messaging approaches to influence citizens' willingness to adhere to the recommendations.
   Objective: The aim of this study is a comparative evaluation of citizens' adherence process to COVID-19-relevant recommendations by the government. The focus is on how three different countries' (United States, Kuwait, and South Korea) citizens, randomly sampled, respond to governments'pandemic guidance efforts. We draw insights into two categories of perceived government roles in managing the pandemic: (1) citizens' perceptions of government's role in responding to the pandemic and (2) citizens' perceptions of government's business reopening efforts. Undoubtedly, the internet and social media have burgeoned, with differing effects on shaping individuals' views and assessments of the COVID-19 situation; we argue and test for the effects of information sources, social media use, and knowledge on the adherence actions.
   Methods: We randomly sampled web-based survey data collected by a global firm in May 2020 from citizens of the United States, Kuwait, and South Korea. A nonlinear ordered probit regression, controlling for several counterfactuals, was used for analysis. The focal estimated effects of the study were compared across countries using the weighted distance between the parameter estimates.
   Results: The total sample size was 482 respondents, of which 207 (43%) lived in the United States, 181 (38%) lived in Kuwait, and 94 (20%) lived in South Korea. The ordered probit estimation results suggest that overall, perception of government response efforts positively influenced self-adherence (P<.001) and others'adherence (P<.001) to social distancing and sheltering. Perception of government business reopening efforts positively influenced others' adherence (P<.001). A higher intensity of general health information source for COVID-19 had a positive effect on self-adherence (P=.003). A higher intensity of social media source use for COVID-19 positively influenced others' adherence (P=.002). A higher intensity of knowledge on COVID-19 positively influenced self-adherence (P=.008) and negatively influenced others' adherence (P<.001). There were country-level variations-broadly, the United States and Kuwait had better effects than South Korea.
   Conclusions: As the COVID-19 global pandemic continues to grow and governmental restrictions are ongoing, it is critical to understand people's frustration to reduce panic and promote social distancing to facilitate the control of the pandemic. This study finds that the government plays a central role in terms of adherence to restrictions. Governments need to enhance their efforts on publicizing information on the pandemic, as well as employ strategies for improved communication management to citizens through social media as well as mainstream information sources.

AB  - The influence of different types of information sources on individual preventive behaviors remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the associations between individual information usage to obtain information about COVID-19 and compliance with preventive behaviors. This longitudinal study was based on an Internet survey conducted in August-September 2020 and February 2021. We used compliance with four preventive behaviors for COVID-19, "wearing a mask", "ventilation", "social distancing", and "avoiding crowds" as outcome variables, and 20 types of information sources based on people or institutions (Medical worker, Government, etc.) and media (TV news, Twitter, etc.) as predictors. Absolute differences and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using generalized estimating equations adjusted for possible confounders. Among the 18,151 participants aged 20-79, the mean age was 51.7 (SD = 15.9) in 2020, and 51.3% were male. In total, compliance with "wearing a mask", "ventilation", "social distancing", and "avoiding crowds" was seen in 86.2%, 46.9%, 45.4%, and 62.6% of individuals in 2020, and 89.3%, 38.2%, 47.2%, and 61.6% of individuals in 2021, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, "medical workers", "professionals", "the government", "Twitter", "news websites", and "TV news" were positively associated with compliance with two or more preventive behaviors (p < 0.05). The type of information source may play an important role in providing information for COVID-19 prevention.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between morningness-eveningness orientation and time-of day on attitude change, and tests the hypothesis that people will be more persuaded when tested at their optimal time-of-day (i.e., morning for M-types and evening for E-types) than non-optimal time-of-day (i.e., evening for M-Types and morning for E-types). Two hundred and twenty participants read a message that contained either strong vs. weak quality counter-attitudinal arguments (anti-voluntary euthanasia) in the morning (9.00 a.m.) or in the evening (7.00 p.m.). When tested at their respective optimal time-of-day (for both M- and E-types) there was a reliable difference in attitude change between the strong vs. weak messages (indicating message processing had occurred) while there was no difference between strong vs. weak messages when tested at their non-optimal time-of-day. In addition, the amount of message-congruent thinking mediated the attitude change. The results show that M- and E-types pay greater attention to and elaborate on a persuasive message at their optimal time-of-day, and this leads to increased attitude change, compared to those tested at their non-optimal time-of-day.

AB  - We examined how individuals' personality relates to various attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI). Attitudes were organized into two dimensions of affective components (positive and negative emotions) and two dimensions of cognitive components (sociality and functionality). For personality, we focused on the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness) and personal innovativeness in information technology. Based on a survey of 1,530 South Korean adults, we found that extraversion was related to negative emotions and low functionality. Agreeableness was associated with both positive and negative emotions, and it was positively associated with sociality and functionality. Conscientiousness was negatively related to negative emotions, and it was associated with high functionality, but also with low sociality. Neuroticism was related to negative emotions, but also to high sociality. Openness was positively linked to functionality, but did not predict other attitudes when other proximal predictors were included (e.g. prior use, personal innovativeness). Personal innovativeness in information technology consistently showed positive attitudes toward AI across all four dimensions. These findings provide mixed support for our hypotheses, and we discuss specific implications for future research and practice.

AB  - Background: Previous research has associated self-reported political conservatism to mental health stigma. Although the limitations of self-reported political attitudes are well documented, no study has evaluated this relationship from a more nuanced perspective of sociopolitical identity.
   Aims: To assess the relationship between political attitudes and mental health stigma (i.e. negative stereotypes and intended social distance), particularly from a standpoint of Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) - a more specific measure of political conservatism.
   Method: A sample of 505 New York State residents completed an online survey.
   Results: The results of this study indicated significant relationships between endorsements of self-reported conservatism and RWA to negative stereotypes and social distance in relation to mental illness. Individuals with High RWA' were more likely to see individuals with mental illness as dangerous and unpredictable, and less willing to want to socially associate with individuals with mental illness. These results remained statistically significant even when controlling for other factors that consistently predict mental health stigma. Negative stereotypes also partially mediated individuals with RWA's significant relationship to social distance.
   Conclusion: Characteristics of political conservatives and right-wing authoritarians (e.g. threat-aversion, personal responsibility) are predictive of mental health stigma. Terror Management Theory may also help to explain this phenomenon.

AB  - Aim The study aimed to examine the relationship between structural empowerment and attitudes towards computer use among nurses.
   Background Empowering organizational structure is a significant factor affecting employees' attitudes and behaviours towards using organizational resources. Health information technologies were proven to improve health care quality. No previous studies examined the relationship between structural empowerment and attitudes towards computer use.
   Methods A cross-sectional correlational design was used. Self-reported questionnaires were completed by 200 Jordanian nurses. Descriptive statistics, Pearson r correlation and linear regression analyses were used to address the research aim.
   Results Structural empowerment was significantly and positively associated with attitudes towards computer use. Dimensions in structural empowerment that predict positive attitude towards computer use were access to opportunity (beta = 0.382, p = .000), formal power (beta = -0.252, p = .006) and informal power (beta = 0.176, p = .046).
   Conclusions Strengthening access to empowerment structures is essential to increase nurses' work efficiency. Improving empowering structures can be achieved by enhancing opportunities to increase professional knowledge and skills towards computerization.
   Implications for Nursing Management Nurse managers should promote work conditions that motivate nurses towards positive recognition of innovation through efficient collaborations with the information technology teams.

AB  - This study examines the extent to which three types of online media (i.e., consumer reviews, personal references, advertisements) change consumers' attitudes toward a tourism product. Using a 3 x 3 x 2 fractional factorial design, this study also tests how visual format and message framing interact with media type to influence attitude change. Findings indicate that online consumer reviews change tourists' attitudes more than the other two media types, with empathetic persuasiveness playing the most influential role in negative product reviews and information involvement playing a critical role in positive online consumer reviews and advertisements. Moreover, visual format influences the effects of media type and message framing on attitude change.

AB  - Objective: We conducted a review of the literature to determine the impact of health information technologies (HITs) on nurses and nursing care.
   Background: Nurses' effective use of HIT has the potential to produce a positive impact on nursing-sensitive patient outcomes, patient safety, and quality of care.
   Methods: A review of the literature produced 564 unique references of which 74 were selected for review.
   Results: Findings suggest that (1) HIT improves the quality of nursing documentation; (2) HIT reduces medication administration errors; (3) nurses are generally satisfied with HIT and have positive attitudes about it; and (4) nurse involvement in all stages of HIT design and implementation, and effective leadership throughout these processes, can improve HIT.
   Conclusion: HIT has had positive influences on nurse satisfaction and patient care. Effective nursing leadership can positively influence the effective development, dissemination, and use of HIT.

AB  - Social Network Sites (SNSs) play key role to raise individuals' awareness in terms of political issues around the world. Young generation particularly university students utilize social networks for political activism and discussion. The present study investigates the effect of social network on political knowledge and attitude of Iranian university students. Mixed- method design was employed to collect quantitative data through a questionnaire followed by an emailed interview with Iranian media experts. The sample size in the study consisted of 382 Iranian students and 12 media experts. The findings of the current study showed that there is generally a direct and positive relation between the level of use of social networks and political knowledge, and attitude. Moreover, the results revealed that using social network sites have a significant positive effect on student's level of political knowledge and political knowledge mediates the positive effect of social network use by Iranian university students on their political behavior. The results of interview corroborate that easy access to modern information sources has increased political knowledge of the students. The results also implied the necessity of deploying an intelligent filtering rather than indiscriminate blocking of the social network websites.

KW  - news diets
AB  - In spite of the concern about the political influence of the new digital media, especially social media, a large amount of circumstantial evidence suggests that their impact on mass political attitudes and behaviour, which is the focus of this article, may be small. Online news is less widely trusted than the news consumed via the legacy media (TV, radio, newspapers and magazines) and social media are least trusted of all. Most people rely heavily on the mainstream legacy media for their news, which are also the most popular online news sources-especially the BBC and much the same news is accessed on the new and old media. The majority of people have a fairly mixed diet of politically neutral and partisan news and there is little evidence of political 'echo chambers'-even among the small minority that rely heavily on a single, partisan source. All age groups gather their news in similar ways, including the youngest, who make heavy use of the social media. Nevertheless, in the absence of rigorous research on causal effects on mass political attitudes and behaviour, we do not know whether the impact of the new media is strong or weak. The circumstantial evidence suggests they are likely to be weak.

AB  - Consumers' potential reactions toward genetically modified (GM) foods affect their commercial feasibility and determine the decisions of economic agents. Inconsistent information on GM foods has created a sense of uncertainty in Chinese consumers' mind. This paper studies how the information about risks and benefits of GM foods from major sources influences Chinese consumer intention to purchase GM soybean oil. This analysis uses data from a survey of 880 residents randomly sampled from 13 cities in Jiangsu province. Using a multinomial logit model, we analyze the effects of information consistency and source credibility. The results show because of new information about 17.36% of consumers increase their intention to purchase GM soybean oil, and 15.10% of consumers decrease purchase intention. Compared to consistent information, inconsistent information can maximize change of purchase intention. The attitude change is greatest when there is a moderate difference between the new information and the initial consumer attitude. Furthermore, trust in biotechnology research institutes, government departments about GM, and GM experts are easier to promote consumers to change their intention to purchase GM soybean oil in a positive direction. Finally, we discuss implications for agencies as to strengthening the regulation and supervision of information sources, and including public-involved policies.

AB  - The central aim of this study is to build upon previous research by investigating the role of product involvement, prior brand attitude, persuasion knowledge and game attitude in the brand attitude changes and purchase intentions of children after playing an advergame. In all, 279 respondents between the ages of 10 and 12 years participated in the study. First, they were asked to complete a pre-test survey addressing product involvement and prior brand attitude towards several products and brands. Two weeks later, the respondents were asked to play an advergame and complete a survey addressing brand attitude, purchase intention, persuasion knowledge and attitude towards the game. Our analysis reveals that a positive attitude change is more likely when the game player has already evaluated the brand positively. Furthermore, game attitude is positively related to attitude changes towards the advertised brands, consistent with affect transfer theory. Counterintuitively, a higher level of persuasion knowledge is associated with a higher intention to buy the advertised product. Finally, children who had a more positive attitude towards the game were more likely to report higher purchase intentions, indicating that games which provide good experiences positively influence behavioural intentions. We conclude the paper by discussing the study's limitations and suggestions for future research.

AB  - Consumers are always influenced by external information before making decisions to purchase energy-saving electric appliances. However, the effects of different information sources are overlooked by previous studies. As a kind of green and safe appliance, the Heat Pump Water Heater (HPWH) is expected to be popular in the Chinese market. This study, based on an investigation in eastern China, will reveal the attitudes of potential consumers to HPWHs and verify the effects of different information sources. The results show that official information (Information from enterprises and governments) can arouse consumers' positive attitudes toward HPWHs, yet can significantly reduce perceived usefulness among consumers, while unofficial information (Information from relatives and friends) negatively affects their attitudes. Although HPWHs are billed as energy-saving and eco-friendly appliances, consumers can obtain different information from online or offline interpersonal communications to obtain user feedback (which might be negative) before purchase. Some suggestions are proposed to promote energy-saving appliances.

AB  - This case study highlights several communication insights that have emerged from the South Korean national response to COVID-19. In particular, it focuses on how innovative disease control programmes and information and communications technologies (ICT) have been used in conjunction with appropriate message strategies. The South Korean government used ICTs in a variety of ways to enhance crisis communication, coordinate large-scale public health efforts and supply chains, and facilitate widespread adoption of preventive measures such as social distancing and mask wearing. The response and communication strategies were based on principles established by research in social sciences and recommended for pandemic response, including social marketing, crisis communication, and normative influence. South Korea's COVID-19 response and communication strategies can provide useful insights for national efforts to manage COVID-19 and other possible future infectious disease outbreaks.

AB  - This study explored intersecting concerns about COVID-19 and racial injustice against Black people in the United States using a syndemic perspective. Findings from a multistate COVID-19 needs assessment project examined the association of general and race-related concerns about COVID-19 and concerns about police violence against Black people with mental health symptoms in a sample of 2480 Black Americans. The role of cultural mistrust in vaccination status was also examined. Concerns about COVID-19 were positively associated with concerns about police violence and associated with worse mental health. Nonvaccinated individuals were higher in cultural mistrust but lower in perceived discrimination than vaccinated individuals. Perceived discrimination partially mediated the relationship between race-related concerns about COVID-19 and mental health symptoms. Findings can inform the development of culturally responsive strategies to address the syndemic effects of COVID-19 and racial injustice.

AB  - When Critical GIS emerged in the 1990s and gained momentum in the 2000s, its potential for enabling progressive social change generated considerable excitement. By combining the powers of mapping, information technologies, and critical social theory, it promised new possibilities for acting upon the growing social contradictions of the neoliberal era. Critical GIS seemed to open a pragmatic plane of action by fusing progressive geographic imaginations with concrete and tangible maps. As I reflect on the state of critical GIS in the middle of the second decade of the 21st century, new configurations of class power, patriarchy, and racism are rapidly reshaping our social and geopolitical worlds and are precipitating environmental destruction. Yet, I attempt to develop the idea that GIS is a tool for social transformation because it can produce new cartographies and spaces of possibility and build and expand geographies of hope and care that change social imaginaries in favour of non-hierarchical class, gender, and race relations. In short, critical GIS scholarship both engages ongoing progressive politics and can create new possibilities for change. In particular, I examine two interventions of critical GIS: creating cartographies of solidarity and teaching.

AB  - This is a review of the theoretical development of the concept of racism. From its 1960s activist roots, the concept lost its theoretical content in its 1970s popularization. Now racism describes virtually anything having to do with racial conflict. The concept is reintroduced and used to analyze the post-1970s race relations propositions. The declining significance of race, symbolic racism, color-blind racism, and unconscious racism missed the structural regressions brought on by the southern strategy to mask indirect and covert ways to continue racial oppression. As a result, the new Jim Crow was missed in race relations since the 1980s. A reconsideration of the theory of racism calls for a strategic approach to race relations research. Research should focus on the etiology of racism among European Americans and the central role played by White elites and the media in maintaining historic cultural and institutional arrangements.

AB  - The study of the influence of the Green Information Technology (GIT), using their potential to reduce the negative impact of the exhaust emission produced by light-duty vehicles, attending verification compliance to circulate in urban areas, is the main topic of the present contribution. Data collected through surveys answered by car owners in Mexico City, place the attention over the knowledge of the official exhaust emission test, their general acceptance, and the understanding of the exhaust test context, once they have received information from the proposed GIT (pGIT). The surveys consider the behavioral intention, attitude toward behavior, perceived usefulness, social influence and volitional control constructs to estimate response of car owners to the concerns about the pollutant emission and their willingness to change their position toward the pollutant emission reduction. The results show the interest of car owners to participate in a collaborative process, and develop positive attitude to cooperate in a social dilemma by considering the use of social networking.

AB  - This paper studies how public attitudes towards reduced immigration, the signature policy of the far right Sweden Democrats, respond once the party increases their political representation at the local level. To identify causal effects, we use panel data from 290 municipal election districts and compare otherwise similar elections where the Sweden Democrats either barely win or lose an additional seat. We estimate that a one seat increase for this far-right, anti-immigration party decreases negative attitudes towards immigration by 1.8 or 4.1 percentage points (depending on which national survey we use), contrary to the party's policy position. Consistent with these attitudinal changes, we find suggestive evidence the Sweden Democrats lose the incumbency advantage experienced by other small parties in Sweden. Exploring possible mechanisms, we find evidence for higher politician turnover and a rise in negative newspaper coverage. These findings demonstrate that political representation can cause an attitudinal backlash as a fringe party and their ideas are placed under closer scrutiny. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present research tested a prejudice-reduction intervention based on imagined contact. White children imagined interacting with a child from an ethnic outgroup (Asian) once a week for 3 weeks, or did not take part in this activity (control group). Compared with the control group, children who engaged in imagined contact subsequently showed more positive attitudes, greater perceived similarity, and willingness for intergroup contact. The effect of the intervention on willingness for contact was mediated by positive attitude change. Implications for imagined-contact theory and the development of prejudice-reduction techniques for schools are discussed.

AB  - Previous research has found that news coverage on immigration is often biased in negative ways and that it inspires the formation of negative attitudes towards immigrants. However, academic research about this link between news consumption and attitudes towards immigrants among adolescents remains limited. The current study aims to test this association from a media-exposure and intergroup-contact perspective using survey data from 875 adolescents in Flanders, Belgium. The findings show that only television news consumption, thus no other types of news consumption, was associated with adolescents' attitudes towards immigrants. Intergroup contact within the friend group, outside the school context, was linked to more positive attitudes. This study nuances earlier findings that news consumption predicts attitudes towards immigrants. Implications for future research are discussed.

AB  - Background: Globally, the use of violent discipline methods by teachers to manage child behavior is still highly prevalent despite enactment of laws that prohibit school violence. In the case of Uganda there is a dearth of accurate prevalence statistics on school violence and factors associated with the use of violence by teachers.
   Objectives: Therefore, the current study examined the prevalence of and attitudes towards violence. The study also explored the association between teachers' stress, positive attitudes towards violence and the use of violent discipline management methods.
   Methods: A representative sample of 291 teachers and 702 students from 12 public secondary schools in southwestern Uganda responded to anonymous self-administered questionnaires. Data were collected from April to November 2017.
   Results: Findings indicated that 86.5% of the teachers reported having used violent disciplinary methods on students in the past month while 91.5% of the students reported experiencing violence by teachers. Teachers (88.3%, n = 256) endorsed positive attitudes towards violent discipline. Teachers' stress was related to higher levels of violent discipline (beta = 0.20). This relation was mediated by positive attitudes towards violence (0.06, SE: 0.01, 95%-CI: 0.035-0.092).
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that teacher reported stress was associated with their use of violent behavior and positive attitudes and that positive attitudes reduced the association between teachers' stress and violent behavior. Therefore, interventions aiming to reduce violence by teachers may need to integrate effective stress management skills, in addition to nonviolent discipline strategies, and fostering attitudinal change towards the use of violent methods.

AB  - The world is experiencing the unprecedented time of a pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease (i.e., COVID-19). As a countermeasure, contact tracing and social distancing are essential to prevent the transmission of the virus, which can be achieved using indoor location analytics. Based on the indoor location analytics, the human mobility on a site can be monitored and planned to minimize human's contact and enforce social distancing to contain the transmission of COVID-19. Given the indoor location data, the clustering can be applied to cluster spatial data, spatio-temporal data and movement behavior features for proximity detection or contact tracing applications. More specifically, we propose the Coherent Moving Cluster (CMC) algorithm for contact tracing, the density-based clustering (DBScan) algorithm for identification of hotspots and the trajectory clustering (TRACLUS) algorithm for clustering indoor trajectories. The feature extraction mechanism is then developed to extract useful and valuable features that can assist the proposed system to construct the network of users based on the similarity of the movement behaviors of the users. The network of users is used to model an optimization problem to manage the human mobility on a site. The objective function is formulated to minimize the probability of contact between the users and the optimization problem is solved using the proposed effective scheduling solution based on OR-Tools. The simulation results show that the proposed indoor location analytics system outperforms the existing clustering methods by about 30% in terms of accuracy of clustering trajectories. By adopting this system for human mobility management, the count of close contacts among the users within a confined area can be reduced by 80% in the scenario where all users are allowed to access the site.

AB  - Introduction Racial disparities in cancer treatment contribute to racial disparities in mortality rates. The quality of patient-physician communication during clinical interactions with black patients and non-black physicians (racially discordant) is poorer than communication quality with white patients (racially concordant). Patient and physician race-related attitudes affect the quality of this communication. These attitudes are likely expressed through subtle non-verbal behaviours, but prior research has not examined these behaviours. Nonverbal synchrony, the coordination of physical movement, reflects the preinteraction attitudes of participants in interactions and predicts their postinteraction perceptions of and affect towards one another. In this study, peer reviewed and funded by the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities (R21MD011766), we will investigate non-verbal synchrony in racially concordant and discordant interactions to better understand racial disparities in clinical communication.
   Methods and analysis This secondary analysis includes racially concordant (n=163) and racially discordant (n=68) video-recorded oncology interactions, patient and oncologist self-reported race-related attitudes, perceptions of the interaction and observer ratings of physician patient-centred communication and patient and physician affect and rapport. In aim 1, we will assess and compare non-verbal synchrony between physicians and patients in racially concordant and discordant interactions. In aim 2, we will determine the influence of non-verbal synchrony on patient and physician affect and communication. In aim 3, we will examine possible causes (ie, race-related attitudes) and consequences (ie, negative perceptions) of non-verbal synchrony in racially discordant interactions. In aim 4, we will develop and test a mediational model linking physician and patient race-related attitudes to non-verbal synchrony and, in turn, interaction outcomes.
   Ethics and dissemination The parent and current studies were approved by the Wayne State University Institutional Review Board. Since only archival data will be used, ethical or safety risks are low. We will disseminate our findings to relevant conferences and journals.

AB  - Several electronic-engagement-related questions arise at work due to the beginning of a new era of social distancing, lockdowns, quarantining, and sanitization. These terms were not so common before. What challenges do employees face while working from home? Why do they face those challenges? How are they overcoming these challenges? In summary, in a work-from-home setting, what are the issues and solutions in engaging remote workers electronically? To answer these questions, 23 information technology (IT) employees in India and four in the United Kingdom were interviewed, and data were analyzed using interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA). A few information technology employees from the United Kingdom were also interviewed to ensure the transferability of the results. Along with a few suggestions, six challenges emerged. These may help employers formulate their electronic engagement strategies for employees in a better manner.

AB  - This study conducts a 2 (message type: CSR vs. CSA) x 2 (source: company vs. nonprofit organization) factorial online experiment to examine impacts on individuals' attitude changes and WOM intention regarding a company. Values-driven attributions and perceptions of company-cause fit were measured as mediating variables. Results indicate that individuals inferred more values-driven motives from CSR messages than CSA messages, which ultimately led to more positive attitude changes toward the company. Theoretical implications for both CSR and CSA scholarship are discussed. Several implications for companies and strategic communicators are offered.

AB  - Information technology (IT) has become a significant part of providing consistent care quality. The applications of the primary health information system (PHIS) in primary health care have rapidly influenced the care service delivery. Improved understanding of critical antecedents leading the PHIS usage can serve as a foundation for practice to develop implementation strategies and enhance system use for nurses. In accordance with the theory of reasoned action (TRA), this study aims to investigate the antecedents that influence nurses to use the PHIS, and to incorporate a framework of technology acceptance by individual professionals to improve the IT attitude in the health care setting. A total of 768 valid questionnaires were completed by primary health care nurses. The results indicated that compatibility has a positive influence on the perceived usefulness and perceived trust in the PHIS. If primary health care nurses perceive the PHIS to be trustworthy then they are more likely to consider it to be useful. In addition, when the PHIS is seen as both trustworthy and useful, then nurses are more likely to have a positive attitude toward using it. These findings have valuable implications for technology management practice promoting PHIS usage by primary health care nurses. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The adoption of educational technology in teaching depends on how well a teacher accepts it. This paper draws on a technology acceptance survey of pre-service primary mathematics teachers in Hong Kong to study the factors influencing their technology acceptance. This work adopted a mixed method approach, in which quantitative data were collected through questionnaire survey from 234 pre-service teachers, where the data were analysed using structural equation modelling with a customised technology acceptance model. The qualitative data were also collected from 14 of these pre-service teachers through interviews, and analysed using the iterative coding process. The results show an overall positive attitude towards the use of educational technology, while perceived usefulness is more influential than perceived ease of use. Perceived ease of use is found to rely heavily on facilitating conditions rather than computer self-efficacy. We also found that subjective norms have an indirect influence on the usage and adoption in our context. Explanations for these findings are discussed, together with implications of the results. Our findings are intended to provide insights to policy makers about how to design teacher education programmes that address the demands of learning and teaching with educational technologies in Hong Kong and related contexts.

AB  - The present research investigated the impact of a social information source's physical attractiveness on selective exposure to decision-relevant information. In two studies, support was found for the hypothesis that physically attractive information sources lead decision makers into being more selective in both searching for (Studies 1 and 2; selective exposure) and evaluating (Study 2; biased assimilation) decision-relevant information. In both studies, the effect was driven by differences in the selection and evaluation of decision-consistent information, that is, physically attractive information sources led to increases in the perceived quality of decision-consistent information as well as increased selective exposure to this information. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - The study examined sources of health information among Vietnamese women and whether these sources were associated with cancer screening outcomes. One hundred eleven participants completed a questionnaire with measures of breast and cervical cancer screening attitudes, efficacy, and behavior. A factor analysis of items that measured sources for information on cancer screening produced three factors: English media sources, Vietnamese media sources, and informal sources. These sources were included along with demographic variables in regression analyses to predict cancer screening outcomes. Results indicated that using informal sources for breast screening information predicted positive attitudes toward breast cancer screening and efficacy for breast and cervical cancer screening. Reliance on Vietnamese media sources was associated with lower cervical screening efficacy. Being older, having health insurance, and a higher income were associated with favorable cancer screening outcomes. The findings suggest that cancer screening programs for Vietnamese women should take into consideration preferred mediums for receiving health information.

AB  - Introduction: In recent years, effective Internet-delivered electronic (e-) mental health services have been developed to overcome the limited resources in face-to-face health care. For the successful dissemination of e-mental health services, individual predictors for their uptake and utilization need to be explored. For instance, little is known about the role of different information sources in attitudes toward Internet therapies. On the basis of technology acceptance framework, this pilot study aimed to identify differences in both attitudes and intentions to use e-mental health treatment services after providing psychoeducational information.
   Methods: 439 participants (mean age 33 years, SD = 10.6 years; 72% female) were randomly assigned to one of three text-based information groups (neutral text: n = 111; expert evaluation: n = 108; user evaluation: n = 112) or a control condition (no information: n = 108). We assessed attitudes toward e-mental health treatments using a 15-item German e-therapy attitudes measure.
   Results: Descriptive analyses revealed overall neutral attitudes toward Internet therapies. Ambivalent perceptions were found in terms of Perceived Usefulness (positive attitude) and Relative Advantage (negative attitude). The awareness of Internet therapies was rather low. Most participants evaluated self-help books, health websites and face-to-face counselling as more useful than web-based counselling and therapies and reported higher intentions to use conventional services in case of emotional problems. As hypothesized, variance analyses demonstrated that text-based information, especially expert evaluations, were associated with significantly more positive attitudes toward e-mental health treatment services compared to the control condition.
   Conclusions: Taken together, this pilot study suggested a positive connection between the provision of general facts about e-mental health treatment services and attitudes as well as behavioral intentions to future use such services. However, a limitation was the omission of baseline attitudes assessment. Thus, further research is needed to gain deeper insights into the impact of information on attitudes.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to integrate the theory of planned behavior (TBP) and the technology acceptance model (TAM) in social marketing to predict and explain technology adoption (gym equipment use) in physical activity (PA) behavior among Ghanaian youth. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative approach was adopted for this study. The empirical data for this paper were drawn from 314 youth who are gym equipment users. The hypothesized relationships were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings This study found that the salient beliefs, namely, attitude, subjective norm and behavioral control toward gym equipment use, do not sufficiently explain PA adoption. However, a better result emerges when these salient beliefs are combined with perceived usefulness (PU) and ease of use (TAM). Practical implications - This paper provides evidence for issues of potential research, policy and managerial interest. The study findings showed that PA adoption, not PEOU, was directly impacted by PU. Thus, policymakers and implementers of social marketing intervention programs should promote the positive attitude toward gym equipment technology use and the perceptions of usefulness (improve cardiorespiratory fitness, feeling healthy and building muscle strength) of using gym equipment technology instead of ease of use to increase PA technology adoption behavior. Originality/value Considering the uniqueness of this current study in the Ghanaian context, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first to integrate two influential theories, namely, the TPB and TAM, to examine the effects of the TPB and TAM variables on the adoption of technology (gym equipment use) in PA among the youth.

AB  - This study examines the linguistic landscape of the two major malls in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, through social distancing posters and signs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study draws on the conceptual framework of linguistic landscape theory, speech acts and semiotics to unveil language dominance, linguistic messages, image-text relations and poster elements that enforce social distancing. A survey questionnaire, primarily aimed at expats, was also administered to find out how they view and interpret the use of bilingual modes in disseminating the social distancing measures. The semiotic analysis reveals that Arabic and English are used in most of the posters, but Arabic remains the dominant language and the preferred medium of information dissemination. Speech acts analysis shows that representatives and directives facilitate implementation of social distancing. The findings also suggest that semiotic modes and signifiers (inscription and materiality) reinforce the effectiveness of the posters. Overall, the use of Arabic and English reflects the country's stance on language policy and economic vision for Jeddah to be a truly global city amid the pandemic.

AB  - Background and Objective Explosion in information technology knowledge and utilization among young people, referred to as digital natives, seems less explored in the health sector and training. This study was aimed to assess awareness, attitude and expectations of physiotherapy students on telerehabilitation. Methods This cross-sectional survey employed systematic probability sampling technique to recruit 200 physiotherapy students. A self-developed questionnaire which was tested for its face and content validity was used to obtain data. Data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Alpha level was set at p < 0.05. Results The mean age of the respondents was 21.2 +/- 2.04 years. There was higher prevalence of moderate awareness (43%) and positive attitude towards telerehabilitation (39%). Majority of the respondents (62%) had high expectation towards future telerehabilitation products and services. There was significant association between level of awareness of telerehabilitation and age (X-2 = 7.119; p = 0.001). Discussion The responding students in this study are by age in the class of digital natives, who should be conversant with technology. This could account for the higher moderate level of awareness of telerehabilitation. However, the higher rates of negative attitude towards telerehabilitation could be attributed to prevailing barriers to its utilization in Nigeria. Nonetheless, a large percentage of the students had high expectations for the future of telerehabilitation. Conclusion Nigerian physiotherapy students have moderate awareness and high expectation for future telerehabilitation applications. However, a larger number of them hold negative attitude towards it use.

AB  - Recently developed COVID-19 vaccines significantly reduce the risk of severe coronavirus disease, which is essential in the particularly vulnerable cancer patient population. There is a growing anti-vaccine concern that may affect the success of the fight against the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. To evaluate opinions and attitudes toward vaccination, we conducted an anonymous online survey among Polish patients diagnosed with cancer. We analyzed how socio-demographic factors, type of cancer, comorbidities, previous influenza vaccinations, and information sources affect the general willingness and opinions about vaccinations, emphasizing vaccination against COVID-19. Six hundred thirty-five patients (80.2% female) participated in the study. A positive attitude towards vaccination was presented by 73.7%, neutral by 17.8%, while negative by 8.5%. Willingness to get vaccinated was declared by 60.3%, 23.5% were unwilling, and 16.2% were undecided. Significant predictors of willingness were education, marital status, active anti-cancer treatment, previous influenza vaccination, and positive attitude towards vaccinations. Patients with cancer have concerns regarding safety, effectiveness, and the process of development of the COVID-19 vaccine. Overall, patients with cancer present positive attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination but required sufficient information on its efficacy and side effects.

AB  - Social network sites (SNSs) have been found to be closely associated with responses to social exclusion and to impact people with high or low levels of social anxiety in different ways. Our study tested whether social anxiety, an individual difference variable, affected the association between SNSs and responses to social exclusion. A Cyberball game was conducted to create social exclusion, followed by a waiting period during which participants were observed to see whether they would choose to use SNSs. Afterwards, recovery from participants' negative responses to exclusion was measured. Results showed that using SNSs benefited the highly socially anxious (HSA) group in terms of recovering from disconnection and feeling a sense of meaningful existence more than the low socially anxious (LSA) group. However, recovery from disconnection was lower for LSA individuals who used SNSs than those who did not use SNSs. Our research suggests that SNSs benefited HSA individuals after social exclusion, but hindered the recovery of LSA individuals.(C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - COVID-19 is a global epidemic. Till now, there is no remedy for this epidemic. However, isolation and social distancing are seemed to be effective preventive measures to control this pandemic. Therefore, in this article, an optimization problem is formulated that accommodates both isolation and social distancing features of the individuals. To promote social distancing, we solve the formulated problem by applying a noncooperative game that can provide an incentive for maintaining social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Furthermore, the sustainability of the lockdown policy is interpreted with the help of our proposed game-theoretic incentive model for maintaining social distancing where there exists a Nash equilibrium. Finally, we perform an extensive numerical analysis that shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of achieving the desired social-distancing to prevent the outbreak of the COVID-19 in a noncooperative environment. Numerical results show that the individual incentive increases more than 85% with an increasing percentage of home isolation from 25% to 100% for all considered scenarios. The numerical results also demonstrate that in a particular percentage of home isolation, the individual incentive decreases with an increasing number of individuals.

AB  - Information and communication technologies such as email, text messaging and video messaging are commonly used by the general population. However, international research has shown that they are not used routinely by GPs to communicate or consult with patients. Investigating Victorian GPs' perceptions of doing so is timely given Australia's new National Broadband Network, which may facilitate web-based modes of doctor-patient interaction. This study therefore aimed to explore Victorian GPs' experiences of, and attitudes toward, using information and communication technologies to consult with patients. Qualitative telephone interviews were carried out with a maximum variation sample of 36 GPs from across Victoria. GPs reported a range of perspectives on using new consultation technologies within their practice. Common concerns included medico-legal and remuneration issues and perceived patient information technology literacy. Policy makers should incorporate GPs' perspectives into primary care service delivery planning to promote the effective use of information and communication technologies in improving accessibility and quality of general practice care.

AB  - It is well documented that news media's coverage of social unrest is sensationalized; however, our knowledge is limited in understanding how the intersection of race with depictions of social unrest influences emotional responses to this content. By applying assumptions from the protest paradigm and intergroup emotions theory, the current set of studies experimentally examines this relationship. Results indicate that racialized news images of dramatized social unrest provoke heightened, complex group-based affective responses that vary based on aspects of psychological group identification among audiences. These outcomes suggest that journalistic practices, whether or not intentionally, may exacerbate race relations regarding social change.

AB  - Purpose - Public service announcements (PSAs) are frequently used tools to try to change attitudes and behaviors on social issues, including texting and driving, which has been social problem for over a decade. However, the effectiveness of such PSA campaigns often meet with varying degrees of success, suggesting changes to current anti-texting and driving campaigns are needed. This study aims to examine how to design more effective anti-texting and driving PSA campaigns by identifying the elements of existing campaigns that have the strongest impact on attitude change.
   Design/methodology/approach - In total, 682 respondents from Amazon's Mechanical Turk participated in an online study in which they evaluated 162 real-world anti-texting and driving ads. Respondents evaluated the ads on various ad elements (i.e. type of appeal, source of emotion, discrete emotions and perceived creativity), as well as their attitudes toward the issue after seeing the ad.
   Findings - PSAs that use emotional (vs rational) appeals, evoke emotion through imagery (vs text) and/or use fear (vs disgust, anger or guilt) result in the largest changes in attitude. In addition, more creative PSAs are more effective at changing attitudes.
   Originality/value - Overall, the results provide useful information to social marketers on how to design more effective anti-texting and driving campaigns.

AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the in-class behaviors of information technologies teachers and the factors that lead to those behaviors in the context of hidden curriculum on the basis of the opinions of information technologies teachers. From the qualitative research methods, the 'phenomonology' research design was used in this study. A total of 15 information technologies teachers who were teaching at secondary schools in a central town of a city located in the West Blacksea Region, Turkey, participated in the study. From purposeful sampling method, criterion and maximum diversity samplings were used in selection of the sample. Data were collected by means of semi-constructed interview forms. The gathered data were analyzed through both descriptive and content analysis methods. As a result of the interviews made with teachers, it was observed that the teachers gave messages and responses which were not in the scope of the formal curriculum. In this direction, teacher behaviours were divided into seven sub-themes such as "power and authority", "prejudices and discrimination", "narratives", "communication", "role-model", "getting a profession", and "school culture". It was identified that most of the teachers were authoritarian and serious, discriminated among students according to individual diffferences, conveyed the ideas that they did not adopt in real life, made social, moral and ideological narratives suiting with their own thoughts and beliefs, preferred teacher-centered methods and techniques and were not able to create a democratical environment during lessons. In this study, it was understood that information technologies served to the hidden curriculum especially in terms of adoption of school culture, interaction with students was effective in occurance of hidden learnings, and status and economical advantages of a profession were of primary importance in teachers' professional guidance. Depending on the results of this study, some educational conclusions and recommendations for future studies were also included in this paper.

AB  - Purpose Responding to the call for an extension of social marketing scope and application, this paper aims to outline implementation of a multi-stream, multi-method formative research approach to understanding human trafficking in the global South context of Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected using a multi-method, multi-stream research design. The study used alternative methods allowing a critical perspective to be taken. Findings Contradictions between upstream discourses and the lived experiences of trafficked individuals emerged. Specifically, moral and rational agency ideology, which conflates human trafficking with prostitution, unintentionally promotes human trafficking and underrepresents other forms of trafficking was evident. Experiences of socioeconomic oppression, traditional practices and an aspirational culture fuels positive attitudes towards human trafficking. The lived experience of human trafficking survivors while varied was underpinned by the common theme of job seeking. Participants perceived human traffickers as benevolent users rather than oppressors, and their rescue as oppressive and disempowering. Research limitations/implications - Application of a multi-stream approach is limited by research context, sample size, time and cost constraints. Future research extending the multi-stream research approach to other research contexts and groups is recommended. Practical implications - Multi-stream formative research design assisted to yield wider insights, which informed the design of a multilevel pilot intervention to combat human trafficking in Nigeria. Originality/value Extending understanding beyond individual, myopic approaches that have dominated social marketing formative research.

AB  - This exploratory study examines the impact of a collaborative inquiry- and design-based afterschool program on urban high school students' IT/STEM learning-using information technology (IT) within the context of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The study used a mixed methods design, involving 77 participants within two cohort groups, each participating in an eighteen-month intervention period. Data were collected from the pre- and post-surveys, analysis of the participants' IT/STEM projects, external evaluation reports, and follow-up interviews. Findings indicate that the program had a significant impact on students' technology and IT/STEM skills, frequency of technology use, and understanding of IT use in STEM-oriented fields. Some degree of impact on attitude changes toward IT/STEM and career aspirations in these fields was also in evidence. The study demonstrates that IT/STEM experiences supported through technology-enhanced, inquiry- and design-based collaborative learning strategies have significant impact on urban high school students' IT/STEM learning. Effect of afterschool programs on attitude changes and IT/STEM-related career aspirations of urban high school students are recommended areas of further investigation.

AB  - Fostering positive attitudes and increasing knowledge are key success factors for enterprise systems. Training can improve knowledge, but little research has investigated the effects of domain-relevant knowledge on salient cognitive beliefs and attitude in technology acceptance. We highlight the critical role of domain-relevant knowledge in the formation of beliefs and the shaping of attitude by developing a model of informed technology acceptance. We hypothesize the positive effects of multi-dimensional enterprise resource planning (ERP) knowledge on salient cognitive beliefs (i.e., ERP self-efficacy, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness) and general affective attitude toward an ERP system. Using survey data from gamified ERP training of 248 professionals from three different organizations, results support the proposed model, suggesting that ERP knowledge is an important antecedent of ERP self-efficacy, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and attitude. We find that ERP knowledge exhibits both direct and indirect effects on attitude. Moreover, we find that gamified training is an effective means of improving ERP knowledge.

AB  - Background: Recruiting deaf and hard-of-hearing participants, particularly sign language-users, for genetics health service research is challenging due to communication barriers, mistrust toward genetics, and researchers' unfamiliarity with deaf people. Feelings of social exclusion and lack of social cohesion between researchers and the Deaf community are factors to consider. Social marketing is effective for recruiting hard-to-reach populations because it fosters social inclusion and cohesion by focusing on the targeted audience's needs. For the deaf population this includes recognizing their cultural and linguistic diversity, their geography, and their systems for information exchange. Here we use concepts and language from social marketing to evaluate our effectiveness to engage a U. S. deaf population in a prospective, longitudinal genetic counseling and testing study.
   Methods: The study design was interpreted in terms of a social marketing mix of Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. Price addressed linguistic diversity by including a variety of communication technologies and certified interpreters to facilitate communication; Place addressed geography by including community-based participation locations; Promotion addressed information exchange by using multiple recruitment strategies. Regression analyses examined the study design's effectiveness in recruiting a culturally and linguistically diverse sample.
   Results: 271 individuals were enrolled, with 66.1% American Sign Language (ASL)-users, 19.9% ASL + English-users, 12.6% English-users. Language was significantly associated with communication technology, participation location, and recruitment. Videophone and interpreters were more likely to be used for communication between ASL-users and researchers while voice telephone and no interpreters were preferred by English-users (Price). ASL-users were more likely to participate in community-based locations while English-users preferred medically-based locations (Place). English-users were more likely to be recruited through mass media (Promotion) while ASL-users were more likely to be recruited through community events and to respond to messaging that emphasized inclusion of a Deaf perspective.
   Conclusions: This study design effectively engaged the deaf population, particularly sign language-users. Results suggest that the deaf population's cultural and linguistic diversity, geography, and forms of information exchange must be taken into account in study designs for successful recruitment. A social marketing approach that incorporates critical social determinants of health provides a novel and important framework for genetics health service research targeting specific, and hard-to-reach, underserved groups.

AB  - Purpose
   This paper aims to investigate the effect of matching social distance and the concrete/abstract visual presentation of the threats of distracted driving in campaign design.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study conducts a series of 2 (social distance frame: close vs distant) x 2 (visual rhetoric style: literal vs metaphorical) online experiments on the perspective of the construal level theory.
   Findings
   This study identified that a fit between social distance and visual rhetoric style of the threat enhances the effect of a social marketing campaign targeting young adults. A message framed in terms of socially proximal entities shows a favorable impact on young drivers' threat perception and behavioral intention when the visual rhetoric depicts the threats of texting while driving more concrete. On the other hand, more distant social entities in the message show a better impact when the threats are visualized in metaphor.
   Originality/value
   This paper enhances the understanding of a threat appeal message design by adding empirical evidence of matching visual rhetoric style and social distance. The findings provide theoretical and practical implications for social marketing campaigns, regarding the strategic tailoring of messages, particularly in public service announcements that discourage texting while driving on young adults.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to investigate how attitude change happens on social media and explore the factors key to persuasion. We apply social impact theory to investigate the effects of persuader immediacy or relationship closeness, message persuasiveness, and perceived supportiveness on attitude change on Facebook. Using 2016 Taiwan President election as the backdrop, 313 Taiwan President election voters were invited to participate in the survey. Results show that persuader immediacy is not significantly related to attitude change or attitude maintenance, while message persuasiveness and supportiveness are significantly related to both attitude change and maintenance, which in turn, predict one's intentions to vote for the opposite political camp.

AB  - Integrating information technology into healthcare has the potential to bring treatment to hard-to-reach people. Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI), however, may derive limited benefit from these advances in care because of lack of computer ownership and experience. To date, conclusions about the computer skills and attitudes of adults with SMI have been based primarily on self-report. In the current study, 28 psychiatric outpatients with co-occurring cocaine use were interviewed about their computer use and opinions, and 25 were then directly observed using task analysis and think aloud methods as they navigated a multi-component health informational website. Participants reported low rates of computer ownership and use, and negative attitudes towards computers. Self-reported computer skills were higher than demonstrated in the task analysis. However, some participants spontaneously expressed more positive attitudes and greater computer self-efficacy after navigating the website. Implications for increasing access to computer-based health information are discussed.

AB  - This study investigated the extent to which values play a role in affecting citizens' political attitudes when exposed to different media news frames and political speech sources. To test this, we designed a survey experiment which used news coverage of a political speech concerning the cultural practices of immigrants (N = 337). We manipulated the manner of how the news was framed (episodic vs. thematic) and the source of the speech (domestic vs. foreign politician). Our main finding shows that citizens who scored high on 'universalism' were more affected by a foreign source in an episodic news frame, compared to those scoring low on 'universalism' in a thematic news frame. On the other hand, in a thematic news frame, the difference between citizens scoring high and low on 'universalism' was found for the domestic source. This suggests that values are a fundamental moderator of media effects in determining citizens' political attitudes.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has induced a process of digital acceleration and has likely changed the attitudes of local public managers toward information and communication technology (ICT). While this attitude change has been reasonably argued, it has not been systematically measured. This study narrows this gap by measuring the attitudes of public managers before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, this study finds that the pandemic has led public managers to be more confident in the capacity of ICT to help cities achieve their economic, social, and environmental goals and respond to challenges. Both explicit and implicit measures confirmed attitude changes. The explicit measures also indicated that the change in public managers' attitude toward ICT was similar to their change in attitude toward scientific progress and greater than their change in attitude toward other issues that have played a major role during the pandemic, namely, climate change, citizen participation, and privacy.

AB  - This endeavor is an attempt to explore the effect of flipped classroom strategy (FCS) on (a) academic achievement in the computer and information technology course and (b) students' attitudes towards this strategy. The sample of the study consisted of 64 students, divided into two groups: experimental and control groups. Two instruments were used to collect the data: a test and a questionnaire. The test was used to measure the students' achievement and the questionnaire to measure their attitudes towards the FCS. The results show statistically significant differences at the level of 0.05 in support of the experimental group at all Bloom's levels. Similarly, students' positive attitude towards the FCS was evident. Therefore, expanding this strategy in different courses is highly recommended because it positively impacts students' achievements. Organizing workshops and designing courses that encourage teachers to implement the strategy in the classroom and develop their technical skills are also recommended.

AB  - This study investigated information dissemination need in the era of COVID-19 pandemic taking into cognizance the role of librarians in Borno State public library. Three research questions were raised. This study adopted a descriptive survey research design. It was found that librarians' roles included advising the public on how to avoid misinformation; highlighting the importance of social distancing; giving general instructions to library users on the use of face masks, handwashing and use of sanitizers; enlightening library users to avoid handshakes in or outside the library. Public libraries in Borno State can support researchers by drawing attention to the latest developments regarding vaccination; drawing relevant studies published in medical journals; providing free access to the latest literature on coronavirus. Based on this finding, it was recommended that librarians should disseminate information via existing and digital media platforms to educate users.

AB  - This article examines the discourses that are used by the British press to represent obesity in its coverage of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Obesity is understood to be a risk factor for COVID-19, with people with obesity being more likely to die from the virus. This study adopts a corpus-based approach to Critical Discourse Studies and utilises a novel approach to keyword analysis, based on comparing analysis corpora against two reference corpora in order to yield keywords that are, in this case, characteristic compared to general coverage of both COVID-19 and obesity. It is argued that the context of the pandemic has produced a range of discourses around obesity that are more stigmatising than usual in both the tabloids and the broadsheets, with people with obesity being construed, for example, in especially fatalistic terms and as being responsible for the problems facing the country's healthcare system. At the same time, the pandemic context also seems to have given rise to some more positive changes to press coverage of obesity, with race-related health disparities receiving more focus than usual and the right-leaning press being more likely to critique the Conservative Government than it usually is, resulting in an arguably more balanced style of reporting.

AB  - In order to meet the needs of life-long learning of the internet of things and the economic and social development of digital learning countries, we must actively explore the teaching mode of digital self-learning courses for college students. This article aims to explore the construction of an autonomous learning model based on the OBE concept of university teaching based on the internet of things technology. Through self-study of college students in the environment of internet of things and information technology, as well as the micro-course self-directed learning that carries the OBE concept, the results show that most students hold a positive attitude towards the autonomous learning model in the information environment. A survey that carries the OBE concept shows that the scoring dimensions of the content of the students' autonomous learning attitude survey before class are both 4.11. It can be considered that the micro-curriculum resources that carry the OBE concept can effectively help students to conduct autonomous learning.

AB  - Purpose Digital libraries and social media have emerged as two prominent online information sources with different characteristics. The purpose of this paper is to compare digital libraries and social media from the perspective of the dual route model which outlined a general framework of central and peripheral route-induced attitude change. Design/methodology/approach Research hypotheses were developed and data collected from users of digital libraries and social media were used for data analysis. The paired samples t-test was employed to compare the means. Findings Both central route (information quality) and peripheral route (source credibility and reputation) of digital libraries are higher than those of social media. Originality/value Building on the dual route model, this study compares digital libraries and social media in terms of the central route and peripheral route, which the authors believe presents a new lens for digital library research and practice alike.

AB  - This study examined the effects of information technology (IT) on policy decision-making processes, especially in the stages of goal setting and choosing among policy alternatives. It used survey data collected in 1998 and 2005 from the metropolitan areas of Seoul and Busan in Korea. The survey results showed that there has been a positive change in the perception of the effects of IT on policy decision-making processes among government users. These changes could be made possible by strong leadership and e-government initiatives in central and metropolitan governments, not just due to the diffusion of technology and technologically capable staff members in organizations. The empirical results also showed that barriers to information sharing had increased in 2005 because of environmental changes, including requirement of authorization for providing information, complicated data management, and negative attitudes to information sharing. It suggests that city governments need to provide policy remedies for overcoming obstacles in information sharing in the areas of protection of privacy, network security, and official authorization processes for providing individual information. This study may contribute to the school of e-government and IT policy research as it helps decrease the gap between theory and practice.

AB  - Social networking sites (SNS) addiction has become a social problem among young adolescents in many areas of the world. The current study examined the role of socioeconomic status (SES) in children and adolescents' SNS addiction, taking into account parents' attitudes and behavior with regard to information communication technology (ICT). Participants were 823 students (ages 9-15; 49.94 % girls) who completed questionnaires in their classrooms. The results showed that: (1) SES was negatively associated with SNS addiction; (2) active parental mediation mediated this association; and (3) parents' ICT attitude moderated this mediating effect; specifically, the association between SES and active parental mediation was weaker for parents with more positive attitudes toward ICT. These findings provide guidance for prevention and intervention related to children and adolescents' SNS addiction.

AB  - Research indicates that U.S. news coverage of non-White political candidates tends to be race-focused and often prompts White voters to bring racial considerations to the polls. Indeed, racial considerations likely cost Barack Obama a significant percentage of White voters in the 2008 presidential election. Nonetheless, scholarship also suggests that Obama aggressively sought to transcend difference-racial or otherwise-during his 2008 campaign via explicit appeals to the national identity. Given these competing dynamics, we conducted a content analysis of both Obama's nationally televised campaign speeches and U.S. news coverage to assess the relative salience of nation-and race-related language present in this discourse. We find that Obama consistently emphasized nation over race, but that journalists overwhelmingly reprioritized race over nation.

AB  - The rise of social media, and specifically Facebook, as a dominant force in the flow of news in the United States has led to concern that people incur greater isolation from diverse perspectives through filter bubbles (from algorithmic filtering) and echo chambers (from an information environment populated by social recommendations coming from overwhelmingly like-minded others). This evolution in news diffusion comes at a time when Americans report increased affective partisan polarization. In particular, evidence shows increasingly negative attitudes about out-party members. Based on selective exposure and reinforcing spirals model perspectives, we examined the reciprocal relationship between Facebook news use and polarization using national 3-wave panel data collected during the 2016 US Presidential Election. Over the course of the campaign, we found media use and attitudes remained relatively stable. Our results also showed that Facebook news use was related to a modest over-time spiral of depolarization. Furthermore, we found that people who use Facebook for news were more likely to view both pro- and counter-attitudinal news in each wave. Our results indicated that counter-attitudinal news exposure increased over time, which resulted in depolarization. We found no evidence of a parallel model, where pro-attitudinal exposure stemming from Facebook news use resulted in greater affective polarization.

AB  - Rationale and Objectives: Social distancing mandates due to COVID-19 have necessitated adaptations to radiology trainee workflow and educational practices, including the radiology "readout." We describe how a large academic radiology department achieved socially distant "remote readouts," provide trainee and attending perspectives on this early experience, and propose ways by which "remote readouts" can be used effectively by training programs beyond COVID-19.
   Materials and Methods: Beginning March 2020, radiologists were relocated to workspaces outside of conventional reading rooms. Information technologies were employed to allow for "remote readouts" between trainees and attendings. An optional anonymous open-ended survey regarding remote readouts was administered to radiology trainees and attendings as a quality improvement initiative. From the responses, response themes were abstracted using thematic analysis. Descriptive statistics of the qualitative data were calculated.
   Results: Radiologist workstations from 14 traditional reading rooms were relocated to 36 workspaces across the hospital system. Two models of remote readouts, synchronous and asynchronous, were developed, facilitated by commercially available information technologies. Thirty-nine of 105 (37%) trainees and 42 of 90 (47%) attendings responded to the survey. Main response themes included: social distancing, technology, autonomy/competency, efficiency, education/feedback and atmosphere/professional relationship. One hundred and forty-eight positive versus 97 negative comments were reported. Social distancing, technology, and autonomy/competency were most positively rated. Trainees and attending perspectives differed regarding the efficiency of remote readouts.
   Conclusion: "Remote readouts," compliant with social distancing measures, are feasible in academic radiology practice settings. Perspectives from our initial experience provide insight into how this can be accomplished, opportunities for improvement and future application, beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Purpose Despite more than half a century of academic research, relatively few methods have been shown to reliably improve intergroup relations in the real world. This paper aims to use a social marketing approach to design a pro-diversity intervention in a university setting. Design/methodology/approach We conducted extensive qualitative, quantitative and observational background research to identify elements that would increase the effectiveness of the intervention. Focus groups and surveys allowed us to identify a target audience, target behaviors and the relevant barriers and benefits. Findings The background research suggested increasing inclusive behavior would have a greater impact than reducing discriminatory behavior. Based on this research, this paper determined an optimal target audience was students who had relatively positive attitudes toward diversity but engaged in few inclusive behaviors. This paper used relevant theories from the behavioral sciences to design an intervention that promoted a small set of inclusive behaviors and that addressed the relevant barriers and benefits. The intervention took the form of a single page of targeted messages that instructors can add to their course syllabi. The page communicates injunctive and descriptive norms, highlights the benefits of behaving inclusively and provides concrete behavioral advice. Originality/value The research applies the social marketing approach to a novel domain. This approach represents a new way to advance diversity, equity and inclusion through promoting inclusive and reducing discriminatory behavior.

KW  - PROPAGATION PATH
AB  - In recent years, with the rapid development of information technology, the Internet has gradually become an interactive platform for people to exchange ideas, collide emotions, spread information, and release emotions. The openness, anonymity, and inclusiveness of the Internet have reduced the obstacles of information dissemination and triggered the conflict of public opinion on the Internet. In addition, students actively express their opinions, attitudes, and feelings on important topics in life and study on the Internet, forming a certain scale of online opinions reflecting students' unique political attitudes, moral concepts, and values. Because college students are immature physically and mentally and the network environment is full of phenomena, it is easy to arouse their emotional resonance. Therefore, the free and diverse network environment presents new challenges and higher requirements of the times for the stable operation of college network public opinion guidance. Therefore, how to form systematic education in universities combined with ideological and political network public opinions under big data has become an important problem to be solved. Based on this paper presents the communication pattern of network public opinion and model it, namely, the random network public opinion transmission model. By comparing the scope and influence of the two transmission paths of network public opinion, the paper draws the conclusion and strengthens the teaching practice of ideological and political courses. Finally, it is pointed out that the research of the ideological and political network public opinion communication path is a complex digital communication system project, which requires the government, the media, and the schools together to give suggestions in the guidance of the network public opinion.

AB  - How are African American political attitudes influenced by the mass media? Cathy Cohen's theory of marginalization suggests that media narratives about African Americans influence their public opinion about HIV/AIDS, behaviors associated with it, and populations associated with it. However, this has gone untested. Using an innovative experimental design involving four hundred African American participants, I find that episodic framing of HIV/AIDS not only activates negative attitudes toward behaviors associated with the disease and toward black men who engage in them; it also stimulates positive attitudes toward political mobilization and regressive policy solutions.

AB  - Background: Data from previous studies indicate a short duration of breastfeeding, especially exclusive breastfeeding, among infants of immigrant mothers living in Norway and other Western countries. Norway has a long tradition of supporting breastfeeding.
   Aim: To explore infant feeding practices among Somali-born mothers in Norway, and the ways in which they navigate among different information sources.
   Methods: Qualitative in-depth interviews and focus groups were carried out with mothers of children 6, 12 and 24 months of age. Women were recruited by a multi-recruitment strategy. Twenty-one mothers participated in interviews and twenty-two in five focus groups. The analysis was guided by Grounded Theory.
   Findings: The mothers had positive attitudes to breastfeeding, but were unfamiliar with the concept of exclusive breastfeeding. Early introduction of water and infant formula was a common practice that interfered with exclusive breastfeeding. The mothers experienced challenges of dealing with conflicting recommendations and expectations regarding infant feeding. They navigated among different sources of information, taking into consideration traditional values, experiences and habits from living in Norway, and research-based knowledge. Their prioritization of the different information sources varied with different life situations, children's age, and the extent to which the mothers trusted the information sources.
   Discussion and conclusions: Despite the strong focus on breastfeeding in Norway, Somali-born mothers encounter obstacles in their breastfeeding practices. These may be due to lack of information about exclusive breastfeeding and to the conflicting information they received. Breastfeeding practices may be enhanced by promoting culturally sensitive communication, and relations of trust at health-care centers. (C) 2016 Australian College of Midwives.

AB  - With 25% of the world's coastline, Canada is endowed with enormous potential for marine aquaculture. Its development on both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, however, has come under increasingly intense public scrutiny and generated heated debate over many issues including First Nations territorial rights, impacts on wild fisheries, and environmental impacts. Provincial governments, industry alliances, scientists and ENGOs (environmental non-governmental organizations) have become increasingly embroiled in a communication tug-of-war to win the hearts and minds of the public. To date, however, there has been very limited community-level research into the public's awareness of aquaculture, the information sources viewed as being most credible, and the issues that resonate the most. This paper reports the results of a study undertaken in small coastal communities on Canada's Pacific (west) and Atlantic (east) coasts that investigated awareness of aquaculture, and the issues that people associate with its development. While many studies have focused exclusively on attitudes related to either finfish or shellfish farming, this study explores community perceptions related to salmon, shellfish and seaweed farming. Significant differences exist between the Atlantic and Pacific coast respondents in terms of their familiarity with and evaluation of different farming systems, the information sources that they rely upon, and their perceptions of the reliability of different information sources.

AB  - This study uses a three-wave prospective longitudinal survey (at 6-month intervals) to test effects of information seeking and scanning on attitudes toward marijuana among college students in Israel (N = 700). We integrate constructs from the elaboration likelihood model to contrast processes of attitude change among individuals who vary in moderators of information processing depth (motivation and ability). In addition, we test whether trust in the information source moderates these processes, and use propensity score matching to reduce bias. Results of autoregressive cross-lagged structural equation models show that scanning from interpersonal sources predicted attitudes toward marijuana among individuals who were low in elaboration motivation or ability. Seeking and scanning information about marijuana from interpersonal sources were positively associated with attitudes toward marijuana among individuals higher in elaboration motivation and ability, who had greater trust in the source. Implications for information processing models, seeking and scanning, and campaigns are discussed.

AB  - From an international perspective, research in the field of public attitudes towards science and technology has been conducted since the 1970s. A frequently articulated - and empirically supported - assumption is that strong interest in and knowledge about science in a society is associated with more favourable attitudes towards science. This positive attitude in turn affects support for public funding of science. However, this research field is not without controversy, and for the South African population many questions remain unanswered. Initial research has not explored the factors that shape attitudes towards science and technology in detail. We re-analysed data from the Human Sciences Research Council to explore the above assumption. Interestingly, for the South African population, higher levels of scientific literacy and use of information sources are associated with more promises but also more reservations towards science and technology. This is especially true for relatively young and educated survey respondents. In international comparison, South Africa shows a unique fingerprint to some extent, but also shares characteristics with industrially developing countries of Europe (such as Greece or Portugal). To understand the correlations better, future research should aim to examine the overall picture when investigating the diverse South African population more extensively.

AB  - This article constructs explanatory theory on trust in e-voting, a term that refers to the use of stand-alone IT artefacts in voting stations. We study e-voting as a techno-organisational arrangement embedded in the process of elections and the broader socio-economic context of a country. Following a critical realist approach, we apply retroduction and retrodiction principles to build theory by complementing existing studies of e-voting with insights from an in-depth case study of elections in India. First, we seek evidence of trust in e-voting in the responses of the public to the announcement of election results. Then we derive the following four mechanisms of trust creation or loss: the association of e-voting with the production of positive democratic effects; the making of e-voting part of the mission and identity of electoral authorities; the cultivation of a positive public attitude to IT with policies for IT-driven socio-economic development; and, in countries with turbulent political cultures, a clear distinction between the experience of voting as orderly and experiences of malpractice in other election tasks. We suggest that these mechanisms explain the different experience with e-voting of different countries. Attention to them helps in assessing the potential of electoral technologies in countries that are currently adopting them, especially fragile democracies embarking upon e-voting.

AB  - Aims. To explore nurses attitudes and level of satisfaction in using the Hospital Information System in clinical practice. Background. Application of the Hospital Information System is increasing and there is substantial evidence suggesting that the successful implementation of Hospital Information System is significantly related to nurses attitudes. However, little information is currently available on the factors influencing those attitudes and their level of satisfaction in Hospital Information System use. Design. Cross-sectional survey. Methods. A stratified, random sampling of 342 nurses working in a Hong Kong private hospital and using Hospital Information System was recruited. A questionnaire was used to collect data on perceptions, level of satisfaction and attitudes towards Hospital Information System usage. Correlations and linear regressions were used to analyse the data. Results. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that work units, perceived usefulness and information technology support are the three predictors of nurses attitudes and level of satisfaction with the system. In addition, nurses who have higher perceived ease of use and better satisfaction towards using the system are associated with positive attitude. Conclusion. The study results serve to guide the nurse managers to develop information systems based on the nurses needs. Previous studies regarded nurses level of satisfaction as a part of nurses attitude. What is of interest in this study is that nurses satisfaction level can be viewed as an individual factor affecting nurses attitudes. With a user-friendly system, nurses tend to be more satisfied and therefore potentially more engaged in its use. This may indirectly improve patient care by saving time on documentation and enhancing communication among departments. Relevance to clinical practice. The nurse managers should promote an institutional culture to motivate staff towards positive acceptance of innovation. An effective collaboration with the information technology team would enhance a more efficient exchange of information to understand the complex factors of IT implementation.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore whether conceptual change predicted emotional and attitudinal change while learning about genetically modified foods (GMFs). Participants were 322 college students; half read a refutation text designed to shift conceptual knowledge, emotions, and attitudes, while the other half served as a control group. The results suggest that the refutation text effectively facilitated change in conceptual knowledge, emotions, and attitudes. The hypothesized relationship among the variables was explored using structural equation modeling. The analysis showed that when participants experienced knowledge change toward more scientifically accepted conceptions of GMFs, their emotions became more positive and less negative, which predicted a subsequent shift toward more-positive attitudes. The results suggest that change in emotions mediates the relationship between conceptual and attitudinal change. Several theoretical and practical implications are discussed including the impact that these findings may have on science education.

AB  - Sub-optimal vaccination coverage and recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases serve as a reminder that vaccine hesitancy remains a concern. ImmunizeCA, a new smartphone app to help track immunizations, may address several reasons for not vaccinating. We conducted a study to describe demographic variables, attitudes, beliefs and information sources regarding pediatric vaccination in a sample of childbearing women who were willing to download an immunization app. We also sought to measure their current mobile usage behaviors and determine if there is an association between participant demographics, attitudes, beliefs and information sources regarding pediatric vaccination and mobile usage. We recruited participants using a combination of passive and active methods at a tertiary care hospital in Ottawa, Canada. We used surveys to collect demographic information, examine attitudes, behavior, and information sources regarding immunization and self-reported mobile phone usage. A total of 54 women participated. The majority had positive attitudes toward vaccination (96%) and intended to vaccinate their children (98%). Participants were interested in information on pediatric vaccination (94%), and found information from public health the most reliable and accessible (78%). Participants also trusted immunization information from their doctor or nurse and public health (83%) more than other sources. There was variability in participant use of mobile apps for other purposes. The median participant mobile readiness score was 3.2. We found no significant associations between participant age, behavior and attitudes regarding vaccination and mobile readiness scores. This is the first evaluation of mobile readiness for a smartphone app to track immunizations. Our findings suggest that there exists an opportunity to provide reliable information on vaccination through mobile devices to better inform the public, however predictors of individual engagement with these technologies merits further study.

AB  - Prior research shows that after making a choice, decision makers shift their attitudes in a choice-congruous direction. Although this post-choice attitude change effect is robust, the neural mechanisms underlying it are poorly understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that decision makers elaborate on their choice in reference to self-knowledge to justify the choice they have made. This self-referential processing of the choice is thought to play a pivotal role in the post-choice attitude change. Twenty-four young American adults made a series of choices. They also rated their attitudes toward the choice options before and after the choices. In support of the current hypothesis, we found that changes in functional connectivity between two putative self-regions (medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus]) during the post-choice (vs. pre-choice) rating of the chosen options predicted the post-choice shift of the attitudes toward the chosen options. This finding is the first to suggest that cognitive integration of various self-relevant cognitions is instrumental in fostering post-choice attitude change. Hum Brain Mapp 37:3810-3820, 2016.

AB  - Introduction. Information literacy skills are crucial in today's world. But teaching these skills is challenging and calls for new pedagogical approaches. This paper reports the results of a teaching intervention designed by practicing teachers in a lower secondary school.
   Method. A quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test design was used to investigate the effect of the intervention. Students' learning outcomes were measured in four component skills of online research: search planning and query formulation, Web searching, critical evaluation, and argumentative use of Web information.
   Analysis. A mixed between-within subjects ANOVA (analysis of variance) was conducted to investigate the impact of the intervention on students' online research skills.
   Results. The intervention group outperformed the control group in an online research performance test. The intervention effect was most powerful among the students who were less active Web searchers or social media users or among those with lower self-efficacy in online research. Surprisingly, the students who had a positive attitude towards traditional teacher-centred learning improved their skills, but the attitude towards independent online learning did not make a difference in learning outcomes.
   Conclusions. Even individual teachers may draw inspiration and ideas from research-based pedagogies, develop their professional practice effectively, and create effects in students.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has made the world face a whole new reality, and the measures taken for slowing the spread of the disease included social distancing, as well as national, regional, or local lockdowns and restrictions regarding the movement of people. For such an important sector of the Romanian economy as the construction industry, the restrictive measures imposed by the authorities led to postponing, delaying, or stopping the current projects. This paper aims at investigating the main effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Romanian construction sector, as well as the role of the digitalization process in mitigating the negative impact on the companies activating in this domain, in the context of the current levels of use of information technologies. The research involved the use of qualitative (exploratory in-depth interviews) and quantitative (online surveys applied to members of the local building sector, such as engineers, architects, contractors, and managers) data collection methods, respectively descriptive statistics for data categorization and interpretation. In general, the Romanian construction sector was only slightly affected, with the most significant negative effects being the delays and cost overrun due to safety and health issues. This paper is one of the first studies to explore and assess the effects of COVID-19 on the Romanian construction industry and the role of digitalization in reducing the pandemic impact. The main findings reveal that the companies in this industry that have a high digitalization degree overpassed in a smoother manner the current pandemic situation.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to investigate how media content consumed through immersive technology may evoke changes in human rights attitudes. It has been proposed that our inability to empathize with others could be overcome by stepping into another's shoes. "Immersive journalism" has been postulated as being able to place us into the shoes of those whose feelings and experiences are distant to us. While virtual reality (VR) and 360-degree news videos have become widely available, it remains unclear how the consumption of content through immersive journalism affects users' attitudes. Design/methodology/approach Utilizing a between-subject laboratory-controlled experiment (N = 87) this study examined participant scores on the Human Rights Questionnaire before and after consuming 360-degree video immersive journalism content via VR (n = 31), 2D (n = 29), and Article (n = 27) formats. Collected data were analysed using statistical inference. Findings Results indicate that immersive journalism can elicit a positive attitudinal change in users, unlike an Article, with mobile VR having a more prominent effect than a 2D screen. Furthermore, this change is more strongly affected by users' higher Involvement in the content. Originality/value These findings are relevant for grasping the distinct effects novel and recently popularized technologies and media have on attitudinal change, as well as inform the current debate on the value of VR as "empathy machines".

AB  - Chronic fatigue syndrome receives little attention in the medical curriculum. This study explores UK medical students' knowledge of and attitudes towards chronic fatigue syndrome. Semi-structured interviews (average length 22 minutes) were conducted with 21 participants (7 females and 14 males) in years 3 (n = 4), 4 (n = 11) and 5 (n = 6) of their studies. Inductive thematic analysis taking a realist perspective produced three themes: limited knowledge, influences on attitudes and training needs. Students acquired their knowledge and attitudes largely from informal sources and expressed difficulty understanding chronic fatigue syndrome within a traditional biomedical framework. Incorporating teaching about chronic fatigue syndrome into the medical curriculum within the context of a biopsychosocial understanding of illness could encourage more positive attitudes towards chronic fatigue syndrome.

AB  - Recent developments in low-cost information technology, fast internet, intelligent terminals, apps that can manage the most varied activities in a professional but simple way, have allowed their diffusion in sectors traditionally reluctant to rapid change. The pandemic crisis caused by Covid-19 and the consequent provisions of social distancing to curb its spread, have also forced the world of education to deal with this modality. Terms such as Distance Learning and Smart Working have forcefully entered the vocabulary and daily life of millions of people. The persistence of the pandemic due to the variants of the virus is convincing even the most reluctant to change that the new "normal" will have to rely on information technology to a greater extent than in the past. In much of the Western world, where culture has long been a thriving economic sector, much has been invested for decades to strengthen and disseminate distance learning activities recognized as economically and socially beneficial. The European institutions have moved in this direction more recently. The author's experience in the last two years in emergency remote education in geography at university level has not always been positive. He therefore felt the urgency to consider adopting existing standards and best practices in order to improve outcomes and achieve effective online geography learning. The evident advantages of adopting good quality e-learning for an extended community would facilitate understanding and acceptance even in the Italian school and academic environment, usually conservative and conformist. In this environment, up to now, many have in fact feared that it could lead to the endorsement of distance learning, viewed with contempt if not really with aversion as it is considered to be of poor quality.

AB  - Access to vaccination information could influence public attitudes towards vaccination. This study investigated the number and types of vaccination-related information sources, and estimated their associations with vaccine confidence and hesitancy in China. In January 2019, we conducted a cross-sectional survey in China, and 2122 caregivers with children <6 years completed self-administered questionnaires. Logistic regressions were used to assess associations between caregivers' primary information sources and vaccine confidence/hesitancy. A majority (72%) of caregivers had multiple sources of vaccination-related information. The proportions of caregivers reporting professional sources, media, and peers as primary information sources were 81%, 63%, and 26%. Internal migrants were less likely to get information from professional sources; more educated and wealthier caregivers reported more information sources and were more likely to get information from media and peers. Caregivers who reported professional information sources had significantly higher odds of being confident about the safety of vaccines and lower odds of being hesitant toward vaccination than those who did not. Caregivers who reported the media as a primary information source had significantly higher odds of being hesitant toward vaccination than those who did not. To address vaccine hesitancy, it is essential to promote universal access to professional vaccination-related information sources, and to use the media to disseminate evidence-based information and clarify misinformation. Health communication should target internal migrants, and more educated and wealthier caregivers.

AB  - Aim/Purpose The purpose of the study is to examine and understand the attitude of Kazakhstani universities' instructors towards ICT integration into the curriculum and to find out the relationship between instructors' attitudes towards ICT and their actual usage of ICT for teaching and learning processes.
   Background The Kazakhstani government has taken initiatives and developed state programs to integrate information communication technologies (ICT) into all levels of education. According to previous research studies, instructors' negative attitude towards ICT integration into curriculum can affect the implementation of ICT-related initiatives in education including higher education. Therefore, this research study examines the attitudes of Kazakhstani higher education instructors towards ICT integration into curriculum.
   Methodology The study implemented an explanatory sequential mixed methods design. For quantitative and qualitative data collection paper-based questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used, respectively. Convenience sampling was conducted, and the sample consisted of 102 instructors working in two universities in Kazakhstan. In quantitative data analysis, descriptive and inferential statistics were used; Spearman's rho correlation coefficient was used to identify the relationship between variables.
   Contribution Understanding instructors' attitude towards ICT in education and exploring reasons behind attitudes might be beneficial in accomplishing aims and purposes of governmental ICT-related programs in the higher education system.
   Findings Quantitative data analysis reveals that instructors generally possess positive to very positive attitude towards using ICT in education. Instructors often use simple basic tools such as multimedia presentation software, however, they very rarely use more advanced tools such as discipline-oriented software. No statistically significant relationship was found between attitude and advanced ICT tools. Qualitative data analysis identifies several barriers to ICT usage: insufficient or lack of provision of ICT tools and software, lack of technical support, and lack of technical knowledge among instructors.
   Recommendations for Practitioners As a result of the study, it is firstly recommended to university administrations to create and add positions of information technology (IT) specialists, to each department and on a permanent basis. Secondly, it is recommended to provide faculty members with training courses that focus on ICT in pedagogy. Thirdly, universities could ask for guidance from their existing faculty members who are advanced ICT integrators, that is to say, collegial learning should be encouraged more strongly. Finally, universities are recommended to reward those faculty members who are active and effective in their attempts to integrate ICT into teaching.
   Future Research As I was not able to interview those instructors who possessed negative attitude towards ICT in education, I would recommend filling this gap in the future. Interviewing instructors who are reluctant to integrate ICT into teaching can help identify more issues related to using ICT in education which were not discovered in the current research study.
   Also, the current research study did not investigate instructors' attitudes in relation to their demographic background. Further research studies can examine how instructors' age, gender, place of study, place of work, academic degree, or subject area of teaching influence their attitude towards using ICT ineducation and their actual usage of ICT in teaching practices.

AB  - Introduction. Given that people rely heavily on their party affiliation to make their political decisions, an interesting dilemma occurs when people are exposed to counter-attitudinal information from the party they identify with. This paper examines how exposure to counter-attitudinal messages from the party an individual identifies with influence further online information seeking and attitude change.
   Method. Using an adult sample (N=289), the study adopts an experimental design, measuring actual information seeking behaviour in time units through unobtrusive observation.
   Analysis. Quantitative analysis was carried out on the data using SPSS.
   Results. In terms of information seeking, neither attitude-party message consistency, nor partisanship strength, led to confirmation bias-seeking. In terms of attitude change, there was significant difference in attitude change between strong and weak partisans when they were exposed to the pro-attitudinal message.
   Conclusions. Despite popular belief, even those with strong party identification do not blindly seek out information that confirms their own belief. The type of information exposure, rather than an individual's strength of party affiliation, influences the further information seeking patterns of individuals. In addition, attitude change patterns showed some complexities depending on various conditions. This paper calls for more nuanced understanding of political information seeking behaviour and attitude change.

AB  - The growth of partisan news sources has raised concerns that people will increasingly select attitude-consistent information, which might lead to increasing political polarization. Thus far, there is limited research on the long-term mutual influences between selective exposure and political attitudes. To remedy this, this study investigates the reciprocal influences between selective exposure and political attitudes over several years, using a three-wave panel survey conducted in Sweden during 2014-2016. More specifically, we analyse how ideological selective exposure to both traditional and online news media influences citizens' ideological leaning. Findings suggest that (1) people seek-out ideologically consistent print news and online news and (2) such attitude-consistent news exposure reinforces citizens' ideological leaning over time. In practice, however, such reinforcement effects are hampered by (3) relatively low overall ideological selective exposure and a (4) significant degree of cross-cutting news exposure online. These findings are discussed in light of selective exposure theory and the reinforcing spirals model.

AB  - Gamification and serious games are increasingly employed for attitude change purposes. However, they frequently exploit a limited set of game elements, such as points, badges and leaderboards, and scarcely explore the use of more complex elements that make games engaging. In this paper, we focus on game elements from the arcade genre, and their use in serious games for attitude change. In particular, we propose a serious game for mobile devices that employs arcade game elements for attitude change in aviation safety, and we assess its effects with two different studies. The first study compares the immediate effects of the serious game vs. the traditional approach (safety card), showing that the game is more engaging and can improve attitudes towards aircraft emergencies in terms of users' self-efficacy and perceived vulnerability to the risk. The second study assesses the effects of the serious game when used over time (1-week) in a naturalistic setting, showing that the game can engage users and increase knowledge about correct and wrong behaviors. In both studies, engagement turned out to play a mediating role that we analyze in detail.

AB  - Background: Immunization has a significant impact in protecting from severe diseases. Various factors that could influence child immunization coverage and parents' decisions about vaccinating their children should be further explored in specific population groups.
   Objectives: The current study has two main objectives: to assess the main information sources that affect parental decisions to vaccinate their children and to measure the extent to which these factors differ demographically by exploring the opinions and attitudes within four main population groups in Israel: ultra-Orthodox Jews, all other Jews, non-Bedouin Arabs, and Bedouins.
   Methods: 1504 parents, with similar representation among four main population groups, participated in this study. A structured, anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was used.
   Results: The most influential source on parents' decisions to vaccinate their children was the nurse at Mother and Child Health Clinics (MCHCs). Positive attitudes were shown regarding the key role of immunization in preventing severe diseases, while the most important concern expressed was the potential pain to the child while being vaccinated (rather than the safety of the vaccine). Higher compliance rates were reported among participants with a non-academic education level (chi(2) = 12.21, p <0.001), an average level of income (chi(2) = 26.66, p <0.001), and a greater level of religiosity (chi(2) = 5.13, p <0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that higher reliance on Ministry of Health publications (OR= 2.24, 95% CI = 1.49-3.35) and a belief that vaccinations prevent severe diseases (OR =1.55, 95% CI = 1.06-2.25) predicted higher vaccination compliance. A concern about unsafe components of the vaccinations predicted lower compliance (OR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.25-0.66). Bedouins demonstrated the highest compliance rate (99%), were most influenced by all information sources, and demonstrated the most pro-vaccination positions.
   Conclusions: The factor that most influenced Israeli parents' decisions to vaccinate their children was their degree of trust in information sources about vaccinations, particularly the nurses at the MCHCs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study explores the navigation patterns of users reading hypertext-linked online news articles about a controversial issue. With the theoretical frameworks of selective exposure and cross-cutting exposure, the study examined the effects of individuals' attitudes on their navigation patterns and consequent attitude changes after the news exposure. We asked 130 participants to read positive or negative news articles about the Korea-U.S. free trade agreement (FTA) by selecting six consecutive webpages. The results indicate that their attitudes toward the FTA was a significant predictor of their news selection, providing support for the selective exposure hypothesis. In terms of navigation patterns across the six news selection stages, the participants tended to select news articles that corresponded to their initial attitudes. The selection gap between participants with different attitudes increased until the fifth stage and ultimately converged. In terms of attitude change, the gap in the participants' attitudes decreased sharply after their navigation.

AB  - Successful reconciliation between groups following a violent conflict requires psychological change. We test a model predicting intergroup attitudes towards Muslims in Lebanon among Maronite (Christian) Lebanese youths. Identification with both their religious subgroup and with the superordinate national group predicted attitudes towards Muslims, in opposite directions. These effects of levels of identification on intergroup attitudes were mediated by attributions of responsibility for the war (Muslim responsibility) and perception that the current generation of out-group members is different from the war generation (perceived out-group discontinuity). Identification with Lebanon fosters positive attitudes towards Muslims by lowering Muslim responsibility for the war, and by increasing perceptions of foreign responsibility and perceived out-group discontinuity. In contrast, increased identification with their own religious subgroup undermines attitude change by increasing Muslim responsibility for the war and lessening perception of out-group discontinuity. Representations of the past have implications for attitudes towards former enemies and reconciliation in the present.

AB  - The data presented in this article provide the opportunity to comparatively analyse anti-immigrant and anti-refugee attitudes, news and social media consumption, and political attitudes (e.g., social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism) of the adult population in seven European countries (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Sweden), the United States, and Colombia in 2021 (N = 13,645). These countries were selected for their variety in national characteristics: coastal and non-coastal border countries, large and small economies, countries with major and minor political influence, and countries with varying degrees of popularity as asylum-seeker destinations. We conducted an online survey which - amongst others - included questions on socio-demographic characteristics, attitudinal indicators, and information on news and social media consumption. These data can be of interest for migration researchers and/or media scholars who want to explore (comparative) dynamics of outgroup attitudes, threat perceptions, and/or news and social media consumption, and for policy makers who seek to influence public attitudes towards immigration and migrants.

AB  - The lack of professional skills in project teams is one of the most important factors contributing to the high failure rate of Information Technology (IT) projects. Therefore, preparing students for increasingly complex IT projects has been an important learning objective in information sciences and technology programs. This article investigates the relationships between face-to-face students' self-efficacy of managing project tasks through online processes and their attitudes toward teamwork. The relationships among student engagement in learning experiences related to teamwork, self-efficacy of technology-mediated teamwork, and attitudes towards teamwork are investigated using confirmatory factor analysis on a data set with 344 participants. The analysis shows that self-efficacy of technology-mediated teamwork mediates the effect of learning engagement on attitudes toward teamwork. Therefore, the article postulates that mastering technology-mediated teamwork skills helps face-to-face students develop positive attitudes toward teamwork, which can be transferred to the workplace.

AB  - The article concerns the analysis of elements building the reliability of IT solutions used in the organizations (system reliability, usage reliability, information reliability and support service reliability) and their influence on IT performance in conditions of the crisis, which calls for social-distancing and forces employees to work remotely, putting IT performance at the centre of attention for organizations seeking ways to survive the crisis. The article aims at verifying the IT Reliability Model under such conditions and identifies which elements building the reliability of IT solutions may contribute to ensuring IT performance. The empirical study is performed among 115 organizations operating in Italy during the COVID-19 epidemic crisis in March 2020 (during the lockdown and peak of the epidemic). The results are compared with a previous study performed among 349 organizations from Poland and 288 organizations operating in Switzerland operating under normal conditions in January 2019. The obtained results confirmed that there are major differences in the strength and significance of the influence of four elements building IT reliability on IT performance among employees from organizations working under normal conditions and conditions of epidemical crisis. The usage reliability and support service reliability were proven to become key factors influencing IT performance under such critical conditions.
   Implications for Central European audience: Central Europe was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, and most of the organizations experienced problems with their functioning due to the need to establish new ways of working in a world of social distancing rules. Information technology became an especially important factor allowing them to remain continuity. Therefore, the analysis of factors influencing its performance during the crisis may help contemporary organizations in Central Europe to overcome the crisis caused by the sudden need to relay, more than ever, on information technology.

AB  - Objective: To assess the knowledge, perception and use of Health Information Technology (HIT) among private dental practitioners in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. Material and Methods: The sample population consisted of private dental practitioners in Chennai District of Tamil Nadu who were individually approached to participate in the cross-sectional survey. A structured, self-reported, close-ended questionnaire, which contained queries on the knowledge, usage and concerns about HIT in their practice, was designed. Descriptive statistics such as frequency distribution and percentages were analyzed using SPSS version 24. Results: Of the 483 dental clinics that were approached, 352 dental practitioners completed the questionnaire survey. A significant proportion of dental practitioners (65 percent) reported positive attitude towards use of HIT systems and believed that HIT systems could help make their work easier and efficient. However, it is unfortunate to note that almost half (47 percent) the dental practitioners were not interested in implementing HIT systems in their practice due to various monetary concerns such as installation and maintenance costs. Conclusion: The widespread adoption of HIT provides system connectivity and information exchange among providers of the same organisation, providers at different organisations and, ultimately, providers practising regionally and nationally.

AB  - Background: Public attitudes towards a given medical procedure can have a significant influence on the employment of that method. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a medical procedure that has received an exceptionally ambiguous public reception since its inception.
   Aim: To survey the level of information about and attitudes towards ECT in a general population sample of the Chuvash Republic of the Russian Federation.
   Methods: A randomly selected cohort of 5,373 people was contacted by telephone. The respondents were asked three closed and three open questions.
   Results: The response rate was 74.7%. Only 35.2% of those interviewed said they knew anything about ECT. Health professionals and younger respondents were better informed. The two main sources of information about ECT were foreign films and the mass media. The main indication of ECT was thought to be schizophrenia. The majority (63.3%) of the respondents had negative opinions and emotions about ECT.
   Conclusion: Limited information about and generally negative attitudes towards ECT were found in the general population of the Chuvash Republic. Gender, age, education level, employment in the health industry, and information source were found to be the determining factors in the knowledge of and attitudes towards ECT.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to analyze the relationships between child-to-parent violence and parental socialization styles with the problematic use of social networking sites, alexithymia and attitude towards institutional authority in adolescents. A sample of 2,399 adolescents (50.2% boys and 49.8% girls) enrolled in schools in Andalusia, aged between 12 and 18 years (M= 14.63, SD = 1.91) participated in the study. A MANOVA 4 x 2 x 2 was carried out. The results showed that high child-to-parent violence was related to high levels of problematic use of social networking sites, alexithymia, and a more positive attitude towards the transgression of social norms. It was also found that adolescents from families with an indulgent style showed the lowest scores in problematic use of social networking sites, alexithymia, and positive attitude towards the transgression of social norms. Additionally, in situations of high child-to-parent violence, girls had higher scores in problematic use of social networking sites and alexithymia than boys. Finally, the results and their practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Considerable research has been conducted analyzing how demographic characteristics influence the public's attitudes toward wildlife; however, less research of this type has been conducted in locations having long-standing species conservation efforts. Questionnaires were completed by residents living adjacent to such a location, the Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge (ACNWR), to investigate which demographics explained residents' knowledge of, attitudes toward, willingness to act for, and participation in sea turtle conservation. Residents who had a non-governmental organization (NGO) or government agency as their sea turtle information source had stronger positive attitudes toward sea turtles. Residents who possessed strong positive attitudes were more willing to engage in pro-sea turtle conservation behaviors. Overall, this research demonstrated that ACNWR residents' source of sea turtle information being an NGO or government agency played a significant role in increasing residents' knowledge of, attitudes toward, willingness to volunteer for, and participation in sea turtle conservation.

AB  - Objective. To incorporate a pharmacy informatics program in the didactic curriculum of a team-based learning institution and to assess students' knowledge of and confidence with health informatics during the course.
   Design. A previously developed online pharmacy informatics course was adapted and implemented into a team-based learning (TBL) 3-credit-hour drug information course for doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) students in their second didactic year. During a period of five weeks (15 contact hours), students used the online pharmacy informatics modules as part of their readiness assurance process. Additional material was developed to comply with the TBL principles. Online pre/postsurveys were administered to evaluate knowledge gained and students' perceptions of the informatics program.
   Assessment. Eighty-three second-year students (84% response rate) completed the surveys. Participants' knowledge of electronic health records, computerized physician order entry, pharmacy information systems, and clinical decision support was significantly improved. Additionally, their confidence significantly improved in terms of describing health informatics terminology, describing the benefits and barriers of using health information technology, and understanding reasons for systematically processing health information.
   Conclusion. Students responded favorably to the incorporation of pharmacy informatics content into a drug information course using a TBL approach. Students met the learning objectives of seven thematic areas and had positive attitudes toward the course after its completion.

AB  - Objective
   To understand Americans' attitudes concerning health information technology's (IT's) potential to improve health care and differences in those attitudes based on demographics and technological affinity.
   Data Sources/Study Setting
   A random-digit-dial sample with known probability of selection for every household in the United States with a telephone, plus a supplemental sample of cell phone users. Telephone interviews were conducted from August 2009 through November 2009.
   Study Design
   Data were analyzed to present univariate estimates of Americans' opinions of health IT, as well as multivariate logistic regressions to assess hypotheses relating individuals' characteristics to their opinions. Characteristics used in our model include age, race, ethnicity, gender, income, and affinity to technology.
   Findings
   A large majority (78 percent) favor use of electronic medical records (EMRs); believe EMRs could improve care and reduce costs (78 percent and 59 percent, respectively); believe benefits of EMR use outweigh privacy risks (64 percent); and support health care information sharing among providers (72 percent). Regression analyses show more positive attitudes among those with higher incomes and greater comfort using electronic technologies.
   Conclusion
   The findings suggest that American's believe that health IT adoption is an effective means to improve the quality and safety of health care.

AB  - Background. Currently, online social media have become increasingly popular and can provide the opportunity to provide and acquire information regarding knowledge and attitudes toward organ donation and transplantation. To evaluate participants' knowledge about organ donation, information sources and donation principles, an on-line survey was distributed through social network in Italy.
   Methods. 10584 persons were invited to respond to the questionnaire, the response rate was 22.8% and a total of 2258 complete responses were analyzed.
   Results. The majority of participants were in favour of organ donation (94.9%), but this proportion decreased when asking for consent to donation of a family member's organs (75.2%; P<0.001). Internet represented a considerable proportion of information sources (37.2%), that were much less frequently represented by family doctors (5.6%) and school education (18.6%). Conversely, 68.5% of participants think that family doctors should provide information regarding donation and 81.9% think schools should also provide such education (P<0.001). A good knowledge about donation principles was the main factor associated with a positive attitude toward donation (P<0.001).
   Conclusion. Efforts must be aimed at involving schools and family doctors in education about donation; the use of social networks can represent a way of improving such knowledge. (Minerva Anestesiol 2012;78:1109-16)

AB  - Social distancing during COVID-19 has become one of the most important measures in reducing the risks of the spread of the virus. Implementing these measures at universities is crucial and directly related to the physical attendance of the populations of students, professors, employees, and other members on campus. This research proposes an automated scheduling approach that can help universities and schools comply with the social distancing regulations by providing assistance in avoiding huge assemblages of people. Furthermore, this paper proposes a novel course timetable-scheduling scheme based on four main constraints. First, a distance of two meters must be maintained between each student inside the classroom. Second, no classrooms should contain more than 20% of their regular capacity. Third, there would be no back-to-back classes. Lastly, no lectures should be held simultaneously in adjacent classrooms. The proposed approach was implemented using a variable neighborhood search (VNS) approach with an adaptive neighborhood structure (AD-NS) to resolve the problem of scheduling course timetables at Al-Ahlyyia Amman University. However, the experimental results show that the proposed techniques outperformed the standard VNS tested on university course timetabling benchmark dataset ITC2007-Track3. Meanwhile, the approach was tested using datasets collected from the faculty of information technology at Al-Ahlyyia Amman University (Jordan). Where the results showed that, the proposed technique could help educational institutes to resume their regular operations while complying with the social distancing guidelines.

AB  - Sponsorship in pro-environmental social marketing campaigns has received limited academic attention within a higher education (HEI) context. This study examines how multi-level variables, i.e. individual (general environmental attitudes), organisational (scepticism toward the HEI's environmental corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives; perceived HEI behaviour) and campaign-related (attitudes toward the advertisement; attitudes toward the corporate sponsor) factors, influence university students' environmental intentions in response to a corporate-sponsored environmental initiative; using mixed methods (231 surveys and 40 interviews). Questionnaires revealed that scepticism toward the HEI's CSR initiatives led to less positive perceptions of the HEI's environmental behaviour, which decreased positive attitudes toward the advertisement and environmental intentions. Interviews revealed that the corporate sponsor seemed to motivate environmental behavioural intentions due to product discounts related to the sponsorship. Thus, a corporate sponsor may have confounding effects on pro-environmental behaviour campaigns. This has implications for the use of sponsorship in environmental social marketing campaigns.

AB  - Studying in-group affiliation preferences can be a valuable tool for understanding race relations in the contemporary United States. We draw on theories of social dominance and social identity to analyze racial attitudes, as measured by the Social Distance Scale, for a subset of black and white students at the University of Mississippi. While both black and white students expressed strong in-group preference, this preference was stronger for whites than for blacks, especially for white women presently affiliated or planning to affiliate with campus Greek organizations. Social dominance orientation, a measure describing whether social inequalities are accepted and justified, mediated the greater in-group preference of many whites, especially for intimate or high-power relationships. We discuss possible individual and institutional causes for the differences we observe, and we draw implications for understanding continued self-segregation both on-and off-campus in a society that implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, espouses "color-blind" ideals.

AB  - Cervical cancer is the leading cause of women's cancer deaths in Senegal, but few medical personnel are trained to perform cervical cancer screening. In rural areas, the situation is worse. To remedy this, a collaborative of researchers and stakeholders trained local health-care workers in cervical cancer screening through the "training-of-trainers" method. However, lack of cancer screening knowledge, barriers, and a hard-to-reach population may jeopardize the collaborative's efforts. The purpose of this study is to map the health communication infrastructure by applying communication infrastructure theory to assess general health and cancer screening knowledge, as well as attitudes and barriers toward screening. Results from focus groups and interviews show that women have minimal knowledge of cervical cancer. Moreover, health workers report detrimental attitudes in menopausal women. Our findings identified routes for information dissemination and attitude change including community radio and local health talks.

AB  - Purpose:
   The objective of this study is to identify the relationship between COVID-19 experiences, perceived COVID-19 behavioral control, social norms and attitudes, and future intention to follow social distancing guidelines.
   Design:
   This is a cross-sectional study.
   Setting:
   Participants responded to an on-line survey in June 2020.
   Subjects:
   The study included 3,183 residents within Quebec, Canada aged 18 and over.
   Measures:
   Measures include perceived COVID-19 related discrimination, fear of COVID-19 infection, prior exposure to COVID-19, and prior social distancing behavior. Participants self-reported attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and perceived norms related to social distancing. Finally, we measured social distancing behavioral intention.
   Analysis:
   We evaluated a theory of planned behavior (TPB) measurement model of social distancing using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The association between COVID-19 perceived discrimination, fear of infection, previous social distancing behavior, exposure to COVID-19, TPB constructs and behavioral intentions to social distance were estimated using SEM path analysis.
   Results:
   TPB constructs were positively associated with intention to follow social distancing guidelines. Fear of COVID-19 infection and prior social distancing behavior were positively associated with behavioral intentions. In contrast, perceived discrimination was negatively associated with the outcome. Associations between fear of COVID-19, perceived COVID-19 discrimination and behavioral intentions were partially mediated by constructs of TPB.
   Conclusions:
   COVID-19 prevention efforts designed to emphasize positive attitudes, perceived control, and social norms around social distancing should carefully balance campaigns that heighten fear of infection along with anti- discrimination messaging.

AB  - The use of nine items of personal protective equipment (PPE) during pesticide spray preparation and spraying was studied among farmers of Moghan Plain region, Iran, along with factors affecting PPE use behavior. Face-to-face interviews with the farmers based on a structured questionnaire were conducted. Low levels of PPE use were reported by almost half of the farmers (48.3%), while 30.5% showed moderate levels and 21.2% showed high levels of PPE use. Long-sleeved shirt was the most common item used by farmers, followed by simple face mask, boots, gloves, hat, wipes for covering face and mouth, trousers, and coveralls. Farmers who were satisfied by farming, farmers with off-farm income, and married farmers used PPE items more frequently. PPE use behavior also showed a positive association with the number of literate members of the household, farmers' knowledge of pesticide hazards, and use of information sources. Distance of village to agricultural offices and extension service centers showed a negative association with PPE use. Structure equation modeling (SEM) revealed that PPE use was increased with i) negative attitudes of farmers towards pesticides, ii) high levels of knowledge about pesticide hazards, iii) frequent contact with information sources, and iv) past poisoning experience during pesticide handling. Based on the model, the most effective variable on PPE use behavior was farmers' attitudes towards pesticides followed by knowledge of pesticide hazards, poisoning experience, and information sources. These four variables explained 85% of the variance in farmers' behavior in PPE use. The study brings new information on the mediating role of farmers' attitudes towards pesticides, knowledge of pesticide hazards, poisoning experience, and information sources in the use of PPE. Education of farmers on the hazards of pesticides is crucial for changing wrong behaviors in PPE use. Moreover, close contacts of the extension experts with pesticides retailers could increase farmers' safety in pesticide use. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: The current study highlights the voices and perspectives of African American fathers, with specific emphasis on their race-related concerns for their adolescents as well as how these concerns guide their parenting strategies.
   Method: Twenty-four African American fathers participated in 1.5-3 h long focus group interviews. All fathers (M = 42.24 years, SD = 6.93) resided in a mid-sized city in the Southeastern United States. All participants were either biological fathers (n = 20) or non-biological (n = 4) fathers. Fathers were residential (76%) and non-residential (24%), with at least one adolescent child (M = 14.32 years, SD = 5.80; Range: 10-16 years). Fifty-eight percent of fathers (n = 14) had both male and female children, 29% had only female children (n = 7) and 13% had only male children (n = 3). After codebook development and refinement, key themes were explored using a theoretical thematic analysis.
   Results: In response to race-related and other social risks for African American adolescents, fathers articulated a number of parenting motivations and intentions: 1) fathers' own racial experiences; 2) negative media images of Black youth and families (e.g. media influences, negative stereotypes, and portrayals of Black fathers); 3) preserving families through community support; 4) developing awareness of discrimination and coping strategies; 5) cultivating positive personal and cultural identities; and 6) achievement as necessity. Also, gender emerged as a critical lens for African American fathers' concerns and parenting strategies.
   Conclusion: Overall, our investigation highlights African American fathers' own meaning-making around concerns for their adolescents as well as how they shape parenting processes.

AB  - Societal organizations aim at challenging online extremist messages by counterposing with different narratives such as alternative narratives (one-sided narrative) and counter-narratives (two-sided narratives). The current study examined which type of narrative is more efficient in changing attitudes accounting for narrative involvement and reactance regarding the narrative. We employed a 2(one-sided vs. two-sided narrative) x 2 (ease of identification vs. no ease of identification) between-subjects design (N = 405) using a controversial topic: the ongoing debate about how to deal with the number of refugees in Germany. We found an indirect effect of the narrative on attitude change. People who read the two-sided narrative showed less reactance. The smaller the reactance, the more they felt involved in the narrative, which, in turn led to more positive attitudes towards refugees. We discuss these findings regarding their theoretical contribution to create customized narratives challenging extremist messages.

AB  - An experiment examined the effects of imagining contact with an illegal immigrant on attitudes towards illegal immigrants and subsequent effects of that attitude change on feelings about other groups (secondary transfer). Compared to a condition in which participants imagined negative contact with an illegal immigrant, participants who imagined positive contact reported more positive attitudes concerning illegal immigrants. Using bootstrapped mediation models, effects of positive imagined contact on attitudes towards illegal immigrants were shown to generalize to other groups that were independently ranked as similar to illegal immigrants, but not to dissimilar groups. This generalization gradient effect was relatively large. Implications for theory and practical applications to prejudice reduction are discussed.

AB  - Information communication technology playing a major role in transmitting idea, thought and information between one to another. Social networking websites are a good example of communication network and it is a social structure that lets the user interact and work collaboratively with other users. WhatsApp is a free instant messenger application that allows users to send text messages and multimedia files. In this paper, an online survey was conducted to measure usability of WhatsApp for service delivery in the libraries and information centres. A random sample was selected from social networking sites from all over India and an online questionnaire was used to gather information from respondents. Findings indicated that respondents showed a positive attitude toward getting services over WhatsApp. Most of the respondents believe that use of WhatsApp can improve alert services (CAS, virtual reference, notifications) and libraries can utilise their potential for providing better user services.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate employee perceptions of the influence of communication technology use outside of regular work hours on perceptions of work life conflict, burnout, turnover intentions, and job satisfaction. An online survey of 168 employees from more than 30 companies in a Midwestern city was conducted to assess relationships among these variables. The results indicated that hours of work-related communication technology use outside of regular work hours contributed to perceptions of work life conflict. However, positive attitudes toward communication technologies predicted decreased work life conflict. Controlling for worker age, perceived life stress, and attitudes toward communication technologies, work life conflict was found to predict job burnout and job satisfaction, but not turnover intentions. The authors discuss implications of the study findings for management practices, limitations of the study, and directions for future research.

KW  - ONLINE COURSES MOOCS
AB  - This study seeks to examine perceptions of attitudinal change in relation to the primary assessment activity within four Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that were designed for attitudinal learning. The purpose of this study was twofold. First, we sought to understand if by focusing on assessing cognitive learning (quizzes) as opposed to behavioral learning (personal projects), the courses would result in greater reported attitude change in the respective areas. The second component of the study examined whether learners who identified cognitive learning (quizzes) as opposed to behavioral learning (personal projects) as the most impactful learning activity (or vice versa) reported stronger learning in the respective attitudinal component. Using an author-created survey that included learner reported attitudinal learning, perceptions of attitude change were collected. Results revealed that learners who utilized assessment activities focusing on behavioral learning did not report higher perceptions of behavioral learning. In contrast, learners utilizing assessment activities that focused on cognitive learning did report higher perceptions of cognitive learning. We conclude with a discussion of instructional design and facilitation of learning in MOOCs, as well as instruction for attitudinal learning within open-learning environments.

AB  - With the general aggression model and presence (i.e., sense of "being there") theory as frameworks, this study investigates the effects of violence cues (blood and screams of pain) and players' individual differences in aggression (trait aggression) on brand logo memory and on attitude change in a violent first-person shooter game (Half-Life 2). Physiological arousal (skin conductance levels) was assessed during game play and participants reported their sense of presence in the game. Results indicate that violence cues influence brand logo memory through engagement and affect attitude change via arousal. Although physiological arousal led to positive change in brand attitude, it does not significantly influence logo memory. Conversely, although higher levels of spatial presence led to better logo memory, there was a corresponding reduction in attitude change for highly recognized brands. We consider the possibility that increased memory but negative attitude change with higher presence in violent video games could deter advertisers from placing their messages inside violent games.

AB  - Recent protests by athletes focused on raising awareness of social issues and injustices, such as the Black Lives Matter protests led by Colin Kaepernick of the National Football League's San Francisco 49ers, have generated a great deal of attention and debate within society. Notably, the protests conducted by these players before games in the 2016 and 2017 seasons became such a sensational topic, that extraordinary amounts of attention was paid to it by the media, consumers, and even politicians who often denounced the players as being unpatriotic. Against this backdrop, the current research examines whether fluctuations in attendance at National Football League games are associated with explicit attitudes towards race, implicit racial prejudice, and racial animus within a population. Specifically, using multiple measures of racial attitudes as part of an econometric model estimating attendance at games, the results suggest that having a higher level of implicit bias in a market leads to a decline in consumer interest in attending games. Additionally, using interaction effects, it is found that while protests generally reduced the negative effects of implicit bias on attendance, markets with lower levels of implicit bias actually had greater declines of attendance during the protests. From this, the current study advances the understanding of racial attitudes and racial animus, and its impact on consumer behavior at the regional level. That is, this research highlights that racial sentiments in a local market were able to predict changes in market behaviors, suggesting that race relations can have wide reaching impacts.

AB  - Despite the continued attention on the distinct behavioral and relational outcomes of narcissism and self-esteem, limited academic research has been devoted to investigating the influences of those individual differences upon behaviors of seeking and retaining a romantic relationship concurrently in the digital environment. The present study aimed to test the role that narcissism and self-esteem play in predicting individuals' attitudes toward behaviors in current and possible romantic relationships. The results demonstrated that individuals high in narcissism showed positive attitudes toward interacting with potential romantic partners on Instagram. Furthermore, they showed positive attitudes toward current relationship-related postings on Instagram. In contrast, individuals high in self-esteem exhibited negative attitudes toward interacting with potential romantic partners, whereas they showed positive attitudes toward posting photographs taken with their current romantic partners on Instagram. This study provides empirical evidence for the associations between individual differences and attitudes toward various behaviors on social networking sites (SNSs) in relation to both potential and current romantic relationships.

AB  - Backgrounds: Healthcare workers are at risk of mental illness during COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated the level of perceived risk and adherence to preventive behaviors regarding COVID-19 among medical students and physicians.
   Materials and methods: We conducted an online nationwide cross-sectional survey among Iranian physicians and medical students. We collected data regarding perceived risk, perceived stress scale (P.S.S.), attitude, practice, and information sources. We assessed the association of four main outcomes (risk perception, P.S.S. score, attitude, and practice) with demographic variables.
   Results: A total of 1085 participants with an overall fear score of 6.48 +/- 2.29 out of 10 filled the questionnaires. Older and more educated participants had a higher risk perception level and adherence to protective measures. In contrary, participants in lower-risk workplaces had lower risk perception scores. Main sources of information did not affect the scores of risk perception, P.S.S., and practice. Higher risk perception scores were observed in those with higher practice and P.S.S. scores. Contrary to risk perception, the P.S.S. score was not affected by many of the demographic variables, except gender. The most positive attitude was observed in individuals with a higher level of trust in governmental information sources. Participants with higher P.S.S. scores adhered more to protective measures.
   Conclusion: Risk perception had the greatest impact on adherence to preventive behaviors. Therefore, policymakers should consider perceived risk as a predictor of the extension of the pandemic. Both risk perception and P.S.S. reflect the severity of fear from COVID-19; however, P.S.S. is less affected by sociodemographic and workplace characteristics.

AB  - Since 1958 and the beginning of the Fifth Republic, the French presidency has been constructed and consolidated as a masculine institution. Furthermore, all presidential elections can be considered as a key moment for politicising issues relating to sex and gender. The 2017 presidential campaign is more specific. Since 2000, the mechanisms designed to ensure gender equality have been strengthened, such that they are now an unavoidable norm in political competition. In a context of dramatic political change, the hierarchy of political issues is affected. This article looks back over Francois Hollande's 5-year term from this perspective, before drawing on an analysis of campaign materials and press coverage. The small proportion of women candidates and the marginalisation of gender issues in the programmes testify to the fragile nature of 'egalitarian good will.' Gender and sexuality did, however, offer a means for other power relations to be expressed, in relation to different conceptions of nationalism and both class and race relations.

AB  - Political advertisements can shift attitudes and behaviors to become more exclusionary toward social out-groups. However, people who engage in an antidiscrimination exercise in the context of an experiment may respond differently to such ads. What interventions might foster inclusive attitudes in the presence of political communications about social policy issues like transgender rights? We examined two scalable antidiscrimination exercises commonly used in applied settings: describing a personal narrative of discrimination and perspective-taking. We then showed people political ads that are favorable or opposed to transgender rights to determine whether those interventions moderate how receptive people are to the messages. Relying on two demographically representative survey experiments of adults in the United States (study 1 N = 1,291; study 2 N = 1,587), we found that personal recollections of discriminatory experiences did not reduce exclusionary attitudes, but perspective-taking had some effects, particularly among those who fully complied with the exercise. However, both studies revealed potential backfire effects; recalling a discriminatory experience induced negative attitudes among a subset of the participants, and participants who refused to perspective-take when prompted also held more negative attitudes. Importantly, political ads favorable toward transgender rights consistently resulted in more positive attitudes toward transgender people. Future work needs to carefully examine heterogeneous responses and resistance to antidiscrimination interventions and examine what particular aspects of the political ads induced the attitude change.

AB  - News coverage of Islamic extremism is reigniting debates about the media's role in promoting prejudice toward Muslims. Psychological theories of media-induced prejudice date to the 1950's, and find support from controlled experiments. However, national-scale studies of media effects on Muslim prejudice are lacking. Orthogonal research investigating media-induced prejudice toward immigrants has failed to establish any link. Moreover, it has been found that people interpret the news in ways that confirm pre-existing attitudes, suggesting that media induced Muslim prejudice in liberal democracies is unlikely. Here, we test the association between news exposure and anti-Muslim prejudice in a diverse national sample from one of the world's most tolerant societies, where media effects are least likely to hold (N = 16,584, New Zealand). In support of media-induced Islamophobia, results show that greater news exposure is associated with both increased anger and reduced warmth toward Muslims. Additionally, the relationship between media exposure and anti-Muslim prejudice does not reliably vary with political ideology, supporting claims that it is widespread representations of Muslims in the news, rather than partisan media biases, that drives anti-Muslim prejudice.

We use Swedish survey data from 2002 to 2007, the period during which high-speed Internet (broadband) emerged. We find that broadband access is associated with online media consumption. The crowd out of offline consumption is, however, small. Furthermore, these altered news consumption patterns have no or small effects on political attitudes.

AB  - Considering the large influence of social media on the restaurant chain industry, finding effective communication strategies to interact with customers is critically important. The purpose of the study was to investigate how restaurant chain's CSR messages on social networking sites affect brand value and social distance. Data were collected from 403 social media users with a dining experience at a U.S. restaurant chain. A two-step structural equation model and a two by two between-subject experimental design were conducted for this study. The perception of CSR messages on SNS positively affects customer's social distance and the restaurant's brand credibility, and consequently enhance the brand equity. Restaurant chain's concrete (vs. abstract) CSR messages on SNS has a positive influence on customers' brand equity when their social distance is close (vs. distant). The study highlights the importance of shortening social distance to enhance brand equity when developing CSR messages on SNS.

AB  - Social networking is currently the most popular online activity among consumers worldwide. Today in business context, Social media is achieving increasing importance as a channel for consumer's online participation and engagement. Brands are developing its presence in social networking sites to meet engagement, brand awareness and word of mouth. In this context, the analysis of the factors that are conditioning consumer interaction with branded content becomes a matter of interest. To explore factors influencing consumer's online engagement in social networking sites (SNS), this study applies use and gratification (U&G) theory to explain why people are actively involved in media usage and interact highly with the communication media i.e., SNS. This study used an online as well as offline questionnaire to conduct empirical research, and collected and analyzed data of 394 samples by structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. The findings show that the U&G theory significantly explains consumers' attitude toward social networking ad (SNA). The result shows that the content characteristics of SNA i.e., vividness, interactivity, entertainment and information have direct influence on the consumers' online participation and engagement behavior whereas incentive doesn't show any impact. On the other hand, when mediated by consumer's positive attitude toward SNA, vividness, interactivity, information and entertainment show partial mediation effect on the consumers' online participation and engagement behavior whereas incentive show full mediation effect. In addition, this study found that the social media users who have a positive attitude toward SNA are more likely to surf the Net and feel more engaged. This study empirically contributes to the existing literature on the management of marketing strategies for consumer engagement in social networking sites.

AB  - Purpose The study aims to demonstrate the impact of social media users' positive attitude towards the social networking sites (SNS) on the generation of a positive attitude towards social networking advertisements (SNA). A favourable attitude towards the SNA thus generated can positively influence brand attitude and purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach An online survey was conducted to collect relevant data using a structured questionnaire. Structural equation modelling was conducted using the statistical software AMOS 18. Findings Empirical analysis revealed the importance of brand advertisements on the social networks in inciting a positive attitude as well as a purchase intention for the brand in the SNS users' minds. Research limitations/implications - The study has been conducted in the Indian context using Facebook as a model social networking site. Practical implications - Social media being one of the most popular and user-friendly platforms for regular communications, marketers are suggested to allocate a sizeable share of the advertising budget for social media advertisements and customer engagement so as to help build a positive attitude towards the advertised brand in the SNS users' minds. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, the impact of users' positive evaluation of SNS as an effective communication medium, on the generation of a positive attitude towards the SNA, has been dealt for the first time here.

AB  - Purpose Public attitudes towards COVID-19 and social distancing are critical in reducing its spread. It is therefore important to understand public reactions and information dissemination in all major forms, including on social media. This article investigates important issues reflected on Twitter in the early stages of the public reaction to COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach A thematic analysis of the most retweeted English-language tweets mentioning COVID-19 during March 10-29, 2020. Findings The main themes identified for the 87 qualifying tweets accounting for 14 million retweets were: lockdown life; attitude towards social restrictions; politics; safety messages; people with COVID-19; support for key workers; work; and COVID-19 facts/news. Research limitations/implications Twitter played many positive roles, mainly through unofficial tweets. Users shared social distancing information, helped build support for social distancing, criticised government responses, expressed support for key workers and helped each other cope with social isolation. A few popular tweets not supporting social distancing show that government messages sometimes failed. Practical implications Public health campaigns in future may consider encouraging grass roots social web activity to support campaign goals. At a methodological level, analysing retweet counts emphasised politics and ignored practical implementation issues. Originality/value This is the first qualitative analysis of general COVID-19-related retweeting.

When examined concomitantly, these minority stress variables accounted for approximately one third of the variance in psychological distress scores. Results indicate that heterosexism in communities of color, race-related dating and relationship problems in the LGBTQ community, internalized heterosexism, and outness to world were the only significant and unique predictors of Asian American LGBTQ persons' psychological distress. In addition, no support was found for the moderating or mediating roles of outness in the internalized heterosexism-distress link.

AB  - Background and Purpose: This study's aim was to examine the persuasive effects of a blue documentary (BD), representing marine life extinction on viewers' perceptions and their attitudinal change toward conservation.
   Methodology: This study selected 36 participants using purposive sampling technique, according to the characteristics of their location and age categories. A total of 72 semi-structured interviews were conducted in two stages - the pre- and post-viewing of the documentary. A documentary program of Lestari Ujana Marin (LUM) was the media text used in gathering the necessary data. The data were then perused qualitatively through the employment of thematic analysis.
   Findings: The findings suggest that the participants' perceptions and attitudinal changes were more positive toward marine life conservation after being exposed to the documentary. The attitudinal changes have been sustainable and exhibited through the participants' real actions in supporting marine life conservation.
   Contributions: This study paves the way for collaboration between experts in different fields, such as filmmakers, oceanologists, and non-governmental organizations, who are fundamentally concerned in disseminating knowledge about environmental conservation for the benefits of future generations.

AB  - Information and communication technologies have become essential and design-effective tools in the global healthcare system. Evidence suggests that information and communication technologies can promote nursing practice and patient satisfaction and quality of care. Competency with information and communication technologies is essential for both nurses and nursing students, and attitudes toward its use and perceived self-efficacy are important for implementation in the workplace. This study aimed to explore nurse and nursing student attitudes and perceived self-efficacy regarding information and communication technologies use in clinical practice and to examine professional and cultural differences between these groups in their attitudes and perceived self-efficacy in information and communication technologies use. A cross-sectional study was conducted among Israeli nursing students (n = 144) and registered nurses (n = 104). The findings revealed that respondents held overall positive attitudes toward information and communication technologies' use in clinical practice and perceived themselves as competent in this context. Significant differences were found between nurses and students in their attitudes toward information and communication technologies and information and communication technologies self-efficacy. Cultural group (Jewish/Arab) was found related to positive attitudes toward use of information and communication technologies in clinical practice. Nurse educators and managers should be aware of the potential impact of cultural and professional differences on the adoption and implementation of information and communication technologies and should institute initiatives within the organization and academia to manage cultural and professional discrepancies.

AB  - Stigma and social isolation are major challenges in building dementia friendly communities. Information is a key factor in improving knowledge and attitudes about dementia. This cross-sectional survey aimed to investigate public attitudes towards people with dementia in an urban community in Japan. Nearly 90% of the participants responded that they were able to have a good relationship with a person with dementia and help such a person if needed. However, around half of the participants would be ashamed of a family member with dementia. A multiple regression model showed that information from television and educational classes was associated with positive attitudes towards people with dementia among older adults. Information from educational classes and the Internet was likewise associated with positive attitudes among the volunteers. Increasing the availability and accessibility of information on dementia may contribute to improving public attitudes towards people with dementia.

AB  - Objectives. Few studies fully integrate the interactive effects of political, geographic, and media contexts into studies of public opinion on immigration. We rectify this by utilizing the post-Katrina Latino immigrant migration to Louisiana as an opportunity for study of these relationships. Methods. We utilize survey data and content analysis of news coverage to examine the influence of news exposure on attitudes toward immigrants and immigration. Results. Exposure to immigration news influences the relative importance of immigration to other issues, self-reported personal contact with Spanish-speaking populations, and perceptions of the legal status of immigrant populations. Conclusions. Local news coverage of immigration increases awareness and concern about immigration and heightened news exposure increases perceptions about personal interactions with Spanish-speaking populations. Additionally, local news coverage of immigration influences the importance of key characteristics of immigrant populations, particularly whether immigrants are here illegally. Tone of coverage, as opposed to amount, exerts the more consistent effect on immigration-related attitudes.

AB  - The impact of how knowledge can effect attitude change is important in order to understand the consequences for stigma. The relationship between increasing subject knowledge of mental health and attitude change was explored. The sample comprised 39 students (18 male and 21 female) from a university in the West Midlands. Participants' level of knowledge and stigma were recorded through pre- and post-tests using the Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS), Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill (CAMI) and the Opinions about Mental Illness (OMI) scale. Information about mental illness was provided between conditions followed by a distractor task. Responses were calculated and combined to give an overall score. A sign test with continuity correction was used to see whether there was a difference in attitudes. The pre-and post-test conditions were scored. Results demonstrate a statistically significant median decrease in stigma in the post-test condition (p = 0.03). Therefore, this research provides support for the success of providing knowledge and information about mental illness in order to reduce stigma.

AB  - Research in the field of entertainment-education demonstrates that narrative forms such as TV and radio can impact prosocial behaviors and attitudes. The current study addresses whether attitudes can also be affected by musical theater. Attitudes were assessed in 171 audience members before and after a professionally produced musical comedy that used social-cognitive principles to explore the theme of deer hunting. Measures included an 8-item Hunting Attitude Scale and an instrument assessing audience engagement (captivation, intellectual stimulation, emotional resonance, spiritual value, social cohesion/insight, and specific emotional reactions). A significant change was observed in attitudes targeted by the show. Audience members' reports of emotional engagement and insight were significantly related to hunting attitude change. Participants who had complex emotional reactions to the show (e.g., feeling both happy and sad) were significantly more likely than those who had only positive reactions to score higher on multiple engagement measures. Although previous research has found a link between strength of audience emotional involvement and personal efficacy, present results suggest an important additional role for complexity of emotional reaction. Overall, the study indicates that musical theater may be a promising method for promoting attitudinal change.

AB  - This article examines whether individual differences in chronic regulatory focus (prevention vs. promotion focus) among adolescents influences the way they evaluate targeted advertising on social networking sites. Study 1 (survey) reveals that adolescents with a promotion focus (who are oriented toward achieving positive outcomes) have a more positive attitude and a higher purchase intention toward targeted advertising, as compared to prevention-focused adolescents (who are dispositioned toward avoiding negative outcomes). Study 2 (experiment) investigates how adolescents' chronic regulatory focus can alter their attitude and purchase intention on a mock social networking site that includes a targeted advertisement. Results show that a low personalized targeted ad is better evaluated (in terms of a more positive attitude and higher purchase intention) among prevention-focused adolescents, whereas a high personalized targeted ad results in better advertising outcomes among promotion-focused adolescents. Contributions to theory and implications for advertising practice are discussed.

AB  - Bhattacherjee and Premkumar (2004) propose a temporal model of belief and attitude change to understand fluctuating patterns of information technology (IT) usage. However, they overlook the role of perceived enjoyment in the process of temporal IT usage. Perceived enjoyment has become an increasingly important part of how consumers assess technology. Thus, we build on Bhattacherjee and Premkumar's model (BP model) and propose a new model by investigating the comparative role of perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived enjoyment (PE) for explaining temporal changes in users' beliefs and attitudes toward IT usage. We name our proposed model the integrated temporal model (ITM). Through an empirical study of iPad usage in a classroom setting at three different stages, we found that 1) the effect of PE on PU was stronger at the pre-usage (vs. post-usage) stage and that its effect was stronger at the initial-usage (vs. later-usage) stage; 2) while PE has a stronger effect than PU on attitude at both pre usage and initial-usage stages, that was not the case at the later-usage stage; instead, the effect of PU on attitude was stronger at the later-usage (vs. initial-usage) stage; 3) the effect of disconfirmation on modified PU and PE was stronger at the initial (vs. later) stage, while the effect of PU and PE expectation on modified PU and PE was weaker at the initial (vs. later) stage. Our study extends the BP model to IT with hedonic elements (i.e., the iPad) and is the first of its kind to empirically examine the combined and relative impact of PU and PE on the temporal usage of IT with hedonic elements in the classroom setting.

AB  - Drawing on social identity theory, we examine how Whites' race-related beliefs drive their reactions to race-based Affirmative Action Policies (AAPs). Across laboratory and field settings, we find that Whites with relatively high modern racism (MR) or collective relative deprivation (CRD) beliefs perceive greater White disadvantage in organizations that have race-based AAPs, than in organizations that do not. Alternatively, race-based AAPs do not lead to perceptions of White disadvantage among Whites with relatively low MR and CRD beliefs. We also find that White disadvantage mediates the relationship between the combined effects of race-based AAPs, MR beliefs, and CRD beliefs and the perceived fairness of the organization's selection and promotion policies. Our findings suggest that race-based AAPs do not necessarily lead to perceptions of White disadvantage, but are contingent upon the interpretive lens of Whites' MR and CRD beliefs, and also offer practical insights for preventing negative reactions to race-based AAPs.

TI  - Forest management or greed of gain?-An information experiment on periurban forest visitors' attitudes regarding harvesting operations
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING

AB  - Forestry operations in urban forests are often perceived negatively by forest visitors seeking recreation. This study investigates the range of attitudes present among such forest visitors and how their perceptions towards forestry operations can be influenced by targeted information measures. First, in order to identify the specific attributes and values associated with forestry operations, a hierarchical value map (HVM) was derived from a pre-study with 12 participants. Second, 51 forest visitors were surveyed in the Vienna Woods, Austria. For the latter, the laddering method was used to identify the focal points and shifts in HVM attributes and values. The results show that the public information boards used in the experiments reduce the visual impact of the harvesting as well as ecology-related factors and redirect attention towards timber-related or commercial items. We conclude that information provided at a site of emotional concern is easily picked up and leads to attitude changes. These attitude changes are directly linked to the information provided (e.g. concerning the environment, the eco-social market economy, or support of the regional economy).

AB  - In the last 10 years, rising rates of obesity in the United States have drawn significant and increasing public attention from various quarters, which has led to commensurately increased news coverage of the issue. A handful of scholars to date have examined how obesity has been "framed" in the news, given that news framing of issues has proven effects on cultural and political attitudes, practices, and policies as regards the subject of coverage. Consistent with these studies, this qualitative framing analysis assesses how obesity is framed in more recent mainstream news coverage. Framing patterns identified in this analysis represent a notable departure from those identified in earlier studies, specifically as relevant to troubling the individual/environmental attribution binary that historically has characterized public discourse around obesity, in particular, and health more broadly. These findings signal important shifts for contemporary cultural attitudes toward obesity and, accordingly, public health policies designed to redress the issue. Further, the findings suggest a reconsideration and elaboration of established tenets of framing theory.

AB  - Background: So far, there have been no published population studies on the relationship between a COVID-19 infection and public risk perception, information source, knowledge, attitude, and behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak in China.
   Objective: This study aims to understand the relationships between COVID-19 infection; four personal nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs; handwashing, proper coughing habits, social distancing, and mask wearing); and public risk perception, knowledge, attitude, and other social demographic variables.
   Methods: An online survey of 8158 Chinese adults between February 22 and March 5, 2020, was conducted. Bivariate associations between categorical variables were examined using Fisher exact test. We also explored the determinants of four NPIs as well as their association with COVID-19 infection using logistic regression.
   Results: Of 8158 adults included, 57 (0.73%) were infected with COVID-19. The overwhelming majority of respondents showed a positive attitude (n=8094, 99.2%), positive risk perception (n=8146, 99.9%), and high knowledge levels that were among the strongest predictors of the four adopted NPIs (handwashing: n=7895, 96.8%; proper coughing: 5997/6444, 93.1%; social distancing: n=7104/8158, 87.1%; and mask wearing: 5011/5120, 97.9%). There was an increased risk of COVID-19 infection for those who did not wash their hands (2.28% vs 0.65%; risk ratio [RR] 3.53, 95% CI 1.53-8.15; P=.009), did not practice proper coughing (1.79% vs 0.73%; RR 2.44, 95% CI 1.15-5.15; P=.03), did not practice social distancing (1.52% vs 0.58%; RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.48-4.67; P=.002), and did not wear a mask (7.41% vs 0.6%; RR 12.38, 95% CI 5.81-26.36; P<.001). For those who did practice all other three NPIs, wearing a mask was associated with a significantly reduced risk of infection compared to those who did not wear a mask (0.6% vs 16.7%; P=.04). Similarly, for those who did not practice all or part of the other three NPIs, wearing a mask was also associated with a significantly reduced risk of infection. In a penalized logistic regression model including all four NPIs, wearing a mask was the only significant predictor of COVID-19 infection among the four NPIs (odds ratio 7.20, 95% CI 2.24-23.11; P<.001).
   Conclusions: We found high levels of risk perception, positive attitude, desirable knowledge, as well as a high level of adopting the four NPIs. The relevant knowledge, risk perception, and attitude were strong predictors of adapting the four NPIs. Mask wearing, among the four personal NPIs, was the most effective protective measure against COVID-19 infection, with added preventive effect among those who practiced all or part of the other three NPIs.

AB  - Scholarly work has placed political discussion at the center of a healthier democracy. However, this might not always be the case considering the vast amount of different discussion attributes and their effects. This study extends existing research on the influence of different discussion attributes (cognitive elaboration, network size, exposure to disagreement, and online/offline discussion) on political attitude change. To do so, we introduce the concept of obstinate partisanship and explore different discussion attributes as its antecedents. Obstinate partisans remain loyal to their political party irrespective of its performance, just as staunch sports fans do with their team. Results from a survey conducted in three democracies show that discussion network size, discussion disagreement, and offline discussion are all negative predictors of obstinate partisanship. Conversely, online discussion fosters this negative orientation. We finally examine the moderating role of discussion disagreement and network size on some of these relationships.

AB  - Globalization does not only involve the spread of massive information technology throughout the world. In the early 2020s the world also experienced a global pandemic COVID-19 which plagues almost all countries in the world. COVID-19 forces learning activities di higher education level to be carried out with social distancing concepts. Online learning can be done using a number of popular information technology applications. The study involved college students from the faculty of computer science and engineering. They took courses on enterprise resource planning, human-computer interaction, and research methods. The results showed that COVID-19 did not impede learning activities. A number of social technologies such as Dropbox, Facebook, Google Forms, Moodle, WhatsApp, WordPress, YouTube, and Zoom have seen a surge in usage to support distance learning activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. With online distance learning mode, all learning activities can be done with the concept of work from home. This learning scheme can be used not only for science and technology fields but also Arabic learning.

AB  - Teleconsultation can be classified as an advanced practice nursing that requires nurses??? clinical reasoning based on a consistent theoretical framework to use in the nursing process. Our study conducted a theoretical-reflective analysis, based on Callista Roy???s Adaptation Model of Nursing and Chick-Meleis??? Transition Theory, about the contribution of teleconsultation as an advanced practice nursing in the care of older adults with chronic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. We reflect on this in two moments: ???nursing theories and dealing with COVID-19??? and ???ways of adapting to new care models and advanced practice nursing,??? based on communication and information technologies. The worsening of the pandemic in Brazil changed life cycles, health/disease and organizational processes, demanding the development of an adaptive-transactional state by users and health care providers. Thus, information and communication technologies combined with advanced practice nursing can relieve social distancing and its repercussions on health care.

AB  - Th aim of the paper is to present findings of a study on information sources and information behavior of doctoral students at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing at the University of Zagreb, Croatia. The study also looked into student perceptions of the role of the academic library and their attitudes toward it as a legitimate partner in the research process, as doctoral students are required to publish the results of their doctoral research in high-ranking peer-reviewed journals during their course of study. However, they rarely use the library and its services; the study was undertaken with the intent to obtain insight into the students' information behavior as well as needs and reasons for overlooking the library as a relevant partner in their research process. The online survey was conducted on a sample of 138 postgraduate students, with semi-structured interviews with five postgraduate students also conducted. The findings show a dominant student orientation towards online sources such as online databases and Google Scholar. Students tend to overlook the library as a relevant information source but have positive attitudes toward librarians ( their knowledge, skills and courtesy). The library needs to become more active in promoting its services and, especially in the domain of postgraduate education, needs to be regarded as a necessary location for any serious research work, where librarians are regarded as cooperating partners in the research process. There were a few limitations of the study: respondents were unwilling to dedicate their time to this research and therefore the interviews were too short to examine the topics discussed in-depth, while the sample was extremely homogeneous, making the results only in part transferable to other contexts.

AB  - The paper explores possibilities and constraints for adopting Information Communication Technology (ICT) as a pedagogical tool among teachers and students in community secondary schools (CSSs). The study used five CSSs located in rural peripheral in Serengeti District. Simple random and purposive sampling procedures were used to select a sample of 210 respondents including 180 students and 30 teachers. Data were primarily collected through standardized questionnaire and structured interview. The results revealed several possibilities for ICT adoption in some of CSSs namely, presence of electricity; presence of ICT devices; presence of technical support and positive attitude toward ICT use. Furthermore, the results showed several constraints for ICT adoption including insufficient of ICT devices: lack of technical support and lack of ICT skills and knowledge. The study findings suggest that teachers and students have positive attitudes towards the technology use. They are passionate and ready to use ICTs in teaching and learning because since other schools have possible determinants for ICT adoption like electricity power and few ICT gadgets. The recommends the government to invest adequately in CSSs residing in rural areas to reduce the digital divides between schools and/or teachers and students in the use of ICT as a pedagogical tool.

AB  - In the ever-growing digital age, the concept of e-learning and Internet technology for smart learning has great potential from the educational perspective. The design of digital learning teaching activities and the flexible use of technological tools is key for today's integrated information technology education. There are major challenges to quality and effectiveness in digital learning, which largely remain unexplained because of overflowing feeling positive and self-congratulatory thoughts. In this paper, Effective Integrated E-Learning Framework (EIELF) has been proposed for the modern education system. This paper presents a framework for executing a content integrated learning management system with a detailed focus on multimedia or digital enrichment in learning content. The experimental results of the proposed method show an important difference in learning performance besides positive attitudes between online and traditional learners, which can be a feasible alternative learning strategy for higher education.

AB  - Past studies have shown positive relationships between use of social network sites (SNSs) and political engagement, but an understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship is limited because the studies often did not take into account the diverse affordances of SNSs that can influence participation in different ways. Adopting the O-S-R-O-R (Orientation-Stimulus-Reasoning-Orientation-Response) model of political communication effects, this study examined the roles of Facebook network size, connections with public political actors, use for news, and political expression on political attitudes, protest, and participation. Structural equation analyses were conducted based on data from a national sample in Hong Kong, a city-state with one of the world's highest Facebook penetration rates. Results showed that Facebook network size and connections with public political actors exhibit both direct and indirect effects on participation through Facebook news, expression, and efficacy. Facebook news exhibited indirect effects primarily though political expression. A discriminant function analysis also showed that age, education, and online news exposure were the most influential variables for distinguishing Facebook users and nonusers. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - The recent growth in opinionated cable news, in which the anchor expresses a clear political point of view, has aroused concerns about its potential polarizing effects on public opinion. Key to uncovering opinionated news' impact on public opinion is an understanding of how partisan audiences process opinionated news: Do the overt partisan cues in opinionated news stimulate biased processing, thereby enhancing attitude polarization among opposing partisans relative to non-opinionated news? Or are opinionated news messages processed uniformly by partisans, contributing to direct persuasion? Two online experiments tested the effects of news opinionationand interactions with individual political partisanshipon information processing and attitude change. Results from both studies most clearly support a model of direct persuasion. Message processing and attitude change follow the direction of the news' opinionation, with little variation by partisanship, offering no evidence that opinionated news intensifies attitude differences among partisans relative to non-opinionated news. Implications for theories of political information processing and democratic politics are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: COVID-19 spread across China and other countries in a matter of weeks. Yet, it is uncertain how people have responded to protective behaviours in this pandemic. This study aims to evaluate how trust in different types of information sources influences the intention to adopt protective behaviours. Methods: In total, 122 Chinese completed a survey on Qualtrics in March 2021. Data on demographic information, protective behaviours, trust in formal information, trust in informal information, perceived risk, worry and social desirability were collected. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to identify associations between these variables. Results: Trust in formal information was significantly associated with perceived risk (beta = -.18) and significantly and positively associated with worry (beta = .28). Trust in informal information was significantly and positively associated with perceived risk (beta = .57). Subsequently, perceived risk was significantly associated with social distancing (beta = -.17), and worry was significantly and positively associated with mask wearing (beta = .25) and significantly associated with hand washing (beta = -.27). Trust in formal information was significantly and positively associated with hand washing (beta = .26) while trust in informal information was significantly and positively associated with social distancing and hand washing (beta = .26). Perceived risk was significantly and positively associated with worry (beta = .32). Conclusion: People who trust in informal information from social media and interpersonal communication would be more likely to adopt mask wearing and hand washing protective behaviours. People who trust in formal information from government-agency source would have a lower perceived risk of COVID-19 and are less likely to adopt social distancing, but people who trust in formal information have a greater worry about contracting COVID-19 and are more likely to wear masks.

AB  - Black Americans post about race and race-related issues on social media more than any other racial group. In this study, we investigated whether Black Americans who post about racism on social networking sites (i.e., Facebook) experience evaluative backlash during the employee selection process. Participants (N = 154) were given a Black job candidate's cover letter, resume, and a scanned printout of their social media. Depending on what condition they were randomly assigned to, the applicant's social media contained posts about racism or posts that were race neutral. Results indicated that Black individuals whose posts were about racism were evaluated less favorably than Black individuals whose posts were race neutral. Specifically, they were perceived as being less likable. In addition, Black individuals whose social media posts were related to racism were less likely to be offered an interview for a job. Implications, limitations, and future directions are discussed.

AB  - In studies of learning, emotion is understood as an expression of affect separate from the mind and in need of discipline rather than constructed through language, culture, and power. This study focuses on emotion in a diverse urban classroom and explores, instead, how emotive interactions in a race-related discussion were mediated by texts, talk, and histories of participation. We theorize emotion as action linked to language and identity, and argue that emotion, when viewed as mediated action, offers a broader critical literacy. This critical literacy is deeply related to how students and teachers, as social actors, mobilize emotion to transform texts and signs, acts that are widely understood to be central to sociocultural and social semiotic concepts of learning, but are otherwise veiled in English classrooms.

AB  - This study investigates the bias of Twitter as an agenda-setter during COVID-19. Specifically, we analyze the agenda-setting function of Twitter (Study 1) and characteristics of information disseminators on Twitter, agenda-builders (Study 2), related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Study 1, we examined rank correlations between the media agendas on COVID-19 and public agendas. The results indicated that Twitter agendas resonate with those who have liberal tendencies. In Study 2, we used data from the Internet survey to identify the political attitudes of agenda-builders who tweet or retweet on COVID-19. The results of the model analyses indicated that people with liberal tendencies, motivated by their political attitude, created original tweets, and some of those tweets were then retweeted by flaming-oriented people driven by a sense of justice. This seems to be how information about COVID-19 spreads on Twitter in Japan.

A survey questionnaire was designed and distributed to gather data for this study. The results indicate a positive attitude towards academic use of SNSs by the students. Although there are some differences in terms of students' opinions on academic applications of SNSs, these differences are largely due to the fact that the use of these sites in academic contexts is not well-defined. The higher academic institutions need to devise appropriate policies and strategies on how they can utilize social networking sites to support education and learning beyond the classroom.

AB  - College English follow-up courses are an important part of "University English Curriculum Teaching Requirements" and college English curriculum reform, and its purpose is to meet the individual needs of learners at different levels. "College English Curriculum Teaching Requirements" pointed out "Each school should design its own college English curriculum system according to the curriculum requirements and the college English teaching objectives of the school, while ensuring the improvement of students' language proficiency, it should be conducive to students' personalized learning. to meet their respective development requirements." With the rise and development of computer technology, human society has ushered in the fifth information technology revolution. In just a few decades, people's life and production methods have undergone tremendous changes. Computer information technology has been widely used in military, medical, commercial, education, and industrial fields. Multimedia-assisted teaching has incomparable advantages in these situations. The use of network, computer, and multimedia has made the English classroom teaching methods changed essentially. Due to the huge storage capacity of the computer, it can use graphics, sound, and animation to express, organize, and store the corresponding text knowledge materials, so that the sound, image, and text can truly coexist, achieving an effective increase in the amount of information dissemination and enhancing stimulus intensity of information so as to make the students' enthusiasm for learning knowledge improved. It is precisely because of the powerful information dissemination ability, information processing ability, and convenient and fast interactive form of multimedia itself that it can be used in teaching to enrich the way of classroom teaching activities and make classroom teaching methods no longer single, which can make students better complete the transition from concrete image thinking to abstract logical thinking. The smooth development of college English follow-up courses will continuously improve the English quality of our talents. Learners of different majors have different needs for follow-up college English teaching. Only when students of different majors adopt different teaching courses can they fully reflect the individuality and suitability of the courses. In order to understand the specific needs and views of students of different majors on the courses, students of different majors are made to adopt different teaching courses to get personalized and appropriate learning experience. We distributed questionnaires to senior students at a certain university and adopted Dudley-Evans and St John's needs analysis method for the survey results. It is found that liberal arts students are looking forward to the language application and language skills modules, and their satisfaction with these two modules is as high as 86.23%. The science students and engineering students are more satisfied with the two modules of professional English and language application. Among them, the satisfaction of science students on these two modules is 78.63%, and the satisfaction of engineering students is as high as 92.38%. Students of different majors have a positive attitude towards English follow-up courses, but there is a big difference between the courses offered by universities and the teaching mode. For example, 85.62% of liberal arts students are satisfied with the recognition of the course mode, and only 14.38% are dissatisfied; 66.
   3% of science students are satisfied with the curriculum model, 33.7% are dissatisfied; 66.45% of engineering students are satisfied with the curriculum, and 33.55% are dissatisfied.

AB  - The impact of information and communication technologies on our daily lives has been constantly increasing. This fact influences the modification of attitudes towards information and communication technologies. This study is focused on finding the gender differences in computer attitudes. A questionnaire with 33 Likert's type items was used in our research. The questionnaire was called Information and Communication Technologies' Attitude Questionnaire (ICTAQ). The sample consists of 518 students from 9 high schools. Data was evaluated with the factor analysis with Varimax rotation, ANOVA, Pearson's chi-square test, Pearson's product moment and Cronbach's alpha which was calculated to find out the reliability of the questionnaire. The items of the questionnaire were divided into five dimensions: 1) The positive influence of ICT; 2) The negative influence of ICT; 3) Advantages of ICT; 4) ICT used in biology lesson; 5) Disadvantages of ICT. In our research students' positive attitudes towards the computer have been confirmed and students consider using ICT in biology lessons to be very useful. They prefer a mixed-mode learning environment, i.e. a combination of face-to-face interaction and online activities. Furthermore, boys have more positive attitudes than girls do.

AB  - Attitudes directed at people with disabilities by people without disabilities are formed through encounters with people with disabilities and are mediated by the characteristics of each person and what occurs during their interactions. Disability simulation activities are used to help positively affect people's attitudes and levels of empathy. The purpose of this study was to examine 10 participants' changes in attitudes toward people with disabilities that occurred as a result of participating in disability simulation activities held during an inclusive recreation services study abroad program. A three-phase mixed-methods research design that included the use of transformative procedures was used. The social model of disability served as the theoretical lens for this study. The quantitative component involved the administration of two scales pre-and post-test: The Attitudes Toward Disabled Persons (ATDP) scale and the Multidimensional Attitudes Scale Toward Persons with Disabilities (MAS) scale. Quantitative results indicated that participants' experienced positive attitude changes in 12 of the 16 emotions as measured on the MAS and four emotions as measured on the ATDP. Statistical significance was not found for the other examined emotions. Qualitative data were collected using an in-depth thematic analysis of verbal and behavioral responses to participants' responses to participation in extensive disability simulation activities. Qualitative results showed that the participants transitioned from a sympathetic response to an empathetic response, and then to an advocacy response. This transition demonstrated the potential for the emergence of a model specific to guiding participants through disability simulation activities. Suggestions for research and for facilitating effective disability simulation activities within or outside of recreational therapy practice are presented.

AB  - In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions for the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), countries have taken drastic steps like quarantine, prohibit large-scale gatherings, limited transport, social distancing, curfews, and lockdowns to curtail the spread of the virus. In light of these events, the current study attempts to understand the short-term changes in road traffic patterns, using data from two Wi-Fi MAC Scanners deployed at strategic locations in Chennai, India. The results indicate that the road traffic activities significantly reduced due to the restrictions in non-essential trips, workplace suspensions, and strict surveillance during lockdowns. However, as the lockdown rules eased, the road traffic activities began to recover. It is found that complete closedown is most effective in reducing road travel activity, but ad-hoc short duration complete closedowns may only yield temporary benefits. Also, extended lockdowns without proper enforcement may be ineffective since the public appeared to ignore the advisory after a while.

AB  - Objective: Several studies have reported that Somalis have negative attitudes about using modern contraceptives. However, little attention has been paid to the differences in Somali women's attitudes toward contraceptives across generations and the attitude change happening overtime in Somali women's attitudes toward contraception. This study explores attitudes toward contraceptives and factors influencing contraceptive use, among first- and second-generation Somali women living in Finland. Methods: The study follows a qualitative design with data collection using in-depth interviews. Sixteen women were interviewed regarding their knowledge of, attitude toward, and use of contraceptives. Eight of the study participants were first-generation and eight were second-generation Somali women living in Finland. The data were analyzed using a thematic approach guided by a cultural anthropology framework. Results: Three main themes emerged in the data analysis: (1) Culture influencing Somali women's attitudes toward contraceptives; (2) information sources can work differently within the same cultural group; and (3) Somali women's perspectives on contraceptives change over time. Cultural, religion, taboo, and knowledge resources are used to understand the whole concept of Somali women's attitude toward and use of contraceptives. Hence, the study shows the diverse opinions of Somali women. According to the informants the main underlying factors influencing Somali women's attitudes toward contraceptives were education, culture, misinterpreted religion, and social pressure. Conclusions: According to the Finish resident women interviewed for this study, Somali culture do not support the use of modern contraceptives. Even though attitudes towards contraceptives are slowly changing, there is a need for SRH education, particularly among first-generation Somalis. Second-generation women are generally more open to the use of modern contraceptives. The study also draws attention to the need to improve the training of health care professionals regarding the handling of culturally sensitive topics such as contraception use.

AB  - Overweight and obese persons are frequently stigmatized in news media. The present study is the first to systematically compare public reactions to positive and negative images of obese persons accompanying news reports on obesity (while manipulating gender and race of the target)and their effects on generalized attitudes and social distance toward obese persons. The authors conducted 3 randomized experimental studies using online surveys to assess public perceptions of positive versus stereotypical images of obese adults (who varied by gender and race) accompanying a neutral news report about obesity. The sample included 1,251 adults, who were recruited through a national survey panel during May of 2010. Participants who viewed negative, stereotypical images of obese targets increased social distance, antifat attitudes, and ratings of laziness and dislike toward obese persons, whereas positive, nonstereotypical images induced more positive attitudes. These findings remained consistent when accounting for sociodemographic variables. African American female obese targets portrayed in images evoked higher ratings of dislike and social distance compared with Caucasian targets, but ratings were similar for male and female targets. This study provides evidence that images of obese person accompanying written media influence public attitudes toward obese people, and may reinforce weight stigmatization if images contain stereotypical portrayals of obese persons. Implications for efforts to report about obesity in the news media are discussed.

AB  - This special issue on race relations and racial inequity in Library and Information Science (LIS) is a response a recent wave of advocacy, activism, and protests. Its explicit purpose is to address the lack of research on race and inequity within our field. The purpose of this contribution to the issue is to substantiate that statement by performing a bibliometric analysis of the last 40 years of LIS scholarship to quantify the amount of attention given to race and racial inequality over that period. We find that despite an important increase in BIPOC-related research in LIS, the numbers remain quite low with approximately 2% of LIS publications containing terms related to racial inequality and BIPOC communities, and this research also tends to be less cited than the average LIS papers in the same area. We also find that this research is present in several areas of the field, although unevenly distributed across them. The trends presented in this paper may help when discussing sensitive issues regarding systematic discrimination, help create and sustain momentum towards change, and address the persistent lack of diverse perspectives and approaches across LIS scholarship and practice.

AB  - In a survey among 250 subjects recruited at a German university and predominantly university students, we elicit opinions about social distancing, i. e., the necessity to keep away from other people to slow down the speed of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. The good news is that most students are supportive to it. A minority, however, does not completely agree. We find that how many elderly persons subjects knew personally, was the most significant factor for their attitudes toward social distancing. We also found a significant negative impact of believe in conspiracy theories on these attitudes. These theories have a non-negligible number of proponents, even among university students. Moreover, a certain degree of mistrust to media is widespread (around a third of the subjects). To improve positive attitudes to social distancing and thus to improve compliance we recommend therefore to emphasize relations of persons to elderly people in health communications more and to continue fighting against fake news and conspiracy theories regarding SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Purpose-Mobile appstores have fast sprung up during the last few years. The large number of apps in these appstores results in increased search effort for the customer as well as fierce competition leading to poorer revenues for both appstores as well as developers. Therefore, appstores allow developers to resort to bundling apps so as to increase the revenues and improve customer loyalty. Since an app-bundle is a mix of two or more apps, it may induce both positive and negative emotions simultaneously in the consumer. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of app-bundling strategy from consumers' perspective, and help developers design app-bundles.
   Design/methodology/approach-Based on ambivalence theories, this research investigate different antecedents and influence of positive attitude and negative attitude on purchase behavior, and derives seven key app-bundles attributes through an exploratory study. The data were collected from 930 consumers of app-bundles in China and analyzed using SEM approach.
   Findings-The findings indicate that positive attitude and negative attitude are two separate concepts and the identified seven app-bundling attributes have distinct effect on shaping consumers' positive and negative attitude.
   Originality/value-This study makes three key contributions to theory and practice. First, this study identifies the specific attributes of app-bundles using exploratory study. Second, this study addresses the challenges involved in examining bundles using ambivalence theory. In doing so, it characterizes attitude as positive and negative and treats them as separate constructs. Third, as called forth by previous studies, this study establishes the co-existence of positive attitude and negative attitude.

AB  - This study uses a Critical Race Digital Literacy framework to examine Black and Latinx adolescents' ability to critically evaluate race-related materials online. Participants completed four tasks that required them to engage with a range of race-related material, from search results to social media content. Findings indicate that the majority of participants demonstrated an "emerging" or "mastery" level understanding of search results and determining the trustworthiness of websites. Participants found evaluating the credibility of Twitter content as well as evaluating a Russian disinformation campaign's Facebook profile targeting African Americans considerably more challenging. In addition, though 34% recognized a video screenshot arguing that building a wall at the southern border is humane as racist, participants had difficulty combining this knowledge with an understanding of online propaganda. Few participants reached mastery on this task, and others that required them to evaluate social media content and recognize disinformation. As more online content and media are explicitly related to race or references specific racial groups, these findings highlight the need for more interventions to enhance competencies around critically evaluating race-related materials online.

AB  - Using nationally representative data in Taiwan, this study investigated the effect of cross-cutting exposure on social media on attitudinal change. Findings showed that the way people responded to political disagreement on social media matters. People's attitudes were likely to change when they checked cross-cutting information and expressed opinion after being exposed to it, but not when they ignored the disagreeing information after the exposure. Accordingly, checking disagreeing information and expressing opinion played a significant role in mediating the relationship between exposure to cross-cutting information and attitude change. More importantly, the indirect effect of cross-cutting exposure on attitude through information checking was contingent on the levels of individuals' openness to diversity and social network homogeneity. The indirect effect was strengthened when the level of openness to diversity was higher but weakened when the level of social network homogeneity was higher. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to explore the socio-cultural factors that emerge in the implementation of integrated financial management information systems (IFMIS) in Ghana, a developing country. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative research approach was used with a case study design. The data were collected from archival documents and semi-structured face-to-face interviews with participants who played a significant role in the implementation of IFMIS in the Ghanaian public sector. Findings The findings show that although IFMIS was considered by the World Bank, Department for International Development (DFID), European Union and Danish International Development Agency to be rational, technical, universal and unproblematic, the use of the system in the Ghanaian public institutions was constrained by socio-cultural factors. These factors included power struggles between various technocrats; and negative attitudes such as opportunism and rent-seeking interest towards the IFMIS. Research limitations/implications The research is grounded in a single case study, but the findings can be theoretically generalised to information technology (IT)-based financial management system exhibiting the same characteristics. Practical implications This study offers a practical implication for governments, consultants and donor agencies. Originality/value This study provides additional insight through the application of the sociology and duality of information technology theory to study a particular IT-based public financial management initiative.

AB  - Background: Although stress is an established contributor to obesity (in general population studies), mechanisms to explain this association in African American women that incorporate culturally relevant frameworks have received little attention.
   Objective: To investigate how stress is associated with body mass index (BMI) in this population, we examined multivariate models of BMI predicted by race-related, gender-related, and generic stressful life events and by use of food to cope with stress. We hypothesized that the three types of stressful life events would be indirectly associated with BM! through using food to cope with stress.
   Methods: Psychometrically robust measures were included in surveys administered to a socioeconomically diverse sample of 189 African American women aged 21-78 years. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. We examined race-related, gender-related, and generic stressful life events as latent constructs indicated by exposure to and appraisal of potential stressors predicting a mediator, using food to cope, which predicted BMI; this model also included direct paths from the three latent stressful life event constructs to BMI.
   Results: Almost every participant reported using food in some way to cope with stress; 33% and 42% met established criteria for overweight and obesity, respectively. The race-related stressful life event construct was the only latent construct predicting using food to cope with stress, and using food to cope with stress predicted BMI. A significance test of indirect effects demonstrated that the race-related stressful life event construct was indirectly associated with BMI through the mediator, using food to cope.
   Discussion: Culturally relevant stress exposures and stress-related eating are important areas of foci for tackling overweight, obesity, and related health inequities in African American women. Findings highlight the importance of developing more complex models to understand the stress-related factors that elevate risk for overweight and obesity in this population.

AB  - We investigated knowledge and attitudes before and after reading refutation texts augmented by different kinds of persuasive information and how emotions mediated the process of knowledge and attitude change. Undergraduates (N = 424) enrolled in 4 universities from 3 countries read a refutation text on genetically modified foods (GMFs) and were then randomly assigned to receive additional information about advantages of GMFs, disadvantages of GMFs, or both. After studying, students reading about advantages of GMFs had significantly more positive attitudes than students who read about disadvantages. There was also a significant reduction in misconceptions; participants in the positive-oriented text condition showed the largest learning gains, particularly those who held more positive initial attitudes. Epistemic emotions of curiosity, frustration, hope, and enjoyment mediated attitude change while confusion mediated relations between prereading attitudes and postreading knowledge. In addition, the direct relationship between prior attitudes and surprise was moderated by type of text. When reading about both advantages and disadvantages of GMFs, participants reported significantly less surprise when compared with those who read about either advantages or disadvantages of GMFs. To foster conceptual change when learning about complex topics, refutation texts may be paired with persuasive information that is aligned with accurate conceptions.

AB  - Men's tendency to delay health help-seeking is largely attributed to masculinity, but findings scarcely focus on African American men who face additional race-related, help-seeking barriers. Building principally on reactance theory, we test a hypothesized model situating racial discrimination, masculinity norms salience (MNS), everyday racism (ERD), racial identity, sense of control (SOC), and depressive symptomatology as key barriers to African American men's health help-seeking. A total of 458 African American men were recruited primarily from US barbershops in the Western and Southern regions. The primary outcome was Barriers to Help-Seeking Scale (BHSS) scores. The hypothesized model was investigated with confirmatory factor and path analysis with tests for measurement invariance. Our model fit was excellent CFI = 0.99; TLI = 1.00; RMSEA = 0.00, and 90% CI [0.00, 0.07] and operated equivalently across different age, income, and education strata. Frequent ERD and higher MNS contributed to higher BHHS scores. The relationship between ERD exposure and BHHS scores was partially mediated by diminished SOC and greater depressive symptomatology. Interventions aimed at addressing African American men's health help-seeking should not only address masculinity norms but also threats to sense of control, and negative psychological sequelae induced by everyday racism.

T2  - PLOS ONE

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have advocated numerous social distancing measures, and compliance with these has likely saved millions of lives globally. In an online sample drawn from the U.S. and Canada (N = 209), participants completed measures of political orientation, moral foundations, and COVID-19 social distancing attitudes and behaviours. A more left-wing political orientation, and greater endorsement of the individualizing moral foundations were significantly related to more positive social distancing attitudes, and greater self-reported compliance with relevant restrictions. A more right-wing political orientation, and greater endorsement of the binding and economic liberty foundations were associated with less positive attitudes and reduced compliance. In a series of mediation analyses, the relationships between political orientation and various social distancing measures were significantly mediated by variations in participants' moral foundations, particularly their endorsement of economic liberty and the individualizing foundations. Further data indicated that the perceived persuasiveness of messages based on each moral foundation advocating for continued social distancing was significantly related to both participants' moral values and their political orientation. Findings are discussed in terms of understanding politicized differences around social distancing as partly reflecting differential valuation of the moral foundations, and in creating effective public health messaging regarding compliance.

AB  - This article examines how on-air conversations between journalists indicate how US television coverage of a race-related crisis can reflect racial ideology. Using critical discourse analysis, we examined interjournalistic discourse about African Americans in national network and cable news programs that aired after Hurricane Katrina reached New Orleans. While we expected conversational semantic items from conservative Fox News to reflect racial ideology, we also found such discursive elements from politically moderate and progressive news organizations such as CBS, CNN, and MSNBC. These findings are consistent with Anxiety Uncertainty Management theory, which predicts that exposure to stressors in unfamiliar settings causes individuals to think in ethnocentric, dichotomous, stereotypical ways. Our research underscores the impact of white privilege on language, communication, and news production, and the need for cultural competence training to enhance journalists' ability to discuss racial matters with ease.

AB  - In the light of the current discourse about national belonging in Britain/the UK, the author examines an episode in the 1980s when the same kind of debate was initiated by the Thatcherite Right over the work of the Institute of Race Relations (IRR) and its booklets for young people about the derivation and reality of racism. Accusing the IRR of political indoctrination, falsifying history, denigrating white people and redefining racism, attempts were made in parliament, the media, through a TV programme and a themed book, to ban the educational booklets of IRR, especially its cartoon book (which was blamed for inciting the riots' of 1985) and close down the organisation.

AB  - Software is a vital resource for modern life. For software to be successful, programming skills are of the utmost importance. These skills are used both by programmers and also by systems analysts and designers during the phases of software development. Therefore, both technical and non-technical stakeholders within the software development process need to understand programming. Evidence from the researchers' experience indicates that non-technical stakeholders perform poorly in programming courses. Given the lack of literature on the attitude factors influencing programming success by non-technical students, this study set out to determine the attitudinal factors influencing successful programming by non-technical (Commerce) and technical (Computer Science) students at a South African University. Using a descriptive survey design, a 50-question Likert scale survey was completed by 126 Commerce and Computer Science students in the Information Technology discipline. Both Commerce and Computer Science students demonstrated a positive attitude towards realising the usefulness of computer programming, however Computer Science students demonstrated a higher overall positive attitude. Furthermore, for Commerce students, performance was correlated with these factors: confidence in learning programming, usefulness of programming and effectance motivation in programming. Hence it is recommended that strategies be devised by lecturers and programming course designers to increase student confidence and effectance motivation in programming, which will result in better student performance. Introducing a problem-solving approach and pair-programming, developing targeted courses and an early use of visual programming environments have been suggested to improve the overall confidence of non-technical students.

AB  - This study aimed to understand the contributions of active ADHD symptoms and the diagnostic label of ADHD in yielding negative attitudes and social distance ratings. Using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (n = 305), respondents were assigned to read a vignette about: (a) a typically developing child, (b) a child with active ADHD symptoms and (c) a child with active ADHD symptoms + diagnostic label. Participants were then asked to answer questions about their beliefs and feelings about the child in the vignette. The active ADHD symptom condition predicted higher levels of social distance, and this link was mediated by negative and animalistic adjective ratings, and by angry emotions felt by the participants after reading the vignettes. Our findings suggest that ADHD symptoms drive negative views and social distance and that an ADHD label may serve as a protective factor to help people overcome biases related to childhood ADHD. ADHD symptom literacy and contact with children with varying levels of ADHD symptoms may be an important target to help reduce negative attitudes.

AB  - Research over the past three decades consistently shows poor outcomes in education and employment for young people leaving care in England. Evidence indicates lower levels of education attainment and post-16 participation for young people in and leaving care in comparison to other young people and suggests a lasting impact, with care experienced adults at greater risk of social exclusion, being overrepresented in marginalised groups such as the long-term unemployed, homeless and prison populations and adults with mental health difficulties. This paper draws on recent research carried out with young people leaving care to explore the challenges they face in finding and sustaining participation in education, employment and training. It shows that support from formal and informal sources to address the practical, emotional and financial challenges is crucial to successful journeys and that young people's own motivation and self-belief are significant factors in increasing and sustaining participation.

AB  - Background Social marketing is a tool used in the domain of public health for prevention and public education. Because injury prevention is a priority public health issue in British Columbia, Canada, a 3-year consultation was undertaken to understand public attitudes towards preventable injuries and mount a province-wide social marketing campaign aimed at adults aged 25-55 years.
   Methods Public response to the campaign was assessed through an online survey administered to a regionally representative sample of adults within the target age group between 1 and 4 times per year on an ongoing basis since campaign launch. A linear regression model was applied to a subset of this data (n=5186 respondents) to test the association between exposure to the Preventable campaign and scores on perceived preventability of injuries as well as conscious forethought applied to injury-related behaviours.
   Results Campaign exposure was significant in both models (preventability: =0.27, 95%CI 0.20 to 0.35; conscious thought: =0.24, 95%CI 0.13 to 0.35), as was parental status (preventability: =0.12, 95%CI 0.03 to 0.21; conscious thought: =0.18, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.30). Exposure to the more recent campaign slogan was predictive of 0.47 higher score on conscious thought (95%CI 0.27 to 0.66).
   Discussion This study provides some evidence that the Preventable approach is having positive effect on attitudes and behaviours related to preventable injuries in the target population. Future work will seek to compare these data to other jurisdictions as the Preventable social marketing campaign expands to other parts of Canada.

AB  - With information technology (IT) increasingly penetrating in workplaces, employee satisfaction with workplace IT becomes an integral part of work and significantly influences work-related outcomes. Scant attention, however, has been paid to whether and how employees' IT satisfaction plays a role in generating job-related attitudinal changes among employees. Drawing upon satisfaction spillover theory, we developed and empirically tested a model to examine the relationship between individual satisfaction with workplace IT and job satisfaction. Specifically, we introduced two elements of user-task-technology fit-namely, job fit and professional fit-to examine the transition in employees' satisfaction from the technological domain to overall satisfaction with work. We found that job fit not only mediated but also strengthened the effect of workplace IT satisfaction on job satisfaction, whereas professional fit did not play a moderating role in the relationship between workplace IT satisfaction and job satisfaction. The findings suggest that practitioners should emphasize workplace IT as a crucial ingredient of the work context and improve employee experiences with using IT. More importantly, the fit of IT with employees' job and professional requirements is critical for this transition in satisfaction.

AB  - Purpose - The major objective of this paper is to examine whether or not information technology (IT) usage to share knowledge is a mediator or moderator of the intention behaviour relationship proposed in the theory of reasoned action (TRA).
   Design/methodology/approach - A letter of invitation to participate in the study was sent to all of the public-listed companies in Malaysia. A total of 483 full-time employees from 23 organizations completed an anonymous, self-administered survey in a cross-sectional design. Partial least squares analysis was used to test the conceptual model.
   Findings - The major finding is that the relationship between the intention to share knowledge and knowledge sharing is partly mediated and not moderated by IT usage to share knowledge.
   Research limitations/implications - Knowledge sharing was considered only at the individual level. The data are self-reported, cross-sectional, from a single source and a single method. The relational and capability-membership perspective leads to a positive attitude towards knowledge sharing whereas the instrumental perspective leads to a negative attitude, The findings augment the TRA by showing there is a mediator of the intention-behaviour relationship in the context of knowledge sharing.
   Practical implications - The findings indicate that organizations need to ascertain employees' preferred methods for sharing knowledge, provide appropriate IT for knowledge sharing, establish online communities for knowledge sharing, publicly acknowledge members for sharing knowledge, and avoid relying on extrinsic tangible rewards to foster knowledge sharing.
   Originality/value - Previous research has shown that using IT to share knowledge does not moderate the intention-behaviour relationship in the TRA. An alternative conceptualisation of the role of using IT to share knowledge in the intention-behaviour relationship is provided.

AB  - This study examined the experiences of sport tourists at the Formula One (F1) Singapore Grand Prix. In addition, the study also examined the difference in experiences between the genders and between local and international tourists. Three hundred and forty-seven reviews on TripAdvisor were captured and analysed. The initial analysis showed seven themes: ?race?, ?track?, ?event?, ?concerts?, ?cars?, ?food? and ?walk?. Further analysis uncovered differences between the genders and between local and international tourists. Specifically, male tourists were more likely to comment on race-related matters. On the other hand, female tourists? experiences were focused on entertainment activities with family and friends during the event. In addition, locals were more focused on race-related experiences while international tourists commented on enjoyable experiences with local food and people during the event. The findings of this study gained insights into the marketing of the F1 Singapore Grand Prix from the tourists? perspective.

AB  - Background Young adults are not considered a risk group, but the public health response to COVID-19 impacts all citizens. We investigated the impact on young adults' and their adherence to containment measures addressing potential gender differences. Methods In April 2020 12 341 students of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences were invited to a longitudinal health survey. Survey topics spanned socio-demographic data, students' health status and behavior, COVID-19 specific impact, concerns, information sources, adherence to containment measures, and trust in government bodies. Group comparisons by gender and multivariate ordinal regression models assessing adherence to restrictions of mobility and social contacts were conducted (n=2373). Results Mean age was 26.4 (SD=5.6), 70% were female. 43.5% reported some concern about their own health, 2.7% stated major worries. Women experienced more conflicts (p < 0.000) and, enjoyed time with the family more (p < 0.000). Men felt less locked up (p = 0.001). The most frequented COVID-19 information source was public media (48%) and confidence in government bodies was high (82%) for both genders. Men yielded lower adjusted odds (OR; 95%-CI) of adherence regarding the following measures: social distancing (0.68; 0.53-0.87), non-utilization of public transport (0.74; 0.56-0.97), 5-person limit for social gatherings (0.47; 0.35-0.64) and the stay at home rule (0.64; 0.51-0.82). Conclusion Early in the pandemic a high degree of adherence was observed in this young academic population. Containment measures restricting movement and social contact yielded considerable differences by gender, information source and perceived susceptibility to the virus. More targeted communication may increase adherence regarding mobility restrictions.

AB  - Utilisation of information technology (IT) in the treatment of people with severe mental health problems is an unknown area in Europe. Use of IT and guiding patients to relevant sources of health information requires that nursing staff have positive attitudes toward computers and accept IT use as a part of daily practises. The aim of the study was to assess the effects of the implementation of a web-based patient support system on staff's attitudes towards computers and IT use on psychiatric wards. Hundred and forty-nine nurses in two psychiatric hospitals in Finland were randomised to two groups to deliver patient education for patients with schizophrenia and psychosis with a web-based system (n = 76) or leaflets (n = 73). After baseline nurses were followed-up for 18 months after the introduction of the system. The primary outcome was nurses' motivation to utilise computers, and the secondary outcomes were nurses' beliefs in and satisfaction with computers, and use of computer and internet. There were no statistically significant differences between study groups in attitudes towards computers (motivation p = 0.936, beliefs p = 0.270, satisfaction p = 0.462) and internet use (p = 0.276). However, nurses' general computer use (p = 0.029) increased more in the leaflet group than in the IT intervention group. We can conclude that IT has promise as an alternative method in patient education, as the implementation of the web-based patient support system in daily basis did not have a negative effect on nurses' attitudes towards IT.

AB  - People often receive information about scientific developments and new technologies from peers and via social media instead of from the original source. During this process, information may get lost or distorted, resulting in an inaccurate perception of the technologies' risks and benefits. It has been hypothesized that people's trust in the information source and their initial attitude toward the technology are drivers of this distortion. In two experiments, participants received information about a new technology that elicited either a positive or a negative attitude and that was provided by a trusted source or a less trusted source. They were asked to write down what they would tell a friend about it. Both the initial attitude and the source trustworthiness influenced what and how participants communicated about the new technology.

AB  - Building on social distancing theories, we present how brands use social media content involving COVID-19 and how consumers respond to it. Drawing from the literature on social marketing, societal marketing, corporate social responsibility (CSR), brand activism, and crisis communication, we theoretically classify branded COVID-19 content in social media environments. We argue that brands - limited to the German market - utilise COVID-19 in manifold ways, involving themselves in social causes and, furthermore, in many cases, assuming a role as a spokesperson for crisis communication. Our findings demonstrate that the Coronavirus pandemic and the corresponding reinforcement of social distancing act as amplifiers of consumer sensitivity. However, even in situations of external crisis, marketing managers can build brand equity by showing empathy.

AB  - Do online social networks affect political tolerance in the highly polarized climate of postcoup Egypt? Taking advantage of the real-time networked structure of Twitter data, the authors find that not only is greater network diversity associated with lower levels of intolerance, but also that longer exposure to a diverse network is linked to less expression of intolerance over time. The authors find that this relationship persists in both elite and non-elite diverse networks. Exploring the mechanisms by which network diversity might affect tolerance, the authors offer suggestive evidence that social norms in online networks may shape individuals' propensity to publicly express intolerant attitudes. The findings contribute to the political tolerance literature and enrich the ongoing debate over the relationship between online echo chambers and political attitudes and behavior by providing new insights from a repressive authoritarian context.

AB  - Objectives: The study objectives were to investigate Qatar pharmacy students' attitudes toward pharmaceutical care (PC), to identify the factors that influence their attitudes, and to recognize their perceived barriers for PC provision.
   Methods: A cross-sectional and online survey of Qatar pharmacy students was conducted.
   Results: Over 4 weeks, 46 surveys were submitted (88% response rate). All respondents agreed that the pharmacist's primary responsibility is to prevent and resolve medication therapy problems. Most respondents believed that PC provision is professionally rewarding and that all pharmacists should provide PC (93% and 91% of respondents, respectively). Highly perceived barriers for PC provision included lack of access to patient information (76%), inadequate drug information sources (55%), and time constraints (53%). Professional year and practical experience duration were inversely significantly associated with four and five statements, respectively, out of the 13 Standard Pharmaceutical Care Attitudes Survey statements, including the statements related to the value of PC, and its benefit in improving patient health and pharmacy practitioners' careers.
   Conclusion: Qatar pharmacy students had positive attitudes toward PC. Efforts should be exerted to overcome their perceived barriers.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic era has further energized humans to consider their health more than before, especially in the digital age when they experience a deluge of health information. This study, therefore, examined COVID-19 digital sources, health message types and how the use of African Indigenous language media enhanced people's utilization of coronavirus health messages. Using an online questionnaire and in-depth interview data collection methods, respondents received preventive COVID-19 health messages on social distancing and personal hygiene from mostly interactive digital sources, which hardly infused African Indigenous language media in the health message. However, African Indigenous languages motivated respondents to utilize COVID-19 messages, though people still spread COVID-19 fake news through Indigenous media. Nonetheless, integrating African Indigenous language media into digital health communication can confer credibility on information sources. Still, there is a need to fight the use of digital media to spread fake news.

AB  - The Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the Health Information Technology Act (2009) in America had recommended that electronic health records (EHRs) should be fully adopted by 2014. This has urged educational institutions to prepare healthcare professionals to be competent in using electronic health records (EHRs) while they are in schools. To equip nursing students with competency in using EHRs, an electronic health record for nursing education (EHRNE) has been developed and integrated it into nursing curricula. The purposes of the study were to investigate the factors influencing nursing students' acceptance of the EHRs in nursing education using the extended Technology Acceptance Model with self-efficacy as a conceptual framework. The study is a descriptive study design using self-reported questionnaires with 212 student participants. The IBM SPSS and AMOS 22.0 were used to analyze the data. The results showed that attitude toward using the EHRNE was the most influential factor on students' acceptance. The preliminary findings suggested that to enhance the students' acceptance of the EHRNE, cultivation of a positive attitude toward using this EHR as well as increasing the perceived usefulness is very important. Also, the study's framework could be used in guiding learning health informatics and be applied to nursing students. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to test the potential of educational television and parent-child discussions about race to change White children's attitudes toward Blacks. Ninety-three White children ages 5-7 and their parents participated. Families were randomly assigned into three experimental groups and one control group. Those in the experimental groups were asked either to show their children five educational videos, with or without additional discussions, or to have race-related discussions with their children without the videos. Improvements were seen in children's out-group attitudes in both the video and discussion groups, whereas in-group attitudes decreased for those who watched videos and had discussions with their parents. Results revealed lack of parental compliance. Even when instructed to do so, only 10% of parents reported having in-depth race-related discussions with their children. Children's racial attitudes were not significantly correlated with those of their parents, but children's perceptions of their parents' attitudes were positively correlated with their own. Reasons for parents' reticence about race discussions, their outcome implications, and directions for future research and intervention are discussed.

AB  - Emerging social media platforms such as Twitter and its Chinese equivalent Weibo have become important in information-sharing and communication. They are also gradually becoming stronger in guiding public opinion. When compared with traditional media, these platforms have salient characteristics, such as highly efficient dissemination of information and interactive commentary, which can contribute to information overload. In earlier research, only the effect of social media on attitude change has been studied, but the specific mechanism of this effect in the context of information overload has not been found. To answer this question, we measured the attitude change of participants after they read Weibo posts about street vendors. A 2 (post-attitude: positive posts vs. negative posts) x 4 (reading time: 35 vs. 25 vs. 15 vs. 5 min) experiment was set up, and the Single Category Implicit Attitude Test was used to measure the implicit attitudes. The interaction effect revealed that in both positive and negative posts, less reading time (i.e., information overload) had a stronger influence. Users were more easily persuaded by posts under high overload. Furthermore, the changes in the attitudes of users were not simply stronger with more information. We found three stages, namely, obedience, resistance, and acceptance, with different mechanisms. Therefore, in the positive information overload condition, the attitudes of individuals eventually change in a positive way. In the negative information overload condition, individuals tend to be biased against the group being reported.

TI  - Object Depth Measurement and Filtering from Monocular Images for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
T2  - JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
LA  - English
KW  - VISION
AB  - The flight safety of low-altitude small fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is often threatened by obstacles such as buildings. This requires UAVs to have the ability to autonomously measure the depth of objects ahead. However, existing depth measurement methods based on multiview geometry and handcrafted features still have problems in accuracy and scene suitability. This paper proposes an object depth measurement and filtering method for UAVs by using monocular images. Firstly, the length of the line segment between feature points instead of the pixel position of feature point is used to solve object depth, which reduces the adverse effect of feature matching error. Meanwhile, in order to adapt to UAV platforms, height and attitude changes are both considered in the modeling process. Moreover, the sequence of object depth values corresponding to the image sequence is filtered by an extended Kalman filter to reduce oscillations. The effectiveness of the whole scheme is verified by visual simulation. Results show that the proposed method achieves better accuracy than other depth measurement methods based on multiview geometry.

AB  - Objective: To determine associations between positive and negative attitudes and hookah tobacco smoking (HTS) among college students. Methods: Among a random sample of university students (N = 852), multivariable logistic regression models assessed associations between positive and negative attitudes toward HTS. Results: Positive attitudes were associated with adjusted odds of 4.32 (95% CI = 3.20, 5.82) for current HTS, whereas negative attitudes were associated with lower adjusted odds for current smoking HTS (AOR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.53, 0.76). Positive attitudes were also associated with adjusted odds of 9.31 (95% CI = 6.77, 12.80) for intention for future hookah use among non-HTS users. Conclusion: Positive attitudes toward HTS were more strongly associated with HTS compared to negative attitudes. It may be particularly valuable for future research and interventions to focus on decreasing positive attitudes toward HTS.

AB  - National panel data gathered in 2008 (T1) and 2010 (T2) from 420 Black and White US adults aged 18-89 years (M = 45.37, SD = 15.85) were employed to assess prospective associations between pornography consumption and premarital sex attitudes. Premarital sex attitudes were indexed via a composite measure of perceptions of the appropriateness of adults and teenagers having premarital sex. Wright's (2011) sexual script acquisition, activation, application model ((3)AM) of media sexual socialization was used as the guiding theoretical framework. The (3)AM maintains that sexual media may be used by consumers to inform their sexual scripts but that attitude change from exposure to sexual media is less likely when media scripts are incongruent with consumers' preexisting scripts. Consistent with these postulates, the association between pornography consumption at T1 and more positive attitudes toward premarital sex at T2 was strongest for younger adults, who are less oppositional to premarital sex than older adults. Contrary to the position that associations between pornography consumption and premarital sex attitudes are due to individuals who already have positive attitudes toward premarital sex selecting content congruent with their attitudes, premarital sex attitudes at T1 did not predict pornography consumption at T2.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationships between motivation factors and game engagement and explore the moderating effect of perceived social distance on those relationships. For this, the present study collected data from 228 college students in South Korean through a survey method and used hierarchical multiple regression analyses with three-steps to test the hypotheses. In the results, first, the more fantasy, diversion, or arousal participants pursue in gameplay, the more they are engaged in the game. Second, the positive relationship between arousal and game engagement is stronger for participants in high rather than low in social exclusion. However, social exclusion was found to have no significance in the relationship between other motivators and game engagement. For research contribution, this study is the first one to examine the integral model of motivation factors of engagement in the game platform and to investigate the moderating effect of perceived social distance in gameplay.

AB  - Drawing on reversal theory (Apter, 2007), the current research proposes that internet users' metamotivational state (telic vs. paratelic) determines advertising interactivity's effectiveness. An online field experiment involving 141 Facebook and Twitter users tests this proposition. Research findings support telic state consumers form more positive attitudes toward a low-level interactive ad, whereas paratelic state consumers form more positive attitudes toward a high-level interactive ad. Further, this research shows that an arousal seeking tendency mediates the metamotivational state's impact on ad attitude. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we study the effects of political attitudes on digital activism. We operationalise - political - attitudes through three constructs used in classical political science studies: citizenship norms, - institutional trust and psychological political engagement. In addition, following the social-psychological models of explanation of political conduct, we suggest the existence of a qualitative difference between the affective component of attitudes, which would coincide with psychological political engagement, and the - cognitive component of attitudes, which are made up of political beliefs and values. The latter influences the former, which, in turn, has an influence on political conduct. To achieve our goals, we have - analysed digital political participation in Spain. Our results support the qualitative differentiation between - cognitive and affective components of attitudes; as a result, there is a clear need to study those political beliefs that specifically characterise digital activism.

AB  - Background Health risk communication plays a key role in promoting self-protective measures, which are critical in suppressing COVID-19 contagion. Relatively little is known about the communication channels used by rural poor populations to learn novel measures and their effectiveness in promoting self-protective behaviors. Behavioral change can be shaped by people's trust in government institutions which may be differentiated by social identity, including indigeneity. Methods During an early phase of the pandemic, we conducted two telephone surveys with over 460 communities - both Indigenous and mestizo - without road access and limited communication access in the Peruvian Amazon. This is the first report on the association of information sources about self-protective measures against COVID-19 with the adoption of self-protective behaviors in remote rural areas in developing countries. Results People mainly relied on mass media (radio, television, newspapers) and interpersonal sources (local authorities, health workers, neighbors/relatives) for information and adopted handwashing, mask-wearing, social distancing, and social restrictions to varying degrees. Overall, self-protective behaviors were largely positively and negatively associated with mass media and interpersonal sources, respectively, depending on the source-measure combination. Mistrust of the government seems to have shaped how Indigenous and mestizo peoples distinctively responded to interpersonal information sources and relied on mass media. Conclusions Our findings call for improved media access to better manage pandemics in rural areas, especially among remote Indigenous communities.

AB  - The recent humanitarian Rohingya crisis has once again put Myanmar onto the centre stage of global media attention. The aim of this paper is to look into the ethnic minority question in contemporary Myanmar. The paper has a special focus on the Muslim Rohingya community. The paper argues that problematic race relations in Myanmar today should not be viewed in isolation but should be seen as a part of a historical continuum. The British colonial policies of divide and rule, political leaders and their obsession with Buddhism in the post-independence period and xenophobic tendencies during the long years of the military junta have all collectively contributed to the very complex situation in which the country finds itself today when it comes to race relations. Meaningful democracy and economic development have been advocated as the way forward especially for the more peripheral parts of the country where there is a strong ethnic minority presence.

AB  - Social distancing measures adopted to face the COVID-19 pandemic had a detrimental impact on adolescent education and their interaction with peers and adults, secondary to the limitation of school and recreational activities, with repercussions on social and sexual life. The "Come te la passi?" ("How is it going?") study, performed in the Metropolitan City of Bologna (Italy), aimed at investigating the type of information sources adopted by adolescents for their sexual and reproductive health (SRH) knowledge and education, the age of their sexual debut, and the way in which the COVID-19 pandemic affected their relationships and sexual life in order to help local health care professionals and educators designing SRH education programs. A purposely designed online survey was administered during the COVID-19 pandemic to 378 high school students (age > 14 yo) in July 2021. Based on the study results, the most common source of SRH education was the web, followed by peers (friends). A total of 61.3% of 17-year-olds already had sexual intercourse, and 90% of 15-year-olds had experienced romantic or sexual attraction. For 58.2% of the adolescents, the COVID-19 pandemic had negative effects on their relationships/sexual life. The current research emphasizes the need to involve health care professionals and educators in structured programs to promote SRH education tailored to adolescents' needs and started from early ages.

AB  - Due to their racialized identity and immigrant status, African immigrants face increased risk for social exclusion and other negative outcomes. Research indicates that discrimination, social and economic disadvantage increase risk for substance use among Black populations in the United States. While emerging studies on African immigrants have explored consequences of social exclusion on psychological health, little is known about how these conditions impact substance use patterns. This study examined the effects of social exclusion on alcohol and/or other drug use, and non-medical use of prescription drugs among African immigrants, and explored whether perceived discrimination mediated this relationship. Data were collected between 2019 and 2020 from a cross-sectional survey examining experiences of first and second-generation African immigrants across the United States (N = 597). The majority of the sample identified as female (71%) and Black (82%). Structural equation modeling was conducted with probit regression paths to examine the direct and indirect effects of three dimensions of social exclusion (sociocultural, economic, and structural) on alcohol and/or other drug use and non-medical use of prescription drugs, with perceived discrimination as the mediator. Increased sociocultural and structural exclusion significantly increased the likelihood of alcohol and/or other drug use and non-medical use of prescription drugs through the perceived discrimination pathway. Structural exclusion also had direct effects on substance use. Findings highlight the importance of examining social stressors when exploring risk for substance use, and point to the need for prevention efforts that reduce negative attitudes and promote inclusivity of this marginalized population.

AB  - This article explores technologically integrated relationship practices among college students. Analyzing interviews of 52 participants at two very different US colleges, I explore how they construct, establish, and maintain technologically mediated social networks. This research focuses specifically on the practice of "doing homework," in which participants conduct social media investigations of potential friends and use that data to determine if a relationship continues. Findings suggest the establishment of offline relationships includes the use of social media profiles to collect social and political attitude data on potential friends. Participants report the use of such data as essential to their decision-making processes about friendship, resulting in a potential increase in social and political homogeneity within offline social networks. These findings contribute to our ongoing understanding of the role of informational echo chambers within a technologically integrated social environment.

AB  - Previous studies have indicated that computers and the internet play very important roles in students' acceptance and use of new information technology. In recent years, with the rapid development of mobile technology, mobile learning (m-learning) has becoming another popular topic. However, little is known about the students' attitudes and self-efficacy with the use of a mobile device in language learning. The purpose of this study was to investigate the attitudes and self-efficacy of using mobile learning devices for college students in a language class by employing task-based instruction. The sample group of the study comprised 58 second-year students at a technical university in central Taiwan who used mobile devices for m-learning in an English class to complete assigned tasks under the guidance of the instructor. Results showed that most students agreed that their motivation for English learning was enhanced and most of them had positive attitudes towards m-learning. Implications for future research and the practice of m-learning are discussed.

AB  - Background: The diffusion of health information technologies (HITs) within the health care sector continues to grow. However, there is no theory explaining how success of HITs influences patient care outcomes. With the increase in data breaches, HITs' success now hinges on the effectiveness of data protection solutions. Still, empirical research has only addressed privacy concerns, with little regard for other factors of information assurance.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to study the effectiveness of HITs using the DeLone and McLean Information Systems Success Model (DMISSM). We examined the role of information assurance constructs (ie, the role of information security beliefs, privacy concerns, and trust in health information) as measures of HIT effectiveness. We also investigated the relationships between information assurance and three aspects of system success: attitude toward health information exchange (HIE), patient access to health records, and perceived patient care quality.
   Methods: Using structural equation modeling, we analyzed the data from a sample of 3677 cancer patients from a public dataset. We used R software (R Project for Statistical Computing) and the Lavaan package to test the hypothesized relationships.
   Results: Our extension of the DMISSM to health care was supported. We found that increased privacy concerns reduce the frequency of patient access to health records use, positive attitudes toward HIE, and perceptions of patient care quality. Also, belief in the effectiveness of information security increases the frequency of patient access to health records and positive attitude toward HIE. Trust in health information had a positive association with attitudes toward HIE and perceived patient care quality. Trust in health information had no direct effect on patient access to health records; however, it had an indirect relationship through privacy concerns.
   Conclusions: Trust in health information and belief in the effectiveness of information security safeguards increases perceptions of patient care quality. Privacy concerns reduce patients' frequency of accessing health records, patients' positive attitudes toward HIE exchange, and overall perceived patient care quality. Health care organizations are encouraged to implement security safeguards to increase trust, the frequency of health record use, and reduce privacy concerns, consequently increasing patient care quality.

We assessed the impact of the project on students' learning with a free writing activity done as pretest and posttest and used a semi-structured interview to explore their attitudes towards language learning and their perceived development of their native language. Data analysis indicated statistically significant gains in foreign language writing and positive attitudinal changes toward foreign and native language learning.

AB  - When most people think of anonymous comments written on online content, they think of messages that are overtly negative and offensive. Previous research suggests that readers of online content about race may react more negatively to authors who are members of stigmatized racial groups. In 2 studies, we tested this possibility with respect to online content written by Black and White authors. In Study 1, we analyzed readers' comments on actual race-related opinion-editorial (op-ed) essays published on The New York Times' Room for Debate blog over a 1-year period. As predicted, readers wrote more (and more negative) comments on Black authors' op-eds compared to comments written on White authors' op-eds. Study 2, which included information about the readers, revealed that people who rate themselves as likely to comment online are also more likely to have negative reactions to Black authors' content. Implications for race-related online content and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Previous research has neglected media audiences' and citizens' opinions on how the media should be organized, how they should function in society and what individual, corporate and state responsibilities should be in regard to these questions. In an attempt to understand the relationship between citizens' broader political attitudes and their attitudes on media-related politics and responsibilities, this study uses a survey (n = 2003) of the adult Swedish population to investigate the distribution of a range of media political attitudes in the contemporary space of political positions. The results reveal overlaps between the space of media political attitudes and the broader political space, where support for a Nordic 'media welfare state' corresponds to leftist and GAL-oriented values, while TAN-oriented and right-wing attitudes link to scepticism towards state interventionism in the media landscape. A small but highly opinionated right-wing and TAN-oriented segment displays laissez-faire views on media policy that are reflected in current policy propositions from right-wing political parties in parliament.

AB  - Influenza is associated with a substantial disease burden, and influenza vaccination is recommended to all healthcare workers. We aimed to assess healthcare workers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices about influenza and its vaccine in Chongqing, China. A cross-sectional study was conducted at selected hospitals from September to November 2019, in which healthcare workers filled in a self-administered questionnaire. Both sentinel (42.92%) and non-sentinel hospitals (57.08%) were included. The majority were nurses (52.48%) and physicians (32.37%). Half (50.42%) of the respondents had a good command of knowledge, and the proportion of healthcare workers having a positive attitude accounted for 62.68%. The primary information sources were colleagues (58.81%), followed by television, newspapers and media (30.18%). The number of healthcare workers reported having got vaccinated last year was only 237 (16.78%), and the main reason was protecting themselves from influenza (93.25%). While the most common reasons given for not getting vaccinated were having no time (65.70%), believing it is unnecessary to get vaccinated (29.62%), worrying about the quality of influenza vaccine (27.49%) or the adverse reactions (25.70%). Factors associated with self-reported high vaccination were sentinel hospital (aOR: 1.427; 95% CI: 1.057-1.925), high-risk department (aOR: 1.919; 95% CI: 1.423-2.589), positive attitude (aOR: 2.429; 95% CI: 1.697-3.477) and taking the initiative to learn influenza information (aOR: 3.000; 95% CI: 1.983-4.538). We concluded that healthcare workers in Chongqing had some misconceptions although many of them showed a positive attitude toward the influenza vaccine. Various strategies, including educational training and on-site vaccination, are necessary to improve the knowledge and overall vaccination coverage.

AB  - The number of asylum seekers and refugees across the world is rapidly increasing. Negative attitudes toward these groups are globally prevalent and typically hostile because most receiving country citizens perceive them to be a security threat and an economic burden. This paper aims to understand the antecedents of negative attitudes toward a large refugee group currently garnering a great deal of attention-Syrian refugees, and experimentally test ways to ameliorate negative attitudes. In Study 1 (N = 122), we investigated predictors of social distance-as a proxy for prejudice-and found right-wing authoritarianism and intergroup anxiety to be significant predictors. In Study 2 (N = 162), we tested whether perceived acculturation orientation would predict social distance and found that Americans were less prejudiced toward Syrians who preferred to assimilate rather than integrate. Finally, in Study 3 (N = 153), we tested if a form of vicarious contact could reduce social distance via reduced intergroup anxiety; we found initial evidence for this mediation link. We discussed the potential for the vicarious contact intervention to foster positive intergroup relations and contribute to refugee wellbeing.

AB  - Purpose - Given the well-documented outcomes of corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities, tobacco companies that exhibit CSR may be trusted and consumers may hold positive attitudes towards tobacco companies further contributing to and reinforcing smoking behaviours, which is a highly undesired and addictive behaviour. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to understand smokers and non-smokers views of CSR activities by Indonesian tobacco companies.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from a large private university in Surabaya, Indonesia. There were 191 usable questionnaires with 91.7 per cent male and 8.3 per cent female. The number of smokers and non-smokers were evenly split, 49 per cent smokers and 51 per cent non-smokers which is slightly lower than the 67 per cent of male smokers in Indonesia. Of the 94 smokers in the sample, 69 per cent reported smoking on a daily basis.
   Findings - The results of this study suggest that CSR activities are able to cultivate favourable images of the tobacco companies especially for those who are currently smoking. CSR in the domain of the tobacco industry increases people's favourable association with the company. Moreover, the findings show that consumer-company identification does not affect company evaluation (CE) and consumer sensitivity towards corporate social performance becomes a motivator which positively affects CE among smokers.
   Practical implications - This study has important implications for social marketing practice and research where the dominant focus remains on the downstream. In the case of smoking in Indonesia social marketing efforts directed towards mid and upstream may be more effective than downstream social marketing interventions which have to compete with global tobacco corporations.
   Originality/value - This is one of the first studies to explore the impact of CSR and one of the first studies to examine Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country which exhibits a very high male smoking rate.

AB  - The limitations of self-report questionnaires and interview methods for assessing individual differences in human cognitive biases have become increasingly apparent. These limitations have led to a renewed interest in alternative modes of assessment, including for implicit and explicit aspects of human behavior (i.e., dual-process theory). Acknowledging this, the present study was conducted to develop and validate a serious game, "Don Quixote," for measuring specific cognitive biases: the bandwagon effect and optimism bias. We hypothesized that the implicit and explicit game data would mirror the results from an interview and questionnaire, respectively. To examine this hypothesis, participants (n = 135) played the serious game and completed a questionnaire and interview in a random order for cross-validation. The results demonstrated that the implicit game data (e.g., response time) were highly correlated with the interview data. On the contrary, the explicit game data (e.g., game score) were comparable to the results from the questionnaire. These findings suggest that the serious game and the underlying intrinsic nature of its game mechanics (i.e., evoking instant responses under time pressure) are of importance for the further development of cognitive bias measures in both academia and practice.

AB  - Objective: Describe variation in sentiment of tweets using race-related terms and identify themes characterizing the social climate related to race. Methods: We applied a Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier to conduct sentiment analysis of 1,249,653 US tweets using race-related terms from 2015-2016. To evaluate accuracy, manual labels were compared against computer labels for a random subset of 6600 tweets. We conducted qualitative content analysis on a random sample of 2100 tweets. Results: Agreement between computer labels and manual labels was 74%. Tweets referencing Middle Eastern groups (12.5%) or Blacks (13.8%) had the lowest positive sentiment compared to tweets referencing Asians (17.7%) and Hispanics (17.5%). Qualitative content analysis revealed most tweets were represented by the categories: negative sentiment (45%), positive sentiment such as pride in culture (25%), and navigating relationships (15%). While all tweets use one or more race-related terms, negative sentiment tweets which were not derogatory or whose central topic was not about race were common. Conclusion: This study harnesses relatively untapped social media data to develop a novel area-level measure of social context (sentiment scores) and highlights some of the challenges in doing this work. New approaches to measuring the social environment may enhance research on social context and health.

AB  - Recent political theory in the areas of dialogic and deliberative democracy has placed particular emphasis on the importance of listening in contexts in which people disagree strongly, have competing (and potentially incompatible) interests, or are otherwise profoundly different. Despite this theoretical attention, there is very little empirical research directly examining the concept of listening - especially across lines of difference - in the political context. In this article we present two studies on race and political listening. Study 1 employs a large, diverse national U.S. adult sample and demonstrates that there are some differences - including race-related differences - in the general tendency toward political listening. Study 2, using a large, diverse national sample of U.S. adults, shifts emphasis from overall tendencies in listening during political talk to specific, situational listening with a particular discussion partner. Across three different (randomly assigned) race-related topics, using a method of imagined interactions to simulate such discussions, we find that Blacks (compared to Whites), individuals with fewer opposite-race relatives, and those who do not identify with the opposite race were significantly more likely to report it being "hard" to truly listen during discussion with a cross-race partner. Together, these findings highlight the importance of race itself, racial identity, experience with cross-race interactions, and race-related topics, to the study of political listening.

AB  - Background: Attitude is a relatively permanent inclination towards a positive or negative evaluation of a given social or physical object, which determines a person's disposition towards their surrounding social reality and informs his/her behavior. Aims: The aim of this study is to assess the attitudes of nursing staff, in terms of the emotional and behavioral components, in relation to selected social groups: a Roma person, a hearing-impaired person, a Muslim, and a person of a homosexual orientation. Design: This cross-sectional study was conducted by means of an Internet questionnaire. Methods: This study included 3900 nurses from Poland who were participants in social networking sites and discussion groups for nurses. The study data were collected by using a self-constructed survey questionnaire. The results were reported using the STROBE Checklist. Results: The following scale was adopted: mean 1.0-3.5-positive attitude, 3.6-6.0-negative attitude. Respondents showed positive attitudes towards patient groups (1.67-2.30), the least positive being towards Muslims (2.30) and Roma (2.21). The respondents predicted that during the performance of professional activities, they would have the biggest problem with a person of homosexual orientation (22.1%) or a Muslim person (19.0%). The results show that the age and length of service most often influence attitudes towards patients from different social groups. Conclusions: Respondents with a longer period of work experience and respondents with lower education, despite declaring positive attitudes towards the surveyed social groups, expressed negative statements towards Muslims and homosexuals. Cultural education during the undergraduate and postgraduate studies of nursing staff is essential. Impact Statement: This research indicates that the lesser the need for direct involvement in interactions with patients from other groups, the greater the willingness to accept the situation in which care is provided.

AB  - Publics tend to use social networking sites mainly for interpersonal communication purposes. Corporate communication focusing on promotional activities, thus, might create negative sentiments toward the organization within those platforms. This experimental study examined the effect of organizations' interpersonal approaches to communication (e. g., nonpromotional messages, high interactivity) in social networking sites using real and fictitious companies. Our results suggest that publics consider corporate activities in social networking sites more negatively when they perceive those platforms as a personal space. However, publics evaluate an organization more positively when it is highly interactive with its publics on these platforms. Finally, publics who perceive the platform as a personal space have a more positive attitude toward the organization when the organization is both highly interactive and employs nonpromotional messages.

AB  - While extended intergroup contact has been commonly studied in the context of prejudice reduction, less is known about its implications for processes related to the ingroup. Through three correlational and one experimental studies (total N = 897) conducted in two different intergroup contexts (Turkey and United Kingdom), we investigated whether extended intergroup contact relates to social distance and attitudes towards ingroup members as a function of outgroup attitudes. We also investigated ingroup identification and perceived ingroup morality as potential mediators in these associations. Correlational studies demonstrated that especially when outgroup attitudes were more negative, participants' positive (but not negative) extended contact was related to a more negative evaluation of the ingroup; whereas when outgroup attitudes were more positive, extended contact was associated with positive attitudes towards the ingroup. We found experimental evidence for the suggested relationships in relation to ingroup social distance. Findings are discussed in the light of vicarious dissonance theory and deprovincialization hypothesis.

KW  - Black people

AB  - Purpose - This paper seeks to present the Black blogosphere's discussion of the Jena 6 case to uncover how ethnic identity is performed discursively to promote social activism.
   Design/methodology/approach - Through an analysis of Black blog postings reporting on the Jena 6 case, this case study chronicles the way in which Black audiences responded to this news story. The research chronicles the ways in which Black audiences responded to the Jena 6 news story and how Black blogs expanded participation in the discussion of events related to Black interests.
   Findings - The findings point to critiques of dominant cultural meanings about race relations and racial injustice. In addition, the findings suggest that social media has become an additional medium that is effectively used by African Americans' in their historical struggle for civil rights. By chronicling the ways in which Black audiences responded to this news story, the paper demonstrates that Black blogs provide a useful space for discussing perceived racial injustice from a diverse African American cultural perspective. Moreover, Black bloggers are able to raise awareness of racial injustice within both the Black community and the broader US society and mobilize collective action.
   Practical implications - New divides may be emerging because of limitations on what you can do on a mobile device. This increase in mobile internet access and the accompanying differences in internet experience heightens the need for studies that examine culturally salient behavioral aspects of use and interpersonal relationships characterized by social support, communication, and resource sharing.
   Originality/value - Through an analysis of Black blog postings reporting on the Jena 6 case, this study chronicles the way in which Black audiences responded to this news story. The findings point to critiques of dominant cultural meanings about race relations and racial injustice. In addition, our findings suggest that the momentum of this social movement was based in the political and economic dynamics of a community; however, social media is enabling critical global, yet vigorous conversion of activism

T2  - MODERN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY
LA  - English
KW  - POLITICS
AB  - This article analyzes how debates concerning Brazilian race relations, miscegenation, and racial democracy unfolded in France in the 1950s. During those years, Gilberto Freyre and those critical of him emerged in French social scientific discourse, offering distinct visions concerning race, culture, and the possibility of harmonious coexistence in a world structured by racial, social, and colonial inequalities. Certain French social scientists such as Lucien Febvre and Fernand Braudel embraced Freyre's vision as a possible source for racial and cultural mixing, whereas others, especially Alfred Metraux and Florestan Fernandes, directly criticized his work. Roger Bastide mediated between the two, translating Freyre's Casa-Grande & Senzala and coauthoring a UNESCO-based study on blacks and whites in Sao Paulo that largely repudiated Freyre's claims. I argue that in a period in which decolonization was already underway, Freyre piqued the interest of French social scientists looking to overcome the growing antagonism between colonizer and colonized, even if other models of cultural integration and autonomy contested the validity of Brazil's so-called racial democracy.

AB  - Piracy adversely affects online music sales. This article aims to investigate the factors that affect global music piracy directly and electronic business indirectly. These factors can be grouped into three categories: economic, legal/regulatory, and technological. On analyzing data from 68 countries, a country's economic status and regulatory status emerge as the primary factors affecting music piracy. Technology indirectly affects music piracy by acting as a mediator between a nation's economic status and the music piracy rate. Hence, a nation can reduce its music piracy rate and enhance e-business by devising stricter laws to safeguard intellectual property, punishing violations of information and communication technology related laws more strictly, allowing more free trade with other countries, inspiring attitudinal changes about inappropriate copying behavior through awareness campaigns, and encouraging increased and secure broadband usage.

AB  - In this paper, a hardware architecture of real-time dynamic data collection is designed, and the method of direct motion control based on the feedback data is used to realize the automatic berthing of the ship. In this method, a ship-based microwave radar array is used to detect the relative position, attitude of the ship and distance from the berth shoreline. According to the precise definition of ship berthing state, an automatic berthing method composed of upper scheduling and lower control is proposed. The results of real ship experiments show that the method is feasible and practical.

AB  - Surveys often ask respondents how information or events changed their attitudes. Does [information X] make you more or less supportive of [policy Y]? Does [scandal X] make you more or less likely to vote for [politician Y]? We show that this type of question (the change format) exhibits poor measurement properties, in large part because subjects engage in response substitution. When asked how their attitudes changed, people often report the level of their attitudes rather than the change in them. As an alternative, we propose the counterfactual format, which asks subjects what their attitude would have been in the counterfactual world in which they did not know the treatment information. Using a series of experiments embedded in four studies, we show that the counterfactual format greatly reduces bias relative to the change format.

AB  - Recently, interest in aggregate and population-level implicit and explicit attitudes has opened inquiry into how attitudes relate to sociopolitical phenomenon. This creates an opportunity to examine social movements as dynamic forces with the potential to generate widespread, lasting attitude change. Although collective action remains underexplored as a means of reducing bias, we advance historical and theoretical justifications for doing so. We review recent studies of aggregate attitudes through the lens of social movement theory, proposing movements as a parsimonious explanation for observed patterns. We outline a model for conceptualizing causal pathways between social movements and implicit and explicit attitudes among participants, supporters, bystanders, and opponents. We identify six categories of mechanisms through which movements may transform attitudes: changing society; media representations; intergroup contact and affiliation; empathy, perspective-taking, and reduced intergroup anxiety; social recategorization; and social identification and self-efficacy processes. Generative questions, testable hypotheses, and promising methods for future work are discussed.

AB  - This study examined the effects of semi-fictional biographical political films on political learning and attitude change in audiences of fictionalized accounts of female politicians. Data from 310 participants indicated that content-related political learning significantly increased and attitude toward female politicians positively changed after exposure. A conceptual model of the political entertainment effects indicated that initial political learning transported the audience into the biographical narrative, which led to greater enjoyment, as well as learning gain and a positive attitude toward female politicians. Our findings provide important clarification to existing research and offer both theoretical, methodological, and practical implications.

AB  - How does exposure to terrorism affect political attitudes? This paper presents a new individual-level psychobiological model of political attitudes. Using a unique individual-level data of personal exposure to terrorism, a physiological marker of inflammation (CRP) and a psychological measure of perception of threat to an ongoing conflict-the Israel-Palestinian Conflict-we assess the effect of personal exposure to terrorism on militant attitudes concerning the conflict. Our data of physiological (blood samples), psychological, and attitudinal factors were collected in Israel during a military escalation along the Gaza Strip border. The findings reveal that among people personally exposed to terrorism, the perception of threat mediates an association between physiological conditions and militant attitudes. These findings contribute to the emerging literature on the biopolitics of political violence, suggesting a renewed focus on the dynamic interplay between physiological, psychological, and political factors.

AB  - This article seeks to explore how the reading matter in a monthly magazine may have influenced its readers' views of race relations during the first half of the 20(th) century. The South African Lady's Pictorial and Home Journal (1910-1940) claimed to be the first leading women's magazine to circulate throughout the four provinces of the Union of South Africa. It also had readers in the major centres of Rhodesia, South West Africa, Mozambique and the Congo. Its target market was white, English speaking-women who, at the time, formed a community of readers with still strong ties to 'home' and, as the years went by, were attempting to work out what it meant to be South African. The magazine reflects and may have influenced its readers' changing views on their position as English South Africans in relation to the other races, both in this country and globally, through informative articles, reader correspondence, short stories and book reviews.

AB  - Gender disparity in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in higher education is a matter of concern across the world. Expansion of the higher education sector in the early twenty-first century in India has enabled to bring attitudinal changes in Indian families especially towards females' STEM higher education. The present study aims to understand the trend in gender parity in STEM disciplines at various levels of higher education in India through All India Survey on Higher Education, Government of India (2010-2011 to 2018-2019). The study uses the Gender Parity Index (GPI) method to calculate the status of female in STEM higher education. The results show that there is gender parity in overall disciplines at under-graduation, post-graduation, and M.Phil. levels. In STEM disciplines, enrolment of female is higher than male in biological sciences at all levels, but physical sciences show lower enrolment of female. Computer engineering, information technology, and electronics engineering have shown improvement in enrolment of female within the engineering and technology category. Gender parity is poor in mechanical engineering, civil engineering, and electrical engineering at all levels of higher education. The complex and multi-layered gender relations in wider society impact females' access to STEM higher education and employment.

AB  - Academic social networking sites (ASNS) are trending in academics and play a significant role in disseminating knowledge. The study aims to explore the usage of ASNS by the faculty members and researchers of NIFT Centers across India. An online questionnaire method used to collect the primary data from 17 NIFT Centers. According to the results of the data analysis, the majority of respondents were aware of and utilised academic social networking sites (ASNS) in NIFT Centers. Google Scholar achieved the highest level of awareness and usage (34.98 %), followed by ResearchGate (27.09 %), Linkedin (18.23 %), and Academia.edu (17.24 %). The findings indicate that faculty members and researchers use ASNS primarily to access freely available millions of research papers, slightly less for communicating in a new way with researchers, and very rarely for increasing citations of research papers. Finally, the results reveal a positive attitude towards using famous academic social networking sites. NIFT should organise workshops and seminars on ASNS platforms to raise awareness and visibility of their research.

AB  - Reduced counterarguing - the generation of questions and arguments in response to a message - has been proposed to be a mechanism of persuasion in a variety of contexts, yet many questions remain unanswered regarding the factors that influence this process. Building upon past theorizing in narrative persuasion, this present work investigates whether signaling of persuasive intent (signaling vs. no signaling) and the fictional presentation of texts (fact vs. fiction) decrease counterarguing and, in turn, increase persuasion. Using a 2 x 2 factorial design across four topics at three time points, hypotheses were tested with narratives regarding four controversial political issues, presented either with or without signaling of persuasive intent and in either a news or short fiction format. The online experiment demonstrated that the narratives impacted political attitudes, even when captured in a later follow-up session. However, neither persuasive signaling nor fictional presentation influenced counterarguing or the extent of attitude change, captured both immediately after narrative exposure and again in a follow-up survey two days later.

AB  - How and why does protest shape participants' attitudes? We study this issue using panel data gathered both before and after Ukraine's Euromaidan protests. We argue that frames play a key role in this process. We find that protest participation increased alignment of protesters' policy preferences with the main protest frames by stabilizing existing attitudes that were in alignment and changing attitudes that conflicted with the dominant frame. Attitudes on core protest issues also became more coherent. We find no comparable effects for issues less central to the protests, and all effects vary as the framing and protest environment changed. In addition, we examine the mechanisms of attitude change, showing that while protesters also experience significant increases in efficacy, interest, and participation, these changes only partly explain attitudinal changes. These findings speak to both the short- and long-term mechanisms by which protest participation can shape public opinion.

AB  - Using an original Python program, we extracted data from the 2014 #Ferguson Twitterstorm to explore contextual predictors of digital activism. Through content analysis we identify whether tweets related to police conduct, race relations, and perceptions of justice were influenced by local arrest rates and economic inequality. Instead, results suggest that race and partisanship drove much of the digital protest behavior. Negative perceptions of justice and police conduct largely originated from within Democratic-leaning communities and areas with larger African American populations. We speculate that deeper social grievances surfaced in the Ferguson case, causing the digital conversation to become both racialized and politicized.

AB  - Purpose Social distancing is an important strategy to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, so it is imperative to understand the behavioral impact of social distancing on individuals. This research studied social distancing from a cognitive appraisal of voluntary social distancing compliance (CAVSD) point of view and a non-medical perspective, specifically the psychological impact (PI) of social distancing on the usage intensity of social networking sites (SNS) during the COVID-19 outbreak in India. Design/methodology/approach The study was conducted on 477 SNS users as a full sample and groups based on age, sex and work status. The model was empirically investigated using structural equation modeling. Findings CAVSD was negatively associated with PI although it was not a significant predictor, while CAVSD and PI were significant predictors of SNS usage intensity; moreover, SNS usage intensity differed between groups of people. Practical implications These findings are significant for organizations, corporations and educational institutions in both the public and private sectors. There is a need to identify subsections of individuals in need of social support and relief from isolation and loneliness. Individuals are relying on social media to handle social distancing and the pandemic, and this shows up in an increase in social networking activity. Originality/value This study contributes to the existing literature by positing social networking as a basic virtual need for socialization, and social media platform assists in that. Cognitive appraisal is an important determinant of individual response.

AB  - This article explains political activism among educated youths in Bangladesh and how information and communication technologies ( ICTs) change their political attitudes and behaviors. The findings identify motivations and psychological factors that affect patterns of new media use in political participation. Data from 23 interviewees, alongside those of 69 focus group participants, reveal that Bangladeshi youths increasingly favor forward-looking agendas by rejecting traditional ideology-based party politics. They have a passion for shaping their opinions through social networking instead of processions, party meetings, and political violence. This study finds that youth engagement through virtual communication has no direct impact on political decision-making but may play a pivotal role in some policy-making processes in Bangladesh.

Through a survey-experiment of news consumers (N = 767) over a three-day period in mid-March 2020, this study shows that citizens had positive attitudes toward their own Covid-19 news sources, but were critical about the news sources others were using to get information about the virus. Data reveal evidence of presumed media influence, where audiences believed others' health behaviors were being influenced by pandemic news.

AB  - Racial resentment (also known as symbolic racism) is among the most widely tested measures of contemporary prejudice in political science and social psychological research over the past thirty years. Proponents argue that racial resentment reflects anti-black emotion obtained through pre-adult socialization. In light of affect-based models of substance use, this paper examined the association between racial resentment and smoking in a national sample of non-Hispanic white, black, and Hispanic respondents. Data come from the 2012 American National Election Study, which contained two measures of smoking. The results of ordinal logistic regression models indicate a positive association between racial resentment and smoking among non-Hispanic whites (N = 2133) that is not present among blacks (N = 693) or Hispanics (N = 660). Models controlled for age, education, income, gender, political ideology, region, and mode of interview. Furthermore, analyses indicated that a measure of race-related affect, admiration and sympathy towards blacks, partially mediated the association between racial resentment and smoking. For non-Hispanic whites, racial resentment appears to constitute a risk factor for smoking. Future studies should further specify the conditions linking substance use to the race-related affective component of racial resentment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective In this article, we explore the seldom studied concept of "distant participation," defined as the experience of social movements (such as receiving information from online media) from overseas. Online media may affect people's political attitudes, but how people use online media is also contingent upon their political attitudes. Method We take advantage of a natural experiment to deal with this endogenous selection problem. Our treatment group consists of college students who happened to join a short-term overseas exchange program during the Umbrella Movement, which had an unexpectedly large turnout in Hong Kong. These students had a different mode of participation in the event from their peers physically in Hong Kong. The experience, including intensive exposure to online media, changed their media consumption habits, and hence their political attitudes. Results We find that the treatment group is more likely to report using online media to obtain news. They also have a stronger sense of political efficacy and significantly weaker national identity. We, however, find no significant difference between the treatment and control groups regarding civic and political participation. Conclusion This study provides a rare contribution to the study of the effect of online media by tackling the problem of selection. The concept of distant participation should also be given more attention given the ease of population flow and technological advancement nowadays.

AB  - While the political influence of the Internet, especially social media, on people's attitude toward their governments has been widely discussed in western democracies, the situation in authoritarian regimes such as China has not yet been adequately addressed. The current Chinese administration considers social media the main battlefield for public opinion struggle' between the official discourse and those challenging it. To provide clues about who is shaping the public opinion, this study examined how consuming news from competing information sources on social media influences Chinese citizens' satisfaction with the central and local government. Based on a nationally representative survey of 2,882 Chinese adults, the study found that consuming news from governmental sources on the country's major social media platforms - Weibo and WeChat - was positively associated with citizens' satisfaction with the central government, while exposure to alternative news sources on WeChat had a negative impact on both central and local government satisfaction. Additionally, news consumption from mainstream media sources on social media did not significantly influence the public's government satisfaction. This paper contributes to the current literature by revealing that social media do not provide a unified agenda and by emphasizing the impact of platform affordances on people's political attitudes.

AB  - Social networking sites (SNS) are extremely popular for providing users with an efficient platform for acquiring social links. We experimentally explored whether priming with SNS would interfere with perceptions of social exclusion experiences. Experiment 1, involving 96 undergraduate Facebook users, demonstrated that priming with SNS was associated with decreased distress experienced in an online virtual ball-tossing game (the exclusionary Cyberball). Felt relatedness mediated the link between SNS primes and reduced social distress. Experiment 2, involving 88 current users of Facebook, showed that thoughts of losing SNS intensified distress caused by social exclusion, suggesting that the loss of SNS appears to signify the loss of a potential source of social reconnection. Moreover, the magnifying effect of SNS' unavailability on the distress associated with social exclusion was more prominent for heavy users. This research provides the first demonstration that SNS (or the loss thereof) can neutralize (augment) perceived distress related to social exclusion. Our findings indicate that online social networking may more profoundly influence how users experience social exclusion in the information age than previously believed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose - Economic adversity, geopolitical, and climate crises leading to the lack of decent and sustainable work are resulting in growing and diverse migratory movements. The precarious situation of many migrant workers in their countries of employment results in a state of social exclusion due to a lack of access to relevant information sources. The purpose of this paper is to further the understanding of the information behavior of migrants by examining the role that La Escuelita, a Hebrew night school for domestic migrant workers in Israel, plays as an information ground helping migrants struggling with social exclusion.
   Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative methodology was used and data were collected using participation observation over a three-months period. Eight students at the school were interviewed using in-depth interviews.
   Findings - La Escuelita served as a vehicle for social inclusion by providing valuable everyday information to the students in a caring environment. Information was shared in multiple directions between both the staff and the students and between the students. Language barriers were revealed as one of the main factors for social exclusion. Findings revealed that although the migrant workers who study at La Escuelita are information poor regarding their struggle for social inclusion into Israeli society, they wish to learn Hebrew as a way to overcome this exclusion.
   Originality/value - Understanding the information behavior of marginalized populations is the first step into designing and implementing information services to help them toward social inclusion. This research presents an innovative contribution by examining the significance and roles of social connections in the setting of a unique information environment.

AB  - The pervasive involvement of information and communication technologies and computers in our daily lives influences changes of attitude toward computers. We focused on finding these ecological effects in the differences in computer attitudes as a function of gender and age. A questionnaire with 34 Likert-type items was used in our research. The sample consisted of 659 students from 14 high schools, aged 15-19 years attending the first, the second, the third, and the fourth years of study. The results of the questionnaire were divided into the two dimensions of concrete computer enjoyment and computer anxiety. On the first dimension both younger students and girls have positive attitudes. On the second dimension both younger students and boys have more positive attitudes. Overall, girls have more positive attitudes than boys. This is interesting because in the existing literature there is evidence that boys have more positive attitudes toward computers than girls. Perhaps a change is taking place.

AB  - Knowledge of students' construction and technology background is an important input to the process of designing technology-enhanced instruction. Current literature in student background is either not specific for the construction/civil engineering student population or lacks direct implications for pedagogical design. This paper presents a survey study that assesses students' self-reported technology skills and attitude, learning preferences, and baseline construction knowledge. The survey is designed as a questionnaire with three sections: demographic and background information, technology attitude and exposure, and construction-related knowledge. From the 280 data points collected, it was found that today's students are exposed to a wide range of technology applications. They had a positive attitude toward technology, were enthusiastic video-game players, and strongly preferred learning activities that involved interactions, whether these interactions were face-to-face or mediated by technology. These findings suggest that technology-assisted learning would excite and engage students. The paper also provides a discussion on specific pedagogical design implications of the findings and ways in which these could be incorporated in the design of technology-enhanced learning tools.

AB  - There is widespread consensus that internships provide great opportunities for engineering students to develop diverse knowledge and competencies. Yet, compared to learning in the classroom, learning in the workplace is less predictable. This study aims to address the research question 'What are engineering students' perceived learning outcomes from their internship experience?' by using a qualitative approach to pinpoint commonalities and differences in students' perceived learning outcomes. Content analysis and constant comparative analysis were used to analyse interview data collected from ten engineering students in Hong Kong. Four categories of learning outcomes were revealed: knowledge, academic-related generic competencies, non-technical generic competencies and technical competencies. Our findings are contrary to the literature indicating that most engineering interns perceived the development of technical competencies (e.g. information technology (I.T.) skills) and non-technical generic competencies (e.g. teamwork skills and positive attitudes). Diversity in engineering students' perceived learning outcomes of internship was subsequently illustrated by a provisional framework. The findings help pave the way for constructive alignment in internship course design such that identification of students' perceived learning outcomes will facilitate the setting of realistic and clear intended learning outcomes.

AB  - Objectives. Racial disparities in late-life cognition persist even after accounting for educational attainment. We examined whether early-life educational quality and literacy in later life help explain these disparities.
   Method. We used longitudinal data from the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP). Educational quality (percent white students; urban/rural school; combined grades in classroom) was operationalized using canonical correlation analysis. Late-life literacy (reading comprehension and ability, writing) was operationalized using confirmatory factor analysis. We examined whether these factors attenuated race-related differences in late-life cognition.
   Results. The sample consisted of 1,679 U.S.-born, non-Hispanic, community-living adults aged 65-102 (71% black, 29% white; 70% women). Accounting for educational quality and literacy reduced disparities by 29% for general cognitive functioning, 26% for memory, and 32% for executive functioning but did not predict differences in rate of cognitive change.
   Discussion. Early-life educational quality and literacy in late life explain a substantial portion of race-related disparities in late-life cognitive function.

AB  - Widespread adoption of clean cooking fuels is a necessary step toward reducing household air pollution and improving population health. Here we use large-scale surveys (10,000 households) from two Indian states, Kerala and Rajasthan, to examine how education and attitudes toward cooking associate with the adoption of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), India's most popular clean cooking fuel. We report three main results. First, education is a strong predictor of LPG adoption. Second, perceptions that LPG is good and affordable and progressive health-related perceptions are associated with LPG ownership. Third, and surprisingly, education does not predict positive attitudes toward clean cooking fuels. These results suggest that education leads to LPG adoption, but not through attitudinal changes. Further research should examine the mediators of the robust observed education-adoption association. (C) 2019 International Energy Initiative. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Substantial efforts devoted to decreasing the burden of transport-related injuries (TRIs) in Canada, including public awareness campaigns aiming to influence attitudes and behaviors, may lead the public to perceive other types of injuries differently. This study examined the relationship between public perception of the preventability of injuries and the type of injury (TRIs vs. non-transport unintentional injuries (NTUIs)); and assessed whether exposure to a social marketing campaign (Preventable) influenced this association. A cross-sectional study design employed survey data collected by Preventable between 2015 and 2016 from 1501 British Columbians aged 25-54 years. A multiple linear regression model was applied to examine the relationship between the type of injury (TRIs vs. NTUIs) and attitudes towards preventability, controlling for socio-demographic variables. Exposure to the campaign was tested as an effect modifier. On a scale from 1 to 10, respondents perceived TRIs to be 1.08 points more preventable than NTUIs (95% CI: 1.00 to 1.16, p-value < 0.0001). Campaign-exposed participants scored 0.31 points higher on preventability of injuries overall (95% CI: 0.16 to 0.47, p-value < 0.0001); and recorded a smaller difference between the perceived preventability of TRIs and NTUIs, relative to those not exposed to the campaign (B=-0.163, 95% CI: -0.28 to -0.04, p-value=0.008). While respondents believed that most injuries are preventable, exposure to considerable road traffic interventions in Canada may have influenced public attitudes towards a higher perceived preventability of TRIs. Social marketing may be a useful tool to emphasize the preventability of all injuries to further reduce their burden in Canada.

AB  - Crises are inevitable for any company, and the fate of a company's image rests in how well they are responded to. Few studies have experimentally tested the impact that common types of company responses can have on consumers' perceptions when a negative complaint has been made online. This research sought to expand the strategies put forth for crisis management by image restoration theory (IRT) using best practice research within the context of social mediated crisis communication. An online experiment examined the effect of a company's response to an online complaint (i.e., professional apology, personal apology, deleting the comment, ignoring the comment, control group) on participants' perceptions of the company (i.e., perceptions of company caring, attitude). The potential for perceptions of company caring to mediate the relationship between these expanded strategies and IRT's ultimate aim of attitude change was also tested. An apology, whether professional or personal, improved participants' perceptions compared to deleting or ignoring the complaint. Caring significantly mediated the relationship between response strategy and participant attitude. Compared to a control group, which had no transgression, ignoring or deleting the complaint led to negative attitudes about the company, while responding to the complaint with a personal or professional apology led to positive attitudes about the company via perceptions of company caring. Results indicate that online complaints could also be seen as opportunities to improve a company's image, as attitudes toward the company were highest when a transgression occurred and was responded to positively, compared to not having the transgression take place at all (i.e., control condition). Potential extensions to current image repair strategies in the social media environment are discussed.

AB  - Following from a public lecture at City University London, the articles discuss the interface between creativity, urban transformation, precariousness and social networking. This introduction places the lecture within the framework of North-South academic exchanges and in relation to how Latin American cities are responding to the rise of the creative economy in urban policy development. The main article, written by Nestor Garcia Canclini, provides the foundation for an anthropology of precariousness and creativity in the context of globalised urban discontent and the transformation of space through information technologies. Voicing classical cultural studies concerns about identities, economy, global imaginaries and political resistance, he examines the strategies and networks that young creative producers, cultural entrepreneurs and artists use to navigate contradictory transnational processes. The article offers a renewed critical perspective into creative urbanism, connecting local cultural practices with global processes of neoliberal economic restructuring, urban violence and social exclusion. In doing so, it delineates the possibilities for an emancipatory transformation of urban space in times of increasing uncertainty.

AB  - Purpose - Consumers increasingly depend on the internet as the information source to make their hospitality decisions, which highlights the need for more research in online recommendation. Due to the globalization, culture and its effects on marketing become an increasingly important subject to investigate. Therefore, this paper aims to offer a cross-cultural investigation of consumers' different trustworthiness and credibility perceptions when facing online recommendations from different information resources.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research uses the source-credibility theory to examine consumers' responses to online recommendations from two sources. Participants were recruited from two equivalent marketing panels in each culture. A 2 (online recommendation source: in-group vs out-group) by 2 (culture: American vs Chinese) between-subjects quasi-experiment was conducted to test the hypotheses.
   Findings - The results demonstrate that culture moderates consumer responses to the two types of online sources. Chinese consumers, due to their more collectivist nature, exhibit higher levels of purchase intent when the recommendation originates from an in-group rather than from an out-group. Such differences are not observed among the more individualist American consumers. Furthermore, trustworthiness plays an important role in influencing Chinese consumers' perception of recommendation credibility and the consequent purchase intent.
   Practical implications - This research provides guidelines to hospitality practitioners when developing their social networking sites and online marketing strategies across different cultures.
   Originality/value - The current study conducts an in-depth investigation of cultural differences in consumers' perceptions of and reactions to online recommendations from other customers with various social distances.

AB  - This research explores how strength of network ties, as fostered by the use of a social network site, Facebook, (a) influences alumni attitudes toward volunteering for and making charitable gifts to their alma mater, and (b) fortifies consistency between attitude and behavior. After exploratory interviews and participant observation, a survey of 3,085 alumni was conducted for hypothesis testing. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed: First, active participation in Facebook groups positively predicted strength of network ties along 2 dimensions: frequency of communication and emotional closeness. Second, both dimensions of tie strength influenced actual behavior, albeit via different routes. The paper also contributes to attitude change research in showing that strength of network ties can help ensure consistencies between attitude and behavior.

AB  - Several studies have reported a relation between race-related stressors and the poor health of Black Americans. Such findings raise questions regarding the mediating biological mechanisms that might account for this link. The present study investigated elevated systemic inflammation, a factor shown to be a strong predictor of chronic illness and mortality in all ethnic populations, as a possible factor. Using 7 waves of data from the Family and Community Health Study, collected over a 20-year period from over 400 Black Americans, we investigated the extent to which exposure to discrimination and segregation at various points in the life course predicted adult inflammation at age 28. Our analyses examined whether cumulative stress, stress generation, or predictive adaptive response (PAR) models best accounted for any associations that existed between these race-related stressors and adult inflammation. At every wave of data collection, assessments of discrimination and segregation were related to adult inflammation. However, multivariate analyses using structure equation modeling indicated that the PAR model best explained the effect of these race-related stressors on inflammation. Exposure to discrimination and segregation during the juvenile years predicted adult inflammation and amplified the inflammatory effect of adult exposure to these race-related stressors. These effects were considerably more robust than that of traditional health risk factors such as diet, exercise, smoking, and low SES. Implications of these findings are discussed, including the limitations of the widely accepted risk factor approach to increasing the health of Black Americans.

AB  - COVID-19 has given rise to a surge in the number of policy instruments used to deal with the pandemic at different levels of governments globally. While much attention has been placed on travel bans, lockdown, social distancing, and economic stimulus packages, government dissemination of epidemic information as a policy instrument has received less attention. Based on 14,637 news items collected from the portals of 79 municipal governments in China, this study aims to 1) conduct a content analysis of news items and construct three key attributes of governments' practices of epidemic information dissemination, namely, comprehensiveness, responsiveness, and the protection of privacy, and 2) study the patterns and determinants of the dissemination of epidemic information. Our results show that these cities vary substantially in how they disseminate statistical data and information on individual cases of COVID-19 infections within their localities, which are shaped by government performance in open data, severity of the pandemic, cities' administrative level, population, and health sector capacities. The findings generate theoretical and policy implications for government dissemination of epidemic information.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to apply cultivation theory to social network sites by investigating how Facebook uses cultivates users' ethnic diversity perceptions and attitudes. Design/methodology/approach The authors' investigations include an online and offline survey study with 476 Facebook users and a follow-up experiment with 75 individuals. Findings The authors provide empirical support that Facebook use cultivates ethnic diversity perceptions and ethnic diversity-related attitudes. They show that Facebook use relates to perceptions of ethnic minorities that resemble the world on Facebook that is characterized by high ethnic diversity. The authors further demonstrate that the cultivation of ethnic diversity-related attitudes is mediated by diversity perceptions related to users' close social environment. Research limitations/implications Future research should consider culturally and educationally diverse samples as well as longitudinal research designs to address external validity and causality issues. Practical implications Algorithms determining the content users are exposed should be thoughtfully curated to avoid attitudinal and ideological polarization. Social implications Facebook can play an important role in positively shaping intergroup relations, thereby countering negative outgroup attitudes, social anxieties and radical right-wing parties. Originality/value The authors' studies extend the scope of cultivation research by identifying a new media vehicle as a source of cultivation influences and shed light on the cultivation-based process of attitude change on social network sites.

AB  - The aim of this work is to analyze three political attitudes: internal efficacy, external efficacy, and political interest, as variables that can explain people's disaffection. We aim to determine the impact of short-term and sociodemographic variables on these three political attitudes in the context of Chile. A survey, carried out by GFK-Adimark between March 3, 2016 and April 6, 2016, was used to answer our main research questions. In the survey, 1,651 inhabitants participated from the Chilean region of Valparaiso. Using this data, a hierarchical multivariate analysis was used for each attitude studied. In these terms, our results suggest that education and previous participation explain internal efficacy and political interest, but not external efficacy. Additionally, gender explains the perception of self-competence but not political interest. On the other hand, the perception of corruption is not related to any of the three political attitudes analyzed. These results are in line with the idea that political attitudes are stable variables not related to short-term variables. Although political malaise is usually studied by scholars, their work is normally considered under the conditions of a consolidated systems. In this framework, the Chilean data presented is going to help us understand the behavior of political attitudes in new democracies.

AB  - The 2008-2009 worldwide economic crisis serves as a backdrop to this study of the dynamics of citizens' economic expectations. Economic expectations are identified as crucial for a range of political attitudes. This study is the first to consider how information affects evaluations in times of a severe crisis, as prior research of information effects on economic evaluations took place in more stable economic times. It links citizens' news exposure and the content of economic news coverage with changes in prospective economic assessments. Drawing on a three-wave panel study and on a media content analysis between the panel waves, we thus provide a dynamic assessment of media influences on changes in economic evaluations. The results demonstrate that media exposure strongly affected expectations regarding the future development of the national economic situation, while being largely unrelated to personal economic expectations. We furthermore show that media dependency increases the magnitude of the media effect. We discuss the disconnect between personal and national economic evaluations with regard to mass-mediated economic information.

AB  - Background. Prior research shows between-race differences in women's knowledge and emotions related to having dense breasts, thus suggesting that between-race differences in behavioral decision-making following receipt of breast density (BD) notifications are likely. Guided by the theory of planned behavior, this study examined differences in emotion-related responses (i.e., anxiety, worry, confusion) and behavioral cognition (e.g., intentions, behavioral attitudes) following receipt of BD notifications among African American (AA) and European American (EA) women. This study also examined whether race-related perceptions (i.e., discrimination, group-based medical mistrust), relevant knowledge and socioeconomic status (SES) explained the between race differences.
   Method: Michigan women (N = 457) who presented for routine screening mammogram and had dense breasts, no prior breast cancer diagnoses, and had screen-negative mammograms were recruited from July, 2015 to March 2016. MANOVA was used to examine between race differences in psychological responses (i.e., emotional responses and behavioral cognition), and a multi-group structural regression model was used to examine whether race-related constructs, knowledge and SES mediated the effect of race on emotional responses and behavioral cognition. Prior awareness of BD was accounted for in all analyses.
   Results: AA women generally reported more negative psychological responses to receiving BD notifications regardless of prior BD awareness. AA women had more favorable perceptions related to talking to their physicians about the BD notifications. Generally, race-related perceptions, SES, and related knowledge partially accounted for the effect of race on psychological response. Race-related perceptions and SES partially accounted for the differences in behavioral intentions. Between-race differences in emotional responses to BD notifications did not explain differences in women's intentions to discuss BD notifications with their physicians.
   Conclusions: Future examinations are warranted to examine whether there are between-race differences in actual post-BD notification behaviors and whether similar race-related variables account for differences.

AB  - Past communication mediation studies have shown positive relationships between news uses and citizens' political attitudes, but understanding the mechanisms underlying the relationship is limited because they often do not take into account the diverse affordances of the media uses and the environment it triggers effects. Using a national Afrobarometer survey (N = 2,400) in Ghana, the present study examined the relationship between news uses and a variety of citizens' political attitudes and how such relationships are affected by partisanship. Based on a series of regression analysis, findings showed that online news uses consistently predicted all levels of citizens' political attitudes while traditional news uses were only associated with citizens' levels of presidential trust and confidence. When partisan differences were further examined, results showed that only online media uses by ruling party members exhibited direct effects on trust in president and democratic satisfaction. However, in all, traditional media news uses based on ruling party support and no party members exhibited indirect effects on political attitudes. Oppositional party members showed no effect.

AB  - In recent years, the rapid advancement of information technology has had a great impact on our daily life and changed the world in which we operate; in particular, mobile devices have become more portable and powerful than ever. As a result, mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) and ubiquitous learning have been widely adopted in a variety of studies. However, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of teaching English for specific purposes (ESP), i.e., the Business Language Testing Service (BULATS) for college students in a language laboratory and through the mobile LINE app. A total of 72 college students were randomly assigned to two groups, a language lab group and a mobile learning group, for 10 weeks of instruction. The findings revealed that the students in the mobile learning group had significantly positive attitudes toward the teaching method and learning content and high user satisfaction. In addition, the learning performance of the students in the mobile learning group was better than that in the language lab group.

AB  - A common challenge facing public health practitioners and social marketers is how best to frame and present benefit-risk information in campaigns that aim to change perceptions and increase acceptance of health recommendations, such as vaccinations. Given that public service advertisements and brand promises are often core components of social marketing and health communication efforts, this study examined whether, and how, framing and the use of text or image support to convey influenza vaccination brand promises affected college-attending young adults' beliefs and intentions regarding influenza vaccination. PSAs that varied with respect to gain or loss frame and type of support provided (i.e., image vs. text-supported) were used as the stimulus material. The findings indicated two pairings performed equally well with respect to the outcome measures used. A gain-framed image-supported PSA and a loss-framed text-supported PSA were both associated with the highest levels of positive affect toward the PSA, positive attitude toward flu vaccination, flu vaccination confidence, and flu vaccination intention. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of assessing both the framing used in social marketing or health communication materials and the approach used to support the framing. It is likely that the effectiveness of framing is affected by the visuals and text used to reinforce the brand promise conveyed by the framing, irrespective of whether it is positive or negative.

AB  - Objective: A significant body of research has examined the psychological harm of exposure to collective traumas such as disasters (e.g., tornados, hurricanes, mass violence). Less well studied are the mental health effects of exposure to macro-level race-related traumas, such as instances of police violence toward African Americans and subsequent civil unrest that are widely covered by traditional and social media. Method: This study examined posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms in a sample of 936 Black and white residents of the St. Louis, MO, metropolitan statistical area surveyed following the August 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown and subsequent civil unrest in Ferguson, MO. We used structural equation modeling to examine direct, indirect, and conditional relationships among race, protest engagement, media use, and resilience on PTS symptoms. Results: Race and protest engagement were directly associated with PTS symptoms, whereas media exposure was indirectly associated with PTS through protest engagement. Resilience had an inverse relationship with PTS symptoms. Conclusion: Our results suggest that social workers should provide mental health resources and interventions for community members experiencing macro-level race-related events and work to address racial injustices that compound trauma and increase risks for posttraumatic difficulties.

AB  - The authors investigated the effects of reading different types of online comments about a company on people's attitude change based on individual's prior attitude toward the company. Based on Social Judgment Theory, several hypotheses were tested. The results showed that the effects of online comments interact with individuals' prior attitudes toward a corporation. People with a strong negative attitude toward a corporation were less influenced by other's online comments than people with a neutral attitude in general. However, people with a prior negative attitude were more affected by refutational two-sided comments than one-sided comments. The results suggest that the effects of user generated content should be studied in a holistic manner, not only by investigating the effects of online content itself, but also by examining how others' responses to the content shape or change individuals' attitudes based on their prior attitudes.

AB  - Can conspiracy theories be a source of social stigma? If it is true, it would follow that people may expect to be socially excluded when they express endorsement of conspiracy theories. This effect should be partially explained by the knowledge of the negative perceptions associated with conspiracy theories. In Study 1, inducing French internet users to write a text endorsing (vs. criticizing) conspiracy theories about the Charlie Hebdo shooting, led them to anticipate fear of social exclusion. This effect was mediated by anticipated negative evaluation of the self. In Study 2, inducing French internet users to imagine defending (vs. criticizing) conspiracy theories about the Charlie Hebdo shooting in front of an audience led them to anticipate fear of social exclusion. The effect was again mediated by anticipated negative evaluation of the self. To conclude, our findings demonstrate that conspiracy theories can be viewed as a source of social stigma.

AB  - Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are increasingly important for people with disabilities (PWDs), suggesting digital inclusion as a possible social mechanism against the social exclusion of disability. This study suggests a more complicated relationship between ICTs and disability. Situated in a Chinese context and based on research methods of ethnographic participant observation and in-depth interviews, this study explains why and how social exclusion of disability in China leads to PWDs' exodus to the Internet, where they find a possible habitat of digital and social inclusion notwithstanding the risk of more profound social exclusion. The study finally argues that the Internet habitat of PWDs is both a material enclave and a discourse heterotopia for understanding Chinese society, disability, and ICTs. In addition, future studies should further include PWDs in this field.

AB  - This paper investigates public attitudes towards privacy, data protection, surveillance and security in Croatia. The public opinion survey assesses the value privacy may have for the individuals and if privacy is recognized as a social and political value. Four principal groups of privacy violations are covered in the survey: information collection, information processing, information dissemination and invasion. Citizens' awareness of the data protection issues and related confidence in government and business practices are examined as well. Furthermore, this paper investigates if public attitudes towards surveillance in Croatia are in favor of the nothing to hide argument. Based on empirical data, the findings indicate that there are three groups of Croatian citizens with different opinions: pro-surveillance oriented citizens; citizens concerned about being surveilled; and citizens concerned about data and privacy protection. Identified groups of citizens differ in demographics. Policy implications of the research results are discussed in the paper.

AB  - BackgroundOur transition to an "information society" means that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has become integral to our lives. ICT has also become an essential aspect of medical institutions and healthcare settings. Healthcare professionals, especially nurses are required to use ICT in their daily work. In Lebanon, however, due to political factors, many universities have not introduced technology or any form of ICT in their curricula. Institutions of higher education do use technology in various ways, however, successful incorporation of ICT in education requires acceptance by instructors who are expected to use ICT in teaching practices. Although international findings reveal that ICT should be used in nursing education, some faculty members experience difficulty integrating it.MethodA mixed methodological research approach was used to investigate the attitudes of nursing teaching staff toward the use of ICT in nursing education.ResultsOur findings revealed three categories of faculty with differing attitudes to the use of ICT in teaching and learning: pioneers, faculty members who have developed positive attitudes toward ICT usage; followers, faculty members with neutral attitudes; and resisters, faculty members with negative attitudes.ConclusionsIdentification of the nursing faculty members' attitude toward ICT and the challenges faced by them contributes to the integration of ICT into nursing curricula and further development of educational practices.

AB  - To investigate the dynamics of online persuasion, this research uses the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) to determine the effects of argument quality as a central route to influence attitude change versus design and social elements as peripheral routes to attitude change. Additional to this research is an examination of change in issue involvement as a mediator between central and peripheral routes leading to attitude change. Findings from a study involving 403 participants add to our understanding of ELM concerning the role of website design and how an individual's level of issue involvement is a prerequisite to changing user attitudes.

AB  - The increased usage of digital communication technologies has transformed online engagement into a key aspect of the modern customer experience in the hospitality industry. The flow theory is especially important for understanding customer engagement in the online environment. The purpose of this study is to examine the antecedents of flow and to investigate its influence on the positive attitudes and continuance intentions among the users of social media. The study's results show that challenge, information quality, and system quality all play significant roles in flow; and flow leads to positive attitudes and continuance intentions, which indicates the importance of creating flow to increase customer engagement. Academically, this study contributes to the limited body of literature on the flow experience and customer engagement in the hospitality context. Additionally, it provides practical insights how to gain competitive advantages by strategically managing customer engagement with social media marketing through flow.

AB  - Race-related biases and discrimination and easily observable race-related characteristics, such as skin color, appear to go hand and hand, but it remains unclear how these factors work together to shape youth development. The current study addresses this gap by investigating skin color satisfaction as a mediator between perceptions of discrimination and adjustment. Data are from a cross-sectional sample of Latinx youth (N = 175; M-age = 12.86; 51.4% female; 86.9% US-born) who completed measures of foreigner-based objectification, peer discrimination, adult discrimination, self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and the importance or value attributed to academic success. Evidence of significant indirect effects of skin color satisfaction in the links between foreigner-based objectification and self-esteem as well as academic importance was found. Skin color satisfaction did not mediate links between either peer or adult discrimination and self-esteem, depression, and academic importance. The results provide support that being perceived as a foreigner has negative implications for Latinx youth adjustment through skin color satisfaction. The present study expands understanding of how different forms of differential treatment may affect minoritized youth. Implications and future research ideas are discussed.

AB  - In an era of a highly digitalized society, Australia's rural areas continue to be at a digital disadvantage. With the increasing penetration of information and communications technology (ICT) into all public and private realms, there is a need to examine the deeply rooted digital divide and how it is intertwined with issues of social exclusion in rural communities. This study focused on remoteness as an indicator of digital exclusion, and investigated its relationship with other dimensions of social exclusion. A secondary data analysis using Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) regional data revealed that remoteness was a strong predictor of home Internet and broadband connectivity, but digital divide was exacerbated by other socio-demographic factors such as educational levels and employment status. When implementing digital inclusion strategies, both supply (infrastructure) and demand (education levels, industry sector, employment opportunities, socio-demographics) factors must be considered.

AB  - Purpose - The elaboration of framing in social movement theory offers a different perspective than is typically taken in social marketing. This paper explores how social marketing may benefit from this alternate lens.
   Design/methodology/approach - The construction, features and processes associated with collective action frames in social movements are examined and explored via two social causes: obesity and disaster preparation.
   Findings - A social movement perspective on framing highlights the need to better understand variations in how groups may perceive a problem and its solutions. It suggests a range of considerations and options in constructing and participating in the development of collective action frames, which are suggested to benefit social marketing initiatives and, thus, society.
   Research limitations/implications - Further research in societal well-being and the meso-level of social change should consider adopting a social movement framing perspective. Alist of questions is provided to guide future research.
   Practical implications - Mobilising a group into action is often a necessary and effective step in realising social change. The questions raised in social movement framing will equip practitioners and researchers with greater understanding of the issue, the context and potential solutions, ultimately to encourage positive social movements and social benefit.
   Originality/value - While calls have been made for broader perspectives in social marketing, little attention has been given to social movements. This paper offers a way forward with respect to framing.

AB  - Positive attitudes toward a new communication technology tend to be a significant motivator in subsequent adoption and use. The recent spurt in the adoption of social media tools such as social networking sites (SNSs) demands the examination of attitudinal variables on motives to use these Web sites. This study explicated a multidimensional measure of attitudes toward SNSs and tested a theoretical model to examine the effect of attitudes on motives to use SNSs and SNS activity. Participants (N=674) completed a cross-sectional survey consisting of measures of attitudes toward SNSs, motives of SNS use, and level of activity. Results showed support for a revised model in which attitudinal variables-ease of use, self-disclosure, and social connection-strongly predicted motives of SNS use such as passing time, information/entertainment, social conformity, and, most importantly, socialization. The motive of using SNSs as a social tool superseded the direct effect of other motives on SNS activity, suggesting that users' primary activity on SNSs was for socialization and for relational development and maintenance.

AB  - Over the past decade, Airbnb has attracted millions of new guests to begin using its service. Diffusion theory suggests that over time different types of customers will adopt an innovation, yet no research has examined differences between Airbnb guests based on when they first began using the service. Consequently, this study compared earlier adopters, later adopters, and non-adopters of Airbnb according to a variety of behaviours and characteristics. The study is based on innovation diffusion concepts, and entailed an online survey of 1,189 US travellers. Data analysis revealed numerous differences between the adopter categories. Earlier adoption corresponded with less attraction to Airbnb's hotel-like features, higher expectations and satisfaction with Airbnb, more positive attitudes towards Airbnb, and a greater likelihood of using other non-hotel forms of travel lodging. More recent adoption corresponded with a greater likelihood of using midrange and upscale hotels. As compared to travellers who had used Airbnb, non-adopters exhibited lower novelty-seeking tendencies and innovativeness towards information technology, in addition to lower socio-economic status. Various theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - First clinical exposures are stressful situations for nursing students, especially, when practicing on the labour ward. The purpose of this study was to develop intrapartum nursing care web-based learning to facilitate students' acquisition of conceptual knowledge and performance skills. This web-based learning unit integrated the 5E-model and information technology with the lecture content. Eighty four nursing students were recruited in the study. The control group received traditional teaching, while the experimental group was supplemented with the web-based learning unit on intrapartum nursing care. The results showed that the students in the experimental group had significant higher scores in conceptual knowledge and performance skill. The students also had significant lower scores in ignorance - related stress when compared to those of the control group. The students supplemented with the web-based course showed a strong positive attitude toward the new learning method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Literature on fear-arousing communications has led to divergent conclusions. On the one hand, studies have shown that fear increases attitude change via systematic processing. On the other hand, it has been observed that arousing fear provokes defense-motivated reactions. Nevertheless, few studies have embedded measures of persuasion, information processing, and defensiveness all at once. Consequently, we conducted an experiment to assess the effects of fear-arousal on these three outcomes in order to clarify this ambiguous issue. The participants were instructed to watch a public service announcement video with two conditions of fear. Our results showed that an increase of fear generated a more positive attitude, as well as systematic processing but, surprisingly, more defensive reactions. Further analyses revealed a mediating effect of these reactions between fear and attitude. These results suggest an alternative pathway to understand the effects of fear-appeals, emphasizing the positive influence of defensive responses.

AB  - The topics and framing of news stories relevant to skin cancer prevention have shifted over time. This study examined agenda-setting effects of such news stories on public attitudes and beliefs about tanning and skin cancer. Content analysis data on 516 articles published in two major daily newspapers in Melbourne, Australia, from 1994 to 2007 were combined with circulation data to generate indices of potential news exposure. Associations between these indices and cross-sectional telephone survey data from the same period on 6,244 adults' tanning attitudes and perceived susceptibility to skin cancer were examined using logistic regression models, accounting for the temporal precedence of news content. Pro-sun protection stories on attitudes and behavior were associated with older adults not thinking a tan looks healthy. Pro-sun protection stories on solaria were associated with less preference for a deep tan among young adults who like to suntan. Stories on vitamin D that were unsupportive of or ambiguous about sun protection were associated with a number of pro-tan attitudes among younger adults. Results indicate news coverage during 1994-2007 served an important agenda-setting role in explaining the public's attitudes and beliefs about tanning and skin cancer. Vitamin D stories appeared most influential, particularly among young adults.

KW  - COMMUNICATION
AB  - BACKGROUND Despite the limited use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) in Indonesia, they have proven to be cost-effective in family planning programs. This study was aimed to identify the elements of ideas and views that people hold and their association with the use of LARC (intrauterine devices and implants) as a means of improving its utilization in Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB) Province, Indonesia.
   METHODS Data were derived from the Improving Contraceptive Mix Methods survey of 6,384 respondents in Bima District, Central Lombok, and North Lombok, NTB Province, in 2015. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to identify suitable elements of 19 variables and generate three ideation elements on attitude, knowledge, and interpersonal communication. Subsequently, the association of three ideation elements with LARC use in NTB was examined.
   RESULTS Multivariate analysis revealed that LARC use was higher among women with a positive attitude toward LARC and high frequency of interpersonal communication. Women with positive attitudes had 7 times greater odds of using LARC than women with negative attitudes (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 7.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.09-8.55). Women with a high frequency of interpersonal communication were 2.4 times more likely to use LARC than women with low communication frequency (aOR = 2.40; 95% CI = 1.94-2.99).
   CONCLUSIONS To increase the use of LARC in NTB, family planning programs should not only focus on improving women's knowledge but also prioritizing the promotion of positive attitudes toward LARC and facilitating interpersonal communication.

AB  - We examined effects of customizability technology (also known as tailoring or personalization) on political selective exposure and political attitude polarization. Our experiment showed that selective exposure mediated the relationship between customizability technology presence and political attitude polarization. We also found that user-driven customizability (technology that enables users to modify their information environment) weakened the relationship between system-driven customizability (technology that modifies users' information environment unobtrusively, without active involvement of the users) and political selective exposure. This research contributes to a better understanding of how important characteristics of today's communication environment influence political selective exposure and political attitude polarization.

AB  - Objective. To investigate the impact of COVID-19 social distancing on medical research from the perspective of postgraduate students. Methods. A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted from October 31 to November 1, 2021. A questionnaire was used to assess the impact of COVID-19 social distancing on medical research among postgraduate students. The questionnaire included basic information, medical research information, and information about social distancing measures. Participants also completed the self-made Research Work Affected Scale of Postgraduates (RWAS-P; qualitative evaluation: very mildly 0- 10; mildly 11-20; moderately 21-30; severely 31-40; very severely 41-50). Logistic regression was used to identify factors related to the impact of COVID-19 social distancing. Results. A total of 468 participants were analyzed; 95.2% of the participants adhered to social distancing measures. The median total RWAS-P score was 22. The median RWAS-P scores for earlier research data, current research projects, future research plans, paper publication, and graduation schedule were 2, 6, 6, 6, and 4, respectively (score range 0-10). The higher grade of students, experimental research, and existence of inappetence or sleeplessness were related to negative attitude towards COVID-19 social distancing (odd ratio = 6.35, 9.80, 2.31, 2.15, 1.95, respectively). Conclusions. Participants reported that social distancing had a moderate overall impact on their medical research. Social distancing had the greatest impact on current research projects, future research plans, and paper publications among postgraduate students. Higher grade level, experimental research type, inappetence, and sleeplessness were related to the impact of social distancing on their medical research.

AB  - The BBC's The British Empire (1972) and Channel Four's Empire (2003) generated significant negative comment during and after their respective broadcasts. Their topic, the British Empire, was an important reason for this, but other factors, including their approach to production and marketing, public and critical expectations, and contemporary politics, were also significant. Despite these similarities, an examination of the critical reactions to each series reveals how public attitudes changed in the 30 years between their broadcasts, to British imperialism, public service television and public discourse.

AB  - Purpose Sexual violence prevention programs on college campuses have proliferated in recent years. While research has also increased, a number of questions remain unanswered that could assist campus administrators in making evidence-based decisions about implementation of prevention efforts. To that end, the field of prevention science has highlighted the need to examine the utility of booster sessions for enhancing prevention education. The purpose of this paper is to examine how two methods of prevention delivery - small group educational workshops and a community-wide social marketing campaign (SMC) - worked separately and together to promote attitude change related to sexual violence among college students.
   Design/methodology/approach The two-part study was conducted at two universities. Participants were from successive cohorts of first year students and randomly assigned to participate in a bystander based in-person sexual violence prevention program or a control group. Participants were later exposed to a bystander based sexual violence prevention SMC either before or after a follow-up survey. Analyses investigated if attitudes varied by exposure group (program only, SMC only, both program and SMC, no prevention exposure).
   Findings Results revealed benefits of the SMC as a booster for attitude changes related to being an active bystander to prevent sexual violence. Further, students who first participated in the program showed enhanced attitude effects related to the SMC.
   Originality/value This is the first study to look at the combination of effects of different sexual violence prevention tools on student attitudes. It also showcases a method for how to investigate if prevention tools work separately and together.

AB  - In this study, we examined whether young people's help-seeking intentions and beliefs about the helpfulness of various sources of help are influenced by their own, and their parents' stigmatising attitudes towards young people with mental disorders.
   A national telephone survey was conducted with 3,746 Australians aged 12-25 years and 2,005 of their parents. Stigmatising attitudes, help-seeking intentions, and perceived helpfulness of various sources of help were assessed in relation to four vignettes of a young person with a mental disorder (psychosis, depression, depression with alcohol misuse or social phobia).
   Unlike 'stigma perceived in others', the 'weak-not-sick', 'social distance' and 'dangerous/unpredictable' dimensions of young people's stigma were associated with both help-seeking intentions and helpfulness beliefs about various sources of help. Attributing mental disorder to a personal weakness rather than an illness was associated with less intention to seek help from a doctor and less positive beliefs about professional sources (including doctors, counsellors, and psychologists). In contrast, young adults aged 18-25 years who perceived the vignette character as more dangerous or unpredictable had greater intention to seek help from a psychiatrist and a helpline, and more positive beliefs about psychiatrists. Greater social distance was associated with less intention to seek help from informal sources and less positive beliefs about these sources. No consistent pattern of associations was found for parent stigma.
   The findings suggest that different dimensions of youth stigma differentially influence help-seeking intentions and beliefs about the helpfulness of different sources of help.

AB  - Many ecosystems are facing environmental threats. Some of the main concerns are now focused in developing countries. Strong environmental messages by numerous stakeholders have led to varied responses on environmental issues. Companies, governmental agencies and NGOs are responding to such issues by developing campaigns to promote sustainable practices amongst key stakeholders. Green advertising is one important form of communications employed to elicit environmentally friendly attitudes and consequently promote behavioural change. This study analyses the effect of a sponsored cinematographic green advertising strategy by a NGO and a major supermarket chain in a Latin American country. Based on in-depth interviews with Colombian movie audiences, this investigation demonstrates how (1) a movie focused on nationalistic identification can effectively provoke positive attitude change toward environmental sustainable practices, (2) the movie's media format can heighten audience interest about adopting environmental sustainable practices and (3) these results benefit positively the two movie sponsors through association and affect transfer.

AB  - Background: The devastating impact of the current opioid overdose crisis has led to new involvement of law enforcement officers. Training programs have focused on overdose recognition and response without targeting core attitudinal change by covering addiction or harm reduction principles.
   Objectives: This study examined the impact of a comprehensive overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) training on officers' attitudes toward overdose victims, knowledge of and competence to respond to an opioid overdose, and concerns about using naloxone. The training included the common information about overdose recognition and response, with added components covering broader content about addiction and harm reduction principles and philosophies.
   Methods: A total of 787 (83% male) officers were administered surveys before and after attending a 2.5-3 hour comprehensive OEND training. Survey items measured overdose-related knowledge and attitudes, including attitudes about people who use drugs and who overdose.
   Results: Following the training, participants' overdose-related knowledge and perceived competence to use naloxone improved. However, there were more nuanced changes in attitudes toward overdose victims: though 55.3% of officers reported more positive post-training attitudes, 31% reported more negative attitudes, and 13.7% reported no attitudinal change. Younger officers were most likely to report worsened attitudes. Improvements in attitudes toward overdose victims were associated with reductions in both naloxone-related concerns and risk compensation beliefs.
   Conclusions: Despite a comprehensive OEND training that addressed addiction and harm reduction and directly targeted hypothesized drivers of negative attitudes (e.g., risk compensation beliefs), some officers' attitudes worsened after the training. Randomized experiments of different training approaches would elucidate the mediators and moderators underlying these unexpected responses.

AB  - One population that shares both similar and different characteristics with traditional college-age students is the U.S. Military. Similarities include a high concentration of 18- to 26-year-olds dealing with new found independence, peer pressure, and the presence of social norms that support violence and hypermasculinity. Sexual violence is a major public health problem in the United States, and because of the similarities in the age group of college and military populations, the problems regarding sexual violence in both constituencies have been well-documented. In the current pilot study we seek to add to both current knowledge about and promising practices of translating prevention strategies from one target audience to another. We describe how we translated, administered, and evaluated a bystander intervention social marketing campaign focused on sexual assault prevention that had been found to significantly affect attitude change on a college campus for a U.S. Army installation in Europe. In addition to demonstrating the process of translating prevention strategies across target audiences, findings from this pilot study contribute to the evaluation data on the effectiveness of sexual violence prevention strategies implemented with members of the U.S. Military. From our analysis, we see that research participants indicate that the degree to which the images resonate with them and the familiarity of the context (i.e., social self-identification) significantly effect the participants' personal responsibility for reducing sexual assault, confidence in acting as a bystander, and reported engagement as a bystander.

AB  - Psychotherapists accelerated their adoption of telepsychotherapy during the COVID-19 outbreak to accommodate preventative isolation and social distancing. Lessons from psychotherapist experiences with technology prior to the outbreak can offer recommendations for practitioners and professional regulators. In this study, psychotherapists were interviewed about their use of technology in practice and interviews were analyzed for consistency with current literature on usual practice and professional regulations. The researchers used actor-network theory to map and explore the links and themes that emerged from the research. We found that technology use was more integrated with psychotherapy practice and psychotherapists were more confident and comfortable with telepsychotherapy than the literature predicted. Key themes arising from the interviews were psychotherapist responsibility and trust that included expanded psychotherapist responsibility, client trust, psychotherapists' self-trust, and trust of information sources. Telepsychotherapy can be enhanced by reflective, intentional practice, making space to examine routine behaviors, and developing strategies to counteract the unreliability of technology. Further, professional and regulatory bodies can support effective practice by developing clear and achievable technological competence responsibilities and by integrating technology training with mandatory psychotherapy education.

AB  - This paper discusses possible long-term effects of COVID-19 on activity-travel behaviour. Making use of theories and concepts from economics, psychology, sociology, and geography, this work argues that lasting effects can be expected, and specifically that peak demand among car and public transport users may be lower than if the pandemic would never have happened. The magnitude of such effects at the aggregate level in terms of the total travel time of all inhabitants of a country or state is likely limited. Such lasting effects imply that additional infrastructure extensions to reduce congestion on roads and crowding in public transport might have a lower benefit-cost ratio than would be the case without these impacts. The paper discusses avenues for future research, including work on the role of attitude changes, the formation of new habitual behaviour, new social norms and practices, well-being effects, and the role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).

KW  - ISLAMOPHOBIA
AB  - This article examines how Zizek's analysis of "subjective" violence can be used to explore the ways in which media coverage of a terrorist attack is contoured and shaped by less noticeable forms of "objective" (symbolic and systemic) violence. Drawing upon newspaper coverage of the 2017 London Bridge attack, it is noted how examples of "subjective" violence were grounded in the externalisation of a clearly identifiable "other", which symbolically framed the terrorists and the attack as tied to and representative of the UK Muslim community. Examples of "systematic" violence were most notable in the ideological edifice that underpinned this framing but also in the ways in which newspaper reports served to draw upon British values in the aftermath of the attack. This directed attention away from the contradictions within the UK, towards narratives that sought to "fix" these contradictions through eradicating the problem of "the other" and/or by violently protecting the British values "they" seek to undermine. As a consequence, newspaper coverage worked to uphold the illusion that "peace" could be achieved by eradicating terrorism through further forms of objective violence, including, internment without trial; the "ripping up" of human rights; and closer surveillance of Muslim communities. Indeed, it was this unacknowledged violence that worked to maintain British values in the press' coverage.

TI  - The Shifting Foundations of Political Communication: Responding to a Defense of the Media Effects Paradigm
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
LA  - English
AB  - Our earlier article (Bennett & Iyengar, 2008) argued that because news audiences are increasingly self-selected, communications scholars will be increasingly hard pressed to document media-induced persuasion effects. Holbert, Garrett, and Gleason's critique does not address the fundamental problem of endogeneity, instead proposing attitude reinforcement as a substitute for persuasion. But the problem of endogeneity applies equally to reinforcement and attitude-change research. Our critics also argue that exposure to alternative news outlets and entertainment programming is exogenous and has the potential to shape political attitudes. We respond that the political content of these programs, while surely promoting other desirable political outcomes, is too sporadic to produce large-scale message effects of the sort described by the classic persuasion paradigm.

AB  - This paper explores the dichotomies and gendered invisibilities underpinning the concept of the knowledge economy and society through a closer examination of two emblematic and contrasting figures working in Information and Communication Technology and domestic/care work as bearers of different configurations of knowledge and skills in the contemporary circuits of globalisation. Such knowledge can be broken down into different typessuch as embrained, encoded, embodied and enculturedwhich are valued differentially and with consequences for gendered labour markets. These gendered differences are reflected in current immigration policies which privilege migrants in scientific and information technology sectors and discount those engaged in care work, associated with embodied knowledge and skills. The impact of these differences has been reinforced during a period of economic recession when immigration has become increasingly restricted, even amongst the skilled.

KW  - CONTEXT
AB  - Purpose - Despite the importance of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) in e-commerce transactions on the global market, there is still limited understanding about the effect of eWOM sequence and its psychological mechanism in cross-cultural settings. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the differences in brand attitude changes according to the eWOM sequence, as well as cross-culturally, based on thinking styles. Furthermore, the authors examine the moderated mediation effect of perceived cognition congruency across cultures to explain its underlying mechanism.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors use a 2 (eWOM sequence: positive/negative, negative/positive) x 2(culture: East (South Korea), West (USA)) factorial design. Perceived cognition congruency is measured as a within-group variable.
   Findings - First, brand attitude changes in the West (USA) for the negative/positive presentation order are significantly larger than for the positive/negative presentation order, while, in the East (South Korea), no significant differences exist. Second, in the Westerner group (analytical thinking style), the perceived cognition congruency shows a significant difference according to the eWOM sequence, whereas in the Easterner group (holistic thinking style), the perceived cognition congruency does not show a significant difference according to the eWOM sequence.
   Practical implications - As such, a strategic interpretation of the mixed eWOM presentation order across cultures is needed. In the West, interest and attention are necessary for the eWOM sequence. However, in the East, a different strategic approach, except for the presentation order of mixed eWOM, is required. The other elements of the mixed eWOM, such as attribute type or intensity of negative information, need to be considered for mixed eWOM management.
   Originality/value - This study expands the existing body of knowledge on the sequence effect of mixed eWOM. Furthermore, it provides strategic direction and practical implications for mixed eWOM-driven information management, focusing on sequence in cross-cultural settings.

AB  - Background: The number of patient portals is rising, and although portals can have positive effects, their implementation has major impacts on the providing health care institutions. However, little is known about the organizational factors affecting successful implementation. Knowledge of the specific barriers to and facilitators of various stakeholders is likely to be useful for future implementations.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the barriers to and facilitators of patient portal implementation facing various stakeholders within hospital organizations in the Netherlands.
   Methods: Purposive sampling was used to select hospitals of various types. A total of 2 university medical centers, 3 teaching hospitals, and 2 general hospitals were included. For each, 3 stakeholders were interviewed: (1) medical professionals, (2) managers, and (3) information technology employees. In total, 21 semistructured interviews were conducted using the Grol and Wensing model, which describes barriers to and facilitators of change in health care practice at 6 levels: (1) innovation; (2) individual professional; (3) patient; (4) social context; (5) organizational context; and (6) economic and political context. Two researchers independently selected and coded quotes by applying this model using a (deductive) directed content approach. Additional factors related to technical and portal characteristics were added using the model of McGinn et al, developed for implementation of electronic health records.
   Results: In total, we identified 376 quotes, 26 barriers, and 28 facilitators. Thirteen barriers and 12 facilitators were common for all stakeholder groups. The facilitators' perceived usefulness (especially less paperwork) was mentioned by all the stakeholders, followed by subjects' positive attitude. The main barriers were lack of resources (namely, lack of staff and materials), financial difficulties (especially complying with high costs, lack of reimbursements), and guaranteeing privacy and security (eg, strict regulations). Both similarities and differences were found between stakeholder groups and hospital types. For example, managers and information technology employees mainly considered guaranteeing privacy and security as a predominant barrier. Financial difficulties were particularly mentioned by medical professionals and managers.
   Conclusions: Patient portal implementation is a complex process and is not only a technical process but also affects the organization and its staff. Barriers and facilitators occurred at various levels and differed among hospital types (eg, lack of accessibility) and stakeholder groups (eg, sufficient resources) in terms of several factors. Our findings underscore the importance of involving multiple stakeholders in portal implementations. We identified a set of barriers and facilitators that are likely to be useful in making strategic and efficient implementation plans.

AB  - Youth alcohol consumption has been steadily declining in Australia, as in other countries; fewer young people are drinking and the age of initiation is increasing. However, young people, their parents and others in their communities continue to believe that adolescent (excessive) drinking is the norm. This perception, and the concurrent misperception that the majority of parents are happy to provide their underage children with alcohol, creates a perceived culture of acceptance of youth alcohol consumption. Young people believe that it is accepted, and even expected, that they will drink; and parents perceive that not providing their adolescent children with alcohol will lead to social exclusion. There is evidence that shifting social norms can have an immediate and lasting effect adolescents' (and adults') alcohol related attitudes and behaviors. This paper reports on a novel, community based social marketing intervention designed to correct misperceptions of alcohol related social norms in an Australian community. The project utilized a social marketing approach, informed by the full complement of Andreasen's social marketing benchmarking criteria, and concurrently targeted adolescents, parents of adolescents and the broader community. Using extensive formative research and multiple evaluation techniques, the study demonstrates that shifts in community social norms are possible and suggests that this approach could be used more widely to support the positive trends in youth alcohol consumption and parental supply.

AB  - Many first-year university students experience stressors that impact their adjustment and well-being. Their help-seeking attitudes and preferred sources of support may be associated with various factors. The purpose of the present study was to (1) examine help-seeking preferences amongst first-year university students, (2) explore factors associated with students' attitudes toward seeking mental health services, and (3) identify perceived barriers associated with accessing formal sources of support. First-year students at a Canadian university (N = 167) completed a survey assessing help-seeking attitudes and preferences, as well as challenges associated with seeking support. Participants also provided information about their perceived levels of social support, personality characteristics, and their tendency to experience positive and negative affect. Findings suggest that social support and negative affect were significantly associated with positive attitudes toward seeking mental health services. However, students were more inclined to rely on informal sources of support, such as family members and friends, compared to formal sources of support available through on- or off-campus mental health services. For those students who are inclined to access formal mental health support, barriers may impede access to care. Perceived barriers include cost and concerns about the availability of services and their overall effectiveness. These findings call for the creation of more opportunities for on-campus informal support in addition to better access to on-campus mental health services.

AB  - Objective:
   This study aims to evaluate the impact of a national mental health arts festival for the general public, encompassing a wide variety of art forms and themes.
   Method:
   An evaluation was undertaken with 415 attendees from 20 different events, combining qualitative and quantitative approaches.
   Results:
   The findings demonstrate positive impact on the relationship between arts and mental health. Events increased positive attitudes, including positive representations of people's contributions, capabilities and potential to recover. They did not decrease negative attitudes. Intended behaviour change was modest and one film event increased audience perceptions of dangerousness.
   Conclusion:
   The paper argues that the arts can change stigma by constructing shared meanings and engaging audiences on an emotional level. Carefully programmed, collaborative, community-based arts festivals should form an integral part of national programmes to address stigma and to promote mental health and wellbeing, alongside traditional social marketing and public education approaches.

AB  - Political disagreement in interpersonal communication increases attitudinal ambivalence and can depress voter turnout. These effects seem to be driven by a wish to avoid social controversy rather than informational gains from encountering other opinions. This article shows that political disagreement in interpersonal communication increases the difficulty of deciding for which party to vote. Moreover, this effect is a result of social disapproval of one's party preference, while political expertise in interpersonal communication has no effect. For voter turnout, no direct effect of social disapproval of one's party preference is found. However, disapproval has an indirect influence on turnout via difficulty of vote choice. In sum, both political attitudes and political behaviour are affected by social pressures. Students of political attitudes and behaviour should try to include interpersonal discussion in their models in greater detail than is common practice today.

AB  - This study investigates foreign language teachers' beliefs about information and communication technology (ICT) and factors contributing to their belief formation through in-depth interviews with eight teachers and the principal of a public primary school. The participants held overall slightly positive attitudes towards the effectiveness of ICT in English education but believed it played only a subsidiary role in their pedagogical practices and professional development. Elementary English teachers' ICT-related beliefs were shaped by individual-, institutional-, and policy-level factors. The study extends belief-related components of the technology acceptance model (TAM) by clarifying the external variables into three-level factors. The results suggest the need for in-service teacher education programmes and joint efforts from individual teachers, school management, and government authorities catering to teachers' ICT beliefs.

AB  - While social living is considered to be an indispensable part of human life in today's ever-connected world, social distancing has recently received much public attention on its importance since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. In fact, social distancing has long been practiced in nature among solitary species, and been taken by human as an effective way of stopping or slowing down the spread of infectious diseases. Here we consider a social distancing problem for how a population, when in a world with a network of social sites, decides to visit or stay at some sites while avoiding or closing down some others so that the social contacts across the network can be minimized. We model this problem as a population game, where every individual tries to find some network sites to visit or stay so that he/she can minimize all his/her social contacts. In the end, an optimal strategy can be found for everyone, when the game reaches an equilibrium. We show that a large class of equilibrium strategies can be obtained by selecting a set of social sites that forms a so-called maximal r-regular subnetwork. The latter includes many well studied network types, which are easy to identify or construct, and can be completely disconnected (with r =0) for the most strict isolation, or allow certain degrees of connectivities (with r > 0) for more flexible distancing. We derive the equilibrium conditions of these strategies, and analyze their rigidity and flexibility on different types of r-regular subnetworks. We also extend our model to weighted networks, when different contact values are assigned to different network sites.

AB  - Five experiments investigated the effect of power on social distance. Although increased social distance has been suggested to be an underlying mechanism for a number of the effects of power, there is little empirical evidence directly supporting this claim. Our first three experiments found that power increases social distance toward others. In addition, these studies demonstrated that this effect is (a) mediated by self-sufficiency and (b) moderated by the perceived legitimacy of power-only when power is seen as legitimate, does it increase social distance. The final two studies build off research showing that social distance is linked to decreased altruism and find an interaction between power and legitimacy on willingness to help others. The authors propose that the concept of social distance offers a synthesizing lens that integrates seemingly disparate findings in the power literature and explains how power can both corrupt and elevate.

AB  - The concepts of place and the social have been put forward as significant intertwined explanatory contexts for information behavior. Much of the research that approaches information behavior from this perspective, however, has focused on static contexts or virtual contexts and has not addressed the influence of technology in physical spaces. In this article, we explore the influence of mobile technologies in two settings. The first is a site where a social space was augmented by the introduction of technology with the potential to provide information with the belief that information behavior, use, and services would evolve. The second is where intermediaries and information systems were designed and introduced into existing social spaces (an individual's home, community center, or street) with the explicit intention of providing information. The intention of both implementations was to reduce social exclusion. This exploratory research used activity theory as a theoretical lens to explore end-user reaction. The findings of the research illustrate how information and service needs are now addressed through a combination of mobile information and communication technologies and human intermediary knowledge.

AB  - This paper analyzes the effect of the public's acceptance of sincere governmental apology and their political attitude regarding public conflict resolution in South Korea. Specifically, this study examines the role of conflict types such as interest conflict and value conflict in the conflict resolution process. The findings confirm that independent variables such as the public's acceptance of a sincere governmental apology' and their political attitude have a significant effect on willingness to cooperate in situations of public conflict resolution. The results reveal differences between these two types of conflict when the interaction effect of independent variables is considered; for example, this effect is significant in interest conflict, but not significant in value conflict. Implications of the results are also discussed.

AB  - Several scholars investigate the link between news media and political attitudes of citizens, showing that media exposure affects confidence in political institutions. Beginning from this perspective, we analyze trust in government in twenty-seven European countries, testing the interactive relationship between citizens' policy views and media slant. Under the assumption that news media bias content in the direction of their audiences or are compliant with potential influence exerted by the government, we use Eurobarometer survey data to measure the effects of the ideological slant of newspapers and public television on trust in government. Our results show that the pro- or antigovernment slant of media outlets interacts with the individual ideological views of each citizen and confirm that media act like echo-chambers that reinforce preexisting attitudes. Conversely, the consumption of counter-attitudinal information barely alters trust in government nor does it produce hostile media effects. We also find a slight difference between newspaper readers and public service broadcaster (PSB) users, which seems related to mechanisms of cognitive dissonance.

AB  - Background: Evidence regarding the effectiveness of contact tracing of COVID-19 and the related social distancing is limited and inconclusive.
   Objective: This study aims to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in South Korea and evaluate whether a social distancing campaign is effective in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.
   Methods: We used contract tracing data to investigate the epidemic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in South Korea and evaluate whether a social distancing campaign was effective in mitigating the spread of COVID-19. We calculated the mortality rate for COVID-19 by infection type (cluster vs noncluster) and tested whether new confirmed COVID-19 trends changed after a social distancing campaign.
   Results: There were 2537 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who completed the epidemiologic survey: 1305 (51.4%) cluster cases and 1232 (48.6%) noncluster cases. The mortality rate was significantly higher in cluster cases linked to medical facilities (11/143, 7.70% vs 5/1232, 0.41%; adjusted percentage difference 7.99%; 95% CI 5.83 to 10.14) and long-term care facilities (19/221, 8.60% vs 5/1232, 0.41%; adjusted percentage difference 7.56%; 95% CI 5.66 to 9.47) than in noncluster cases. The change in trends of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases before and after the social distancing campaign was significantly negative in the entire cohort (adjusted trend difference -2.28; 95% CI -3.88 to -0.68) and the cluster infection group (adjusted trend difference -0.96; 95% CI -1.83 to -0.09).
   Conclusions: In a nationwide contact tracing study in South Korea, COVID-19 linked to medical and long-term care facilities significantly increased the risk of mortality compared to noncluster COVID-19. A social distancing campaign decreased the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea and differentially affected cluster infections of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Introduction:Online communication and the number of e-health applications have noticeably increased. However, little is known about the otolaryngologists' use behavior and their attitudes toward the potential of e-health. The aims of the study were to evaluate the documentation, information, and communication technologies used by otolaryngologists and to get a better understanding of their attitudes toward the potential of e-health for cross-sectoral patient care.Methods:A survey was developed and tested by otolaryngologists, healthcare-information technology experts, and health services researchers. A total of 334 otolaryngologists in private practice were asked to participate in this cross-sectional study. In total, 234 of them took part in the study, and 157 returned completed questionnaires. Statistical analysis was performed by using crosstabs, including chi-square tests, and multivariate logistic regressions.Results and Materials:Digital technologies are widely used by otolaryngologists (e.g., 89.6% use an electronic health record). However, the majority of intersectoral communication is still based on analogue techniques (e.g., fax use in 63.7%). From the otolaryngologists' perspectives, the potential of e-health for intersectoral care is mostly in appointment scheduling, further referrals to hospitals, and automated appointment reminders. The physicians' attitudes toward e-health are associated with their Internet use behavior in daily life (odds ratio=4.30, confidence interval 1.11-16.64, p=0.035) but not with their demographics.Discussion:The otolaryngologists are well prepared and have an overall positive attitude toward e-health for deeper use in cross-sectoral care. Therefore, e-health in otolaryngology needs more attention and resources for further studies, especially with a focus on quality and safety of care.

AB  - Given the aggressive behaviours and negative attitudes associated with hegemonic masculinity, and the fact that men are more likely to commit violent crimes than are women, people might choose to avoid men displaying characteristics consistent with hegemonic masculinity. In a vignette-based study, we assessed whether the gender of a person displaying behaviours and attitudes consistent with hegemonic masculinity influenced people's desire for social distance. Further, we explored whether the relationship between hegemonic masculinity and social distance was mediated by perceived dangerousness. A fictitious man displaying attitudes and behaviours consistent with hegemonic masculinity was perceived to be more dangerous than a woman displaying the same characteristics, and an increase in perceived dangerousness was associated with a desire for greater social distance. Once this was removed from the direct path, there was no link between the gender of the fictitious individual and social distance, indicating that people do not desire greater social distance from men but from anyone exhibiting 'toxic' attitudes and behaviours. The findings have important clinical implications, highlighting the role social connections play in changing prejudiced attitudes and recovery from depression.

AB  - One hundred and eighty-eight participants completed the online questionnaire with items on demographics (age and gender), social exclusion, surveillance use, Facebook addiction, and narcissistic grandiosity. The findings showed that social exclusion was positively associated with Facebook addiction (B = 0.237, p < 0.001) and surveillance use was significantly positively associated with Facebook addiction (B = 0.211, p < 0.01). The surveillance use of Facebook was found to be a significant mediator between the risk of social exclusion on Facebook and Facebook addiction (B = 0.054, CI [0.20, 0.113]). Narcissistic grandiosity significantly moderated the associations between social exclusion and Facebook addiction (B = 0.079, p = 0.012). These findings suggest that the risk of social exclusion could serve as facilitator of Facebook addiction depending on narcissistic grandiosity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the relationship between the nursing station design and use of communication technologies by comparing centralized and decentralized nursing stations.
   BACKGROUND: The rapid changes in communication technologies in healthcare are inevitable. Communication methods can change the way occupants use a space. In the meantime, decentralized nursing stations are emerging as a replacement for the traditional centralized nursing stations; however, not much research has been done on how the design of nursing stations can impact the use of communication technologies.
   METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted using an Internet-based survey among registered nurses in a Southeastern hospital in the United States. Two units with centralized nursing stations and two units with decentralized nursing stations were compared in terms of the application of communication technologies. A total of 70 registered nurses completed the survey in a 2-week period.
   RESULTS: The results revealed no significant differences between centralized and decentralized nursing stations in terms of frequency of communication technologies used. However, a difference was found between perception of nurses toward communication technologies and perceptions of the use of communication technologies in decentralized nursing stations.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the study was limited to one hospital, the results indicate that nurses hold positive attitudes toward communication technologies. The results also reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each nursing station design with regard to communication technologies.

AB  - Background: Herbal medicine has been widely utilized by pregnant women despite the limited available evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of that practice. The current available studies, from different countries, estimated that the use of herbal medicine during pregnancy range from 7% up to 96%. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence, attitude, source of information, and reasoning behind the use of herbal medicine among pregnant women in Saudia Arabia.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted using a convenience sample including pregnant women who visited the obstetric clinics at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A survey was administered in order to evaluate the prevalence and perception toward herbal medicine use among pregnant women in Saudi Arabia.
   Results: A total of 297 pregnant women completed the survey. The results showed that 56% of the respondents have used some type of herbal medicine during their pregnancy. Olive oil was utilized in 26% of the respondents followed by cumin 20% and garlic 15%. In addition, 37% of the respondents used herbal medicine by their own initiative, while 33% and 12% used herbal medicine based on recommendations from their families and friends, respectively. Furthermore, 19% of the respondents reported a positive attitude toward herbal medicine use during pregnancy. In addition, the percentage of women with positive attitude was marginally higher among respondents with lower educational level.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of using herbal medicine is considerably high among pregnant women in Saudi Arabia. Unfortunately, the majority of the users relied on informal sources to use herbal medicine during pregnancy. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Instagram is one of the most popular social networking services worldwide. This exploratory study was conducted to examine the relationships between social exclusion, Instagram usage motivation (self-promotion, social interaction), and Instagram usage behaviour (frequency of photo uploads, degree of interest in photos uploaded by others). A total of 359 Korean Instagram users responded to an online survey. As a result of correlation analysis and path analysis, it was found that being rejected correlated most with social interaction motivation and being ignored correlated with self-promotion motivation. Findings also indicated that self-promotion motivation was highly correlated with the frequency of photo uploads, leading to Instagram users uploading photos of people, food, and objects more frequently. Social interaction motivation showed a close relationship with a degree of interest in photos uploaded by others, leading users to view and respond to photos of people, food, and objects posted by other users. This study is the first study to suggest social exclusion as an antecedent factor that influences Instagram usage motivation and usage behaviour.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the dynamics of online health care communities and the impact of two-way online social support on customers' well-being and patients' quality of life, at different social exclusion levels.
   Design/methodology/approach - An online survey in China's Anti-Hepatitis B Online Community includes 326 respondents. A combined hierarchical regression analysis and structural equation model test the hypotheses.
   Findings - Both receiving and giving online social support, as reciprocal altruism behaviors, enhance patients' well-being. Receiving online social support influences psychological well-being most; giving has the largest impact on existential domains. Social exclusion boosts the benefits of giving online social support but attenuates the benefits of receiving it.
   Research limitations/implications - This research focusses on the effects of online social support among socially excluded patients. Extensions could rely on objective instead of subjective measures and alternative methodologies to test the underlying processes. Additional insights could derive from a bidirectional perspective.
   Practical implications - Medical treatment institutions should leverage customer resources; health care providers should prioritize patients who feel socially excluded as effective online support providers. Health care community administrators can use several means to convince patients to contribute to communities.
   Originality/value - Social support in online health care communities is a collaborative service that uses customers as service resources. This study explains the collaborative service and how customers feel about their bidirectional roles. It also extends reciprocal altruism research to a health information technology realm by systematically exploring how giving, vs receiving, online social support affects customers' well-being.

AB  - A sample of undergraduate college students (N = 610) enrolled in Introductory Sociology courses participated in a study exploring attitudes toward and social distance from persons who are Arab, Pakistani, and Muslim vis a vis other ethnic and religious groups. Data were collected between 2010 and 2016 using the Bogardus Social Distance scale and a 16-item Islamophobia scale. Respondents positioned Arabs, Pakistanis, and Muslims at the bottom of a closeness hierarchy. In multiple regression analyses where race, religion, political affiliation and preferred news source are regressed on Islamophobia scores we find that being Christian, being a Republican and watching Fox News, separately and together, significantly influence negative attitudes toward Muslims and persons from those regions, while knowing someone Muslim diminishes these views. The persistence of these sentiments is explored.

AB  - Given that the most students spend considerable time on social networks, many educational institutions use this habit as a basis for educational purposes. Increasing students' active participation in learning activities is one of the main goals of education. The purpose of this research was to investigate to what extent crowdvoting techniques can increase students' participation and interest in the e-learning process. Additionally, we set out to explore social networks as a medium for crowdvoting, contests, and collaboration among students. The research participants included 131 students in the information technologies area of the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, University of Belgrade who participated in contest related to their 3D modeling projects. Voting was performed via Facebook. The students voted for particular projects primarily based on the quality of the project itself. Additionally, the competition was an incentive for students to prove themselves to colleagues, but also to provide an opportunity for teamwork, additional engagement, and acquisition of new skills and knowledge. The research results indicate a generally positive attitude among students towards the competition and rewards.

AB  - Purpose Strategic goal achievement in every sector of a company relies fundamentally on the firm's employees. This study aims to disclose the factors that spur employees of major Information Technology (IT) companies in the United States (US). Design/methodology/approach In this paper, 15,000 reviews from the top 15 United States IT companies were collected from the social media platform Glassdoor to uncover the factors that satisfy IT employees. To learn the most meaningful features that influence the scores, positive and negative remarks, as well as advice to the management team, were analyzed through a support vector machine. Findings Results highlight a positive attitude of coworkers, contributing to a positive environment and job satisfaction. However, unsatisfied IT employees reveal that work exhaustion is the main reason for their job dissatisfaction. Practical implications - IT human resource departments can use these valuable insights to align their strategies in accordance with their employees' desires and expectations in order to thrive. Originality/value The study highlights the relevance of IT companies to understand the reasons behind their employees' satisfaction. Up until now, little is known concerning the variants of job satisfaction among IT employees, enriching the understanding in this particular professional area.

AB  - This research examines the effectiveness of the myth/fact message format (MFMF)a message format that first presents a common misperception as a myth then counters it with a correcting factwithin the health-care and social marketing context of mental illness (MI). Stereotype processing theory predicts that the use of a negative aspect of the stereotype in a MFMF may further instantiate the negative belief, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the message. Conversely, using a message format that conveys only facts (i.e., new positive beliefs) without inclusion of the myth will lead to more positive attitudes. However, this effect will only be seen among people with personal relevance with MI as only they are sufficiently motivated to suppress the automatically activated stereotype and elaborate on the message. A study demonstrates that advertising utilizing a fact-only format leads to more positive attitudes than the MFMF among people with personal relevance while people without personal relevance to MI demonstrate no differences in attitude between myth/fact and fact-only message formats. Personal relevance had the opposite moderating effect on perceived learning. These findings suggest that the MFMF's impact on attitudes, the typical focal point of social marketing campaigns targeting misconceptions about stereotyped groups, may be ineffective. Thus, using a fact-only format that conveys new positive beliefs in a social marketing message is recommended within the specific context of MI and may be warranted in other health-care and social issues.

AB  - Much research has examined the effect of personality, political attitudes, and place attachment on environmental concerns and behavior intentions. However, the effects of these factors have largely been studied separately from one another. Moreover, little research has focused on their relationship to environmentally responsible behaviors (ERB) directly. In the current study, a moderated mediation model was proposed to capture the synergistic effects of personality, political attitudes, and place attachment on ERB. An undergraduate sample (N=475) completed an online survey of Big Five personality, political attitudes, place attachment, and participation in ERB. Correlation analyses suggested that openness to new experiences, liberal attitudes, and place identity had reliable, statistically significant relations with ERB. The moderated mediation analyses provided support for the synergistic model. Specifically, openness' effect on the adoption of ERB was mediated by liberal attitudes and this mediation effect was further moderated by place identity. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - We examined the influence of locus of control on the relationship between social exclusion and preference for distinctive choices. Participants were 212 undergraduate students at a university in Central China, who completed measures of social exclusion, locus of control, choice, and perceived uniqueness. Results showed that participants who believed that the environment controlled their fate (external locus of control) preferred more distinctive choices in a social exclusion context than in a social inclusion context, whereas participants who believed that they could control the environment (internal locus of control) preferred less distinctive choices. Further, perceived uniqueness mediated the effect of social exclusion and locus of control on choice. These results add to the literature on social exclusion and personal control.

AB  - The immigration issue seems to have consolidated a top position on the European political agenda, and the body of literature devoted to explaining attitudes toward immigration continues to expand. Alongside established models focusing on threat perceptions as the central mechanism behind anti-immigration attitudes, increased attention has been paid to the role of media. The aim of the present study is to test the effects of media use on attitudes toward immigration from regions that are perceived to be remote versus those close to the host society. Moreover, the study goes beyond previous research by investigating reciprocal relationships between the use of specific media types and attitudes toward immigration. While the empirical findings suggest that the effects of using traditional news media is weak, right-wing alternative media appears more powerful in influencing immigration attitudes. Specifically, the results indicate that the use of right-wing alternative media reinforces negative attitudes toward perceived remote immigration. At the same time, the use of right-wing alternative media appears to stimulate more positive attitudes toward perceived close immigration. Further, reciprocal relationships were found between right-wing alternative media use and attitudes toward immigration.

AB  - Purpose
   This study aims to investigate whether the shift to teleworking during COVID-19 pandemic is going to diminish the need to procure/rent extensive office space and how this emerging trend impacts the real-estate market in Israel.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The methodologies used in this study include triangulation of Google search engine, survey and post hoc case study analysis.
   Findings
   The analysis indicates a decline both in procuring office space and its price per square meter. Employee productivity while teleworking remains relatively high despite home distractions. Interestingly, the survey results forecast a continuous shift to hybrid work mode after the pandemic.
   Practical implications
   The study introduces the development of numerous innovative Israeli technologies to allow a gradual return to work in public places.
   Social implications
   As the coronavirus outburst, business sectors were forced by government regulations to change the way of employment extensively, specifically, teleworking has become an integral part of the routine to accommodate social distance. The study provides insights into the impact of teleworking on gender and ethnic diversity in the Israeli workplace.
   Originality/value
   Israel provides a unique bedrock for investigation because of its status as a start-up nation with both high skilled workforce and advanced information technology infrastructure. The study enlightens an Israeli perspective on how a small size country with a high-density population succeeds to deal with coronavirus by teleworking coupled with strict government enforcement of social distance.

AB  - BackgroundLaunched in 2018, Time to Change Global is a new anti-stigma programme to tackle stigma and discrimination towards people with mental health problems in low- and middle-income countries. Our aim was to evaluate pre-post changes in stigma within the target populations for the social marketing campaigns ran in Ghana and Kenya carried out as components of the wider Time to Change Global programme.MethodsUsing data collected before and after each campaign in Accra and Nairobi, we investigated pre-post differences in stigma-related outcome measures: mental health-related knowledge (MAKS), mental health-related attitudes (CAMI), and desire for social distance (RIBS), with regression analyses. Other covariates were included in the models to control for differences in participant demographics.ResultsA significant positive change in a stigma related outcome was found at each site. Reported in standard deviation units, desire for social distance from people with mental health problems in Accra was lower after the launch of the campaign, measured as an increase in intended contact (beta =0.29, 95% CI=0.14 to 0.43, p <0.001). In Nairobi, the stigma related knowledge score was higher in the post campaign sample (<beta>=0.21, 95% CI=0.07 to 0.34, p =0.003).ConclusionThe increase in intended contact in the absence of other changes seen in Ghana, is consistent with the early results for Time to Change England. The estimate for the magnitude of this change is the same as Time to Change England for the general population between 2009 and 19, a very promising result for a short term public mental health campaign. The different results observed between sites may be due to campaign as well as population differences.

AB  - Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has been considered an important component to integrate into teacher education programs in the twenty-first century. However, neither faculty members nor the pre-service teachers seem to benefit from ICT efficiently throughout the 4-year teacher education program in Turkey. This study was designed to find out the experiences of Turkish EFL (English as a Foreign Language) pre-service teachers about their practice-based training on ICT integration into language learning and teaching. The junior pre-service teachers were given training about ICT integration based on SAMR model (Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, Redefinition) throughout 4 weeks. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews and observations. The findings show that the participants found SAMR model beneficial and held positive attitudes towards using SAMR in their future classes.

AB  - Occasioned by the celebration of the 200 years since the outbreak of the Greek Revolution of 1821, Onassis Library, in collaboration with the Cartographic Heritage Archives of General State Archives of Greece and the Department of Geography of Harokopio University, designed a series of four digital workshops to motivate teenagers to bring to life one of the most emblematic maps of the so-called Greek Enlightenment during the eighteenth century and major item of the Greek cartographic heritage: Rigas Velestinlis Charta (map) of Greece (1796-1797). From January to March 2020, four school teams consisting of students 13-17 years old, approached in a creative way the map that inspired the Greek Revolution of 1821, transforming it into a computer game, a digital story, an augmented reality or a virtual reality application. By using innovative mixtures of history, geography, cartography, visual arts and information technology, they managed to expand their knowledge and skills by participating in an entertaining learning process. All participants acknowledged the pedagogical value of this innovative experience, which cultivated a positive attitude towards the learning procedure, enriching the lessons of history and geography, promoting the cartographic cultural heritage through new technology approaches and using valuable digital techniques and tools.

AB  - Background Adolescent health has become a priority on the global health agenda. Parent-adolescent communication regarding sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues can help to reduce adolescent risk-taking sexual behaviours.
   Objective This study was to describe the situation of SRH communication, and to determine the factors associated with SRH communication between high school students and their parents in Vientiane Capital prefecture, Lao PDR.
   Methods A multistage sampling technique was applied. A self-administered questionnaire was implemented among a sample of 384 high school students aged 14-17 in Vientiane. SRH communication in this study was recorded as the frequency with which adolescents discussed with their parents at least four topics on SRH issues during a six-month period prior to the interview. Data were entered and analysed using Epi Data software version 6.0 and STATA software version 14.2.
   Results Slightly more than one-fifth of the students (21.3%) communicated with parents on SRH issues. The multivariate logistic regression model showed that being a male adolescent (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.5), urban school locations (AOR = 0.2; 95% CI 0.1 to 0.5), a mature father (AOR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.0 to 2.9), positive attitudes towards general communication with parents (AOR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.1 to 4.2) and accessibility to multiple SRH information sources (AOR = 5.2; 95% CI 2.4 to 11.4) were significantly associated with adolescent-parent communication on SRH issues.
   Conclusion This study showed that student-parent communication on SRH issues was low, so policymakers should develop programs to improve SRH communication skills in all schools and encourage open discussion among family members, especially with respect to the participation of adolescent girls. The positive attitudes of students and multiple sources of SRH information were also important factors in improving SRH communication.

AB  - Background: To evaluate whether a high body mass index (BMI) predisposes marathon/half-marathon participants to lower extremity injuries. Methods: Consenting adult participants at the 2008 National Marathon to Fight Breast Cancer were enrolled in this observational study. The primary outcome measure was prevalence of self-reported lower extremity injury, during both training and race participation, with respect to BMI. Results: There were 194 subjects with complete data: 139 females (72%) and 55 males. Forty-six percent of females and 51% of males ran the full marathon (P = .63). Median BMI was 23.7 kg/m(2) for females and 26.2 kg/m(2) for males (P = .001). Eleven (24%) females in BMI tertile 1 (T1) suffered a training injury, while 9 (18%) from T2 and 4(9%) from T3 suffered injuries (P = .072; OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01). Twenty-six (19%) females suffered an injury during the race. Females in T1 were more likely to suffer a race-related injury (P = .038; OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.99). Females were 13% less likely to suffer a race-related injury with each 1-unit increase in BMI. Rates of injury did not differ by BMI tertile in males. Conclusions: A high BMI did not impart an increased risk of lower extremity injury during training or race participation.

AB  - Donald Trump's bombastic statements regarding women and minorities were a constant theme in the 2016 presidential election and attracted attention from both the mainstream media and his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Given the increasing use of social networking sites among political actors and the public, as well as the focus given to women and minorities in the 2016 election, we utilize a content analysis of presidential candidates' social media activity in the months preceding the election in order to better understand how the candidates addressed women and minorities. We ultimately find that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton out-posted Trump in both positive and negative content in the categories of women's issues; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender issues; race; and immigration. However, this is not the case with issues involving crime and police, which was a lens through which Trump was more likely to approach race-related issues. In many instances, the candidates also appeared to strategically target content-specific posts to the social media platforms where they would be most likely to be seen by women or the minority group most closely related to the post's content.

AB  - Most research examining partisan media effects uses individual differences in exposure to news sources to predict attitude change. In this paper, we improve upon this approach by using variations in cable news coverage to predict subsequent changes in viewer impressions of the candidates. This approach allows us to examine the distinct effects of in-party and out-party candidate coverage. Content analyses and survey data show that partisan media effects result from coverage of the opposition candidate, and not from coverage of the like-minded candidate. Specifically, during the 2008 presidential election, increased coverage of Obama (McCain) on Fox News (MSNBC) made viewers less favorable toward Obama (McCain). Meanwhile, coverage of McCain (Obama) on Fox News (MSNBC) had minimal effects on viewer impressions. These results suggest that media effects persist even during an era dominated by selective exposure.

TI  - Adherence to epidemiological measures and related knowledge and attitudes during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in Croatia: a cross-sectional study
T2  - CROATIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - COVID-19
AB  - Aim To assess the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and related knowledge and attitudes during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in Croatia.
   Methods The online survey, conducted on social media in May 2020, yielded 1393 responses across the country (66% from the Adriatic area). The questionnaire consisted of socio-demographic questions and questions on the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to PPE use. The chi(2) test, t test, and multivariate logistic regression were used in data analysis.
   Results As many as 84.0% of participants reported the compliance with social distancing measures, while 52.8% reported using PPE (mask and/or gloves) when shopping or visiting friends and family. Participants demonstrated good knowledge (mean of 10.4 [95% CI 10.3-10.4] correct answers out of 13 questions) and neutral to moderately positive attitude about PPE use (mean of 36.6 [36.1-37.1] out of 50 points). Participants with higher education, women, and health care workers had a greater probability for having a high knowledge score. Women, older individuals, public transport users, people with more positive PPE use attitude, and those who complied with social distancing had a higher probability of PPE use, while health care workers and highly educated participants had a reduced probability of PPE use in public.
   Conclusions Croatians had good knowledge and neutral to moderately positive attitudes about PPE use. Nevertheless, health authorities need to promote positive attitudes about PPE use in order to retain trust and compliance with epidemiological measures.

AB  - The present study investigated short-term effects of daily social exclusion at work on various indicators of sleep quality and tested the mediating role of work-related worries using a time-based diary study with ambulatory assessments of sleep quality. Ninety full-time employees participated in a 2-week data collection. Multilevel analyses revealed that daily workplace social exclusion and work-related worries were positively related to sleep fragmentation in the following night. Daily social exclusion, however, was unrelated to sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency and self-reported sleep quality. Moreover, worries did not mediate the effect of social exclusion at work on sleep fragmentation. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.

AB  - Empirical evidence that combines traditional factors and information technology factors to predict public attitudes toward to medical services is inadequate. To fill this gap, this study investigates the impact of Internet use on people's satisfaction with medical services by employing the Chinese Social Survey for 2013, 2015 and 2017 (including 28,239 samples in total). Estimation results under the ordered probit reveal that Internet use is negatively correlated with individuals' medical services satisfaction. The results support the negativity bias theory, namely, compared with positive information, netizens pay more attention to negative medical-related information on the Internet. The results are still reliable by adopting substitution variable methods, subdividing the samples, employing other estimation methods and carrying out placebo tests to conduct robustness checks. This study further enriches the literature on public attitudes toward medical services and provides additional policy implications for medical risk management in the digital era.

AB  - Developments in information and communication technologies enable more information services to be used in education applications. In this respect, it is important for educators to adopt technology, follow it closely and show a positive attitude towards technology in order to be able to use the developing technology in the classroom. Today, using technology is not a privilege but a necessity. Technological developments affect the structure and functions of educational institutions. For this reason, teachers are expected to integrate their lessons with technology in order to train individuals of the information society. This study aims to determine teachers' views on the use of information and communication technologies in education. Mixed research method was used in the study including experimental dimension and qualitative research. A total number of 58 teachers participated in the study. Results of the study provided useful implications for teachers in developing the ability to work in the information and educational environment.

AB  - Existing research has shown that the media can influence public attitudes to immigration. The adoption of a mixed-methods approach to audiences of immigration news, combined with a comparative design and a focus on Eastern Europe - a region scoring lowest in the world in terms of migrant acceptance - can bring significant advances to knowledge in this area, leading to a more rounded understanding of how media come to shape immigration attitudes. To demonstrate this, we draw on a comparative, mixed-methods data set comprising representative population surveys (N = 4,092), an expert survey (N = 60), and qualitative interviews (N = 120) conducted in four Eastern European countries. In contrast to existing research on Western Europe, we found significant variation in the links between attitudes to immigration and use of Public Service Media (PSM), with PSM consumption linked with more negative attitudes to immigration in some countries, and with more positive attitudes in others. Second, our results confirm that different attitudes to immigration are embedded in different qualitative understandings of immigration: while participants with more positive attitudes often adopted a more inclusive understanding of immigration, those with more negative attitudes adopted a narrower understanding. Third, we demonstrated the importance of family and acquaintances as trusted sources of information.

AB  - The implementation of effective community interventions can be challenging for many reasons, including financial and time costs, lack of infrastructure, local contextual variations, and barriers to fidelity. But, prior to all of these is the challenge of limited information exchange between the researchers developing interventions and the practitioners implementing them, or the so-called research-practice gap. In this paper, we use network theory and review a dozen small world experiments to understand the research-practice gap, identifying three key lessons: (1) spatial and social distances are related to the severity of the gap, (2) social boundaries may lead to echo chambers and closed loops, and (3) wider gaps reduce the likelihood of successful information exchange. From these lessons, we recommend that researchers and practitioners should rely on the assistances of information brokers who know people they do not know and who are different from themselves.

AB  - Evidence abounds about the fortunes to be gained in national and European Parliament elections by avowedly eurosceptic political parties. Consequently, a rich literature exists on the broad phenomenon of euroscepticism, in particular its frequent and volatile packaging with nationalism, xenophobia and anti-immigrant welfare chauvinism. This article takes up an ongoing debate about the intervening role of information (sources of information, understanding of the way the EU works, forms of information seeking) in shaping negative attitudes. Eurobarometer data along with original survey responses from elected representatives in subnational assemblies of three countries reveal (1) the significant relationship between euroscepticism and information deficiency, (2) the surprising receptivity of some eurosceptics to gaining new information about the EU, and (3) the potency of information exposure in mitigating anti-EU sentiments.

AB  - Rudyard Kipling's 1899 poem "The White Man's Burden" is frequently invoked in the online postings of white supremacists making various arguments about contemporary race relations. Many follow Senator Ben Tillman's early appropriation of the text as an argument for racial separatism and isolationism, while others advocate a new imperialism. This article examines how Kipling's poem takes on the special qualities of a mettle, allowing a loosely affiliated community of authors and audiences to signal their identities through transmission of a shared text even as they stray in multiple directions from its original meaning. Newly examined primary sources draw from a range of so-called "alt-right" spokesmen and obscure Internet users to demonstrate how the concept of the "white man's burden" has adapted to survive in a cultural environment more than a century removed from its origin, and how Kipling himself has been adopted by a twenty-first century subculture.

AB  - Holding similar negative-versus positive-attitudes toward a third party has been shown to predict increased closeness to a stranger. Here, the authors examined whether this effect is mediated by the heightened feelings of familiarity engendered by shared negative attitudes. In Study 1, participants who shared with a (bogus) stranger a negative attitude of a professor subsequently reported knowing more about the stranger than those who shared a positive attitude, but only when they did not feel strongly about the attitude. In Study 2, a familiarity manipulation produced high levels of closeness among participants who believed they had a lot of information about a stranger. Among those who believed they knew little about the stranger, closeness was facilitated by sharing a weakly held, negative attitude of a professor. Discussion considers the relevance of these findings to the interpersonal attraction literature.

AB  - This article investigates the prominence of racial content in newspaper stories about Barack Obama and three other candidates running in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primary. Content analyses of stories appearing in six national newspapers sought to ascertain how frequent racial references appeared in news accounts of the presidential contest, how salient the racial content was, and what factors explained race-related coverage. Consistent with previous studies, the presence of one or more racial minorities in the stories increased the likelihood and presence of racial references found in the story. However, results challenge the conventional wisdom that racial content is salient enough to serve as a prominent racial cue activating readers' or voters' negative racial prejudices. This study finds that more than any other factor, journalists' desire to heighten the election's competitiveness influenced the presence and degree of racial content present in stories.

AB  - Our study investigates several antecedents and consequences of negative emotional reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic in a cross-national sample of 737 participants. Our results show that COVID-19 anxiety and negative mood are positively predicted by death anxiety and the use in communication of general COVID-19 information. Death reflection reduces negative mood in relation to COVID-19 and attenuates the positive association between death anxiety on the one hand and the negative mood and anxiety in relation to COVID-19 on the other hand. The use of humoristic information about COVID-19 reduces anxiety and social distance towards people infected with COVID-19 and also attenuates the positive association between the use in communication of general COVID-19 information and negative mood in relation to COVID-19. Our results also show that the association between death anxiety and social distance towards those infected with COVID-19 is mediated by anxiety and negative mood in relation to COVID-19. Finally, the association between the use of COVID-19 information in interpersonal communication and social distance is mediated by anxiety and negative mood in relation to COVID-19. The study thus reveals specific insights for tailored interventions to reduce negativity towards people infected with COVID-19.

AB  - Although research findings highlight the complex dualities of the Strong Black Woman ideal and demonstrate its effects on Black women's mental health and well-being, there is less understanding of the role that social media may play in Black women's negotiation of this ideal. To what extent might Black women's engagement with race-related social media, such as the use of Black-oriented blogs and hashtags, contribute to their well-being and potentially buffer contributions of the Strong Black Woman ideal? To investigate this question, we tested 412 Black women who completed online survey measures assessing their general social media use, Black-oriented blog and hashtag use, mental health, and self-esteem. Correlational and regression analyses revealed that, as expected, both greater endorsement of the Strong Black Woman ideal and higher levels of general social media use was associated with adverse mental health and lower self-esteem. Contrary to our expectations, Black-oriented blog use was also associated with more symptoms of depression and anxiety and did not moderate effects of Strong Black Woman endorsement on well-being. Clinicians, instructors, parents, and media activists should be mindful of how the use of both traditional and race-related social media may be both liberating for, and detrimental to, Black women's well-being.

AB  - Background: Studies have shown that human mobility is an important factor in dengue epidemiology. Changes in mobility resulting from COVID-19 pandemic set up a real-life situation to test this hypothesis. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of reduced mobility due to this pandemic in the occurrence of dengue in the state of Sa tilde o Paulo, Brazil. Method: It is an ecological study of time series, developed between January and August 2020. We use the number of confirmed dengue cases and residential mobility, on a daily basis, from secondary information sources. Mobility was represented by the daily percentage variation of residential population isolation, obtained from the Google database. We modeled the relationship between dengue occurrence and social distancing by negative binomial regression, adjusted for seasonality. We represent the social distancing dichotomously (isolation versus no isolation) and consider lag for isolation from the dates of occurrence of dengue. Results: The risk of dengue decreased around 9.1% (95% CI: 14.2 to 3.7) in the presence of isolation, considering a delay of 20 days between the degree of isolation and the dengue first symptoms. Conclusions: We have shown that mobility can play an important role in the epidemiology of dengue and should be considered in surveillance and control activities.

AB  - Social media has been integral for the organization and success of right-wing populist movements in the United States and Europe. Within online communities, discussions take place in which ideologies are formulated, iterated upon, and disseminated. One particular forum, hosted on the popular website reddit.com, r/The_Donald, has received media attention for its political influence. Despite the influence of online spaces in populist, far-right movements, relatively little attention has been paid to qualitative content of discussions that take place within such spaces, including r/The_Donald. Guided by a social representations approach, we analyzed how discussions on r/The_Donald represent sociopolitical groups. We focused on discussions of political affiliations, race relations, immigration, and culture. From a dataset of 8,198 posts, we selected 1,292 segments from 883 unique Reddit usernames and analyzed them using qualitative content analysis. The results showed that the majority of posts discussed liberals, race relations, and conspiracy theories, and in these posts, liberals and liberal ideas were delegitimized and mocked through their representations. These posts represented conservatives through antinomic contrast and comparison to liberals and liberal policies. The meanings of those representations in intergroup relations are discussed.

AB  - The hyperperception model was used to derive hypotheses concerning the processes by which people experience romantic jealousy because of their observation of their romantic partners on social network sites. The main focus was on the receiver component of the model that specifies that when observation of others' interactions is constrained to social media, those interactions appear more intimate than when the dyad is also observable offline. A survey (N = 322) was conducted to test this component of the model and determine if the model can predict additional phenomena such as possession signals and staying home during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data were generally consistent with the hypotheses and the utility of the hyperperception model for understanding the effects of observing romantic partners' interactions on social media. The data also reveal the importance of interpersonal processes in obeying social distancing guidelines.

AB  - The global threat of climate change, diminishing natural resources and significant socio-economic inequalities is forcing companies and individuals to evaluate the impact they are having on the natural, social and economic environments. This trend has led to an increased availability and demand for socially, environmentally and economically responsible products. The tourism industry relies heavily on the sustained beauty and hospitality of the places and communities it operates in and has come under pressure to manage its negative impacts. Change in the industry has, however, been limited. This paper investigates the current attitudes and perceptions of tourism business owners in Cape Town towards responsible tourism management (RTM) practices in order to develop social marketing strategies that can influence positive behaviour change in management. Cape Town as an internationally acclaimed top tourism destination needs to urgently address its low levels of responsible tourism evidence. Survey data of 244 tourism businesses was used to statistically test what factors are causing the low levels of RTM practices in Cape Town. Findings suggest that despite general positive attitudes towards RTM, tourism businesses are not investing time and money into changing management practices. This is a common emerging market phenomenon where resource constraints negatively impact the relationship between what businesses would like to do and what actually gets done. Factors such as the perceived cost of RTM, a highly competitive environment and a perceived lack of government support are further negatively influencing this relationship. Recommendations are made as to how social marketing can be used to encourage businesses to adopt RTM practices by reducing the perceived and actual costs of implementing RTM. The paper discusses what channels should be implemented to facilitate change.

AB  - Background: Inferiority feeling leads to the negative reactions such as depression and anxiety among community youth, social exclusion also forms their negative emotions due to the alienation of social relations. We aimed to explore the effect of social exclusion on the inferiority feeling of community youth.
   Methods: In December 2021, a total of 681 community youth from Wuhan in China were selected as the research object. They were evaluated using a social exclusion scale, inferiority scale, and rumination scale, respectively. The mediating effect of rumination on the relationship between social exclusion and inferiority of community youth was tested by using structural equation model and bootstrap test.
   Results: The scores of social exclusion, inferiority complex, and rumination were positively correlated (P<0.05). The mediation effect test showed that the mediation hypothesis model had a relatively good fitting index. Social exclusion was a positive predictor of rumination, and rumination was a positive predictor of inferiority. Ruminant thinking had a significant partial mediating effect in the relationship between social exclusion and inferiority feeling, the indirect effect was 0.078, the direct effect was 0.04, the total effect was 0.118, and the ratio of direct effect to indirect effect was approximately 1:2. Therefore, social exclusion exerted the influence on inferiority through rumination.
   Conclusion: Social exclusion positively affects the inferiority feeling of community youth through the mediating effect of rumination thinking. The health prevention of community youth's inferiority feeling should not only prevent the negative impact of social exclusion but also strengthen the cultivation of rumination thinking.

AB  - Background: Whether information sources influence health protective behaviours during influenza pandemics or other emerging infectious disease epidemics is uncertain.
   Methodology: Data from cross-sectional telephone interviews of 1,001 Hong Kong adults in June, 2009 were tested against theory and data-derived hypothesized associations between trust in (formal/informal) information, understanding, self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility and worry, and hand hygiene and social distancing using Structural Equation Modelling with multigroup comparisons.
   Principal Findings: Trust in formal (government/media) information about influenza was associated with greater reported understanding of A/H1N1 cause (beta = 0.36) and A/H1N1 prevention self-efficacy (beta = 0.25), which in turn were associated with more hand hygiene (beta = 0.19 and beta = 0.23, respectively). Trust in informal (interpersonal) information was negatively associated with perceived personal A/H1N1 susceptibility (beta = -0.21), which was negatively associated with perceived self-efficacy (beta = -0.42) but positively associated with influenza worry (beta = 0.44). Trust in informal information was positively associated with influenza worry (beta = 0.16) which was in turn associated with greater social distancing (beta = 0.36). Multigroup comparisons showed gender differences regarding paths from trust in formal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, trust in informal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, and understanding of A/H1N1 cause to perceived self-efficacy.
   Conclusions/Significance: Trust in government/media information was more strongly associated with greater self-efficacy and handwashing, whereas trust in informal information was strongly associated with perceived health threat and avoidance behaviour. Risk communication should consider the effect of gender differences.

TI  - Librarian Perception of Wikipedia: Threats or Opportunities for Librarianship?
T2  - LIBRI
LA  - English
AB  - The rapid rise of Wikipedia as an information source has placed the traditional role of librarians as information gatekeepers and guardians under scrutiny with much of the professional literature suggesting that librarians are polarized over the issue of whether Wikipedia is a useful reference tool. This qualitative study examines the perceptions and behaviours of National Library Board (NLB) of Singapore librarians with regards to information seeking and usage of Wikipedia. It finds that instead of polarized attitudes, most librarians, although cautious about using Wikipedia in their professional capacity, hold a range of generally positive attitudes towards the online en-cyclopaedia, believing that it has a valid role to play in the information seeking of patrons today. This is heartening because it suggests the existence within the librarian population of attitudes that can be tapped to engage constructively with Wikipedia. Three of these in particular are briefly discussed at the end of the article: Wikipedia's ability to appeal to the socalled "digital natives," its role as a source of non-Western information, and its potential to enable a revitalization of the role of librarians as public intellectuals contributing to a democratic information commons.

AB  - Study design: Qualitative study.
   Objective: To examine how trusted communication between individuals with spinal cord injury (ISCIs) and physicians who care for ISCIs is affected by the discussion of advances in stem cell research and interventions locally and abroad.
   Setting: Canada and the United States (US).
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews with ISCIs and physicians. A thematic analysis approach was applied to more than 12 h of data to derive prominent themes and describe relationships between them.
   Results: A convergence of factors involving transparency impact trusted communication between ISCIs and physicians about stem cells and spinal cord injury (SCI). ISCIs expressed that trusted communication is strengthened when physicians exhibit caring, attentive and positive attitudes that are underpinned by domain-specific knowledge and scholarship. Perceived reluctance to communicate or lack of knowledge poses significant challenges. Physicians also emphasised the importance of transparency for trusted communication but expressed that the still limited clinical reality of treatment choices for SCI and the pressures imposed by external resources are significant stressors that complicate the communication landscape. Both groups cited the range and variable quality of information sources, and the difficulty associated with navigating them, as priorities for action that would remediate these tensions.
   Conclusions: (1) Epistemic transparency should be privileged over silence. (2) A new generation of innovations in research and clinical trial dissemination about stem cells for SCI is needed to remedy the perceived inadequacies of existing information content and accessibility.

AB  - This paper focuses on differences of attitudes related to information and communication technologies among Czech and Turkish university students. Student attitudes were evaluated summatively and with respect to gender, year, country, and type of residential area (town/village). Student attitudes were measured by a modified version of the Information and Communication Technologies Attitudes Questionnaire (Kubiatko & Halakova, 2009). The sample consisted of a total of 770 unversity students (316 Czech and 454 Turkish). The data analysis included factor analysis, MANCOVA, ANOVA, and t-test. The factor analysis yielded five dimensions: 1) Influence of ICT on teaching process, 2) Influence of ICT on human body and environment, 3) Using of ICT in teaching, 4) School and ICT, 5) ICT as didactic equipment. As a result, students from the Czech Republic, male students, sopho-mores, and students living in town showed more positive attitudes in comparison to other respective groups.

AB  - Context: Notwithstanding the recognizable impact on public health, knowledge regarding this virus remains inadequate.
   Aims: This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of medical and allied health students regarding COVID-19 and its relationship to their demographic information.
   Setting and Design: This study was conducted at the University of Hail, Hail region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This study used a quantitative comparative-correlational design.
   Materials and Methods: There were 232 students recruited as respondents resulting from convenience sampling. A Google Forms survey was used to collect the data from March 2, 2020, until April 15, 2020.
   Statistical Analysis Used: One-way ANOVA, t-test, and Pearson's correlation test were used to analyze the data.
   Results: The participants had good knowledge, positive attitudes, and good practices on COVID-19. Of all the variables tested, only gender (P < 0.002) has statistical difference to knowledge. The Pearson's results showed no significant relationship between knowledge and attitudes (P > 0.5), knowledge and practices (P > 0.5), or attitudes and practices (P > 0.5).
   Conclusion: With the good knowledge, positive attitudes, and good practices of the participants about COVID-19, it is inferred that they can help to do information dissemination needed by the community. As females found to be more knowledgeable than males, female involvement in prevention and information of COVID-19 in the family dynamics of the Saudi context is worth considering. Moreover, male participants' knowledge should be improved through health education.

AB  - Several studies of innovative work practices show a positive link with firm performance and employees' task involvement, organizational commitment and citizenship behaviours. One of the recent changes faced by firms is the introduction of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). Although several empirical studies analyse the links between ICT use, innovative work practices and firm performance, employee-level analyses are scarce. Using data from the European Working Condition Survey (EWCS), this article investigates the relationships between use of the Internet and computers and positive attitudes among employees (social support, job satisfaction, extra effort) in the European context. Our empirical results are based on data for more than 9500 employees from 16 European countries in 2005, and more than 14 000 in 2010. Among the different effects of ICT use, based on the results for the 2005, 2010 and the pooled 2005-2010 sample, and in a within-cohorts change analysis, we find that Internet use is positively related to employees' job satisfaction and extra effort. We find that computer use is not related to employees' behaviours. We find also that most of the innovative work practices considered are positively related to employees' positive attitudes.

AB  - Purpose This paper discusses the need for government and healthcare organization to implement mobile phone-based solutions for healthcare during the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. It also highlights the challenges and/or barriers to the rapid introduction, implementation and management of these and other innovative solutions to health service delivery during the current situation Design/methodology/approach The data include both qualitative and quantitative, collected from the primary interview-based case study and questionnaire survey. It also uses insights from the general populations, healthcare professionals and health information technology developers to understand the role of a mobile health intervention in the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Findings Healthcare professionals and health information technology developers are confident that the use of mobile health technology and applications has the ability to assist in monitoring and controlling the COVID-19 outbreak. The key advantages of using mobile phone technology are: increased awareness, improved assistance in tracking and testing casualties, improved assistance in seeking and scheduling health information and medical appointments, increased social distancing, improved overall productivity and quality of life. However, data demonstrated that lack of awareness and accessibility or unwillingness to use the technology, complex healthcare needs, application infrastructure, policies and a dearth of training and support are all barriers to successful implementation of this useful tool. Practical implications This research has the potential to make a significant impact on government and healthcare policy through presenting a coherent argument for the importance of designing and deploying mobile health technology and applications for the general population. Originality/value prior literature in this domain is inadequate in explaining the importance of mobile phone-based healthcare solutions for health service and during serious disease outbreaks and, in particular, within the Indian context. The findings of this study can be used by government and healthcare organizations to improve health governance during the current global pandemic.

AB  - This paper presents findings from an evaluation of the Computer Clubs for Girls, an initiative originally delivered in the South East of England, designed to encourage more girls to take up information technology (IT) courses and careers. By targeting girls aged 10-14, the club aimed to provide members with a gender relevant' experience of IT, tackling issues of access, confidence and negative attitudes about IT. The evaluation, conducted over four years, included the collection of quantitative and qualitative data from members and non-members of the clubs. It included a longitudinal component in order to assess the longer-term impacts of the club. The findings support the critical view that initiatives based on assumptions about the relationship between girls and IT misinterpret the problem' about female under-representation in IT, and are unlikely to have a significant or sustained impact on what remains an occupational and subject area divided by gender typing. The paper argues for an approach which challenges the social and cultural discourses that maintain this gender divide.

AB  - This study relies on the core ideas of the health belief model and suggests that short informational videos on Internet 'addiction' can be an effective means towards preventing problematic use of the Internet through their ability to drive changes in viewers' attitudes towards reducing their Internet use. Building on the heuristic-systematic model of information processing viewpoint, it is further suggested that this attitude change is guided by the information the videos provide, as well as the surprise emotion they generate. To test this model, data were collected at three points in time from 223 participants who were exposed to one of two video interventions. Partial least-square analyses indicated that the videos were efficacious in improving viewers' attitudes towards reducing their Internet use, after accounting for viewers' preexisting attitudes, levels of Internet 'addiction', demographics and social desirability bias. Consistent with the heuristic-systematic model of information-processing perspective this effect was mobilised simultaneously through the information and surprise induced by the videos.

AB  - As information technologies continue to evolve, the gap between those who were born before (digital immigrants) and after (digital natives) the technology revolution continues to widen. Building on the technology acceptance model, we examine the determinants and influences on attitudes towards using FinTech services and analyze differences in attitudes between the two categories of consumers. The results show the relevance of digital literacy, financial literacy, perceived ease of use and the personal habits of consumers in prompting a positive attitude towards the use of FinTech services. Digital natives have stronger personal habits oriented towards information systems; they rate their own levels of digital literacy higher and also perceive ease of use in FinTech. Digital immigrants rate their levels of financial literacy higher. The research highlights the relevance of improving the financial literacy of digital natives and the digital literacy of digital immigrants. Moreover, it is important to investigate further measures that would increase the perceived ease of use of FinTech by digital immigrants.

AB  - Past research suggested thatfrom the perspective of perpetratorsanimal metaphors are a powerful means to reinforce social exclusion and to foster hostile behaviors against the targets of social exclusion. In the current work, we focus on the consequences of this dehumanizing form of social exclusion from the perspective of victims. In two studies, we manipulated the presence of animal metaphors in a variety of contexts of interpersonal social exclusion. Our results showed that when social exclusion is associated with animal metaphors, its consequences are exacerbated. In particular, labelling targets of social exclusion as animals indirectly caused them to display more aggressive tendencies compared with when they are labelled with corresponding offending, but nondehumanizing, attributes. Crucially, this increased aggressiveness was mediated by higher perceptions of being treated (Study 1) or viewed (Study 2) by others as animal-like. Overall, our research showed the detrimental effects of the interplay between social exclusion and animal metaphors from the perspective of victims.

AB  - Previous research demonstrates that attitude certainty influences the degree to which an attitude changes in response to persuasive appeals. In the current research, decoding emotions from facial expressions and incidental processing fluency, during attitude formation, are examined as antecedents of both attitude certainty and attitude change. In Experiment 1, participants who decoded anger or happiness during attitude formation expressed their greater attitude certainty, and showed more resistance to persuasion than participants who decoded sadness. By manipulating the emotion decoded, the diagnosticity of processing fluency experienced during emotion decoding, and the gaze direction of the social targets, Experiment 2 suggests that the link between emotion decoding and attitude certainty results from incidental processing fluency. Experiment 3 demonstrated that fluency in processing irrelevant stimuli influences attitude certainty, which in turn influences resistance to persuasion. Implications for appraisal-based accounts of attitude formation and attitude change are discussed.

AB  - Social exclusion amongst rural-dwelling older adults and the role of the diversity of people and places in mediating the construction of that exclusion has not been adequately investigated or conceptualised in the international literature. Consequently, how ageing in a rural community can function to disadvantage or protect older people remains poorly understood. With the aim of advancing conceptual understanding on rural old-age social exclusion, this article explores how exclusion is manifest in the lifecourse experiences of rural-dwelling older adults and the role of mediating factors in the construction of exclusion in different kinds of rural places. The analysis draws on ten rural case-study sites across Ireland and Northern Ireland, encompassing five kinds of rural communities: dispersed rural; remote rural; island rural; village rural; and near-urban rural. Data come from 106 interviews with older people ranging in age from 59 to 93 years. Rural old-age social exclusion is confirmed as a multi-dimensional construct, involving: social relations; service infrastructure; transport and mobility; safety, security and crime; and financial and material resources. This analysis demonstrates that social exclusion for rural-dwelling older people is multi-layered, and its prevalence and form is shaped by four mediating factors: individual capacities; lifecourse trajectories; place; and macro-economic forces. The findings are used to present a conceptual framework that emphasises the role of mediating forces on rural old-age social exclusion.

AB  - Online reviews have become a significant information source for customers in decision-making. Such reviews are particularly important to firms like Airbnb as consumers have limited direct information regarding the quality of the property and the services. Researchers and practitioners, in general, favor positive reviews as they increase customers' booking intentions. However, this study theorizes that positive reviews could backfire and induce negative consequences under certain circumstances. More specifically, this research examines the interaction effects between the cause of an expectation disconfirmation and review dispersion on customers' attitudes and behavioral intention. Results indicated that when an expectation disconfirmation was caused by reviewers, participants showed more negative attitudes and lower intentions to spread positive WOM and repurchase when review dispersion was low (vs. high). In contrast, when the expectation disconfirmation was caused by property descriptions, participants reported similar responses regardless of review dispersion. Further, such interaction effects were mediated by perceived fairness.

AB  - Background: For over 25 years cord blood has been used as an alternative to bone marrow for therapeutic use in conditions of the blood, immune system and metabolic disorders. Parents can decide if they would like to privately store their infant's cord blood for later use if needed or to publicly donate it. Parents need to be aware of the options that exist for their infant's cord blood and have access to the relevant information to inform their choice. The aim of this paper is to identify parent's knowledge and awareness of cord blood donation, private banking options and stem cell use, and parent sources and preferred sources of this information.
   Methods: An integrative review was conducted using several electronic databases to identify papers on parents' knowledge, attitudes and attitudes towards umbilical cord blood donation and banking. The CASP tool was used to determine validity and quality of the studies included in the review.
   Results: The search of the international literature identified 25 papers which met review inclusion criteria. This integrative review identified parents' knowledge of cord banking and/or donation as low, with awareness of cord blood banking options greater than knowledge. Parents were found to have positive attitudes towards cord blood donation including awareness of the value of cord blood and its uses, with the option considered to be an ethical and altruistic choice. Knowledge on cord blood use were mixed; many studies' participants did not correctly identify uses. Information sources for parents on cord blood was found to be varied, fragmented and inconsistent. Health professionals were identified as the preferred source of information on cord blood banking for parents.
   Conclusions: This integrative review has identified that further research should focus on identifying information that expectant parents require to assist them to make informed choices around cord blood banking; and identifying barriers present for health professionals providing evidence based information on cord blood use and banking options.

AB  - Nowadays, we cannot ignore the fact that young children are over flooded with technologies. Only a proper action and a positive attitude from adults can prevent potential negative consequences, and prepares the child for a life where the usage of communication technologies (ICTs) is necessary for an individual's social success. This article represents the child's access to information-communication technology, its usage at home, the influence of child's ICTs usage on his or hers development of competences, and the child's relation with the ICTs at home. The data was gathered with the help of 130 parents who filled out a questionnaire and provided us with their opinions about their four-year-old children and their usage of ICTs at home. We found out that four-year-old children in their home environment regularly encounter ICTs. Besides that, we were also interested whether there exist differences according to the child's gender and the parents' level of education. Moreover, we present parents' opinions at suggestions for further studying of this issue.

AB  - Based on a literature review on factors that explain media effects and previous findings on media coverage and public opinion on nuclear power, this article examines the effects of Fukushima on media coverage and public opinion in Germany in two studies. The first study uses content analysis data to analyse changes in media coverage, and the second one is based on panel survey data to examine attitude changes on an individual level. The results of both studies show changes in media coverage and public opinion on nuclear power. Furthermore, the second study reveals that individual attitude changes cannot necessarily be explained by the same factors as the distribution of attitudes.

AB  - In this article, I use a case study analysis of two white nationalist movements online, in the Australian context, to consider whether the prevalence and everyday uses of social media by white nationalist groups today has impacted on race relations and multiculturalism in Australia 12 years after the Cronulla riots. Social media affordances present a set of conditions that were absent during the 2005 riot, and yet, are today mobilising distinct variants of white nationalism online. Rather than these expressions being locally situated, social media allows these performances to be connected up virtually, extending the white nationalists' capacity to occupy and terrorise a range of networked public and intimate spaces and influence mainstream political culture. Nonetheless social media affordances, which situate these movements in a virtual 'ecology of subcultures' also contributes to their instability and ambivalence, with the uncivil 'trolling' practices of online movements undermining broader social goals and contributing to even more extreme and unstable expressions online.

This paper develops a comprehensive model for political attitude estimation leveraging the Facebook Like information of the users. We designed a Facebook Crawler that efficiently collects data overcoming the difficulties in crawling Ajax enabled Facebook pages. We show that the category level selection can reduce the data analysis complexity utilizing the sparsity of the huge like-attitude matrix. In the Korean Facebook users' context, only 28 criteria (3% of the total) can estimate the political polarity of the user with high accuracy (AUC of 0.82).

AB  - This study evaluated the effectiveness of the In One Voice campaign for raising mental health awareness and improving attitudes of youth and young adults towards mental health issues. The campaign featured a prominent male sports figure talking about mental health issues and used online social media.
   A successive independent samples design assessed market penetration and attitudinal changes among the young people. Two samples completed an online questionnaire either immediately before (T1: n = 403) or 2 months after (T2: n = 403) the campaign launch. Website analytics determined changes in activity levels of a youth-focused mental health website (mindcheck.ca).
   One-quarter (24.8 %, n = 100) of the respondents remembered the campaign. The proportion of respondents who were aware of the website increased significantly from 6.0 % at T1 to 15.6 % at T2. Average overall scores on standardized measures of personal stigma and social distance were not significantly different between T1 and T2 respondents. Attitudes towards mental health issues were statistically similar between respondents who were or were not exposed to the campaign. Those who were exposed to the campaign were significantly more likely to talk about and seek information relating to mental health issues.
   The proximal outcomes of the campaign to increase awareness and use of the website were achieved. The distal outcome of the campaign to improve attitudes towards mental health issues was not successfully achieved. The brief social media campaign improved mental health literacy outcomes, but had limited effect on personal stigma and social distance.

AB  - Two studies investigated whether performing green behaviors may influence people's political attitudes regarding climate change. A survey study revealed that self-reported green behaviors indirectly predicted American participants' political attitudes regarding climate change, and that this relationship was mediated by their green self-perceptions. This relationship was relatively stronger for conservatives than for liberals. An experimental study included two conditions: one which led people to perceive that they often performed green behaviors and another that led them to perceive that they failed to perform green behaviors. Political-orientation was found to moderate the effect of green behavior perceptions on ratings of the importance of climate-related issues and on support for emissions-reducing policies. Liberals reported greater importance and greater policy support when perceiving that they failed to act green, while conservatives did not. Implications for green behavior campaigns and their political spillover effects are discussed.

AB  - Information communication technologies (ICT) are an integral part of contemporary family life, though the existing research about its impact is scarce, less than definitive, and individually based, as well as failing to attend to cross-cultural and cross-national dimensions. This study investigates how family clinicians construe the impact of ICT in the clinical context. A survey directed at family clinicians (N = 258) in four countries (Canada, Mexico, Spain and the USA) was designed to gather data on their beliefs about the impact of the emerging ICT on families and on their own clinical practice. The study found differences in the use of ICT across countries and correlation analyses showed there were more positive attitudes about the impact of emerging ICT on family dynamics among the clinicians whose use them the most.
   Practitioner points A constructive attitude towards emerging technology may enhance the effective use of technology in family therapy. The use of technology for personal and professional purposes by therapists may elicit appreciative conversations with families about its impact on family processes. Emerging digital technologies may enable clinicians to involve family members in virtual exercises and participation.

AB  - In the absence of an effective vaccine or treatment, the current best defence against COVID-19 is social distancing - staying at home as much as possible, keeping distance from others, and avoiding large gatherings. Although social distancing improves physical health in terms of helping to reduce viral transmission, its psychological consequences are less clear, particularly its effects on memory. In this research, we investigated the effect of social distancing duration on negative moods and memory. The relation between social distancing duration and both negative mood and memory errors followed the same U-shaped function: negative moods and memory errors initially decreased as social distancing duration increased, and then at approximately 30 days, they began to increase. Subsequent analyses indicated that memory errors were mediated by lonely mood in particular. Thus, short-term social distancing might benefit psychological well-being and memory performance, but extended social distancing has a negative impact on mood and memory.

AB  - Purpose: Youth smoking is a global public health concern. Health educators are increasingly using Internet-based technologies, but the effectiveness of Internet viral marketing in promoting health remains uncertain. This prospective pilot study assessed the efficacy of an online game-based viral marketing campaign in promoting a smoke-free attitude among Chinese adolescents.
   Methods: One hundred and twenty-one Hong Kong Chinese adolescents aged 10 to 24 were invited to participate in an online multiple-choice quiz game competition designed to deliver tobacco-related health information. Participants were encouraged to refer others to join. A zero-inflated negative binomial model was used to explore the factors contributing to the referral process. Latent transition analysis utilising a pre-and post-game survey was used to detect attitudinal changes toward smoking.
   Results: The number of participants increased almost eightfold from 121 to 928 (34.6% current or ex-smokers) during the 22-day campaign. Participants exhibited significant attitudinal change, with 73% holding negative attitudes toward smoking after the campaign compared to 57% before it. The transition probabilities from positive to negative and neutral to negative attitudes were 0.52 and 0.48, respectively. It was also found that attempting every 20 quiz questions was associated with lower perceived smoking decision in future (OR = 0.95, p-value <0.01).
   Conclusions: Our online game-based viral marketing programme was effective in reaching a large number of smoking and non-smoking participants and changing their attitudes toward smoking. It constitutes a promising practical and cost-effective model for engaging young smokers and promulgating smoking-related health information among Chinese adolescents.

AB  - This article examines how peer communication among adolescents (14-16 years) affects the evaluation of social advertising (i.e. targeted ad that adopts the social proof heuristic by using an individual's social ties as endorsers for a brand) on social networking sites (SNSs). More precisely, the focus lies on how engaging in online peer chatting on these social platforms alters persuasion knowledge and attitude towards the ad. In order to test this, two between-subjects experiments were conducted in which adolescents chatted with peers on a mock SNS that contained a social ad. In Experiment 1, results reveal that a social ad generates a more positive attitude among adolescents when they have engaged in online peer communication, and at the same time, triggers less persuasion knowledge. In Experiment 2, the depth of the relationship between the chatters (tie strength) plays a significant moderating role as peer communication with strong ties yields greater effects, compared to communication with weak ties. These findings reveal important social influence dynamics that may alter the elaboration of persuasive communication, leading to valuable theoretical and practical implications.

AB  - Our paper tackles the novel issues of the economic impacts and innovations in tourism marketing in the 21st century. The paper examines the economic impact of tourism and its influence on the economy and the tourism industry in general from the angle of innovations in the tourism marketing and the new challenges for the tourism industry brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic that disrupted international tourism and caused major economic losses to the industry. We analyse the changes that the coronavirus pandemic made to the tourism industry and focus on the novel trends in tourism marketing that embeds the new informational technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), online Zoom tours, and other novelties that emerged after the lockdowns and social distancing imposed in the first half of 2020 in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus infection. Our results show that tourism marketing in the 21st century should be based on sustainable management and provide the right answers to questions about the impacts of tourism on the economy without sacrificing positive economic growth. We also show that information technologies might offer viable alternatives to massive international over-tourism and package tours ensuring both the safety of travel and deeper immersion into the travel experience before, during, and after the trip. Our outcomes might be useful for tourism scholars, policymakers, as well as stakeholders specializing in international tourism marketing.

AB  - People with strong (vs. moderate) political attitudes have been shown to exhibit less phasic reactivity to perceptual anomalies, presumably to prevent their committed meaning systems from being challenged by novel experiences. Several researchers have proposed that (but not tested whether) firmly committed individuals also engage in more attentional suppression of anomalies, likely mediated by prestimulus alpha power. We expected participants with strong (vs. moderate) political attitudes to display increased pre-stimulus alpha power when processing perceptual anomalies. We recorded electrophysiological activity during the presentation of normal cards (control group) or both normal and anomalous playing cards (experimental group; total N = 191). In line with our predictions, the presence of anomalous playing cards in the stimulus set increased prestimulus alpha power only among individuals with strong but not moderate political attitudes. As potential markers of phasic reactivity, we also analyzed the late positive potential (LPP) and earlier components of the event-related potential, namely P1, N1, and P300. The moderating effect of extreme attitudes on ERP amplitudes remained inconclusive. Altogether, our findings support the idea that ideological conviction is related to increased tonic responses to perceptual anomalies.

Conducted some twenty years since the first studies on this topic, the current study provides an updated perspective into language attitudes toward the use of Roman-alphabeted Greek (henceforth, Greeklish) in emails and SMS messages exchanged between Greek native speakers. Adapting the matched guise methodology commonly used in language attitude research to visual stimuli, we collected data from 6o participants of different ages and genders. Overall, their attitudes toward Greeklish were markedly negative, confirming negative attitudes already expressed twenty years prior but also extending them. We propose that technological and demographic but also ideological factors underlie the negative attitudes toward Greeklish expressed by Greek native speakers today.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is largely caused by airborne transmission, a phenomenon that rapidly gained the attention of the scientific community. Social distancing is of paramount importance to limit the spread of the disease, but to design social distancing rules on a scientific basis the process of dispersal of virus-containing respiratory droplets must be understood. Here, we demonstrate that available knowledge is largely inadequate to make predictions on the reach of infectious droplets emitted during a cough and on their infectious potential. We follow the position and evaporation of thousands of respiratory droplets by massive state-of-the-art numerical simulations of the airflow caused by a typical cough. We find that different initial distributions of droplet size taken from literature and different ambient relative humidity lead to opposite conclusions: (1) most versus none of the viral content settles in the first 1-2 m; (2) viruses are carried entirely on dry nuclei versus on liquid droplets; (3) small droplets travel less than 2.5 m versus more than 7.5 m. We point to two key issues that need to be addressed urgently in order to provide a scientific foundation to social distancing rules: (I1) a careful characterisation of the initial distribution of droplet sizes; (I2) the infectious potential of viruses carried on dry nuclei versus liquid droplets.

AB  - The hundreds of millions of floating people in China who leave their hometown for a new city to improve their standard of living constitute an important phenomenon, but as yet the ethical predicaments they face, such as low compensation equity and high social exclusion, have attracted little attention. With a national sample of 125,626 floating people in China, this study investigated how and when compensation equity influences prosocial behavior through the lens of justice theory. This study found that floating people's compensation equity positively influences prosocial behavior, and this relationship is mediated by subjective well-being (SWB). This study also supported that multilevel social exclusion, including the perception of social exclusion and provincial social exclusion strength, positively moderates the relationship between compensation equity and SWB. Moreover, the perception of social exclusion and provincial social exclusion strength moderate the mediating effect of SWB between compensation equity and prosocial behavior. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications are further discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND To limit the spread of the COVID-19 emergency, a massive vaccination program was implemented and restrictive measures were imposed on the population. However, the propensity to adhere to the vaccination program has struggled to take off. Moreover, complying with the restrictive rules and maintaining social distancing have been highly distressing for many individuals.
   PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE Italian participants (N = 140, females = 65%, mean age = 29.50, SD = 10.80) were presented with an online survey consisting of multiple-choice questions and two single-category implicit association tests (SC-IATs). One SC-IAT evaluated the tendency of participants to automatically associate personal protective equipment (PPE) and vaccines with safety or danger; the other evaluated their tendency to automatically associate social situations with good or bad. Multiple-choice questions explored individual, social, and environmental factors that were expected to contribute to vaccine propensity, compliance with restrictive rules, and feelings of distress.
   RESULTS Using scientific information sources was related to implicitly associating PPE and vaccines with safety, which in turn was associated with the propensity to get the vaccine. Moreover, being female, young, unsatisfied with social relationships, having suffered health and economic consequences due to the pandemic, and having negative implicit attitudes toward social situations contributed to increasing feelings of distress.
   CONCLUSIONS Communication may contribute to individuals' behavior and preferences and it can also be associated with implicit attitudes, becoming consequently one of the main leverages to reduce vaccine hesitancy. Recovery programs should prioritize the development of interventions aimed at fostering psychological well-being through the enhancement of social contacts.

AB  - Although social exclusion is often described as an outcome of paternal imprisonment, few studies have directly measured the extent of social exclusion in prisoners' families or benchmarked it against the general population. This paper compares social exclusion among caregivers of children affected by paternal incarceration with overall estimates of social exclusion across the Australian population and with estimates of social exclusion among a matched subset. Caregivers of children with imprisoned fathers were much more heavily excluded than adults in the general population. Compared to a matched sample, differences were smaller and mostly related to inadequate financial resources. We propose that single parent status and financial hardship are key mediators of the relationship between paternal incarceration and social exclusion.

AB  - The present data set contains self-report data of German individuals participating in a longitudinal data assessment via online surveys conducted in the year preceeding the general elections in Germany.
   Data of N = 122 individuals are included in the data set. Those individuals participated in an initial, extensive survey between November 2020 and February 2021 (T1) as well as in a final survey after the general German elections, thus, between the end of September 2021 and October 2021 (T3). Of those individuals, n = 93 additionally participated in an intermediate survey in between the previously mentioned ones between the end of May and the end of June 2021 (T2).
   Next to the assessment of sociodemographic variables, information on (political) news consumption, such as the frequency of being confronted with counter-attitudinal news, and on political attitudes, for example via current voting intentions for one of the major German parties, were assessed in the initial survey (T1).
   In the intermediate survey (T2), participants provided information on recent political news consumption habits including the frequency of being confronted with counter-attitudinal news, current voting intentions for one of the major German parties, as well as on extraordinary events that happened recently and impacted their voting intentions. In the final survey (T3), sociodemographic variables and actual voting decisions in the general German elections in 2021 were assessed. Moreover, variables on recent political news consumption habits, including the frequency of being confronted with counter-attitudinal news, and extraordinary events that happened recently and impacted voting decisions were assessed. Finally, a detailed self-report questionnaire retrospectively assessing political news consumption for the time between participation in the initial survey (T1) and the final survey (T3) was completed by participants. Not only did this questionnaire assess which online and offline news channels (e.g., TV, print, news websites) participants used. Besides, the questionnaire included items on how many outlets per channel were used and the frequency of being confronted with counter-attitudinal news within each channel. This data set is provided alongside the present article to be used for further investigations of the stability of voting intentions, thus, political attitudes. Moreover, a content analysis of the open responses on which extraordinary events happened and impacted voting intentions/decisions can provide further knowledge on factors influencing voting intentions and their variability versus stability.

AB  - This paper explores how politics is experienced by actors who mediate neighborhood organizations and formal political institutions in the Northeastern city of Salvador da Bahia, in Brazil. It is based on a series of ethnographic interviews in 2004 among identified community leaders in the city's poorer neighborhoods, with attention to their politics of habitus-their socially-situated modes of expression of political proclivities. While all of our informants identified themselves as Black and identified racial structures as shaping their lives, their understandings and evaluations of formal politics were divided. Those who only mediated between the neighborhood and formal institutions were critical of the world of politics and its polluting influence. Those who were also involved in mediating publics tended to experience formal politics as unjust but ultimately accessible through legitimate Black political action. This distinction helps account for the difficulty in mobilizing around a reformist political project and adds a local and political dimension to the understanding of race relations in Brazil.

AB  - Background: The International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) has established an interim guidance of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for pharmacists worldwide. The aim of this study was to identify the implementation of FIP guidance in China and provide applicable strategies for further actions. Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional survey on Chinese pharmacists was distributed electronically through groups of WeChat between 9 December 2020 and 18 December 2020. The 29-item questionnaire for the survey was designed based on the FIP guidance and knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) framework. Results: A total of 237 responses from 237 pharmacists (69.20% females) were received. Most pharmacists (81.86%) participated in work related to COVID-19. Respondents referred to other guidelines or consensus more than they did to FIP guidance. Most participants were qualified for the knowledge-based questions regarding COVID-19 (67.51%), had positive attitudes towards pharmacists' roles and actions (61.18%), and were qualified in the practices of prevention measures, infection risk monitoring, and pharmacists' advice (50.63%). Several factors were revealed as having impact on pharmacists' KAP, such as the relevance of participating in work related to COVID-19, work entailments, and information source. Conclusions: The FIP guidance has a certain degree of dissemination and implementation in China, which can be improved through effective actions directed towards impact factors.

AB  - Four studies investigated the link between cross-race friendships and attraction. In Study 1, White Australian participants (N = 240) who reported friendships with racial outgroup members were more likely to report attraction to the members of the racial group their friends belonged to. Studies 2a (N = 300 White American participants) and 2b (N = 303 White British participants) showed that experiences of cross-race non-verbal intimacy, perceived cross-race reciprocity in attraction, positive perceived ingroup norms about dating cross-racially, and warmth toward the racial outgroup were particularly important in explaining the friendship-attraction link in majority samples. Study 3 (N = 292 Black British participants) showed that in addition to the mediators above, self-disclosure was key to explaining the friendship-attraction link for racial minority group members. These findings extend the contact literature by exploring the specificity and mediators of the link between contact and attraction in the context of race relations.

AB  - Promotions for online sports betting during televised sports broadcasts are regularly viewed by millions of Australians, raising concerns about their impacts on vulnerable groups including at-risk and problem gamblers. This study examined whether responses to these promotions varied with problem gambling severity amongst 455 Australian Internet sports bettors participating in an online survey. Results indicated that young male Internet sports bettors are especially vulnerable to gambling problems, particularly if they hold positive attitudes to gambling sponsors who embed promotions into sports broadcasts and to the promotional techniques they use and this heightens the risk that alluring messages contribute to excessive gambling. As problem gambling severity increased, so too did recognition that these promotions have impacted negatively on their sports betting behaviour. Because a plethora of sports betting brands and promotions are now heavily integrated into sports coverage, social marketing efforts are needed to offset their persuasive appeal and counter the positive attitudes towards them that appear linked to excessive gambling amongst Internet sports bettors.

AB  - Objective:
   We aimed to investigate the relationships between use of media to obtain information on radiation and radiation anxiety among community residents in Fukushima, 5.5 years after the nuclear power plant accident.
   Methods:
   A questionnaire survey was administered between August and October 2016 to 2000 randomly sampled residents in Fukushima prefecture. Radiation anxiety toward health and regarding discrimination and prejudice were assessed with 4- and 3-item scales, respectively. Participants nominated their most-used media for acquiring information on radiation by choosing up to 3 sources from 12 information sources listed (eg, local newspaper, TV news, websites, social networking sites [SNS], local government newsletter, word of mouth). We investigated associations of most-used media types and radiation anxiety, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and anxiety regarding radiation's health effects immediately after the accident, using multivariate linear regression analyses.
   Results:
   Valid responses were obtained from 790 (39.5%) residents. Acquiring information about radiation by word of mouth was related to higher radiation anxiety toward health. Regarding radiation anxiety concerning discrimination and prejudice, SNS use was related to higher anxiety, whereas acquiring information through Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK) TV news was related to lower anxiety.
   Conclusions:
   Interpersonal interactions rather than gaining information from media - characterized by unidirectional information exchange - may increase radiation anxiety.

AB  - In the midst of a pandemic, the efficacy of official measures to mitigate the COVID-19 crisis largely depends on public attitudes towards them, where conspiracy beliefs represent potential threats to the efficacy of measures such as vaccination. Here, we present predictors and outcomes associated with a COVID-19 vaccination conspiracy belief. In a representative survey of Germany, sociodemographic predictors of this belief were found to include age, federal state, migration background and school leaving qualification. The study revealed correlations with trust in scientific and governmental information sources, respondents' self-assessment of being informed about science, general conspiracy mindedness, the frequency of using Twitter and messaging apps, as well as willingness to voluntarily take the COVID-19 vaccine. Our results cohere with and build on the general literature on conspiracy mindedness and related factors. The findings provide an evidence base for more effective health and crisis communication in Germany and beyond.

AB  - Evidence suggests that Arabic-speaking refugees in Australia seek help from informal sources, including religious and community leaders, when experiencing mental health issues. Despite their significant influence, there is scarce research exploring attitudes of Arabic-speaking leaders toward mental illness. The current exploratory study explored mental illness stigma and various factors among Arabic-speaking religious and community leaders. This study uses a subset of data from an evaluation trial of mental health literacy training for Arabic-speaking religious and community leaders. Our dataset contains the pre-intervention survey responses for 52 Arabic-speaking leaders (69.2% female; mean age = 47.1, SD = 15.3) on the ability to recognise a mental disorder, beliefs about causes for developing mental illness, and two stigma measures, personal stigma, and social distance. Being female was associated with a decrease in personal stigma. An increase in age was associated with an increase in personal stigma. Correct recognition of a mental disorder was associated with decreased personal stigma, and after adjusting for age and gender, significance was retained for the I-would-not-tell-anyone subscale. Endorsing the cause "being a person of weak character" was associated with an increase in personal stigma. There is an urgent need for future research to elucidate stigma to develop effective educational initiatives for stigma reduction among Arabic-speaking leaders.

AB  - Student academic performance and social competence are influenced positively by parent involvement; effective parent-teacher communication not builds parent reliance on a school, it enhances parent knowledge of raising children. As information technology develops rapidly, it is already a trend that e-communication is replacing traditional paper communication. Mobile phone messages could be a convenience tool to issue notices to parents and reduce conflicts due to negligence such as missing phone calls, forgotten alerts, etc. Therefore, this study investigates teacher behavior of adopting mobile phone messages as a parent-teacher communication medium by applying the TAM, C-TAM-TPB, and UTAUT models. The result posits that attitude should be treated as a mediator between perceived usefulness and behavior intention, even if the user perceives the new device is useful but does not hold a positive attitude toward the device. On the other hand, to most subjects, opinions from family and friends and expectations from superiors are important considerations when making decisions; those thoughts affect directly the intention to use the new system. The results also suggest that infrastructure maturity for mobile phone messaging improves intention to use, but actual use behavior relates to school policies, not teacher intention. To implement a messaging system successfully, authorities should provide inducements that not only attract teachers to use the system, but that foster positive attitudes toward the messaging system to further increase use intention.

AB  - This study examines the possible correlation between (a) digital empowerment and their teacher self-efficacy in general, (b) the level of prospective ELT teachers' digital empowerment and their teacher self-efficacy beliefs, (c) the level of regular ELT teachers' digital empowerment and their self-efficacy beliefs, and tries to see if prospective ELT teachers and regular ELT teachers differ in digital empowerment and their self-efficacy beliefs. A statistically significant correlation exits between digital empowerment and teacher self-efficacy in foreign language teaching context. All the same, a statistically significant correlation between the level of prospective ELT teachers' digital empowerment and their teacher self-efficacy beliefs has been observed as well as the significant correlation coefficient for their mentors. Additionally, we have seen correlations between self-efficacy and (a) motivation, (b) technical availability and utilization, and (c) competency in the use of technology. Moreover, it was found that prospective ELT teachers and regular ELT teachers only differ in digital empowerment but in self-efficacy. The only difference was observed in technical availability and utilization in favor of regular teachers (mentors). Therefore, it is concluded that foreign language teachers should become acquainted with digital technologies for more effective classroom teaching. To do so, motivation with positive attitudes towards information technologies, and feeling competent through more practice in pre-service foreign language teacher training programs at least in order to improve their self-efficacies by creating a positive classroom environment should be provided.

AB  - Background: Some 80% of the South African (SA) middle class consumers use washing machines, electric cookers, fridges, freezers and other appliances. Considering the growing water and electricity shortages in SA, the government advocates the use of green appliances. However, the factors helping or hindering the positive attitudes, purchase and use of green appliances need examination.
   Focus of the article: This study focuses on the first and second steps of the community-based social marketing (CBSM) framework, whereby for behavioral change, behaviors, their drivers and barriers are to be examined before strategy formulation. Thus, this study first assessed SA black middle class consumers' green appliances attitude, behavioral intention and actual behavior. It then integrated the Theory of Consumption Values (TCV), Diffusion of Innovations Theory (DOI), and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to examine the consumer-related and product-related factors helping or hindering the green appliances attitudes, behavioral intentions and actual behavior.
   Research Hypotheses: From the integration of the TCV, DOI and TPB, a conceptual model was developed that proposed that consumer-related factors (functional, conditional, epistemic, emotional and social values) and product-related factors (relative advantage, complexity, compatibility and observability) will influence green appliances attitude, which with perceived behavioral control will impact behavioral intention, proposed as a driver of actual behavior.
   Methods: Considering that the black middle-class are a fast growing and large (about 4.2 million South Africans) community of consumers, cross-sectional quantitative data was collected from 500 black middle class consumers through self-administered questionnaires. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling was used to test 14 hypotheses.
   Results: The respondents expressed positive attitudes toward green appliances (M = 5.80 on a 7-point Likert scale and positive intention to buy green appliances (M = 5.78). Most of the study participants have purchased one or more green appliances (M = 6.09). The integrated model explained 84.5% of attitude toward green appliances. The significant drivers of attitude were functional, conditional, and epistemic values (consumer-related factors), and relative advantage, compatibility, and observability (product-related factors). The attitude, social value and perceived behavioral control explained 83.1% of behavioral intention, which with PBC explained 24.2% of actual behavior.
   Recommendations for practice: Considering that the third step of the CBSM framework is to develop strategies for behavioral change, the South-African government, environmental agencies and social marketers should seek ways to reward the large segment of black middle class consumers, so that their positive green appliances attitudes and behavioral intentions can further be converted to actual purchase. The consumer-related and product-related drivers of attitudes and purchase behaviors identified in this study should be used to position and promote green appliances using the middle class consumers as opinion leaders or endorsers.
   Limitations: The main limitation is the use of a survey which limits provision of deeper insights into drivers and barriers of green appliances attitudes and behaviors.

AB  - In recent years, advances in mobile communications technology have enabled collaborative consumption or product sharing between consumers on a large scale. Unlike traditional consumption, collaborative consumption is based on collaboration among individuals, so that the decision-making mechanisms of individual consumers may be different from those in traditional consumption scenarios. The current study focuses on how the social distance between consumers and drivers affects collaborative consumption intention in the case of online carhailing services. In this study, the theory of planned behavior (TPB) is used as the foundational framework, and we innovatively add the concept of social distance to the TPB to form a new, and integrated model. We test the model based on data collected from 315 online car-hailing users. The results shows that behavioral attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, positively influence collaborative consumption intention and behavior. More interestingly, we find that social distance has both direct and indirect impacts on collaborative consumption intention: The greater the social distance, the lower the collaborative consumption intention. Moreover, social distance also moderates the influence of subjective norms and perceived behavioral control on collaborative consumption intention. To be specific, the influence of subjective norms and perceived behavioral control on collaborative consumption intention is weakened when consumers perceive less social distance. The results suggest that the integrated model has a stronger explanatory power on collaborative consumption behavior. This study enhances the traditional TPB model and offers insight into promoting collaborative consumption in the context of the sharing economy.

AB  - Research has frequently found that students use their information and communication technologies-such as smartphones and laptops-for non-academic uses in the classroom. These uses include sending messages as well as checking email and social media accounts. This study aimed to examine students' in-class information and communication technology use, their motivations for it, and perceptions of it, as well as their attitudes toward restriction and integration of information and communication technologies in the classroom. It was found that students most frequently engage in non-academic information and communication technology use when they feel that they would not miss any new class content, or when they feel disengaged. Students perceived that their non-academic information and communication technology use had costs, especially distraction. However, students also reported negative attitudes toward policies that would restrict their information and communication technology use in the classroom but had positive perceptions of attempts to integrate information and communication technology use. We propose that information and communication technology integration can be an effective method of increasing student engagement-and therefore decreasing non-academic information and communication technology use.

AB  - The strength of health science students' identification with their chosen profession is associated with their attitudes towards interprofessional education (IPE). However, little is known about the factors that might mediate this relationship. In this article, we examine the relationships between professional identification, communication and teamwork skills, perceived relevance of IPE, and positive and negative attitudes towards IPE. A sample of 444 first-year university students from 25 health science professions enrolled in a first-year interprofessional program participated in this research by completing a questionnaire. Data were analysed using path analysis. Positive IPE attitudes were more strongly endorsed than negative IPE attitudes. Perceived relevance of IPE to future careers was the strongest predictor of both positive and negative attitudes to IPE, and fully mediated the effect of professional identity. Self-reported communication and teamwork skills were a significant negative predictor of negative attitudes to IPE only, and the effect was not mediated by perceived relevance. These findings indicate that IPE may be particularly challenging for students who do not have confidence in their abilities to communicate and work effectively in teams. Building these skills through alternative communication technologies may decrease negative attitudes. In order to maintain or increase positive attitudes towards IPE in introductory programs that span professions, the curriculum needs to be designed to demonstrate relevance to the future careers of participating students.

AB  - Purpose The recent and rapid growth of social networking site (SNS) use presents a unique public health opportunity to develop effective strategies for the recruitment of hard-to-reach participants for cancer research studies. This survey investigated childhood cancer survivors' reported use of SNS such as Facebook or MySpace and their perceptions of using SNS, for recruitment into survivorship research.
   Methods Sixty White, Black, and Hispanic adult childhood cancer survivors (range 18-48 years of age) that were randomly selected from a larger childhood cancer study, the Chicago Healthy Living Study, participated in this pilot survey. Telephone surveys were conducted to understand current SNS activity and attitudes towards using SNS as a cancer research recruitment tool.
   Results Seventy percent of participants reported SNS usage of which 80 % were at least weekly users and 79 % reported positive attitudes towards the use of SNS as a recruitment tool for survivorship research.
   Implications for Cancer Survivors The results of this pilot study revealed that SNS use was high and regular among the childhood cancer survivors sampled. Most had positive attitudes towards using SNS for recruitment of research. The results of this pilot survey suggest that SNS may offer an alternative approach for recruitment of childhood cancer survivors into research.

At the same time we also note an increasing polarization of Belgian public opinion on this subject. Among the main actors to shape this public opinion are news media, as they contribute to or combat stereotyping of (sub)groups in the population. The purpose of the current study is to analyze to which extent media consumption and trust have an impact on public opinion on two minority groups - immigrants and refugees - in a representative sample of the Belgian adult population (n = 1500). We gathered data on Belgian news media consumption and trust, and attitudes on immigrants and refugees through an online questionnaire. The results indicate that Belgian adults hold more positive attitudes on immigrants than on refugees. The reading of quality online newspapers as well as high levels of trust in television and radio are correlated with a positive attitude towards both groups, whereas the consumption of commercial television and popular newspapers go along with a negative attitude. Fear of terrorism (negative relation) and a negative evaluation of media coverage of refugees (positive relation) also have a sizeable influence. In terms of regional differences within Belgium, we find that citizens in the Brussels Capital Region hold more positive attitudes towards both groups than those in Flanders and Wallonia.

AB  - This study investigates which factors predict whether consumers will pass on viral advertising communications to their friends on a social network site. A conceptual framework consisting of three attitudinal and three social predictors of forwarding online content was tested using three real-life advertising campaigns that were spread simultaneously through the Dutch social network site Hyves. Results show that viral advertising pass-on behavior was significantly predicted by a positive attitude toward the brand, the advertisement and toward viral advertising in general. For two of the three advertisements participants were more likely to forward the advertisement when the advertisement was received from a friend rather than a company. The present study is the first to investigate the predictors of actual pass-on behavior of viral advertisements in the context of a social network site, thereby significantly contributing to existing knowledge on the drivers of viral advertising success.

KW  - BELIEFS
AB  - Objective: Evidence-based practice (EBP) provides nurses with a method to use critically appraised and scientifically proven evidence for delivering quality health care to a specific population. The objective of this study was to explore nurses' awareness of, knowledge of, and attitude toward EBP and factors likely to encourage or create barriers to adoption. In addition, information sources used by nurses and their literature searching skills were also investigated.
   Method: A total of 2,100 copies of the questionnaire were distributed to registered nurses in 2 public hospitals in Singapore, and 1,486 completed forms were returned, resulting in a response rate of 70.8%.
   Results: More than 64% of the nurses expressed a positive attitude toward EBP. However, they pointed out that due to heavy workload, they cannot keep up to date with new evidence. Regarding self-efficacy of EBP-related abilities, the nurses perceived themselves to possess moderate levels of skills. The nurses also felt that EBP training, time availability, and mentoring by nurses with EBP experience would encourage them to implement EBP. The top three barriers to adopting EBP were lack of time, inability to understand statistical terms, and inadequate understanding of the jargon used in research articles. For literature searching, nurses were using basic search features and less than one-quarter of them were familiar with Boolean and proximity operators.
   Conclusion: Although nurses showed a positive attitude toward EBP, certain barriers were hindering their smooth adoption. It is, therefore, desirable that hospital management in Southeast Asia, particularly in Singapore, develop a comprehensive strategy for building EBP competencies through proper training. Moreover, hospital libraries should also play an active role in developing adequate information literacy skills among the nurses.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health problem in India. We surveyed medical students to assess their knowledge, attitudes, and factors associated with confidence in antibiotic prescribing intent. In this cross-sectional study, a convenience sample of 356 students were surveyed in July-August 2017 on AMR-related knowledge, attitudes, information sources and antimicrobial training. Antimicrobial resistance knowledge and attitude scores were calculated. Bivariate analysis using the chi-square test of independence and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis were used to investigate factors associated with confidence in antibiotic prescribing intent. A total of 347 students completed the survey; 64% agreed that strong knowledge of antibiotics is important in their medical careers; 61 % stated that they would like more education regarding appropriate use of antibiotics. The mean total knowledge score was 11.5 out of 31 (SD = 3.4), and the mean attitude score was 6.0 out of 16 (SD = 4.2). Although 13% of students were "very familiar"/"familiar" with the term "antimicrobial stewardship," only 35% of students felt "very confident" or "confident" in antimicrobial prescribing to patients in the future. On multivariate analysis, female gender, clinical vignette antimicrobial knowledge scores, positive attitude scores, awareness of Infection Control Policy, and > 3 years of antimicrobial prescribing clinical training were predictors of confidence in antimicrobial prescribing. A higher attitude score was independently associated with decreased confidence in antimicrobial prescribing intent. There is a need to improve education regarding AMR in the curriculum, and increase awareness of infection control policies and antimicrobial stewardship program in clinical settings.

AB  - Apartheid laws and policies served to create a hierarchy of four apparently distinct races in South Africa, which were systematically segregated from each other and provided with unequal access to material resources. The apartheid state was dissolved in 1994, and a new, democratic government installed, under relatively peaceful conditions. This special issue of the journal will examine the effects of this major social and political transformation on intergroup relations in South Africa. The present article outlines the history and nature of the transformation, and contextualizes aspects of race relations that will be explored in articles in this special issue.

Using textual analysis, the essay reads Asian subjectivities portrayed in the movie in the context of race relations in the United States, in Singapore, and between the United States and Asia. The essay concludes by discussing how yellowface mockery and ambivalence center whiteness in different ways for Asia-Asians and Asian Americans, and it argues for the continued relevance of yellowface theorizations for unpacking representations of Asian/American subjectivities in filmic texts that are produced by, for, and with Asians.

AB  - Knowledge sharing visibility (KSV) is a critical environmental factor which can reduce social loafing in knowledge sharing (KS). This is especially true in ICT-based KS in learning organisations. As such, it is imperative that we better understand how to design technology enabled knowledge management systems (KMS) to support high KSV. This article examines the impact of knowledge management technology functions (e.g. tracking, knowledge storing) on KSV through qualitative analysis of 16 semi-structured interviews with participants in a Chinese company. Impact and implications of use for their existing KMS are examined. This article also examined the effects of department characteristics (i.e. group size and task characteristics) and individual roles (i.e. employee positions) on the IT-KSV relationship. Results encourage applied statistical, tracking, knowledge distribution and knowledge storing functions for monitoring explicit KS, and suggest integration of visualised knowledge maps with communication tools (e.g. Instant Messenger (IM)) to support visibility for implicit KS. Findings also suggest that KM technologies are more salient on improving KSV in large department with routine tasks, and that low-level employees may have more positive attitude on accepting communication tools on sharing knowledge. Extension to use of Web 2.0 technologies (e.g. weblogs) in KMS is also explored.

AB  - ObjectiveIn this article, we investigate the third-person effect within the context of the decision by the New Orleans Times-Picayune in September 2012 to end daily print circulation in favor of a three-day-per-week publication schedule and online news offerings.
   MethodsWe utilize original survey data based on 1,043 telephone interviews with respondents living in the greater New Orleans area, including 530 landline respondents selected via random digit dialing and 513 respondents randomly selected from available cellular telephone blocks.
   ResultsWe find evidence of a third-person effect on judgments about changes at The Times-Picayune. New Orleans area residents worry that the decline of information will negatively affect the ability of others to keep up with the news. We also show that the effects are contingent upon physical location. The greater the distance from New Orleans, the more pronounced concerns are about the effect of the loss of this daily information source on others in the community.
   ConclusionsTo date, third-person effects have generally been studied within the context of enduring and established forms of communication, especially those viewed as having potential negative effectspolitically biased messages, other forms of propaganda, and communication that could harm reputations. In this article, we extend this work to show third-person effects persist within the context of declining news coverage.

AB  - Purpose The paper proposes a privacy-preserving artificial intelligence-enabled video surveillance technology to monitor social distancing in public spaces. Design/methodology/approach The paper proposes a new Responsible Artificial Intelligence Implementation Framework to guide the proposed solution's design and development. It defines responsible artificial intelligence criteria that the solution needs to meet and provides checklists to enforce the criteria throughout the process. To preserve data privacy, the proposed system incorporates a federated learning approach to allow computation performed on edge devices to limit sensitive and identifiable data movement and eliminate the dependency of cloud computing at a central server. Findings The proposed system is evaluated through a case study of monitoring social distancing at an airport. The results discuss how the system can fully address the case study's requirements in terms of its reliability, its usefulness when deployed to the airport's cameras, and its compliance with responsible artificial intelligence. Originality/value The paper makes three contributions. First, it proposes a real-time social distancing breach detection system on edge that extends from a combination of cutting-edge people detection and tracking algorithms to achieve robust performance. Second, it proposes a design approach to develop responsible artificial intelligence in video surveillance contexts. Third, it presents results and discussion from a comprehensive evaluation in the context of a case study at an airport to demonstrate the proposed system's robust performance and practical usefulness.

AB  - Although virtual reality technology is increasingly being used in tourism, its potential as a shopping tool and as an avenue for marketing and selling tourism products and services has not yet been examined. Likewise, very little is known about how exploring holiday packages through virtual reality affects behavioral intention to visit tourist destinations. This study aims to compare the visit intentions evoked and the process of booking holiday travel packages between an immersive virtual reality environment (displayed through Oculus head-mounted glasses) and a traditional web-based 2D platform. A causal model is proposed and tested for both designs. Using a between-subjects experimental design with a sample of 202 individuals, the experiences of two randomly selected groups were observed as they bought holiday tour packages to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The first group made a simulated purchase in an immersive virtual reality environment using a head-mounted device, and the second group made the purchase on a traditional e-commerce website. The findings revealed that the scores given to sense of presence, attitude change, and perceived ease of use were greater among those who made the purchase in the more immersive virtual reality environment. However, the relationships between the variables in the causal model were stronger for the classic website than for the virtual reality setting. Attitude change positively affected intention to visit a destination more in the virtual reality environment.

AB  - In the context of Australian debates about refugees and asylum seekers, this article examines the relationship between attitude, as a performative articulation of selfhood, and ethics of non-violence and welcome. Exploring how attitude change has been represented in the narrative of the Go Back To Where You Came From documentary, it is argued that attitude is a concept indelibly fixed within discourses of refugee arrivals in Australia and attitude change regularly posited as the process towards ethics. An example of attitude change in the documentary is discussed through Butler's ethics of non-violence and the ways in which recognition and the recognizability of the other operate to promote or stem an ethical responsiveness or welcome. This is followed by looking at how the Butler's account of frames as the social and political mechanisms that can prevent the recognition of the other as human or worthy of hospitality can be expanded to show how the production of an ethical relationship is aided by a disturbance in selfhood such that a subject can recognize his or her own vulnerability and hence the vulnerability of the other. How an expanded theory of ethics and hospitality plays out through attitude change is highlighted.

Though a growing number of studies analyze the strategy of such campaigns, it is not yet known how these efforts shaped the political attitudes and behaviors of Americans. We study this question using longitudinal data that describe the attitudes and online behaviors of 1,239 Republican and Democratic Twitter users from late 2017 merged with nonpublic data about the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) from Twitter. Using Bayesian regression tree models, we find no evidence that interaction with IRA accounts substantially impacted 6 distinctive measures of political attitudes and behaviors over a 1-mo period. We also find that interaction with IRA accounts were most common among respondents with strong ideological homophily within their Twitter network, high interest in politics, and high frequency of Twitter usage. Together, these findings suggest that Russian trolls might have failed to sow discord because they mostly interacted with those who were already highly polarized. We conclude by discussing several important limitations of our study-especially our inability to determine whether IRA accounts influenced the 2016 presidential election-as well as its implications for future research on social media influence campaigns, political polarization, and computational social science.

AB  - Although it is frequently used and is highly valued in practice, background music in non-fictional media formats has shown a broad spectrum of ambiguous results in previous empirical research. Scholars have often even advised against the use of music in formats such as television news, news magazines, and documentaries. Discrepancies in the effectiveness of background music have also been found in film and advertising research. In these research areas, the congruence between music and medium has been shown to be especially relevant for predicting music's effects. In this study, two experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of congruent and incongruent music in non-fictional media formats. The first experiment (N = 92) focused on music's expressed and induced emotions, recipients' memory performance, and the perceived credibility and general evaluation of the media format. Experiment 2 (N = 147) concentrated on attitude changes. As expected, carefully selected congruent background music (i.e., music expressing emotions and triggering associations fitting the media format's topic) positively influenced recipients' emotionalization, memory performance, and attitude change, as well as the perceived credibility and general evaluation of the media format. All of the measured effects can be considered medium or large (eta(2) =.11-.64).

AB  - This research explores the effects of visual representations of immigrants and refugees in U.S. news outlets. Study 1 examined news photographs about immigrants and refugees that were shared on Twitter by regional news outlets in all 50 states. Most photos contained either a human interest frame, featuring immigrants and refugees as everyday people, or a political frame, showcasing politicians. Study 2's experiment determined the effects of these visuals on participants' emotions and, in turn, their attitudes toward immigrants and refugees. The political frame increased negative emotions, leading to negative attitudes. The human interest frame increased positive emotions, enhancing positive attitudes.

AB  - Asian Americans are commonly perceived as perpetual foreigners and, therefore, not "true" Americans. Asian Americans report inquiries about nationality and English abilities as the most common forms of racial microaggressions perpetrated by White Americans (Sue, 2015). Race theorists assert that these microaggressions are race-related and marginalize Asian Americans. Scholars have claimed that these subtle acts are harmful, yet only a few studies have uncovered the mechanisms by which racial microaggressions affect mental and physical well-being (Ong, Burrow, Fuller-Rowell, Ja, & Sue, 2013; Wong, Derthick, David, Saw, & Okazaki, 2013). The current study conceptualized racial microaggressions as a stressor to address the major gaps in research. Specifically, this study (a) experimentally tested the race-related nature of the microaggression event to determine whether a White American perpetrator would elicit more stress in Asian Americans compared to an Asian American perpetrator and (b) examined threats to explicit and implicit self-esteem as possible mediators of microaggression-generated stress. Findings confirmed that the race of the perpetrator did have an impact on stress among Asian Americans. In the multiple meditation analysis, experience with a White American perpetrator, compared to an Asian American perpetrator, lowered implicit self-esteem, which resulted in more stress. Implications and strategies for counseling Asian American clients are discussed.

AB  - Background Pharmacists' involvement in outpatient dialysis centres in Australia is currently limited, despite the positive contribution of pharmacists to renal patients' medication management and health outcomes outlined in the literature. An expanded role for pharmacists in this setting may be required as a consequence of the increasing burden of renal disease in the population. Objective To explore renal-specialised hospital pharmacists' intentions to implement pharmacy services in outpatient dialysis centres. Setting Australian renal-specialised hospital pharmacists. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposeful sample of renal pharmacists recruited through the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia Renal Special Interest Group. The interview guide was developed based on the theory of planned behaviour. To identify behavioural intention, the three components of the theory-attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control-were explored. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically content analysed following a qualitative approach. Main Outcome Measures Pharmacists' views on their potential involvement and perceived ease or difficulty in implementing pharmacy services in outpatient dialysis centres. Results Thirteen renal pharmacists were interviewed until data saturation achievement. The following services for this setting were suggested: medication reconciliation, medication review, patient education, promotion of compliance, involvement in protocol development with subsequent anaemia/phosphate management. Pharmacists demonstrated positive attitudes towards the implementation of the services. Outcomes expected included benefits to patients, the renal team, and the pharmacy profession, as well as economic savings due to dose optimisation and improvement of patients' adherence. Subjective norm was favourable meaning that nephrologists, nurses and patients were expected to be receptive towards future pharmacy services. Barriers pointed out for the implementation comprised: funding, hospital administrators' approval, time and staff shortage, academic training, relationship with physicians, and attitudes of pharmacists, renal team, and patients. Facilitators mentioned by respondents included: having an interview room with access to information sources, consent from the team, access to patients' profiles, and a full-time pharmacist with a clearly defined role. Conclusion Pharmacists showed positive attitudes, favourable subjective norm and strong perceived behavioural control, which originated a clear behavioural intention to develop pharmacy services in outpatient dialysis centres. The potential barriers and enablers outlined should be taken into account, as well as the holistic approach for the successful implementation of cognitive pharmacy services.

AB  - BackgroundThe use of electronic health records in nursing education is rapidly increasing worldwide. The successful implementation of electronic health records for nursing education software program relies on students as well as nursing faculty members.
   AimsThis study aimed to explore the experiences and perceptions of nursing faculty members using electronic health records for nursing education software program, and to identify the influential factors for successful implementation of this technology.
   MethodsThis exploratory qualitative study was conducted using in-depth individual interviews at a university in Singapore. Seven faculty members participated in the study. The data were gathered and analysed at the end of the semester in the 2012/2013 academic year.
   ResultsThe participants' perceptions of the software program were organized into three main categories: innovation, transition and integration. The participants perceived this technology as innovative, with both values and challenges for the users. In addition, using the new software program was perceived as transitional process. The integration of this technology required time from faculty members and students, as well as support from administrators.
   LimitationsThe software program had only been implemented for 2-3 months at the time of the interviews. Consequently, the participants might have lacked the necessary skill and competence and confidence to implement it successfully. In addition, the unequal exposure to the software program might have had an impact on participants' perceptions.
   ConclusionThe findings show that the integration of electronic health records into nursing education curricula is dependent on the faculty members' experiences with the new technology, as well as their perceptions of it. Hence, cultivating a positive attitude towards the use of new technologies is important.
   Implications for nursing and health policyElectronic health records are significant applications of health information technology. Health informatics competency should be included as a required competency component in faculty professional development policy and programmes.

AB  - Imprisonment rates for black Americans have long been five to seven times higher than those for whites. The immediate causes are well known: high levels of black imprisonment resulting in part from higher black than white arrest rates for violent crime and vastly higher black drug arrest rates. Drug arrest disparities result from police decisions to concentrate attention on drugs blacks sell and places where they sell them. Prison disparities are aggravated by laws prescribing sentences of unprecedented severity for offenses for which blacks are disproportionately arrested. Those practices and policies were shaped by distinctive sociological, psychological, and political features of American race relations. Work on the psychology of American race relations shows that many white Americans resent efforts made to help black Americans overcome the legacy of racism; that stereotypes of black criminality support whites' attitudes toward drug and crime control policy; and that statistical discrimination, colorism, Afro-American feature bias, and implicit bias cause black offenders to be treated especially severely. Sociological work on racial stratification shows that whites support policies that maintain traditional racial hierarchies. Contemporary drug and crime control policies are components of the Republican Southern Strategy, shaped by and exacerbating those phenomena, to use crime as a "wedge issue" to appeal to whites' racial anxieties and resentments.

AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate the role of the veterinarian characteristics (e.g., age, gender, self-estimation, use of the internet), and their attitudes concerning animal owners seeking self-information. A particular focus was laid on any association between shared decision making (SDM), age and gender. In an online survey, 527 German veterinarians were asked about their attitude regarding SDM principles and their experiences with self-informed animal owners. The factors associated with veterinarians' perception of SDM were investigated in a multivariable linear regression model. A recently published structural equation model consolidated the application of SDM, empathic behavior, and veterinarians' evaluation of self-education as latent factors. Interconnected questionnaire items were processed using an exploratory factor analysis to 11 interpretable factors. Veterinarians who assumed therapy failure was associated with themselves had significantly higher rates of SDM (p = 0.002). In contrast, SDM was significantly lower (p = 0.002) if they assumed that therapy failure was due to the animal's owners. SDM was negatively associated with the perceived quality of the pet owners' self-information (p < 0.001) and if skepticism was perceived as the reason for seeking the self-information (p = 0.001). Veterinarians who advised against self-information (p = 0.006) and those who assumed that self-information of animal owners goes along with uncertainty (p = 0.001) had low SDM values (p = 0.006). Asking the animal owner for self-information (p = 0.001), and recommendations of good information sources (p = 0.022) were positively associated with SDM. Looking at the influence of age and gender on the application of SDM, older people and males rated higher. However, the evaluation of the latent factor SDM was based on the self-estimation of the participants. Assuming that younger women were less self-confident, we cannot exclude that young female participants self-evaluated their SDM skills lower than older male participants, although both groups would objectively have the same SDM level. Practitioners who have a positive attitude toward animal owners, who enjoy contact with animal owners and welcome their interest in further (self-)information, show empathic behavior, and have a positive attitude toward SDM are more likely to have better veterinarian-animal owner-relationships.

AB  - Experiencing and observing social exclusion and inclusion, as well as prosocial behavior, are important aspects of social relationships in childhood. However, it is currently unknown to what extent these processes and their neural correlates differ in heritability. We investigated influences of genetics and environment on experiencing social exclusion and compensating for social exclusion of others with the Prosocial Cyberball Game using fMRI in a twin sample (aged 7-9; N=500). Neuroimaging analyses (N=283) revealed that experiencing possible self-exclusion resulted in activity in inferior frontal gyrus and medial prefrontal cortex, which was influenced by genetics and unique environment. Experiencing self-inclusion was associated with activity in anterior cingulate cortex, insula and striatum, but this was not significantly explained by genetics or shared environment. We found that children show prosocial compensating behavior when observing social exclusion. Prosocial compensating behavior was associated with activity in posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, and showed unique environmental effects or measurement error at both behavioral and neural level. Together, these findings show that in children neural activation for experiencing possible self-exclusion and self-inclusion, and for displaying prosocial compensating behavior, is accounted for by unique environmental factors and measurement error, with a small genetic effect on possible self-exclusion.

AB  - Studies exploring digital technology in the context of leisure for older people tend to neglect their parallel use of traditional media. By simultaneous examination of both online and offline recreational media use, the present study explores media-based leisure repertoires and wellbeing among older Internet users. Data were collected via a survey of 10,527 Internet users aged 60 and up from seven countries (Austria, Canada, Denmark, Israel, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain). Analysis examined participants' media use and differences among people with disparate use patterns. The study identified four groups of Internet users according to the media-based leisure activities they engaged in: innovative traditionalists, entertainment seekers, selective content consumers, and eclectic media users. The groups differed in their activity repertoires, background characteristics, and leisure preferences. Being an eclectic media user (i.e., relatively less selective) was significantly associated with lower life satisfaction. Results indicate an advantage to selectivity in media use for leisure and confirm that participation in certain activities may compensate somewhat for distressing conditions in old age. They also suggest diminished boundaries between offline and online leisure among older Internet users and call for further development of the functional approach to Internet use in later life.

AB  - There is little empirical research to date that looks at how the deleterious effects of social exclusion can be mitigated. We examined how touching an inanimate object-a teddy bear-might impact the effect of social exclusion on prosocial behavior. Across two studies, we found that socially excluded individuals who touched a teddy bear acted more prosocially as compared to socially excluded individuals who just viewed the teddy bear from a distance. This effect was only observed for socially excluded participants and not for socially included (or control) participants. Overall, the findings suggest that touching a teddy bear mitigates the negative effects of social exclusion to increase prosocial behavior. In Study 2, positive emotion was found to mediate the relationship between touch and prosocial behavior. These results suggest a possible means to attenuate the unpleasant effects of social exclusion.

AB  - To well prepare pre-service teachers for their future teaching, researchers and teacher-educators have been employing information and communication technology to improve pre-service teachers' learning of subject-matter knowledge, pedagogies, classroom-management skills, and so on. This study illustrates a service-learning project we conducted to engage 18 Taiwanese pre-service teachers in tutoring middle school students by means of synchronous communication tools. To evaluate this project, we collected data from observations, surveys, postings on a discussion forum, teaching journals, and learning journals. Although the pre-service teachers and students generally held positive attitudes toward the tutoring experience and the pre-service teachers reported various benefits from participating in this project, some tutors were concerned with the effectiveness of online tutoring. Most of the tutors tried to motivate their students by providing appealing materials to, and by facilitating interaction with, the students. Yet, some tutors were troubled by students' misbehavior and low motivation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The psychosocial model of social exclusion postulates that age identity of older persons induce and sustain perceived and enacted discrimination, resulting in psychosocial disability and social exclusion. These propositions were tested by using a cross-sectional survey of 573 older persons, aged 65 years and above. The variables were measured by standardized rating scales. The results reveal age identity significantly influenced perceived (beta = .762; p < .001), enacted discrimination (beta = .514; p < .001), psychosocial disability (beta = .588; p < .001) and social exclusion (beta = .389; p < .001). Perceived discrimination significantly increased enacted discrimination (beta = .314; p < .001) and enacted discrimination influenced psychosocial disability (beta = .279; p < .001) and psychosocial disability increased social exclusion (beta = .090; p < .05). Perceived discrimination significantly mediated the negative effect of age identity on enacted discrimination (b = .211; p < .001), psychosocial disability (b = .219; p < .001) and social exclusion (b = .073; p < .05). The conceptual model showed good data model-fit, giving evidence to conclude that this model was useful in explaining process and outcomes of social exclusion of older persons.

AB  - Social exclusion is a painful experience associated with a variety of psychosocial and behavioral outcomes from childhood to adulthood. The purpose of the current study is to explore the mediation role of resilience and self-esteem in the relationship between social exclusion and life satisfaction in high school adolescents. The sample comprised 1172 students enrolling in grades of 9-12 in four public schools in an urban city of Turkey. Of the 52.7% participants were female and 47.3% of them were male with ages ranged between 14 and 19 years (M = 15.91, SD = 1.25). Results of the analyses showed negative and significant relationships between social exclusion and life satisfaction, self-esteem and resilience. Moreover, there were positive and significant relationships between resilience, life satisfaction and self-esteem. Findings of structural equation model revealed that social exclusion directly predicted resilience and self-esteem. Social exclusion predicted life satisfaction by the mediation of resilience and self-esteem. These outcomes indicated that resilience and self-esteem mediated the relationship between social exclusion and life satisfaction in adolescents.

AB  - The term 'Afrophobia', implying fear of the African, has come to mean the hatred of the African other, and is increasingly being used in the literature and popular media to describe the negative attitudes of black South Africans towards African immigrants. These negative attitudes towards other Africans are in contrast to the more positive attitudes towards white immigrants from Europe and America. This emerging literature also suggests that black South Africans have more positive attitudes towards black foreigners with whom they share a language. This article uses data from the 2013 Social Attitudes Survey to assess the evidence for Afrophobia, with further analysis of gender and ethnicity. The results suggest that the term Afrophobia does not usefully describe black South Africans' attitudes towards African immigrants. This article argues that South Africans have different attitudes towards immigrants from different countries. Also, the relationship between black South Africans' attitudes and the immigrants' ethnicity was not a straightforward one. Some immigrant groups that spoke a 'South African language' were among the black foreigners most disliked by those black South Africans with whom they shared a language. The study suggests the need for a more detailed and nuanced analysis of attitudes that understands the heterogeneous nature of black South Africans (and African immigrants) and goes beyond generalising terms such as 'Afrophobia' and 'ethnic affinity', which, based on the evidence, may be of limited use in understanding why some African immigrants are more disliked than others.

AB  - This research investigates user awareness and attitudes toward potential inferences of information posted on social network sites (SNSs). The study reports how user attitudes change after exposure to inferences made based upon information they have disclosed on an SNS, namely, on Facebook. To demonstrate this, two sub-studies involving three focus group sessions were conducted with Facebook users. In the first sub-study, the users received a general introduction to information that can be inferred from posts by using a prototypical privacy-enhancement tool called DataBait. Then, the second sub-study allowed the users to witness the potential inferences of their own Facebook photos and posts by using the DataBait tool. Next, qualitative content analysis was conducted to analyze the results, and these showed that the participants' attitudes toward privacy on SNSs changed from affective to cognitive when they became aware of potential inferences from actual information posted on their own Facebook accounts. The results imply that end users require more cognitive awareness regarding their genres of disclosure and the effect of their disclosures on their privacy. Moreover, as privacy awareness is contextual, there is a need for more research and development of online tools that will allow users to manage and educate themselves.

AB  - The successful impact of healthy eating campaigns often depends on the extent to which messages are effective in changing attitudes and behaviors over time. The present work proposes that healthy eating campaigns can be designed taking into consideration elaboration and validation processes so that the degree of attitude change is maximally influenced and is consequential. The first set of studies described in this review demonstrates the importance of considering elaboration in determining initial attitudes toward healthy foods as well as the subsequent attitude strength consequences (e.g., stability, prediction of behavior, spreading). The second set of studies focuses on the role of perceived validity of one's thoughts in the domain of eating as a potential mediator of the persuasion process. These studies include campaigns promoting positive attitudes toward healthy eating (e.g., eating of vegetables and fruits), and interventions oriented to decreasing the intake of unhealthy food (e.g., taxing junk food). We also discuss the role of modality of information presentation (e.g., verbal and visual information vs. direct physical experience) in those studies. Finally, the review offers a tutorial with concrete recommendations that researchers, practitioners and public policy makers can follow in order to predict both short and long-term attitude and behavior changes.

AB  - Social exclusion inherently involves an element of expectancy violation, in that we expect other people to follow the unwritten rule to include us in social interactions. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we employed a unique modification of an interactive virtual ball-tossing game called "Cyberball" (Williams et al.. 2000) and a novel paradigm called "Cybershape," in which rules are broken in the absence of social exclusion, to dissociate brain regions that process social exclusion from rule violations more generally. Our Cyberball game employed an alternating block design and removed evoked responses to events when the participant was throwing the ball in inclusion to make this condition comparable to exclusion, where participants did not throw. With these modifications, we replicated prior findings of ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), insula, and posterior cingulate cortex activity evoked by social exclusion relative to inclusion. We also identified exclusion-evoked activity in the hippocampi, left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and left middle temporal gyrus. Comparing social exclusion and rule violation revealed a functional dissociation in the active neural systems as well as differential functional connectivity with vACC. Some overlap was observed in regions differentially modulated by social exclusion and rule violation, including the vACC and lateral parietal cortex. These overlapping brain regions showed different activation during social exclusion compared to rule violation, each relative to fair play. Comparing activation patterns to social exclusion and rule violation allowed for the dissociation of brain regions involved in the experience of exclusion versus expectancy violation.

AB  - This research examines how technology usage can instigate social change in a developing country. We expected that technology usage leads to changes in modern cultural values and attitudes toward gender equality while traditional values persist. This was tested in an information and communication technology (ICT) for Development Aid project among Ethiopian children who had received a laptop. A longitudinal field experiment compared children who received a laptop (n = 573) with a matched control group without a laptop (n = 485). Measures were taken before laptop introduction and 6 months later. Laptops had medium to strong effects on value and attitude change, particularly in rural areas. Children with laptops endorsed modern values more strongly, but traditional values were bolstered as well. Modern value change mediated the effect of laptop usage on the endorsement of gender equality. Theoretical and practical implications for cultural changes related to gender equality are discussed.

AB  - Learning and using new technologies by the older people is seen as a demand for their integration in society and as a factor related to active aging. The goal of this article is to understand the attitudes of the elderly towards information and communication technologies in the context of a training course about the utilization of a digital platform. It is the result of an empirical study with a sample of 240 older people registered in the course Tele-Services for the Elderly, that took place in the Centers for the Elderly in the province of Cuenca, Spain. Through a self-administered questionnaire, aspects related to social activity, knowledge and use of the computer and Internet, expectations on learning and use of computer technology, personal competence, and self-concept were evaluated. The results obtained showed relationships between implication in the activities, experience with computers, and belief in the usefulness of learning new technologies. The participants' involvement in the activities was related to greater contact with information and communication technologies (ICT), which, in turn, generated more positive attitudes toward its learning and utility as well as more self-confidence. The elderly said that they enrolled in different activities to learn and to keep their minds active, and they thought of training as a means of social participation and lifelong learning.

AB  - The advent of Information Communications Technology has revolutionized ESL writing instruction. This quasi-experiment investigated the correlations of self-perception in reading, self-perception in writing, reading performance and writing performance of two groups of freshman college students representing two learning conditions - the experimental group (38) exposed to Web-mediated Instruction and the control group (38) taught using the Conventional Method. Researcher-made reading test, self-perception in reading and self-perception in writing inventory validated by language experts, and writing prompt for informative essay were administered to both groups of students before and after the treatment period which ran for 13 weeks. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to examine the correlations among variables and ANCOVA was used to determine the effect of web-mediated and conventional writing instruction on students' writing performance. Results of independent t-test show that there is a significant difference in the pre-test and posttest writing scores of both experimental and control groups. However, there is no significant difference between the reading and writing performance of experimental group and control group at p < 0.05) based on ANCOVA results. Therefore, web-mediated writing instruction via weblogs and conventional writing instruction are equally effective in enhancing students' writing performance. As regards, correlations of variables tested in this study, for experimental group, reading performance positively significantly affects writing performance. Both self-perception in reading and self-perception in writing insignificantly affect writing performance. Reading performance is insignificantly correlated with self-perception in reading. For control group, self-perception in reading and reading performance positively significantly affect the control group's writing performance. Reading performance is insignificantly correlated with self-perception in reading and self-perception in writing. In both groups, self-perception in reading is positively correlated with self-perception in writing. Hence, educators should develop students' positive attitude towards reading to effect positive attitude towards their writing. As what research shows, positive self-concept in writing will more likely result in improvement of writing skills.

AB  - This study uses a hierarchical statistical model to explore what drives African attitudes toward foreign countries, an understudied and underappreciated topic in the fields of African studies, political psychology and international relations. Enabled by increasing access to information, technology and resources, African peoples across the continent are directing their national stages like never before. Yet when it comes to international engagements on the continent, there is little scholarly focus on African sentiment toward foreign countries. The present study finds that the drivers of attitudes toward foreign countries vary, depending on which foreign country is under consideration by the respondent. For China, positive sentiment is associated with individuals who report having assets, belong to the president's party, view domestic governance positively, are more politically interested, are more trusting, are educated and are more frequent news consumers. While political interest, trust, education, news consumption and positive evaluation of domestic governance also correspond to positive attitudes toward the USA, so does being employed and perceiving the domestic government as corrupt. When it comes to attitudes toward former colonies, trust, education, news consumption, positive evaluations of domestic governance, perceiving the domestic government as corrupt, employment, identification with the president's party and support for democracy are associated with positive sentiment. For China, the USA and former colonies, negative sentiment is associated with individuals who identify as Muslim.

AB  - People rationalize the choices they make when confronted with difficult decisions by claiming they never wanted the option they did not choose. Behavioral studies on cognitive dissonance provide evidence for decision-induced attitude change, but these studies cannot fully uncover the mechanisms driving the attitude change because only pre- and post-decision attitudes are measured, rather than the process of change itself. In the first fMRI study to examine the decision phase in a decision-based cognitive dissonance paradigm, we observed that increased activity in right-inferior frontal gyrus, medial fronto-parietal regions and ventral striatum, and decreased activity in anterior insula were associated with subsequent decision-related attitude change. These findings suggest the characteristic rationalization processes that are associated with decision-making may be engaged very quickly at the moment of the decision, without extended deliberation and may involve reappraisal-like emotion regulation processes.

AB  - Introduction:The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted everyone, including students. Accurate information about the disease, its spread, preventive measures and government-issued advisories is critical for containing an outbreak. We evaluated the knowledge, attitudes and practices, and the key behavioural determinants of clinical outcomes, among university students.Materials and methods:We conducted a cross-sectional study among IIHMR University students (31 March to 10 April 2020), soon after the nationwide lockdown in India. Through purposive sampling, we enrolled 529 students, who completed a semi-structured questionnaire (44% completion rate). Knowledge level of the participants was assessed using a scoring system, and chi-squared test andt-test were performed to detect significant (p< 0.05) differences among various groups.Results:More than 70 per cent of students had good knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, mode of transmission and preventive measures, and 66 per cent knew about treatment approaches. Social media (83%) and TV (77%) were their primary sources of information. Most students showed a willingness to follow social distancing and lockdown guidelines; however, only 27 per cent perceived the risk of infection. Nearly all students reported compliance with government health advisories.Conclusions:We evaluated COVID-19 awareness and impacts of various information sources on effective outbreak containment. Improved community engagement activities and effective communication are needed during widespread disease outbreaks.

AB  - Social exclusion-being rejected or ignored by individuals or groups-is a common and adverse experience in social life. As a social activity, driving behaviour can be influenced by many factors. Whether social exclusion is one of these factors is an open question. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the impact of the social exclusion experience on individuals and their driving behaviours and the mediating effect of prosocial tendencies and driving anger. A total of 240 (104 males and 136 females) participants from China completed a questionnaire including the Ostracism Experiences Scale (OES), the prosocial tendencies measure (PTM), the Driving Anger Scale (DAS) and the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ). The hierarchical multiple regression analysis and pathway analysis results showed that social exclusion experience and driving anger positively predicted aberrant driving behaviours (including aggressive violations, ordinary violations, lapses and errors), while prosocial tendencies had a negative impact on aberrant driving behaviour. Moreover, prosocial tendencies and driving anger mediated the relationship between social exclusion and driver behaviour, accounting for 11.18% and 46.71% of the total effect, respectively. The chain-mediated effect of prosocial tendencies and driving anger was also significant, accounting for 5.26% of the total effect of social exclusion on driver behaviour. This study examines the mechanisms underlying social exclusion experiences that positively predict individuals' unsafe driving behaviours, thereby filling a gap in social exclusion research and suggesting new avenues of exploration into the personal and social influences that affect driving behaviours.

AB  - Various researchers have explored the use of health information systems (HISs) in the public sector in South Africa, including users' experiences thereof. However, there is limited research relating to the private health sector. Nurses form the majority of the health workforce and are therefore essential for capturing clinical data into an HIS. The study under review aimed to obtain a better understanding about nurses' attitudes towards a computerised HIS. The objectives were to explore and describe nurses' attitudes towards the HIS in a private hospital in North West, South Africa. The research followed a qualitative design using interpretive, descriptive and contextual strategies. Purposive sampling was done (n=14) and semi-structured individual interviews were conducted, while thematic analysis was done according to Creswell's steps. It was found that the nurses held specific affective, cognitive and behavioural attitudes towards the HIS. The findings indicated how the HIS challenges the caring ethos of nursing as information technology (IT) infiltrates the caring presence between nurse and patient. The study confirmed that nurses have positive attitudes towards the HIS. It is recommended that managers include confidentiality measures as part of HIS standards and ensure adherence thereto. Further research could be done on the relation between the HIS and the ethics of nursing as a profession.

AB  - Positive and negative attitude dimensions (i.e., bi-dimensional attitudes) asymmetrically predict behaviour, with the positive dimension being the better predictor than the negative dimension. These findings have been demonstrated using self-reported behaviour measures. In this study, we aimed to test the bi-dimensional attitude-behaviour relationship using objectively measured speeding behaviour derived from a driving simulator and test if the asymmetrical prediction of behaviour from the positive and negative attitude dimensions could be explained by attitude accessibility (how available an attitude is in memory and therefore how readily it is able to guide behaviour). One hundred and six drivers completed online measures of the positive and negative dimensions of their attitudes towards exceeding the speed limit. Response latency measures of the accessibilities of both dimensions were also taken. A driving simulator was used to measure speeding behaviour. Both attitude dimensions independently predicted speeding, with the positive dimension being the stronger predictor. The positive attitude dimension was also more accessible than was the negative dimension. The difference in the accessibilities of the positive and negative attitude dimensions significantly mediated the difference in their predictive validities. The results demonstrate that the positive attitude dimension is the principle predictor of speeding and a reason for this is that it is more accessible in memory than is the negative attitude dimension. Road safety interventions (e.g., education) that aim to reduce speeding and associated traffic crashes might usefully decrease the valence or accessibility of the positive attitude dimension. There would also appear to be scope to reduce speeding by increasing the valence or accessibility of the negative attitude dimension. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims and objectivesTo assess nursing students' knowledge of and attitudes towards such patients and to determine the variables associated with students' knowledge and attitudes towards them.
   BackgroundImproving nurses' and nursing students' knowledge and attitudes towards patients with HIV/AIDS is vital for providing quality care for such patients.
   DesignThis descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted at three nursing schools located in two different cities in Turkey. The inclusion criteria for the nursing students were as follows: being at least 18years old; being a first-, second-, third- or fourth-year nursing student; and giving consent to participate in the research.
   MethodsThe sample comprised 580 nursing students. The study used three data collection tools: (1) the Student Socio-Demographic Questionnaire, (2) the HIV/AIDS Knowledge Questionnaire and (3) the HIV/AIDS Attitude Questionnaire.
   ResultsParticipants' knowledge was found to be insufficient, particularly with regard to HIV transmission routes. They generally had positive attitudes towards patients with HIV/AIDS. However, they expressed some concerns and were hesitant about working with AIDS and HIV-positive patients.
   ConclusionsThe current results reveal that nursing students still have misconceptions and a lack of knowledge of HIV/AIDS and that their attitudes need to be improved.
   Relevance to clinical practiceImproving education programmes about HIV/AIDS and using information sources effectively may contribute to better knowledge and more desirable attitudes towards HIV/AIDS.

AB  - This study utilized a social identity-based cultivation approach to investigate the influence of English and Spanish-language television exposure in the United States on Latinos' perceptions of intergroup relations. Although research has examined the influence of television on Whites' perceptions of nondominant racial and ethnic groups, little empirical research exists assessing the influence of television on nondominant group members' (e.g., Latinos') race-related perceptions. To help fill this gap, a survey of Latino Americans (N = 209) was conducted. Results indicated that Latinos' English-language television exposure was associated with perceptions of discrimination against Latinos and perceptions of the legitimacy of such treatment. Endorsement of English-language television portrayals and exposure to Spanish-language television moderated these relationships.

AB  - Public reception of epilepsy in Croatia was re-assessed in 2009, 5 years after an initial survey, by interviewing 1000 randomly selected adults. Ninety-two percent (-5.0%) of the respondents had heard about epilepsy, 47% (-7.9%) knew someone with epilepsy, and 38.6% (-6.0%) had witnessed a seizure. Interviewees were quite ready to accept a person with epilepsy. Almost 8% (+1.1%) would object if their child played with a child with epilepsy, and 77.8% (+1.8%) believed that a child with epilepsy could succeed as well as a child without epilepsy. Although 45.9% (-6.6%) would approach a person having a seizure and help, 36.1% (+3.0%) would also call "911." Citizens of Croatia re-declared a high tolerance toward people with epilepsy and positive attitude toward children with epilepsy. Experiential factors remained strong predictors of more positive attitudes. A more prominent role of patients and implementation of social marketing in addressing a large persisting degree of prejudice and stigmatization worldwide are warranted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This analysis tests two distinct predictions regarding local newspapers' coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. A public service view of local newspapers predicts that a robust local newspaper sector would mitigate the politicized national partisan rhetoric surrounding COVID-19; reducing the disparity in social-distancing behaviors between predominantly Republican and predominantly Democratic counties by increasing compliance in Republican counties. The alternative hypothesis, informed by a demand-side view of the market pressures local newspapers face, predicts that increased competition between local newspapers will increase the degree to which local newspapers amplify the rhetoric of national officials in line with the partisan composition of their community, further polarizing adherence to social-distancing behaviors across predominantly Republican versus predominantly Democratic counties. The results of this analysis offer strong support for the second hypothesis; but, an additional analysis of vaccination rates offers a more nuanced perspective than a simple public service versus demand-side dichotomy would imply.

AB  - Resistance to U.S. President Donald Trump's policies on gender equality, health care, race relations, the environment, and immigration has been large, widespread, and persistent. Following President Trump's election, millions of people across the United States protested, creatively using slogans, signs, costumes, chants, and songs. Others engaged in resistance with online videos, songs, memes, and hashtags. By employing the communicative informatics model, we examine the relationship between online communication and the creative and active audience involved in U.S. political resistance in 2017.

AB  - People have substantially differing attitudes towards consumption. Anti-consumers are negative towards consumption. In contrast, pro-consumers view consumption in a positive light. We posit that people's attitudes toward consumption at the societal (macro) level are impacted by the implicit theories they hold about whether society can solve the problems it faces. We identify two different implicit theories consumers hold regarding how solvable larger societal problems are. Social optimists believe that we will solve the problems that are emerging as we evolve at the societal level. In contrast, social pessimists believe that societal evolution is creating problems too large to be solved. We developed a macro attitudes model where social optimism and pessimism were posited to impact people's macro attitudes towards consumption. We present the results of a study that found that social optimists have more positive attitudes towards consumption and social pessimists have more negative attitudes towards consumption. We also found that this model provided a superior fit in comparison to three other plausible models relating implicit theories and attitudes towards consumption. These findings have implications for anti-consumption research, consumer research on implicit theories, and social marketing designed to address problems associated with overconsumption.

AB  - Celebrities endorsing e-cigarette brands on social media may exert a strong influence on e-cigarette uptake. Using a between-subject experiment, this study examines the effects of endorser type (celebrities, non-celebrities and products only) in e-cigarette brand Instagram advertisements on e-cigarette attitudes and smoking intentions. Results showed that celebrity endorsers significantly increased positive attitudes towards e-cigarettes and smoking intentions, compared to non-celebrities or products only. Celebrity endorsers also rated significantly higher on trustworthiness, expertise, goodwill and attractiveness, compared to non-celebrities. Additionally, identification, social comparison, health consciousness and social networking site use moderated between endorser type and key dependent measures. Implications for e-cigarette marketing regulation are discussed.

AB  - Background: Screening for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) represents a worldwide public health priority. Screening patients to detect colonization is considered an essential pillar of any MRSA control program. Purpose: To (a) assess health care workers' (HCWs) attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioral control toward MRSA screening, and intention to perform the screening; (b) examine the predictors of HCWs intentions to perform screening; (c) identify HCWs' perception of barriers to and benefits of screening; and (d) identify HCWs' information sources about screening. Methods: Data obtained from 870 HCWs using the MRSA Screening Survey (MRSASS) were analyzed. The MRSASS was divided into three parts. Part 1 assessed sociodemographic variables. Part 2 contained the following six sections: (a) attitudes and perceived risk of MRSA screening, (b) perceived social norms of screening, (c) perceived behavioral control factors, (d) intention, (e) barriers to screening, and (f) benefit of screening. Part 3 assessed HCWs' source of information about MRSA screening. Results: HCWs had positive attitudes toward the intention to screen for MRSA. Many HCWs felt that they had little influence on policy makers to conduct MRSA screening. The most reported barriers for MRSA screening were a lack of isolation facilities and increased workload. Only 5.2% (n = 45) of respondents indicated that they had been given MRSA screening training. Conclusion: Attitude was the only predictor for the intention to screen for MRSA. HCWs believed that the barriers to MRSA screening were inadequate facilities, primarily the lack of isolation facilities, and increased workload.

AB  - Objective: To examine consumers' attitudes toward direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) for prescription drugs in Korea.
   Methods: We conducted a survey of 350 patients visiting community pharmacies to fill their prescriptions. Consumers' attitudes toward DTCA were assessed in terms of whether they felt DTCA was necessary, their trust in the information provided by DTCA, and their intention to use the information provided by DTCA. We examined consumers' preferences regarding the regulation of DTCA and their expectations of the effects of DTCA.
   Results: About 60% of the respondents responded that DTCA is necessary and that they intended to use the information from DTCA. Less than half of the respondents reported that they would trust DTCA information. About 70% of the participants expressed the need for prior vetting of the DTCA content. Respondents had the highest expectation on the effect of DTCA as an information source for patients. Positive consumer expectations regarding the effects of DTCA were significantly associated with positive consumer attitudes toward DTCA (odds ratio = 4.70, 95% confidence interval: 2.25-9.82).
   Conclusions: This study provides evidence that consumers in South Korea generally have positive attitudes toward DTCA. However, most of the respondents wanted a prior examination system of DTCA content to ensure that the information conveyed to them via DTCA was trustworthy. Policy-makers should be cautious and well-prepared if they decide to introduce DTCA in Korea. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Information is now commonly consumed online, often displayed in conjunction with self-expression affordances (i.e., likes, votes) that create a sense of "self as source." Sundar et al.'s (2015) theory of interactive media effects (TIME) conceptualizes such affordances as source interactivity (SI). An experiment examined medium effects of SI as well as message effects on attitudes. It tracked selective exposure to attitude-consistent vs. -discrepant political messages, to capture confirmation bias, and manipulated SI presence (affordance to up-vote or downvote articles present or absent) as within-subjects factors. SI use and attitude change were captured. SI reduced selective exposure to attitude-consistent content. However, use of SI affected attitude reinforcement independently as well. Hence, users shaped their own attitudes both by selectively reading articles and expressing their views through SI. Directions for theory development are offered.

AB  - The occurrence of popular social events causes fluctuations and changes of public emotions, while the rapid development of online social platforms and networks has made individual interactions more intense and further escalated public emotions into public opinion. However, there is a lack of consideration of individual emotions in the current research on online public opinion. Based on this, this paper firstly expounds the quantitative representation of attitude and emotion, analyzes the formation and propagation process of online public opinion by combining individual's expression willingness, individual's expression ability, attitude perception value, attitude change probability and other factors, and constructs a network public opinion propagation model that takes individual emotion into consideration. Finally, the main factors affecting the formation and propagation of network public opinion are discussed through simulation experiments. The results demonstrate that: (1) fear is conducive to the formation of online public opinion, but the speed is relatively slow; sadness is not conducive to the formation, but once enough people participate in the exchange of views, the formation of online public opinion will be faster; (2) the influence of online public opinion on individual emotions expands with the increase of the number of individual interactions; (3) different network structures impact differently on the propagation of public opinion. Among them, BA (BA network is a scale-free network model proposed by Barabasi and Albert in order to explain the generation mechanism of power law, BA model has two characteristics: growth and priority connection mechanism) and ER (ER network is a network with random connectivity proposed by Erdos-Renyi) random networks can promote the propagation of online public opinion, which is prone to "one-sided" online public opinion. WS small-world networks (proposed by Watts and Strogatz. It is a kind of network with short average path length and high clustering coefficient) and fully-connected networks have an inhibitory effect on the spread of online public opinion, easily maintaining the multi-dimensional nature of online public opinion.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to develop an educational program to reduce negative attitudes toward persons with mental illness (PMIs) using online media and to test its effectiveness.
   Methods A nonequivalent control group with a pre-posttest was employed in this study. A total of 143 lay people were enrolled. The study variables were knowledge and attitudes about mental illness, and social distance. The four domains of attitudes were authoritarianism, benevolence, social restrictiveness and community mental health ideology.
   Results Phase 1: In an attempt to develop an educational program, the researcher conducted interviews with lay people and families of PMIs, and reviewed the pertinent literature. Three mental health professionals were consulted after developing the program. The program consisted of eight sessions. Phase 2: Community mental health ideology differed significantly between groups after the experiment. Knowledge tended to increase in the experimental group, while social restrictiveness showed a tendency to decrease. However, the changes were not significant in either case. Authoritarianism, benevolence, and social distance were not significantly different between groups. There was a significant difference in the pattern of change over time for both groups regarding authoritarianism, benevolence, and social restrictiveness.
   Conclusions The program developed here was partially effective at changing negative attitudes. The online video program can be used by community mental health nurses to enhance general knowledge and help reduce stigma. [Asian Nursing Research 2010;4(2):90-101]

AB  - Purpose
   Stuttering is a multifactorial speech disorder with significant social and psychological consequences. There is a lack of knowledge about public attitudes towards people who stutter (PWS) and the factors that can determine such attitudes in underprivileged communities. This study aimed to assess the public attitudes in South Egypt towards PWS and compare our results with those stored in a reference database representing 180 different samples.
   Methods
   A multi-stage random sampling approach was used to recruit 650 people from Beni-Suef City in South Egypt. All participants were interviewed using the Arabic version of the Public Opinion Survey of Human Attributes-Stuttering (POSHA-S) after getting their informed consent. This instrument assesses people's Beliefs and Self Reactions towards PWS in addition to their sociodemographic characteristics.
   Results
   The Beliefs and Self Reactions subscores in addition to the Overall Stuttering Score of the Egyptian sample were remarkably lower than the median values of the reference database (12 versus 34), (-4 versus 2), and (4 versus 18), respectively. TV, radio, and films were the main sources of knowledge about stuttering. Egyptian participants who reported average to high income were more likely to have a positive attitude (>= 50% of Overall Stuttering Score) towards PWS than their counterparts with low income (Odds Ratio = 1.57, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.08-2.28).
   Conclusion
   People in South Egypt showed a less positive attitude towards PWS compared with other populations worldwide. Further studies should focus on changing the public attitudes towards PWS through awareness programs that consider the cultural perspectives of the society.

AB  - Road safety issue is an urgent problem that needs to be addressed and has been a growing public health concern worldwide. Previous research has investigated the risk factors associated with dangerous driving behavior. So far, however, little research has explored the potential influence of social exclusion on dangerous driving behavior, and little is known about the mechanisms underlying this relationship. The current study aims to empirically explore how and when social exclusion impacts dangerous driving behavior based on the Multimotive Model of social exclusion, and the effects of driving anger and cognitive reappraisal. A total of 240 Chinese drivers (Mean age = 26.07, SD = 7.68) completed anonymous questionnaires regarding social exclusion, driving anger, dangerous driving behavior, and cognitive reappraisal. The findings indicated that (1) social exclusion positively predicted dangerous driving behavior; (2) driving anger fully mediated this association; (3) cognitive reappraisal respectively moderated the effect of social exclusion on dangerous driving behavior and driving anger. When cognitive reappraisal was low, social exclusion had a stronger positive effect on dangerous driving behavior. These findings highlight the significance of identifying the mechanisms underlying the effect of social exclusion on driving behavior. Certain implications can be provided for promoting drivers' safe driving behavior and reducing the negative effect of social exclusion.

AB  - The existence of propaganda is inexorably bound to the nature of communication and communications technology. Mass communication by citizens in the digital age has been heralded as a means to counter elite propaganda; however, it also provides a forum for misinformation, aggression and hostility. The extremist group Britain First has used Facebook as a way to propagate hostility towards Muslims, immigrants and social security claimants in the form of memes, leading to a backlash from sites antithetical to their message. This article provides a memetic analysis, which addresses persuasion, organisation, political echo chambers and self-correcting online narratives; arguing that propaganda can be best understood as an evolving set of techniques and mechanisms which facilitate the propagation of ideas and actions. This allows the concept to be adapted to fit a changing political and technological landscape and to encompass both propaganda and counter-propaganda in the context of horizontal communications networks.

AB  - Background: Relapse in People Living with Schizophrenia (PLS) has several reasons and recognizing these can increase the effectiveness of treatment interventions. Formal and informal caregivers are an informed source to reduce relapse in PLS. Aim: This study explores the caregivers' perspective in Iran on the factors affecting relapse in PLS. Method: A total of 28 caregivers (16 formal caregivers and 12 informal caregivers) of PLS were enrolled in our qualitative study. A content analysis was conducted using individual and group, semi-structured in-depth interviews with informal and formal caregivers of PLS. This study was conducted in a hospital, three universities, and a non-governmental organization in Tehran, Iran. Results: The majority (69%) of the participants were females. About half of the informal caregivers were over 60 years old and about 40% of the formal caregivers were in the age range of 30 to 40 years. The average number of years of work for informal caregivers was 17.6 years and the average of work experience among the formal caregivers was 14.1 years. Seven key dual themes were identified from data: 'awareness-stigma', 'social support-social exclusion', 'treatment adherence-treatment discontinuation', 'holistic approach - one-dimensional approach', 'supported employment-social dysfunction', 'emotional management in family - family with high emotional expression', and 'access to treatment-treatment gap'. Conclusion: The results of this research can help practitioners and policymakers to enable evidence-based practices to reduce relapse in PLS by emphasizing and acting on factors identified in our analyses.

AB  - COVID-19 has been spreading fast worldwide, and until effective and safe vaccines have been widely adopted, preventive measures such as social distancing are crucial to keep the pandemic under control. The study's research questions asked which psychosocial factors predict social distancing behavior and whether there are country-level differences in social distancing? Using the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) as a theoretical lens, we examined the predictive effects of threat and efficacy and demographic variables on adherence to the COVID-19 preventive behavior of social distancing using a survey among an international sample of university students. Using path modeling and analysis of covariance, we confirmed the predictive effects of the EPPM on social distancing behavior. Our final model showed that perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 was both directly and indirectly (through response efficacy) associated with social distancing behavior; that perceived severity of COVID-19 yielded a significant indirect effect on social distancing behavior through both self-efficacy and response efficacy; that perceived susceptibility is indirectly and positively associated with social distancing behavior through response efficacy; and that self-efficacy and response efficacy were directly associated with social distancing behavior. Additionally, there were country-level differences in social distancing. Possible explanations for and implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Research has shown that will (positive attitudes), skill (technology competency), and tool (access to technology tools) are all essential ingredients for a teacher to effectively integrate information technology into classroom practices. This study focuses on the will, skill and tool as essential measures for the predictability of technology integration, reported by the study participants and measured by stages of adoption of teachers in Ghana. Attempts are made to explore the extent to which these parameters differ among the teachers and also influence technology integration. Furthermore, the parameters are proposed for use in modelling the process of technology integration for these teachers. Well validated instruments spanning the areas of attitudes, competencies, access and technology integration proficiencies were used to collect data from 120 mathematics prospective teachers and 60 practicing mathematics teachers from Ghana. The data was analyzed using regression analysis. The results indicated that lack of teacher anxiety was the most important dimension of attitudes, and that skill is the strongest predictor of classroom integration of technology for the teachers. Significant differences existed between practicing and prospective teachers' computer anxieties, competencies, and access levels. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite scientific consensus, consumers' misperceptions about the risks of genetically modified (GM) food influence product rejection and the persistence of negative attitudes. Building on the mental models approach for risk communication and the Elaboration Likelihood Model for attitude change, a two-wave repeated measures randomized controlled experiment on a representative sample of Swedish consumers was used to test the effectiveness of tailored (to consumers' mental models of GM food) and persuasive (strong vs. weak) communication for attitudes and product preferences change. In wave 1 (N = 3,243) and wave 2 (N = 1,554), we measured consumers' attitudes and elicited product preferences using a discrete choice experiment. We found a positive effect of communication on attitudes and product preferences in two out of the four treatment groups, one of which initially held a negative attitude and perceived GM food as very risky.

AB  - Studies of the relationship between retirement and subsequent health, including longevity, have produced mixed findings. One reason may be that these studies have not taken attitudes toward retirement into account. In the current study we examined whether attitudes toward retirement can impact longevity. The cohort consisted of 394 participants who were followed for 23 years. As predicted, participants with positive attitudes toward retirement at the start of the study lived significantly longer than those with negative attitudes toward retirement. The positive attitudes-toward-retirement group had a median survival advantage of 4.9 years. This survival advantage remained after controlling for relevant covariates, including age, functional health, socio-economic status, and whether employed or retired. Our findings suggest that psychological planning for retirement is as important as the more traditional forms of planning.

AB  - In the face of a public health crisis full of uncertainty, how should the community respond in order to effectively reduce the negative impact of the epidemic on public health? This article takes a Chinese rural community located near Wuhan City as an example to explore the mechanism of how collaborative leadership enhanced collective action in community governance against the COVID-19 pandemic. Early blockading to prevent transmission into the community, strict maintenance of social distance to prevent internal diffusion, timely elimination of public panic, and efficient guarantees of household supplies have proven effective in preventing the spread of the epidemic. Our research shows that collaborative leadership can achieve these goals mainly by effectively integrated local knowledge, modern information technology, and social self-organization, and then promoting the realization of collective action of community epidemic prevention and control. The lessons and implications for public health are discussed.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether or not Jamaican coaches' knowledge and practices of fluid replacement are on par with that of the National Athletic Association's and the American College of Sports Medicine Standards.
   Methods: A descriptive survey of 90 high-school track and field coaches in Jamaica was conducted. Coaches were given a 29-item survey questionnaire which adapted the content from previous surveys and also based on the National Athletic Trainers' Association guidelines for fluid replacement and information sources of fluid replacement. A pass score of 80% was employed.
   Results: Approximately 26.6% of participants passed the knowledge-based assessment with the minimum requirement of 80% and 73.4% of participants had an unacceptable level of knowledge about fluid replacement and hydration. Only 26 (28.9%) coaches received training in fluid replacement therapy. Most of them therefore relied on reading materials ranging from magazines to journals, or learnt it on the job from other coaches.
   Conclusion: Findings suggest that the level of knowledge in Jamaican track and field high-school coaches about fluid replacement and hydration is very poor However, their attitudes towards fluid replacement and hydration are very good, and this will facilitate their acceptance and adoption of correct fluid replacement guidelines. Tapping into this positive attitude and implementing workshops, seminars and onsite promotion should improve the coaches' knowledge significantly.

AB  - Across surveys and regardless of controls, women in many Western countries are consistently more politically left-leaning than men. More recently, however, innovative measures of non-binary gender identity suggest important heterogeneity in political attitudes within the categories of 'women' and 'men'. Building from this, we study the direct and conditional associations between sex and non-binary gender on two political attitude dimensions: (1) left-right ideology; and (2) green/alternative/liberal versus traditionalist/authoritarian/nationalist opinions. Using a Swedish population-based survey from 2013, we find no evidence that political attitudes vary by non-binary gender identity alone, and only weak evidence that political attitudes vary by sex. However, supporting our conditional hypotheses, we find that gender (non)conformity matters significantly. Specifically, men with many masculine traits and women with many feminine traits stand more to the right and show more traditionalist/authoritarian/nationalist opinions than men and women who are less gender conforming.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
LA  - English
AB  - Background To evaluate the perspectives of dermatology specialists and residents on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. Methods Present questionnaire-based study was conducted on dermatology residents and specialists between January 5 and 20. A non-validated online questionary evaluating the attitude of the participants about the COVID-19 vaccine was performed. In the first step of the study, data related to the demographic features, all participants' clinical characteristics, and working conditions were recorded. Thereafter answers given to 12 specific questions were recorded. The study population was divided into two groups: dermatology residents (n = 138) and specialists (n = 159). Mentioned variables were compared between the two defined groups. Furthermore, a correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationship between vaccination acceptance and various study parameters. Results Majority of the cases had positive attitudes against COVID-19 vaccines. However, there were significant differences between the resident and specialist groups related to the source of information, working conditions, degree of concern, and type of vaccines. Statistically significant negative, weak correlations were observed for age and duration of medical practice (r = -.128, P = .028; r = -.132, P = .041 respectively). Statistically significant positive weak correlations were observed for chronic diseases, level of knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines, number of information sources about COVID-19, and previous COVID-19 infection (r = .133, P = .021; r = .207, P < .001; r = .335, P < .001; r = .176, P = .002 respectively). Conclusion The acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination may be affected by working conditions, medical experience, level of knowledge and the presence of risk factors for severe disease among dermatology residents and specialists.

AB  - Objective To assess the attitude of people living with type 1 diabetes toward the use of information and communication technology (ICT) to facilitate access to diabetes healthcare professionals (HCPs).
   Research design and methods We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in two European tertiary diabetes care centers in London, UK, and Vienna, Austria, and from online diabetes platforms. Participants were asked about general options of online diabetes care and were presented with three scenarios (teleconference, online chat and telemonitoring of continuous glucose monitoring traces).
   Results In total, 294 people (59% female; 78 British, 164 Austrians, 47 Germans, 5 from other countries; 45 +/- 15 years) who had been living with type 1 diabetes for 26 +/- 14.5 years participated. The vast majority of participants were insulin pump (and/or glucose sensor) users (84%) and reported good glycemic control (31% with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <7% and 51% with HbA1c 7%-8%). ICT was generally acceptable for counseling, with email/online messaging services and online health platform the most preferred options (74% and 53%). Study participants expressed a neutral to positive attitude toward the combined theme scores (relationship with HCP; confidence using technology; trust in data protection; intrusion of patient privacy; general acceptance of ICT in healthcare). UK participants showed more positive attitudes toward ICT across all theme scores than participants from Austria and Germany, but there were no gender-related differences.
   Conclusions This online survey identified a highly ICT-astute group of people with type 1 diabetes, already using technology for insulin delivery, for whom online supported clinical diabetes care would be a viable and welcomed option.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to assess whether kindergarten through twelfth grade teachers differ from people in non-teaching occupations in their reactions to people who stutter (PWS). Taking differences in age and education into account, we compared reactions to PWS between 263 teachers and 1336 non-teachers in the United States based on their responses on the Public Opinion Survey on Human Attributes-Stuttering (POSHA-S, St. Louis, 2012). Findings indicated that teachers use a greater number and variety of information sources about PWS than the general public and that male teachers do so even more than female teachers. With regard to the other POSHA-S components, accommodating/helping, knowledge/experience, and sympathy/social distancing of PWS, teachers' responses were not significantly different from their non-teaching counterparts. Regardless of occupation, women reported reactions to PWS that are considered more accommodating and helpful to PWS than the reported reactions of men.
   Learning outcomes: Readers should be able to: (1) identify the challenges that students who stutter encounter in the K-12 school setting, (2) identify recommended ways teachers can react to their students who stutter, (3) summarize findings regarding teachers' reactions to people who stutter (PWS), and (4) identify key variables that are associated with reactions to PWS.

AB  - Based on various theories of human agency (Ajzen, I. (2005). Attitudes, personality and behavior (2nd ed.). London: Open University Press; Davis, F.D. (1989). Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology. MIS Quarterly, 13, 319340; Rogers, E.M. (1983). Diffusion of innovations (3rd ed.). New York: The Free Press), it is essential to know users' attitudes and abilities before implementing widespread use of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) techniques in schools. This study takes a two-tiered approach. On the one hand, it aims to explore the current computer-related attitudes and abilities of Iranian high school language teachers and students, before the actual diffusion of computers into the education system. On the other hand, this study compares the attitudes of language teachers and students towards CALL, cultural perceptions of the role of computers in education, computer competence, and computer access. Toward this aim, a multi-section survey in the Persian language was administered to high school language teachers and students. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and the results indicated that the majority of the participants have positive attitudes towards CALL and find it relevant to the cultural context of Iran. Teachers have moderate computer competence, while students have limited competence. Language teachers and students have daily access to computers mostly at home. The study further shows the difference between language teachers and students in that although teachers are presumed to be ambivalent about computer-related issues, in comparison with their students, teachers rank significantly higher on the CALL attitude and computer competence scales. From the positive CALL attitudes of both groups, it may be inferred that they will use computers in language education once computers become available, accompanied by adequate training.

AB  - Purpose-Social media have become an increasingly important source for people to learn about politics and public affairs. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of social media news sharing as a reasoning process of the O-S-R-O-R model and the moderation role of social media news performance on the association between news consumption and attitudinal changes.
   Design/methodology/approach-A national survey was conducted in the US. The researcher recruited participants in the Qualtrics national panel by following the census adult demographic breakdown.
   Findings-This study finds that social media news consumption on the US-China trade conflict is likely to lead Americans to change attitudes toward Chinese, and this relationship is mediated by social media news sharing. In addition, the indirect relationship via news sharing is found particularly strong among individuals who perceive social media news fair and balanced.
   Originality/value-This study extends the literature by examining social media news engagement on the ongoing trade conflict between the US and China. It reveals that the impact of social media news consumption on people's attitudinal and behavioral changes depends on people's perceived news quality on these platforms. Theoretical contribution to the O-S-R-O-R model and practical implications to social media news are discussed in terms of the role that social media platforms play in attitude change.

AB  - Online` racial discrimination and race-related traumatic events online have been linked to psychological distress in Black youth. The current study builds on extant literature by examining associations among online racial discrimination, traumatic events online, and trauma symptoms of discrimination, after controlling for gender identity and ethnic-racial setting of college in a sample of 245 Black youth. Additionally, this study examines the potential moderating effects of gender identity. This study is the first to examine the associations among online racial discrimination, traumatic events online, and trauma symptoms specific to racial discrimination. Path modeling revealed positive associations among online racial discrimination, traumatic events online, and trauma symptoms of discrimination. No significant differences in models were found by gender identity.

AB  - Introduction. The information provided about organ donation and transplantation (ODT) affects whether it is viewed favorably or unfavorably.
   Objectives. The objective of this study was to determine the means by which each source of information about ODT influenced attitudes of children.
   Material and Methods. Ten secondary schools from the south-east of Spain were stratified geographically. We performed a random selection of pupils from the first 4 years of compulsory secondary range, education (age 11-15 years). A validated self-administered questionnaire about attitudes toward ODT was completed anonymously.
   Results. The adolescents had received information about ODT through several sources. The most frequent sources were television (86%), films (59%), and magazines (56%). Positive information from information sources was associated with more favorable attitudes toward ODT (P < .05); those who received negative information had more unfavorable attitudes (P < .05).
   Conclusions. Most information about ODT that reaches our children is through audiovisual means. Attitudes were more favorable among adolescents who have received positive information through the mass media, with more negative attitudes among those who received negative information.

AB  - Background: Using condoms consistently could prevent unintended pregnancy among young people. This study highlights multiple domains of inuence on condom use among male college students in China, including knowledge, attitudes, health services utility on condom use and reproductive health information sources.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To identify factors associated with condom use in Chinese male college students, we examined a sample of 870 sexually experienced male students in seven colleges in Wuhan, China, 2009. 535 (61.5%) of 870 male students reported condom use during their most recent sexual encounter. Male students with steady partners were more likely to use condoms than students with casual partners (adjusted OR = 3.11, 95%CI 2.30-4.20). And positive attitudes toward contraceptive responsibility were associated with greater odds of condom use (adjusted OR = 1.40, 95%CI 1.02-1.92). Only 54(6.2%) and 83(9.5%) of respondents reported that free condoms and reproductive health counseling were available at the student health center. Providing free condoms and reproductive health counseling at the student health central were associated with increased condom use among college students (both P<0.05). In addition, students who gained reproductive health information mainly through websites, television and radio programs were more likely to use condoms than through school education (all P<0.05).
   Conclusions: Improving attitudes of male students toward contraceptive responsibility, providing proper reproductive health information through mass media and making free condoms and reproductive health counseling available in school may help increase condom use among college students in China.

AB  - Objective This study investigated the efficacy of an internet-based personalized decision support (PDS) tool designed to aid in the decision to screen for colorectal cancer (CRC) using a fecal occult blood test. We tested whether the efficacy of the tool in influencing attitudes to screening was mediated by perceived usability and acceptability, and considered the role of computer self-efficacy and computer anxiety in these relationships.
   Methods Eighty-one participants aged 50-76 years worked through the on-line PDS tool and completed questionnaires on computer self-efficacy, computer anxiety, attitudes to and beliefs about CRC screening before and after exposure to the PDS, and perceived usability and acceptability of the tool.
   Results Repeated measures ANOVA found that PDS exposure led to a significant increase in knowledge about CRC and screening, and more positive attitudes to CRC screening as measured by factors from the Preventive Health Model. Perceived usability and acceptability of the PDS mediated changes in attitudes toward CRC screening (but not CRC knowledge), and computer self-efficacy and computer anxiety were significant predictors of individuals' perceptions of the tool.
   Conclusion Interventions designed to decrease computer anxiety, such as computer courses and internet training, may improve the acceptability of new health information technologies including internet-based decision support tools, increasing their impact on behavior change.

AB  - Background: In the emerging era of digitalization and electronic health, skin cancer-related apps represent useful tools to support dermatologic consultation and examination. Yet, little is known about how patients perceive the value of such apps.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate patient attitudes and their awareness toward skin cancer-related apps.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study including 200 patients from the oncological outpatient unit was conducted at the University Hospital (LMU Munich, Germany) between September and December 2018. Patients were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire on the popularity and usefulness of health-related and skin cancer-related apps. A descriptive analysis was performed with the expression of categorical variables as frequencies and percentages. For continuous variables, the median and range were indicated. Contingency tables and chi-square tests were performed to investigate associations between sociodemographic data and selected items of the questionnaire.
   Results: A total of 98.9% (195/197) of patients had never used skin cancer-related apps or could not remember. In 49.7% (93/187) of cases, patients were unsure about the usefulness of skin cancer apps, whereas 42.6% (78/183) thought that skin cancer apps could supplement or support the professional skin examination performed by a physician. However, 47.9% (90/188) were interested in acquiring more information by their dermatologists about skin cancer apps. Young age (P=.002), male gender (P=.02), a previous history of melanoma (P=.004), and higher educational level (P=.002) were significantly associated with a positive attitude. Nevertheless, 55.9% (105/188) preferred a printed patient brochure on skin cancer to downloading and using an app.
   Conclusions: The experience and knowledge of skin cancer-related apps was surprisingly low in this population, although there was a high general interest in more information about such apps. Printed patient brochures were the preferred information source.

AB  - Purpose - Given the consistent finding in the literature that members of minority groups hold less favorable views of the police than white citizens, social distance may be an important, yet untested, mediator. The purpose of this paper is to examine the mediating effect of social distance net of other established correlates.
   Design/methodology/approach - A sample of students attending a university in the northeastern USA completed an online survey in 2013. The survey was about their contact with the police, attitudes toward the police, and lifestyles, among others.
   Findings - Race, along with other predictors, significantly influenced confidence in police. However, race is the only factor that turns nonsignificant when social distance is included in the model. Mediation tests confirmed that social distance mediates the relationship between race and confidence in the police.
   Research limitations/implications - To maximize confidence in the police, administrators should focus on closing the social distance between the public and the police through initiatives like community policing.
   Originality/value - While there is extensive research on public attitudes toward the police, social distance has been neglected as a determinant, despite movements like community policing that promote citizens' relational closeness to the police - that is, to decrease the social distance between police and the public. The current study would be an exploratory study and reference for future studies.

   Method: The study sample includes male university students in their 20s in South Korea. In total, 223 responses were entered for analysis. Questions related to attitudes, satisfaction, and future behavioral intentions were asked using 5-point Likert scales. The responses were divided into two groups, current and previous users, to identify significant differences in terms of attitudes, satisfaction, and future behavioral intentions. A descriptive analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and multiple regression were run.
   Results: The majority of respondents prefer the powdered form of supplements in bulk with a price range between 30,000 won and 60,000 won. Online shopping was preferred, while word of mouth and friends/family were considered credible information sources. The most common side effects experienced were problems with digestion and hives, although more than 78% did not experience side effects. In comparison between current and previous users in terms of attitudes and satisfaction, the following areas showed significances. Regarding attitudes, the importance of brand, preference for products from overseas, the search for nutritional facts, and reading carefully all product information were significant, while regarding satisfaction, price, effectiveness, and ease of consumption were significant. All significances showed that current users had more positive attitudes and greater satisfaction. Overall, consumers' satisfaction regarding ease of consumption influenced future behavioral intentions.
   Conclusions: The market for protein supplements has been growing, so measuring consumers' attitudes and satisfaction would help attract potential consumers. In addition, analyzing previous users' opinions on products could guide product development and encourage customers to return for repurchase.

TI  - IT EDUCATION AS A FACTOR TO INFLUENCE GENDER IMBALANCES IN COMPUTING: COMPARING RUSSIAN AND AMERICAN EXPERIENCE
T2  - OBRAZOVANIE I NAUKA-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
LA  - English
KW  - IT education
KW  - women in computing
KW  - gender imbalances
AB  - Introduction. The problem of the relatively small number of women professionally employed in computing (computer science and information technology) is relevant throughout the world. Despite the fact that IT professionals are widely in demand, women in many countries, including the USA and Russia, make up no more than a quarter of their total number, which requires explanation. One of the major reasons for this phenomenon, according to the authors, lies in the education system.
   The aim of this article was to analyse the factors affecting gender imbalance in IT professions, by comparing two countries in which information technology has historically played an important role, and which are very different from each other in many ways - economic, political, educational system and others.
   Research methodology. The present research is based on the comparison of data on IT education in schools and universities, and the degree of involvement of girls and women in computing in the USA and Russia.
   Results. Both in the USA and in Russia, gender imbalances in IT professions are formed largely in the field of education. Cultural stereotypes about computing as a male-dominated profession are produced by the media. Such stereotypes can discourage some girls and young women from studying computer science and also result in imbalance formation. The education system needs to increase the confidence of girls and young women in the possibilities of realising their abilities in the field of computer science and information technologies. Educational institutions should help to eliminate the negative attitude towards girls' choice of IT professions.
   Scientific novelty. For the first time, general factors in the field of education were identified that affect gender imbalances among IT professionals in Russia and the USA - the countries with significantly different traditions and educational systems.
   Practical significance of the present work is to justify the conditions for improving school and university education to solve the problem of gender inequality in IT industry.

AB  - The democratisation and proliferation of social media has seen the emergence of a distinct virtual community of Twitter users known as Black Twitter. This burgeoning community is characterised by discourses on cultural issues that are critical to the black community, such as race relations and identity politics in general. Black Twitter has often been criticised for its unashamed bashing of those who are perceived as displaying inauthenticity in their performance of identity and their positions on the critical issues debated on Twitter. This article reports on a study that employed a small-scale online ethnographic approach to collect a sample of tweets from a Twitter engagement with a South African public figure and media personality, the actress Nandi Madida. The article argues that through an African normative perspective known as ubuntu, the perceived harshness of South African Black Twitter users can be more usefully read as part of African cultural value of critical humanism. Ultimately, the traditional notion of ubuntu as simply friendliness towards a fellow human is challenged by broadening the concept to apply to notions that include seemingly violent forms of communication. This more robust view of ubuntu, whose application is demonstrated from the context of Black Twitter, ultimately seeks to make another person a better human even if it means public criticism.

AB  - Globally, increased domestic violence against women during the 2020 Covid-19 lockdowns concerned researchers, policymakers, governments and the civil society. In South Africa, an increased risk for gender-based domestic violence against women during the lockdown period was reported by various sources including the national gender-based violence call centre (GBVCC), the South African Police Service (SAPS) and the civil society. Covid-19 lockdown encouraged spatial distance: a public health measure. This measure inadvertently created social distance and social disconnection. Public life, which is frequently a coping mechanism and an escape for some women and girls at risk of domestic violence, was curtailed by the lockdown rules that forbade movements. Informal sources of help for victims of abuse were limited due to closed economic activities, and community-based helping services for domestic violence were not permitted to open. Some victims of domestic violence struggled with public transportation to access informal help, visit the police, social workers and other sources of help. Some organisations offered online and telephone services. The increased risk of gender-based domestic violence during the lockdown is indicative of poly-violence that women are exposed to. The risk of the domesticated poly-violence during crisis periods could be averted by focussing on risk reduction for all forms of violations against women.

AB  - New Zealand is one of the very few countries where the national netball team (known as the Silver Ferns) has a high public profile. The popularity of the Silver Ferns reflects in part the status of netball as the most popular team sport in New Zealand in terms of participation. It also, however, reflects the ways in which the captains and coaches of the Silver Ferns have constructed a positive image of the team through developing their team culture and relationships with sponsors and the media. This paper examines how they have achieved this development since 1960, when international netball emerged as a seven-a-side game, and how they have done so while navigating changing societal values on amateurism, gender roles, race relations and national identity.

AB  - Using Gallup survey data and online news from 2015 to 2020, this study explored the degree to which audiences "meld" agendas from a wide array of news sources for the five most popular issues in the U.S.: the government and politicians, immigration, the economy, race relations, and healthcare. Overall, audiences of varying ideology had agendas that were congruent. Media agendas also appeared congruent, except on the issue of the economy. Conservative news media had a strong influence on audience issue salience. Horizontal (all partisan) and vertical (nonpartisan) media were in a virtual tie for influence among audiences. Despite an erosion in media trust, conservatives were receptive to issue salience from news media of all types, including liberal media. Liberals did not mirror elite media issue saliences, but were influenced by all other types of media, including conservative media. Moderates were influenced by the entire media landscape, to a somewhat even degree. Four out of the five issues studied here showed varying news media influence with no one media group nor ideology owning the agendas of an issue. The exception observed here was the issue of healthcare, which was influenced exclusively by liberal media for all three ideological groups.

AB  - Breaking bad news is a mandatory provision in the professional life of nearly every physician. One of its most frequent occasions is the diagnosis of malignancy. Responding to the recipients' emotions is a critical issue in the delivery of unsettling information, and has an impact on the patient's trust in the treating physician, adjustment to illness and ultimately treatment. Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, several measures of social distancing and isolation have been introduced to our clinical setting. In the wake of these restrictions, it is important to reexamine existing communication guidelines to determine their applicability to face-to-face counseling in the context of social distancing, as well as to new communication technologies, such as telemedicine. We address these issues and discuss strategies to convey bad news the most empathetic and comprehensible way possible.

AB  - The experience of social exclusion has been shown to trigger aggressive, antisocial behavior. This outcome is particularly problematic if such retaliatory acts, in addition to being harmful, are also highly original and creative and difficult to anticipate and to defend against. For this reason, the present study investigated whether a laboratory social exclusion paradigm would increase malevolent creativity-creativity deliberately aimed at damaging others. In a sample of n = 81, male and female participants were either excluded or included by an alleged group of peers based on their personal preferences, and then generated as many original ideas as possible to take revenge on other wrongdoers (Malevolent Creativity Test, MCT). State affect was additionally assessed before and after exclusion or inclusion. Analyses revealed that social exclusion had significant effects on individuals' malevolent creativity performance, with the excluded group generating a greater number of vengeful ideas in the MCT that were also rated as more original. Greater harmfulness (malevolence) of revenge ideas was specifically observed for excluded women. While social exclusion was linked to increased anger and general negative affect, affect changes did not mediate exclusion effects on malevolent creativity. This hints at more complex mechanisms linking social exclusion and creative antisocial behavior other than immediate emotional responses. Altogether, our findings emphasize the role of situative factors for the emergence of malevolent creativity, suggesting that anybody may resort to highly malicious ideation under threatening circumstances.

The results showed that tag questions and argument quality directly affected speaker and message quality perceptions and cognitive responses. They also interacted to directly affect perceptions of the speaker's power and credibility. Mediational analyses also showed that tag questions and argument quality had indirect effects on attitude change. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for the cognitive processing of and research on linguistic markers of powerlessness.

   Design/methodology/approach - Data-gathering tools used included questionnaire, observation and informal interview with selected college librarians.
   Findings - Application of ICT in Indian college libraries has not reached a very high level. Lack of budget, lack of manpower, lack of skilled staff and lack of training are the main constraints for not automating library activities. Even though library professionals have shown a positive attitude towards the use of ICT applications and library automation, they need extensive and appropriate training to make use of ICT tools.
   Originality/value - This is a comprehensive study on the use of ICT in Indian college libraries. Its findings should help college librarians, local government and also the University Grants Commission, New Delhi.

AB  - Racial discrimination has intensified in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic, but how it disrupted healthcare is largely unknown. This study investigates the association of racial discrimination with delaying or forgoing care during the pandemic based on data from a nationally representative survey, the Health, Ethnicity and Pandemic (HEAP) study (n = 2552) conducted in October 2020 with Asians, Hispanics and non-Hispanic Blacks oversampled. Racial discrimination during the pandemic was assessed in three domains: experienced racial discrimination, race-related cyberbullying, and Coronavirus racial bias beliefs. Respondents answered whether they had delayed or forgone any type of healthcare due to the pandemic. Overall, 63.7% of respondents reported delaying or forgoing any healthcare during the pandemic. About 20.3% East/Southeast Asians, 18.6% nonHispanic Blacks and 15.9% Hispanics reported experiences of racial discrimination, compared with 2.8% of non-Hispanic Whites. Experienced racial discrimination was associated with delaying/forgoing care among nonHispanic Blacks (Adjusted odds ratios[AOR] = 4.58, 95% confidence interval[CI]: 2.22-9.45), Hispanics (AOR = 3.88, 95%CI: 1.51-9.98), and East/Southeast Asians (AOR = 2.14, 95%CI: 1.22-3.77). Experiencing race-related cyberbullying was significantly associated with delaying/forgoing care among non-Hispanic Blacks (AOR = 1.34, 95%CI: 1.02-1.77) and East/Southeast Asians (AOR = 1.51, 95%CI: 1.19-1.90). Coronavirus racial bias was significantly associated with delaying/forgoing care among East/Southeast Asians (AOR = 1.55, 95%CI: 1.16-2.07). The three domains of racial discrimination were consistently associated with delayed or forgone health care among East/Southeast Asians during the COVID-19 pandemic; some of the associations were also seen among non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics. These results demonstrate that addressing racism is important for reducing disparities in healthcare delivery during the pandemic and beyond.

AB  - Since prehistoric times, cetaceans have been important food sources, but they also have been seen as monsters of the sea, a perception that did not change much during the past centuries. Due to a better understanding of their biology in recent years, the public perception towards cetaceans has been evolving. Various studies have been developed aiming to evaluate the attitude and perception of humans towards cetaceans, but these have been local and focused on specific target groups. Our study aimed to evaluate the attitude of the public towards cetaceans on a wide scale by using an international online questionnaire distributed exclusively on social media An attitudinal scale proposed by Kellen (1985) on a Likert scale matrix was used with nine statements referring to dolphins and nine referring to whales. Even though specific constraints occur from such types of research (e.g., mostly highly educated and young respondents from developed countries), 5,222 responses were collected from 107 countries in total. While Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania were well represented, the number of answers from Africa and Asia were limited. Our results revealed a shift in the public attitude towards cetaceans, with the majority of people exhibiting a positive attitude following the global trend of a rising appreciation for wildlife. Whaling nations and ex-whaling nations that have continued that practice until recently exhibited a more negative attitude towards cetaceans, revealing the importance of culture, heritage, and memory in shaping attitudes. Finally, we discuss our findings under the light of the culture and history of different countries.

AB  - The main intent of this research is identifying attitudes and practices improving English language skills through mobile applications in secondary schools teachers in Awi zone. This day has becoming digital throughout life. Being assisted by the technology, it is good to build a valuable attitude and engage in tasks to progress English language skills using MAs is why the researchers conducted this research. To achieve the objectives, descriptive survey research design and mixed research approach were held. Observation, interview, and questionnaire were data collection tools. Furthermore, mixed data analysis method was applied. SPSS version 23 was used for the quantitative data and analyzed using descriptive statistics like mean, percentage, and portrayed in tables; qualitative data on the other hand, were mixed with quantitative data. The outcomes showed that ELTs have positive attitudes, but they sometimes practice to develop their ELS through MAs. Finally, it is recommended the government of Ethiopia should fulfill the access of connection throughout rural towns which have high schools; the ministry of education should provide educational materials apart from the textbooks and commercial references, and language skills and information communication technology instructors should provide need based training for the English language teachers at high schools.

AB  - When seeking information, Internet users often find multiple communicators co-presenting and expressing their opinions. This study examined how people judge message senders' credibility in a multi-source environment based on system-generated cues, the consensus among multiple sources, and the effect of receiver's familiarity with the online platform. Moreover, this research examined the mediating role of source credibility in attitude change in an online consumer-review community. Results indicated that users familiar with a platform were more likely to use system-generated cues for their judgment of credibility along with consensus heuristics, and the combination of heuristics influenced attitude through credibility. However, unfamiliar users relied on consensus heuristics but not system-generated cues. These findings and their theoretical implications are discussed.

AB  - Background: Despite numerous studies exploring medical students' attitudes to communication skills learning (CSL), there are apparently no studies comparing different experiential learning methods and their influence on students' attitudes.
   Aims: We compared medical students' attitudes to learning communication skills before and after a communication course in the data as a whole, by gender and when divided into three groups using different methods.
   Method: Second-year medical students (n = 129) were randomly assigned to three groups. In group A (n = 42) the theatre in education method, in group B (n = 44) simulated patients and in group C (n = 43) role-play were used. The data were gathered before and after the course using Communication Skills Attitude Scale.
   Results: Students' positive attitudes to learning communication skills (PAS; positive attitude scale) increased significantly and their negative attitudes (NAS; negative attitude scale) decreased significantly between the beginning and end of the course. Female students had more positive attitudes than the male students. There were no significant differences in the three groups in the mean scores for PAS or NAS measured before or after the course.
   Conclusions: The use of experiential methods and integrating communication skills training with visits to health centres may help medical students to appreciate the importance of CSL.

AB  - Background: The adoption and use of health information technology (IT) continues to grow around the globe. In Switzerland, the government nor professional associations have to this day provided incentives for health IT adoption.
   Objective: We aim to assess the proportion of physicians who are routinely working with electronic health data and describe to what extent physicians exchange electronic health data with peers and other health care providers. Additionally, we aim to estimate the effect of physicians' attitude towards health IT on the adoption of electronic workflows.
   Methods: Between May and July 2013, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1200 practice based physicians in Switzerland. Respondents were asked to report on their technical means and where applicable their paper-based workarounds to process laboratory data, examination results, referral letters and physician's letters. Physicians' view of barriers and facilitators towards health IT use was determined by a composite score.
   Results: A response rate of 57.1% (n = 685) was reached. The sample was considered to be representative for physicians in Swiss ambulatory care. 35.2% of the respondents documented patients' health status with the help of a longitudinal semi-structured electronic text record generated by one or more encounters in the practice. Depending on the task within a workflow, around 11-46% of the respondents stated to rely on electronic workflow practices to process laboratory and examination data and dispatch referral notes and physician's letters. The permanent use of electronic workflow processes was infrequent. Instead, respondents reported paper-based workarounds affecting specific tasks within a workflow. Physicians' attitude towards health IT was significantly associated with the adoption of electronic workflows (OR 1.04-1.31, p < 0.05), but the effect sizes of factors related to the working environment (e.g., regional factors, medical specialty, type of practice) were larger.
   Conclusion: At present, only a few physicians in Swiss ambulatory care routinely work with electronic health data. Until more of their peers participate in electronic exchange of structured clinical information, most physicians will continue to stay in paper-based systems and workarounds. The survey found that physicians with a positive attitude towards health IT were more likely to adopt electronic workflows, but the impact is minor. It will likely be necessary to introduce financial incentives and develop national standards in order to promote the adoption by a critical mass of practicing clinicians.

AB  - Background: It has been widely communicated that individuals with underlying health conditions are at higher risk of severe disease due to COVID-19 than healthy peers. As social distancing measures continue during the COVID-19 pandemic, experts encourage individuals with underlying conditions to engage in telehealth appointments to maintain continuity of care while minimizing risk exposure. To date, however, little information has been provided regarding telehealth uptake among this high-risk population.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to describe the telehealth use, resource needs, and information sources of individuals with chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary objectives include exploring differences in telehealth use by sociodemographic characteristics.
   Methods: Data for this study were collected through an electronic survey distributed between May 12-14, 2020, to members of 26 online health communities for individuals with chronic disease. Descriptive statistics were run to explore telehealth use, support needs, and information sources, and z tests were run to assess differences in sociodemographic factors and information and support needs among those who did and did not use telehealth services.
   Results: Among the 2210 respondents, 1073 (49%) reported engaging in telehealth in the past 4 months. Higher proportions of women engaged in telehealth than men (890/1781, 50% vs 181/424, 43%; P=.007), and a higher proportion of those earning household incomes of more than US $100,000 engaged in telehealth than those earning less than US $30,000 (195/370, 53% vs 241/530 45%; P=.003). Although 59% (133/244) of those younger than 40 years and 54% (263/486) of those aged 40-55 years used telehealth, aging populations were less likely to do so, with only 45% (677/1500) of individuals 56 years or older reporting telehealth use (P<.001 and P=.001, respectively). Patients with cystic fibrosis, lupus, and ankylosing spondylitis recorded the highest proportions of individuals using telehealth when compared to those with other diagnoses. Of the 2210 participants, 1333 (60%) participants either looked up information about the virus online or planned to in the future, and when asked what information or support would be most helpful right now, over half (1151/2210, 52%) responded "understanding how COVID-19 affects people with my health condition."
   Conclusions: Nearly half of the study sample reported participating in telehealth in the past 4 months. Future efforts to engage individuals with underlying medical conditions in telehealth should focus on outreach to men, members of lower-income households, and aging populations. These results may help inform and refine future health communications to further engage this at-risk population in telehealth as the pandemic continues.

AB  - The present research investigated whether perceived social exclusion would lead women to embrace the social group of the family (and its traditional gender roles). In two studies, it was found that in comparison to a social inclusion manipulation, a social exclusion manipulation caused women to report significantly more positive inclinations towards traditional, gendered work allocations (Studies 1 and 2). Moreover, seeking meaning in life mediated the relationship between social exclusion and the perceived attractiveness of the roles of mother and housewife (Study 2). In a third study, adherence to family-related concepts was examined in both socially excluded and included-men, but no difference was found between the two groups. It thus appears that social exclusion does not enhance the attractiveness of familial relationships for men. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Across two studies, the current research investigated how different dimensions of narcissism (grandiosity/agentic extraversion, entitlement/self-centered antagonism, vulnerability/narcissistic neuroticism) relate to social networking site (SNS) use and behaviors. Study 1 employed a community sample of young adults, whereas Study 2 examined college students. Participants completed assessments of narcissism and SNS use through an online survey. Grandiosity/agentic extraversion was generally associated with greater levels of downward social comparison relative to the other two dimensions. Entitlement/self-centered antagonism generally showed weak correlations with SNS outcomes. Vulnerability/narcissistic neuroticism was generally associated with greater upward social comparison and perceived social exclusion relative to the other two dimensions. Results suggest that SNS experiences may vary depending on the dimensions of narcissism. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Public support for the rights of persons with intellectual disability (ID) and their acceptance in local communities has been rarely studied internationally and the variables associated with more positive attitudes remain to be confirmed.
   Aims: To develop and test a model that brought together personal, organisational and national predictors related to public attitudes that have been previously identified in past research.
   Methods and procedures: Self-completed, online surveys were undertaken with market research panels in 17 countries and in eight cities in the USA with a total of 36,508 respondents who were representative in terms of gender and age. Path analysis was used to explore the inter-relationships among the predictor, possible mediating and outcomes variables.
   Outcomes and results: The resulting model was a good fit for the data. Support for the rights and community acceptance of people with ID was highest among university educated respondents, those who were comfortable at meeting people with ID and those living in countries with very high ratings on the Inequality Adjusted Human Development Index.
   Conclusions and implications: The model could guide further research into public attitudes alongside the development of interventions to promote more positive attitudes. Further research into the validity of the model is proposed.

AB  - Purpose - New information and communication technologies provide tools that help users to progress from traditional teaching methods towards new and more participative approaches consistent with collaborative learning. This study aims to assess the application of online discussion forums as. a support tool for lecturing in marketing.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors seek to pinpoint which factors determine student use of online forums on the basis of the Technology Acceptance Model and to provide empirical evidence concerning their impact-on learning performance.
   Findings - The findings indicate that it is not ease of use but perceived usefulness that determines a positive attitude towards forums, an attitude which in turn influences forum use and perceived learning. Adopting a new learning system may be seen as a gradual process in which students become involved as they develop a positive attitude towards the system.
   Practical implications - Lecturers and web developers should pay particular care not only to the layout of the web site supporting the forums, but also to their usefulness and ability to stimulate ongoing and interesting debates among students.
   Originality/value - The findings of the study are valuable in helping lecturers and educational administrators in the application and promotion of online forums for creating knowledge through internal and interactive dialogue in a more conversational model of learning.

AB  - Mental illness is not uncommon among young adults, but negative attitudes towards mental disorders and lack of parental support might be associated with hesitancy in seeking professional help. This study aimed to examine the relationships of parental support, beliefs about mental illness, and mental help-seeking among young adults in Saudi Arabia. This quantitative cross-sectional study included a convenience sample of 236 young adults (ages 18-25) with the majority of the total (86.4%) being female. Data were collected via three self-administered questionnaires: The Perceived Parental Support Scale, Beliefs toward Mental Illness scale, and Mental Help Seeking Attitude Scale. Results indicated that the participants had a moderately negative attitude toward mental illness, a moderately positive attitude toward parental support, and a highly positive attitude toward mental help-seeking. No significant relationships were found among the study variables. The study highlights that despite young adults' positive attitude toward mental help-seeking and parental support, they have negative views toward people with mental illnesses. Educational programs in schools and media are needed to improve attitudes and enhance readiness to interact with people with mental illness.

AB  - Purpose: The objective of this paper is to assess clinical dental providers' baseline knowledge and attitudes about the implementation of three clinical decision support (CDS) tools built into the electronic health record (EHR) of a multi-specialty group dental practice.
   Procedures: An electronic survey designed to examine predisposing factors for acceptance of EHR-based tools, caries and periodontal disease management by risk assessment and a risk assessment-based Proactive Dental Care Plan, was distributed to all Willamette Dental Group (WDG) employees. The survey collected demographic data, along with measures of job experience and satisfaction, comfort with dental information technology, and attitudes and knowledge of each CDS tool. WDG provided data on site-level patient and financing mix, patient satisfaction data, employee role (e.g. dentist) and tenure with company. The survey was conducted 3 months prior to the rollout of the CDS tools in November 2013. The survey was distributed electronically to all WDG employees (n = 1166), of whom 58.5% (n = 682) were clinicians, located in 53 sites in Oregon, Washington and Idaho. The overall response rate was 79.8% (n = 930), with a response rate of 83.1% (n = 567) from all clinicians. Of these, 24.3% were general and specialist dentists (n = 138); 26.6% were dental hygienists (n = 151), and 49% were dental assistants (n = 278).
   Principal Findings: The clinicians surveyed reported being highly amenable to implementation of the three CDS tools. Clinicians' attitudes reflected higher expected improvement in patient care and quality than in business processes due to the implementation. The clinician characteristics most strongly correlated with a positive attitude toward the CDS tool implementation (as measured on Likert scale I = low to 5 = high) included satisfaction with the EHR (0.499, rho < 0.001), job satisfaction (0.458, rho < 0.001), finding change to be exciting (0.398, rho < 0.001), degree of control perceived over work (0.352, rho < 0.001), and a perception of having adequate tools to get work done (0.340, rho < 0.001). Higher reported frequency (scale 1 = never, 7 = always) of feeling burned out (-0.297, rho < 0.001), feeling emotionally drained (-0.265, rho < 0.001), and feeling work is a strain (-0.205, rho < 0.001) had the greatest correlation with negative attitudes.
   Conclusion: This is the first study to examine dental provider attitudes toward the implementation of CDS tools incorporated within an electronic health record. Provider attitudes toward CDS tools can shape the entire implementation process for better or worse. This study contributes to the literature by providing an understanding of factors related to positive attitudes at the outset of a system change and can help guide organizational administrators to better prepare their workforce and organization for adoption of evidence-based dentistry tools such as a CDS system.

AB  - Critical thinking is widely recognized as a necessary skill for growth and intellectual development due to a variety of factors, including globalization, the revolution of information technology, modernity, and connectivity. EFL teachers can lay the groundwork for their students to attain critical thinking through various methods, models, and strategies. The present investigation suggests that the teacher could promote EFL learners' critical thinking through guided discovery model of instruction. Henceforth, the current paper endeavors to enlighten the adequacy of applying guided discovery for developing learners' critical thinking skills. It is an experimental research that investigates: how may guided discovery contribute to the development of EFL learners' critical thinking? It attempts to examine the utility of discovery learning in teaching students how to process and think critically about the education they receive where information has become readily available and accessible. To this aim, 40 EFL Master students who took educational psychology courses were nominated from the university center of Naama, Algeria. The researcher selected Peter Honey Critical Thinking test and focus group discussions to attain data on students' critical thinking skills. The test results demonstrated that the experimental group outperformed the control group. The students become more autonomous, reflect on their learning experiences, and identify the most useful strategies. Furthermore, the analysis of focus group interviews revealed that the experimental group participants hold positive attitudes toward discovery learning. They perceive it as a precious method that can enhance their awareness about the value of thinking critically.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the limited previous research on knowledge sharing in universities, by profiling the attitudes of and intentions towards knowledge sharing of UK academics, and by profiling their views of some of the factors that might be expected to impact on knowledge sharing activities.
   Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire-based survey was used to gather a profile of UK academics' attitudes and intentions towards knowledge sharing and related factors, including expected rewards and associations, expected contribution, normative beliefs on knowledge sharing, leadership, structure, autonomy affiliation to institution, affiliation to discipline, and technology platform. Responses were received from 230 academics in 11 universities.
   Findings - Respondents had positive attitudes towards knowledge sharing and their intentions in this area were also good. This may be related to their belief that knowledge sharing will improve and extend their relationships with colleagues, and offer opportunities for internal promotion and external appointments. Respondents are relatively neutral regarding the way in which they are led, and the role of organisational structure and information technology in knowledge sharing. They have a relatively low level of affiliation to their university perceptions of a high level of autonomy coupled with a high level of affiliation to their discipline.
   Originality/value - This study demonstrates that universities do have an embedded knowledge culture, but that culture is individualistic in nature and to some extent self-serving and instrumental. This poses interesting challenges for knowledge management in universities.

AB  - Background: Despite consumers appearing to assign great importance to green purchasing and expecting companies to produce their goods in an environmentally friendly way, they do not always exhibit this positive attitude while making purchases.
   Focus: This paper aims to discuss the extent to which green purchasing behavior in the Arabic Gulf is affected by individuals' perceived environmental attitudes, concern, perceived seriousness of environmental problems, perceived environmental responsibility, perceived self-identity in environmental protection, perceived social context in environmental protection, as well as demographics.
   Methods: The study adopted a quantitative research approach using a survey questionnaire on a sample of 324 individuals residing in different Arab countries in the Gulf area. A 5-point Likert scale was used. Path analysis was conducted to test and evaluate the hypothesized relationships among constructs.
   Results: The study found importantly, by using multiple regression analyses, that consumers' environmental concern, self-identity in environmental protection, and social context in environmental protection are significant predictors of green purchasing behavior and can predict 38.9% of green purchasing behavior. Among demographic factors, gender showed a significant effect on green purchasing behavior.
   Importance to Social Marketing Field: The present study enhances the social marketing literature through the understanding of green purchasing behaviors from a perspective of non-Western countries.
   Recommendation for Research or Practice: This paper has significant managerial implications. The findings could help marketers and government in formulating strategies that encourage green purchasing behavior in the Arabic Gulf.
   Limitations: Although the current study shed some light on green purchasing behaviors in the Arabic Gulf, it did not focus on a particular type of green product; rather, it looked at green purchasing behavior in general.

AB  - Social dominance orientation (SDO) and stereotypes about out-groups can influence social distance significantly. We tested the effects of these 2 factors on social distance and a probable mediation effect of upper class stereotype with participants from lower class groups of Chinese people in 3 studies (N = 105 in Study 1; N = 102 in Study 2; N = 112 in Study 3). The results in Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that higher SDO and a more positive stereotype elicited less social distance between lower class and upper class members. In Study 3, the mediation effect of stereotype was also significant. These results provide insight into the mechanism of the perceived social distance between social classes, which is meaningful for social harmony in China.

AB  - Internet addiction is a growingly prevalent behavioral addiction that causes numerous psychosocial problems. Investigating the causes and consequences of Internet addiction is fundamental to comprehend and prevent it. Therefore, the current study provided protective and promotive factors for undesired effects of social exclusion on Internet addiction. The study examined a moderated mediation model to test whether mindfulness moderated the mediating role of self-forgiveness in the association between social exclusion and Internet addiction among young adults. The participants of the present study included 358 undergraduate students attending a state university in Turkey. They ranged in age from 20 to 28 years (M = 21.89, SD = 1.95). The participants comprised 206 (57.5%) female and 152 (42.5%) male college young adults. Overall, the study findings indicated that self-forgiveness mediated the relationship between social exclusion and Internet addiction, and mindfulness moderated the mediating role of self-forgiveness in this association. Contending with negative outcomes of social exclusion and Internet addiction, and mitigating and buffering roles of self-forgiveness and mindfulness provide important implications to design prevention and intervention services for reducing Internet-related addictive behaviors.

AB  - Digital pathology systems (DPSs) have been globally implemented, and computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) software has been actively developed in recent years. This study aimed to investigate perceptions of digital pathology and the demand for CAD. An online survey involving members of the Korean Society of Pathologists was conducted, and a demonstration clip of the diagnostic assistant software for a prostate needle biopsy was shown to them to provide a simple experience with CAD. One hundred sixty-four Korean pathologists (13.6% of 1210 Korean pathologists) participated. The majority (77.4%) answered affirmatively regarding the necessity of implementing a DPS, and 26.8% had plans to implement or increase the use of DPSs in the following 2-3 years at their medical institutions. Pathologists felt that multidisciplinary care or conference accessibility (56.7%), remote consultation (49.4%), and big data building (32.9%) were useful parts of DPSs. Most pathologists (81.7%) responded that CAD software would assist with the diagnostic process. In a prostate needle biopsy, pathologists used the software to improve the measurement of tumor volume and/or length and core length but not to suggest a diagnostic name or Gleason grade. Korean pathologists who participated in the survey had highly positive perceptions of digital pathology and maintained a positive attitude toward the use of CAD software.

AB  - The aim of this article was to examine how media attention affects the social exclusion of young refugees negotiating their way towards settlement in Australia. Emerging stereotypes and prejudices against young male refugees require new ways of understanding the impact of global, national and local issues on their social exclusion. The article brings together the impact of (a) the global politicisation and backlash against refugees, (b) Australians negative perception of refugees and (c) the increased reporting of young African-Australian and Pasifika-Australians as the perpetrators of youth violence. The article recognises the overlapping dimensions of social exclusion for young refugees and considers their 'spatial', 'relational' and 'socio-political' exclusion. The examination of media reporting of a landmark legal case of discrimination and racial profiling reveals a discourse of media attention that has perpetuated the social exclusion of a group of young African-Australian refugees living on a Melbourne public housing estate. The sensationalist and prejudicial media connection of the landmark legal case, youth violence and young African-Australians living on the Flemington Estate demonstrates the challenges young male refugees face in negotiating their settlement in Australia. This article makes a contribution to understanding the multidimensional nature of youth exclusion in contemporary times.

AB  - BackgroundPublic Health policies related to social distancing efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic helped slow the infection rate. However, individual-level factors associated with social distancing are largely unknown. We sought to examine social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in Michigan, an infection "hotspot" state in the United States early in the pandemic.MethodsTwo surveys were distributed to Michigan residents via email lists and social media following COVID-19 related state mandates in March; 45,691 adults responded to the first survey and 8512 to the second. Staying home >= 3 out of 5 previous days defined having more social distancing. Logistic regression models were used to examine potential factors associated with more social distancing.ResultsMost respondents were women (86% in Survey 1, 87% in Survey 2). In Survey 1, 63% reported more social distancing, increasing to 78% in Survey 2. Female sex and having someone (or self) sick in the home were consistently associated with higher social distancing, while increasing age was positively associated in Survey 1 but negatively associated in Survey 2. Most respondents felt social distancing policies were important (88% in Survey 1; 91% in Survey 2).ConclusionsMichiganders responding to the surveys were both practicing and supportive of social distancing. State-level executive orders positively impacted behaviors early in the COVID-19 pandemic in Michigan. Additional supports are needed to help vulnerable populations practice social distancing, including older individuals.

AB  - A mandatory National Premarital Thalassemia Screening Program was implemented in Jordan in 2004. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of university students in North Jordan toward this program. Data was collected from 542 students from four universities (two public and two private universities) located in North Jordan, using a structured questionnaire. Results of t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that while respondents had adequate knowledge of and positive attitudes toward the premarital screening program, there was still a lack of knowledge about the disease itself. Nearly half the respondents were under the impression that -thalassemia (-thal) is a disease that can be treated simply. One-third of the respondents believed that if both partners were carriers of -thal they should proceed with marriage. Negative attitude was revealed when many respondents believed that diagnosing a family member as a carrier affects other family members' future marriage opportunities. Significant associations were detected between the knowledge scores and gender, urban/rural residence, and the university where the students were enrolled. Students in private universities showed significantly lower attitude scores. Consideration of prenatal diagnostic services as part of a -thal prevention program is necessary. It would also be helpful to include information about -thal as a preventable inherited illness with a severe debilitating impact on the family in the high school curriculum. There is also a need for social marketing of the program.

KW  - social media
AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of conspiracy theories have emerged. A popular theory posits that the pandemic is a hoax and suggests that certain hospitals are "empty." Research has shown that accepting conspiracy theories increases the likelihood that an individual may ignore government advice about social distancing and other public health interventions. Due to the possibility of a second wave and future pandemics, it is important to gain an understanding of the drivers of misinformation and strategies to mitigate it.
   Objective: This study set out to evaluate the #FilmYourHospital conspiracy theory on Twitter, attempting to understand the drivers behind it. More specifically, the objectives were to determine which online sources of information were used as evidence to support the theory, the ratio of automated to organic accounts in the network, and what lessons can be learned to mitigate the spread of such a conspiracy theory in the future.
   Methods: Twitter data related to the #FilmYourHospital hashtag were retrieved and analyzed using social network analysis across a 7-day period from April 13-20, 2020. The data set consisted of 22,785 tweets and 11,333 Twitter users. The Botometer tool was used to identify accounts with a higher probability of being bots.
   Results: The most important drivers of the conspiracy theory are ordinary citizens; one of the most influential accounts is a Brexit supporter. We found that YouTube was the information source most linked to by users. The most retweeted post belonged to a verified Twitter user, indicating that the user may have had more influence on the platform. There was a small number of automated accounts (bots) and deleted accounts within the network.
   Conclusions: Hashtags using and sharing conspiracy theories can be targeted in an effort to delegitimize content containing misinformation. Social media organizations need to bolster their efforts to label or remove content that contains misinformation. Public health authorities could enlist the assistance of influencers in spreading antinarrative content.

AB  - Studies on previous outbreaks of contagious diseases suggest that the impact of the emotions associated with an epidemic can be greater than that of the epidemic in terms of the number of people affected. This study explores the relationships between the three most commonly expressed emotional responses to the COVID-19 pandemic (fear, anger, and depression) and two outcome variables (compliance with the social-distancing policy and the stigmatization of those infected by COVID-19). A large online, public opinion survey was conducted in South Korea (n = 1000) between 4 and 11 June 2020, which was between the first and the second waves of COVID-19. A series of regression analyses suggest that the emotional response was accompanied by differential behavioral and perceptual consequences. Fear was consistently positively related to all indicators of compliance with social-distancing policies (the voluntary practice of social distancing, support for the "routine-life-distancing" policy, and support for stronger social-distancing policies). Anger was positively related to both stigmatization indicators (responsibility attribution and stigmatizing attitude toward people infected with COVID-19). Finally, depression showed negative relationships with support for the "routine-life-distancing" policy and for stronger social-distancing policies but a positive relationship with the voluntary practice of social distancing. By examining whether and how certain types of emotional responses are more or less related to compliance with social distancing and stigmatization, the present study provides practical implications for effective public communication during an epidemic such as COVID-19.

AB  - Does relative performance information (PI) still impact politicians' attitudes when the potential for external blame or credit is limited? And, if not, is the active disclosure of PI about government activities with a low propensity for media attention an effective strategy for increasing the effect of PI? Despite the tendency to progressively disclose PI, empirical evidence on the effectiveness of publicly disclosing PI is almost non-existent. Hence, a survey embedded experiment was developed, building on self-determination theory and blame-avoidance theory, to assess how the provision of PI with a low propensity to attract media attention affects politicians' attitudes towards resource allocation and whether this effect is altered by the public disclosure of PI. Data from 795 Belgian (Flemish) local councilors indicates that PI with a low propensity for media attention does impact politicians' attitudes towards effort allocation but that public disclosure of PI mitigates the effect size in the case of negative-valence PI. Thus, the results draw attention to the unintended- and potentially dysfunctional-effects of the disclosure of PI.

AB  - Research on the truth effect has demonstrated that statements are rated as more credible when they are repeatedly presented. However, current research indicates that there are limits to the truth effect and that too many repetitions can decrease message credibility. This study investigates whether message negativity contributes to this boomerang effect and whether the interaction of credibility and negativity influences political attitudes. These assumptions were tested in an online experiment in which the frequency of exposure to political campaign posters and message negativity were manipulated. The results show that negativity on political campaign posters functions as a crucial moderator, especially in combination with high-frequency exposure. Repeatedly presented negative posters resulted in a more negative attitude toward the presented political issue, which was mediated by a decrease in credibility judgments.

AB  - Objective: this study aims to contribute to the development of a conceptual framework that will inform maternity care improvements for expectant mothers with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) by exploring the structure, functions, and perceived quality of social support received by women with IDD during pregnancy and childbirth.
   Design/setting: using a grounded theory approach, we conducted an exploratory study set in Ontario, Canada in 2015.
   Participants: the sample included four adult women with IDD who had given birth in the last five years.
   Measurements: data were collected using semi-structured interviews.
   Findings: the structure of social support received by women with IDD consisted of both formal and informal sources, but few or no friendships. Women with IDD reported high levels of informational and instrumental support and low levels of emotional support and social companionship. However, a high level of available support was not always perceived as beneficial. Emergent core categories suggest that social support is perceived as most effective when three conditions are met: (1) support is accessible, (2) support is provided by individuals expressing positive attitudes towards the pregnancy, and (3) autonomy is valued.
   Key conclusions and implications for practice: our study confirms and identifies important gaps in the social support received by expectant mothers with IDD. Women with IDD currently lack accessible informational support, emotional support, and social companionship during pregnancy and childbirth. Additional findings regarding the structure and functions of social support are presented, and a preliminary conceptual framework of effective social support during pregnancy and childbirth, as perceived by women with IDD is also proposed. Findings suggest that increasing support accessibility should be a social and clinical priority; however, maternity care providers should be aware of stigmatizing attitudes and respect the autonomy of pregnant women with IDD as they prepare for motherhood.

AB  - The use of educational video games (EVGs) is gaining momentum as a means to motivate and to engage students in their learning process. Nevertheless, previous research is taking for granted that students have a positive attitude towards EVGs and did not ensure a proper understanding of students' characteristics that might influence their attitude towards them. Therefore, this study's main goal is to explore four students' characteristics (perceived relevance, perceived confidence, media affinity, and perceived self-efficacy) that influence students' attitude towards the use of EVGs to develop competencies. Using the fsQCA method to analyze data gathered on a sample of 128 undergraduate students we delve into different configurations underlying students' positive and negative attitude towards the use of EVGs. Main results suggest three configurations leading to a positive attitude with perceived, relevance being a necessary and sufficient condition for students' positive attitude towards the use of EVGs to develop their competencies. Four configurations were found to condition a negative attitude suggesting that equifinality can be considered when explaining students' attitude towards the use of EVGs to develop competencies. Implications for teachers, limitations of the study, and future research lines are addressed at the end of the paper. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Immunization can contribute to a dramatic reduction in number of vaccine-preventable diseases among children. The aim of this study is to investigate mothers' awareness about child vaccines and vaccination in Jordan. This study was a community-based, cross-sectional study that was performed at public places in Irbid City. Data was collected from 506 mothers. After verbal approval, mothers were interviewed to assess their knowledge, attitudes, and practice toward vaccination. Results show that majority of mothers had acceptable knowledge and positive attitude toward vaccination. Most of mothers (94.7-86.8%) were able to identify vaccines that are mandatory as per the national vaccination program. Lower knowledge was observed among mothers (71.6%) for HIB vaccination being mandatory. Most mothers (97.2%) had vaccination card for their baby form the national vaccination programs. Vaccination delay was reported by about 36.6% of mothers and was shown to be associated with significantly (P = 0.001) lower vaccination knowledge/attitude score. Additionally, mothers who reported to be regularly offered information about vaccination during visits and those who identified medical staff members as their major information source had significantly higher vaccination knowledge/attitude score (P = 0.002). In conclusion, vaccination coverage rate is high; however, some aspects of knowledge, attitudes, and practice of vaccination need to be improved. Knowledge and attitudes of mothers were directly associated with their practice of vaccination. Medical staff education about vaccination during each visit seems to be the most effective tool that directly reflects on better practice of vaccination such as reducing the possibility for vaccination delay.

AB  - Background. Information about organ donation and transplantation (ODT) is the basis on which attitude toward this subject is shaped. The information about ODT that teachers can provide to school children is fundamental for them to develop a favorable attitude to this matter in the future.
   Objectives. The aims of this study were: 1) to determine the type of information on ODT received by secondary school teachers; 2) to determine through which means teachers obtain information about donation; and 3) to determine the influence of each information source on their attitudes.
   Methods. A sample was selected from 10 secondary schools, which were geographically stratified in southeast Spain. A validated questionnaire was applied about attitude toward ODT among teachers (n = 327), which was completed anonymously and was self-administered. The statistical analysis used the Student t test and the chi-square test.
   Results. The questionnaire completion rate was 88% (n = 288); 99% (n = 286) of the responding teachers stated that they had received some information about ODT, and 40% (n = 117) indicated that they had good or very good information. The teachers received information about ODT from several sources, the most frequent being audiovisual means: television (89%), press (60%), and radio (47%). Social/family means were also important, such as conversations with other people (51%) and conversations with family members (39%). Teachers who reported having good information were more in favor of ODT than those who had limited or no information (P = .001). Only the exchange of information through conversations with family members was related to a positive attitude (P = .009).
   Conclusions. Most secondary school teachers in southeast Spain receive information about ODT. However, fewer than half think that the information is good. Teachers receive information through different means, especially audiovisual means, mainly television. Nevertheless, the social/family means has the most influence on attitude.

AB  - Psychiatric advance directives (PADs) allow service users to participate in their own mental health care in the event that they have a future mental health crisis and are deemed incompetent to make decisions, but few patients complete these documents. This Open Forum reports on factors that have helped or hindered completion of PADs in New Zealand. Perceived barriers to completion include resource limitations, procedural issues, access and storage problems, and mistrust between clinicians and service users regarding implementation. Having management and nursing "champions" of the process and organizing outreach meetings for all interested parties appear to aid completion. Targeted education and training promote creation and use of PADs, address negative attitudes, and assist service users in creating these documents. Information technology support is vital to having PADs uploaded and accessed in medical records.

AB  - Author summaryWhy was this study done? As of May 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has spread to nearly every country in the world since it first emerged in China in December 2019. Confronted with a COVID-19 epidemic, public health policy makers in different countries are seeking recommendations on how to delay and/or flatten its peak. Evaluation of the impact of social distancing mandated by the governments in many countries and of other prevention measures to control further spread of COVID-19 is urgent, especially because of the large societal and economic impact of the former. What did the researchers do and find? We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to awareness of COVID-19 and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the epidemic dynamics. We showed that self-imposed measures can prevent a large epidemic if their efficacy exceeds 50%. We estimate that short-term government-imposed social distancing that is initiated early into the epidemic can buy time (at most 7 months for a 3-month intervention) for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden. The delay to the peak number of diagnoses can be even longer and the height of the peak can be additionally reduced if the same intervention is combined with self-imposed measures that are continued after lifting government-imposed social distancing. What do these findings mean? Raising awareness of self-imposed measures such as handwashing and mask-wearing is crucial in controlling the ongoing epidemic. Short-term early initiated government-imposed social distancing combined with self-imposed measures provides essential time for increasing capacity of healthcare systems and can significantly mitigate the epidemic. In addition to policies on social distancing, governments and public health institutions should continuously mobilize people to adopt self-imposed measures with proven efficacy in order to successfully tackle COVID-19.
   Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread to nearly every country in the world since it first emerged in China in December 2019. Many countries have implemented social distancing as a measure to "flatten the curve" of the ongoing epidemics. Evaluation of the impact of government-imposed social distancing and of other measures to control further spread of COVID-19 is urgent, especially because of the large societal and economic impact of the former. The aim of this study was to compare the individual and combined effectiveness of self-imposed prevention measures and of short-term government-imposed social distancing in mitigating, delaying, or preventing a COVID-19 epidemic. Methods and findings We developed a deterministic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 in a population stratified by disease status (susceptible, exposed, infectious with mild or severe disease, diagnosed, and recovered) and disease awareness status (aware and unaware) due to the spread of COVID-19. Self-imposed measures were assumed to be taken by disease-aware individuals and included handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing. Government-imposed social distancing reduced the contact rate of individuals irrespective of their disease or awareness status. The model was parameterized using current best estimates of key epidemiological parameters from COVID-19 clinical studies. The model outcomes included the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate, and time until the peak number of diagnoses. For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate and diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. We estimate that a large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term government-imposed social distancing alone is estimated to delay (by at most 7 months for a 3-month intervention) but not to reduce the peak. The delay can be even longer and the height of the peak can be additionally reduced if this intervention is combined with self-imposed measures that are continued after government-imposed social distancing has been lifted. Our analyses are limited in that they do not account for stochasticity, demographics, heterogeneities in contact patterns or mixing, spatial effects, imperfect isolation of individuals with severe disease, and reinfection with COVID-19. Conclusions Our results suggest that information dissemination about COVID-19, which causes individual adoption of handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing, can be an effective strategy to mitigate and delay the epidemic. Early initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden. We stress the importance of disease awareness in controlling the ongoing epidemic and recommend that, in addition to policies on social distancing, governments and public health institutions mobilize people to adopt self-imposed measures with proven efficacy in order to successfully tackle COVID-19.

AB  - This study examined the individual and combined effects of exposure to positive Latino exemplars and prototypes in the media on White audience members' attitudes about and judgments regarding Latinos in society. Although it was expected that exposure to these favorable models would promote positive evaluations of Latinos among White consumers, the extent to which one mode of presentation could be privileged in the production of more beneficial outcomes was uncertain based on existing research. These results cautiously indicate that while prototypes may offer some advantages in terms of reducing stereotyping, both exemplar- and prototype-based characterizations of positive race-related media content (alone and in combination) can positively influence consumers' perceptions of target racial/ethnic groups.

AB  - Despite rapid digital development in the past two decades, the remote parts of Australia still experience disadvantages with the adoption and diffusion of digital technology. As the adoption of information and communication technology continues to increase at a significant rate, investigating the underlying factors of the digital divide in general and also in the context of social exclusion in Australia is pertinent. The current study fills the gap in the existing body of knowledge by exploring the effect of socio-demographic factors and remoteness on the digital divide landscape with a country-specific focus on Australia. Using state-wide longitudinal data covering the 1998-2015 period within the panel data estimation framework, this study finds that digital divide is significantly associated with socio-demographic factors and remoteness in Australia. Moreover, the findings affirm that in addition to telecommunication infrastructure development, policymakers should also underscore socio-demographic factors in shaping digital inclusion strategies.

TI  - Leveraging Remote Research Associates During a Pandemic
T2  - WESTERN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE

AB  - Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has seriously impacted clinical research operations in academic medical centers due to social distancing measures and stay-at-home orders. The purpose of this paper is to describe the implementation of a program to continue clinical research based out of an emergency department (ED) using remote research associates (RA).
   Methods: Remote RAs were trained and granted remote access to the electronic health record (EHR) by the health system's core information technology team. Upon gaining access, remote RAs used a dual-authentication process to gain access to a host-based, firewall-protected virtual network where the EHR could be accessed to continue screening and enrollment for ongoing studies. Study training for screening and enrollment was also provided to ensure study continuity.
   Results: With constant support and guidance available to establish this EHR access pathway, the remote RAs were able to gain access relatively independently and without major technical troubleshooting. Each remote RA was granted access and trained on studies within one week and self-reported a high degree of program satisfaction, EHR access ease, and study protocol comfort through informal evaluation surveys.
   Conclusions: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we virtualized a clinical research program to continue important ED-based studies.

AB  - African American university students (n=365) read a description of the fatal shooting of African Americans in incidents that most participants perceived as involving racial bias. Then they completed measures about their distress concerning these incidents, identification with the shooting victims, and feeling personally threatened by the shootings. Higher race-based rejection sensitivity and several components of racial identity (higher racial centrality, higher private regard, and lower public regard) predicted more distress about the shootings via increased feelings of personal threat. Only higher racial centrality was related to more distress based on how much participants identified with the shooting victims. The results document how indirect experiences with race-related shootings may elicit distress about these incidents.

AB  - Interactive media such as the Web have become a popular and important vehicle for communicating health information. However, little attention has been given to theorizing and empirically testing the effects of interactive media and the theoretical construct of interactivity. In this paper, we clearly identify and define the nature of interactivity examined. We then develop and test a theoretical model of website interactivity on information processing, involvement with communication, and attitude change in the context of stigma of mental illness. The results of an experiment revealed that interactivity of the website had positive main and moderating effects on dependent variables, while involvement with communication played a significant role in explaining the effects of interactivity. Implications for future research and for health communication campaigns for mental illness stigma are discussed.

AB  - Background Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer affecting women around the world in which the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the one of the recognized causative agent affecting women health. In response to this health issue, the Malaysian government had officially implemented the HPV immunisation programme for secondary schoolchildren in 2010 at the age of 13 years old and above. The purpose of this study is to investigate the sociodemographic determinants of knowledge and attitude among students of Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR) towards the HPV vaccination programme. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using self-administered questionnaires, recruiting 374 UTAR's students as the respondents by using convenience sampling method. Respondents were categorized as having good/poor level of knowledge and positive/negative attitude towards HPV vaccination. Results Over half of the respondents were females (64.5%) and the majority were aged 20 years old and below (55.8%). Generally, 54.7% of the total respondents had a high level of knowledge towards HPV vaccine while 57.5% of the total respondents showed a negative attitude towards HPV vaccine. Female respondents aged 20 years old and below showed good knowledge (56.4%) and a more positive attitude (55.8%) towards HPV vaccine. Students from the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences (FMHS) exhibited higher knowledge (67.3%) and positive attitude (62.4%) as compared to the Faculty of Accountancy and Management (FAM) which showed only 32.7% of knowledge and 37.6% of positive attitude towards the HPV vaccination. Conclusion The majority of UTAR students possess good knowledge regarding HPV vaccination. Nonetheless, they demonstrated a negative attitude towards HPV vaccination, depicting the necessity to impart and further intensify the sense of health awareness among all students, especially among male students. The judicious use of social media apart from the conventional mass media should be an advantage as to enhance the practice of HPV vaccination among them and thereafter minimize the health and economic burdens of cervical cancer.

AB  - Nutrition labelling is a topical issue, being a vital aid that shapes consumers' food choices and could be an efficient tool for the prevention of consumer vulnerability to diet-related diseases such as cancer, high blood pressure, hypertension, and obesity. However, data on the public use of nutritional labels as an information source on nutritional properties of foods and health claims, especially as it relates to Nigeria, are not popular in the literature. This study seeks to examine consumers' use of labelling information: knowledge; attitude, and practice. A cross-sectional study with the aid of a survey elicited information from 374 randomly selected shoppers in five shopping malls in Lagos State. Data were analysed using the T-test method. Findings show that while the majority of the respondents (70.6%) read the nutritional information, only 64.9% understand the information presented on food labels. The study also reveals that the majority of the respondents (57.5%) do not know that information on food labels should be presented in the English language before any other language as recommended by the National Agency Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC). While 57.9% of consumers have a positive attitude towards using food labels, 58% of the respondents' buying decisions are influenced by food labels. The study concludes that consequent upon the importance of nutritional knowledge and wellbeing, consumers of Fast Moving Goods in Nigeria are beginning to consciously pay attention to nutritional labels. The study recommends that producers of Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) products in Nigeria should adopt the total disclosure of ingredients and nutritional content of their products. Also, regulatory bodies in charge of pre-packaged food products in Nigeria (NAFDAC) should go the whole way and make nutritional labelling mandatory.

Respondents of the questionnaires included 51 BA students from Portugal and 56 BSc students from Ukraine, as well as their 30 Ukrainian and 16 Portuguese ESP teachers. The results proved that Portuguese teachers spend, and would like to spend, more time on creative thinking skills development than their Ukrainian colleagues. More than a third of teachers in both countries stated that they use PBL to foster students' creative thinking skills. The main difference noticed was that ESP teachers in Ukraine often chose project-based learning (57.7% - 15 respondents), whereas their Portuguese colleagues prefered role-playing (50% - 6 teachers). The majority (83.8%) of all 37 interviewed Ukrainian future engineers reported a positive attitude to role-playing. However, twelve Portuguese (75%) and twenty-one Ukrainian ESP teachers (70%) admitted combining both creative and traditional approaches in their classrooms. The creative skills most students would like to develop in their ESP classroom include trying new experiments (71.4% of Ukrainian and 56.9% of Portuguese), searching for new ways to solve the problem (69.6% and 82.4%), creating new associations and interdisciplinary links (57.1% and 43.1%), and choosing new information sources (44.6% and 41.2%). Professional situations, which according to the students' answers demanded from them these skills were defined in the article. The creative ESP tasks students in Ukraine, Portugal and other countries had in their classroom were stated as well.

AB  - Objective: The present study aimed to explore students' reports of their sharing of alcohol-related content on different social networking sites (i.e., frequency of sharing and connotations of alcohol related posts), and to identify indicators of such posting. Method: Students at the four largest institutions for higher education in Bergen, Norway, were invited to participate in an Internet-based survey. The sample size was 11,236 (a 39.4% response rate). The survey included questions about disclosure of alcohol-related content on social networking sites, alcohol use (using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test), personality factors (using the Mini-IPIP), and demographic characteristics. Binary logistic regressions were used to analyze indicators of frequent sharing of alcohol-related content depicting positive and negative aspects of alcohol use. Results: A majority of the students had posted alcohol-related content (71.0%), although few reported having done so frequently. Positive aspects of alcohol use (e.g., enjoyment or social community) were most frequently shared. Young, single, and extroverted students with high alcohol consumption were more likely to report frequent sharing of alcohol-related content. Positive attitudes toward posting alcohol-related content and reports of exposure to such content particularly increased the likelihood of one's own posting of alcohol-related content. Conclusions: Positive aspects of alcohol use seem to be emphasized on social networking sites. Sharing of alcohol related content is associated with heightened alcohol use, which implies that such sites can be relevant for prevention agents. Social influence from social networking sites, such as exposure to others' alcohol-related content, is associated with one's own sharing of similar content.

AB  - Background: The use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to provide healthcare professionals with peer benchmarked feedback is growing. However, there is little evidence on the opinions of professionals on the value of this information in practice. The purpose of this research is to explore surgeon's experiences of receiving peer benchmarked PROMs feedback and to examine whether this information led to changes in their practice.
   Methods: This qualitative research employed a Framework approach. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with surgeons who received peer benchmarked PROMs feedback. The participants included eleven consultant orthopaedic surgeons in the Republic of Ireland.
   Results: Five themes were identified: conceptual, methodological, practical, attitudinal, and impact. A typology was developed based on the attitudinal and impact themes from which three distinct groups emerged. 'Advocates' had positive attitudes towards PROMs and confirmed that the information promoted a self-reflective process. 'Converts' were uncertain about the value of PROMs, which reduced their inclination to use the data. 'Sceptics' had negative attitudes towards PROMs and claimed that the information had no impact on their behaviour. The conceptual, methodological and practical factors were linked to the typology.
   Conclusion: Surgeons had mixed opinions on the value of peer benchmarked PROMs data. Many appreciated the feedback as it reassured them that their practice was similar to their peers. However, PROMs information alone was considered insufficient to help identify opportunities for quality improvements. The reasons for the observed reluctance of participants to embrace PROMs can be categorised into conceptual, methodological, and practical factors. Policy makers and researchers need to increase professionals' awareness of the numerous purposes and benefits of using PROMs, challenge the current methods to measure performance using PROMs, and reduce the burden of data collection and information dissemination on routine practice.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review use of open source software in the public sector in Botswana and South Africa. South Africa is Botswana's neighbor and both countries are leading economies in Africa.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on a survey that was carried out in information communication technology (ICT)-intensive government ministries in Botswana in May 2008. The study sought to establish availability of policy framework, level of usage of open source software, government support, motivations for implementing open source software in government, availability of skills, attitude of it managers in government toward open source software and challenges of open source software deployment in the public sector. The population of the study consisted of information technology (IT) managers who were purposively selected from ICT-intensive government ministries and interviewed. The study was extended to cover South Africa through review of literature on the same issues as those studied in Botswana.
   Findings - Compared with other countries in developed and developing countries including South Africa, there is limited use of open source software in the public sector in Botswana. However, IT managers in government of Botswana demonstrate a positive attitude toward open source software, and seem to have adequate understanding of its potential benefits. Comparatively, South African government provides support for harnessing open source software; awareness among top government officials is high and attitude toward open source software seems positive; skills are generally available and hardly any challenges of using open source software were identified.
   Research limitations/implications - This study was limited to purposively selected government ministries which are ICT-intensive in Botswana, while for South Africa, the study was based on secondary sources of data and focused on deployment of open source software in government agencies.
   Practical implications - Despite the increasing deployment of open source software in government across the world, the Botswanan government is yet unlikely to put in place an enabling open source software policy to harness the potential of the Software.
   Originality/value - Open source software deployment in government across the world is gaining momentum purportedly to enhance universal access, reduce costs associated with commercial software bridge the digital divide, grow indigenous IT skills, etc. Botswana and South Africa are the economic frontline states in Africa, and their leadership role in this matter among counterparts on the African continent is pertinent.

AB  - A key guarantor of social trust and a necessary feature of democratic societies is a stable sense of social distance. Social distance is the cultural imaginary within which an individual's coordinates of social status and contingent social location allow or inhibit contact with similarly and dissimilarly located others. The rearrangement of customary social distances by new communication technologies is a source of considerable social anxiety. In mobile communication, this context collapse is instigated by a distinctive combination of affordances: deep connectivity, the accelerated speed and volume of communicative exchange, enhanced social legibility and asymmetric communicative transparency. Robust and effective levels of social trust depend on a political will to build strong democratic accountability and civil rights guarantees into emerging mobile architectures. Identifying specific recalibrations of familiar social distances by regimes of mobile communication and assessing the effects of these recalibrations in democratic terms is a central task of mobile research.

AB  - Within the theoretical frameworks of the dual coding theory, this study examined how the implementation of infographics would influence audiences' cognitive responses to science news reporting topics of genetically modified food and bioengineering. A total of 280 participants were randomly assigned to view news articles that report genetically modified food information presented via infographics or text. Findings showed that the participants recalled more information, elaborated more message-relevant thoughts, and had more favorable attitude changes toward the genetically modified foods when science news content is presented in infographics compared with text. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed herein.

AB  - Most people are unable to accurately estimate the number of immigrants in their country. Nonetheless, it has been argued that the size of the immigrant population would affect people's immigration attitudes. Part of the effect of immigration on attitudes occurs not so much because of real immigration figures, but rather because of media reporting about immigration. In this study, negative attitudes towards immigration are explained by investigating the impact of the salience and the tone of immigration topics in the news media vis-a-vis the impact of immigration statistics. The cases of Denmark and the Netherlands are analysed for a period from 2003 to 2010, using a multilevel design. Overall, real-world immigration numbers have little impact. The tone of news coverage has an effect in the Netherlands: a positive tone reduces negativity towards immigration, while a negative tone does not increase negativity. We cautiously conclude that the longevity of the issue's salience has a moderating effect.

AB  - Objective: This study evaluates English newspaper coverage of mental health topics between 2008 and 2014 to provide context for the concomitant improvement in public attitudes and seek evidence for changes in coverage.
   Method: Articles in 27 newspapers were retrieved using keyword searches on two randomly chosen days each month in 2008-2014, excluding 2012 due to restricted resources. Content analysis used a structured coding framework. Univariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of each hypothesised element occurring each year compared to 2008.
   Results: There was a substantial increase in the number of articles covering mental health between 2008 and 2014. We found an increase in the proportion of antistigmatising articles which approached significance at P < 0.05 (OR = 1.21, P = 0.056). The decrease in stigmatising articles was not statistically significant (OR = 0.90, P = 0.312). There was a significant decrease in the proportion of articles featuring the stigmatising elements 'danger to others' and 'personal responsibility', and an increase in 'hopeless victim'. There was a significant proportionate increase in articles featuring the antistigmatising elements 'injustice' and 'stigma', but a decrease in 'sympathetic portrayal of people with mental illness'.
   Conclusion: We found a decrease in articles promoting ideas about dangerousness or mental illness being self-inflicted, but an increase in articles portraying people as incapable. Yet, these findings were not consistent over time.

AB  - In the absence of target treatments or vaccination, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can be impeded by effectively implementing containment measures and behaviors. This relies on individuals' adoption of protective behaviors, their perceived risk, and the use and trust of information sources. During a health emergency, receiving timely and accurate information enables individuals to take appropriate actions to protect themselves, shaping their risk perception. Italy was the first western country plagued by COVID-19 and one of the most affected in the early phase. During this period, we surveyed 2,223 Italians before the national lockdown. A quarter of the sample perceived COVID-19 less threatening than flu and would not vaccinate, if a vaccine was available. Besides, most people perceived containment measures, based on social distancing or wearing masks, not useful. This perceived utility was related to COVID-19 threat perception and efficacy beliefs. All these measures were associated with the use of media and their truthfulness: participants declared to mainly use the Internet, while health organizations' websites were the most trusted. Although social networks were frequently used, they were rated lower for trustfulness. Our data differ from those obtained in other community samples, suggesting the relevance to explore changes across different countries and during the different phases of the pandemic. Understanding these phenomena, and how people access the media, may contribute to improve the efficacy of containment measures, tailoring specific policies and health communications.

AB  - Positive attitude is thought to impact academic achievement and learning in children, but little is known about its underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. Using a large behavioral sample of 240 children, we found that positive attitude toward math uniquely predicted math achievement, even after we accounted for multiple other cognitive-affective factors. We then investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the link between positive attitude and academic achievement in two independent cohorts of children (discovery cohort: n = 47; replication cohort: n = 28) and tested competing hypotheses regarding the differential roles of affective-motivational and learning-memory systems. In both cohorts, we found that positive attitude was associated with increased engagement of the hippocampal learning-memory system. Structural equation modeling further revealed that, in both cohorts, increased hippocampal activity and more frequent use of efficient memory-based strategies mediated the relation between positive attitude and higher math achievement. Our study is the first to elucidate the neurocognitive mechanisms by which positive attitude influences learning and academic achievement.

AB  - Although social exclusion has been shown to play an important role in depression, little is known about mediating and moderating mechanisms underlying this relation among college students. Based on conservation of resources theory and hopelessness theory of depression, the current study investigated the mediating role of psychological capital and the moderating role of implicit theories in the relation between social exclusion and depression. Five hundred and fifty-three Chinese college students filled out questionnaires regarding social exclusion, depression, psychological capital and implicit theories. After gender and age were controlled, social exclusion was significantly and positively associated with depression. Mediation analysis revealed that psychological capital partially mediated the association between social exclusion and depression. Moderated mediation analysis further indicated that the indirect effect of social exclusion on depression was moderated by implicit theories. The indirect path was only significant for entity theorists but not for incremental theorists. These findings may help to design effective psychological interventions for college students with higher level of depression.

AB  - Background: Recent years have seen a number of attempts to reduce the stigma related to mental illness; the media can play a significant role in perpetuating this stigma. This paper analyses trends in newspaper coverage of mental illness in the UK between 1992-2008 across a range of psychiatric diagnoses.
   Methods: A content analysis was performed on a sample of articles (n = 1361) about mental illness in a range of UK newspapers in 1992, 2000, and 2008.
   Results: There was a significant proportional reduction in negative articles about mental illness between 1992 and 2008, and a significant increase in articles explaining psychiatric disorders. Coverage improved for depression but remained largely negative for schizophrenia.
   Conclusions: Newspaper coverage of mental illness became less stigmatising overall in the 1990s and 2000s, but this was not true for all diagnoses.

AB  - Background: Health information has a profound impact on developing awareness and ultimately preventing the burden of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, but study in Bangladesh is lacking.
   Aims: Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the impact of information from social media and television in developing health awareness among people amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: Data was collected during December 10, 2020 to February 10, 2021 from 1808 people. Data was collected by using questionnaire about information source and their impact on COVID-19 related health measures. Pearson's correlation analyses was conducted.
   Results: Female (52%, 937 of 1808) was the most prevalent sex and the mean age was 24 +/- 3.9 years. Most of the social media users were students (63%, 1131 of 1808). Social media (53%, 959 of 1808) and television (44%, 800 of 1808) were the most popular sources and Facebook (66.5%, 1203 of 1808) was the most common source of getting health information. About 87% people received health information on social media and television. Users of social media had about 3 times more likelihood to follow the health rules. About 80% participants who used social media followed the health measures after 0-28 days of getting the information. The strongest correlation was found between social distancing and the infor-mation on television (r = 0.943).
   Conclusion: Strong correlation of health information was present among the participants in building awareness about taking preventive measures. This is the first study to describe the positive influence of information amid COVID-19 in Bangladesh. (C) 2021 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Extant findings are mixed on whether social exclusion impacts prosociality. We propose one factor that may underlie the mixed results: Cynicism. Specifically, cynicism may moderate the exclusion-prosociality link by influencing interpersonal empathy. Compared to less cynical individuals, we expected highly cynical individuals who were excluded to experience less empathy and, consequently, less prosocial behavior. Using an online balltossing game, participants were randomly assigned to an exclusion or inclusion condition. Consistent with our predictions, the effect of social exclusion on prosociality through empathy was contingent on cynicism, such that only less-cynical individuals responded to exclusion with greater empathy, which, in turn, was associated with higher levels of prosocial behavior. We further showed this effect to hold for cynicism, but not other similar traits typically characterized by high disagreeableness. Findings contribute to the social exclusion literature by suggesting a key variable that may moderate social exclusion?s impact on resultant empathy and prosocial behavior and are consistent with the perspective that people who are excluded try to not only become included again but to establish alliances characterized by reciprocity.

AB  - The increasing importance of digital reading and the prevalence of social media among adolescents necessitate further investigations into the effects of social media on the development of students' digital reading proficiency, which could foster proper behavior and attitudes regarding social media and help narrow achievement gaps in reading education. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of information and communication technology (ICT)-based social media factors, categorized into use and attitudinal factors, on adolescents' digital reading performance and to capture the trajectory of the impacts on generations of adolescents over nine years. Data from 767,511 15-year-old students from 57 countries/regions in total were extracted from the four cycles of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) database, i.e., PISA 2009, PISA 2012, PISA 2015 and PISA 2018. Hierarchical linear models were constructed to investigate significant student-, school- and country-level factors. The findings indicated that a) the effects of ICT-based social media use outside of school varied across different purposes and types of use and the influential patterns remained relatively unchanged; b) students' use of ICTbased social media at school was negatively correlated with digital reading performance in general from PISA 2009 to PISA 2018; and c) students with positive attitudes towards ICT-based social media performed better on the digital reading assessment than those with negative attitudes.

AB  - One of the major obstacles to agricultural development in Jordan is the weakness of extension programming which is still traditional and based on personal judgement. The aim of this study was to examine the attitudes, adoption barriers and in-service training needs of Public Extension Agents (PEAs) towards the adoption of Needs-Based Extension (NBE). An instrument to assess attitudes, barriers and training needs was designed and used to collect data from 73 PEAs in Jordan. Face and content validity were confirmed by a panel of experts, and internal consistency of the study scales were demonstrated by alpha coefficients ranging from 0.75 to 0.90. Parametric and nonparametric methods were used to analyze the data. The results showed that most PEAs had positive attitudes towards adopting NBE services, but adoption was constrained by internal and external barriers; supporting culture to NBE, finance and skills to undertake surveys and need analysis. The involvement of public extension staff in the survey contributed to in-service training and the application of NBE programs. Priority areas for training were determined using weighted discrepancy scores, with the most important being information technologies, agribusiness management and conducting needs assessment respectively. Study tours and professional training were perceived as the most important training methods. There were few significant differences among the PEAs with respect to the attitude and competence scales. These results indicate the need to undertake needs assessments of PEAs to improve extension programming in Jordan.

AB  - Background: People want to be well informed and ask for more information regarding their health. The public can use different sources (i.e. the Internet, health care providers, friends, family, television, radio, and newspapers) to access information about their health. Insight into the types and sources of vaccine related information that parents use, and reasons why they seek extra information is needed to improve the existing information supply about childhood vaccinations.
   Methods: Dutch parents with one or more children aged 0-4 years received an online questionnaire (N = 4000) measuring psychosocial determinants of information-seeking behaviour and self-reports of types and sources of vaccine information searched for (response rate 14.8%). We also tested two invitation approaches (i.e., reply card versus Internet link in invitation letter) to observe the difference in response rate.
   Results: Almost half of the parents (45.8%) searched for extra information. Of all the respondents, 13% indicated they had missed some information, particularly about side effects of vaccines (25%). Intention to search for vaccination information was influenced by positive attitude and perceived social norm towards information-seeking behaviour. There was no difference in the response rate between the two invitation approaches.
   Conclusions: The information provided by the National Immunization Programme (NIP) might be sufficient for most parents. However, some parents mentioned that they did not receive enough information about side effects of vaccinations, which was also the topic most searched for by parents. Public Health Institutes (PHIs) and child healthcare workers should therefore be aware of the importance to mention this aspect in their communication (materials) towards parents. The PHIs must ensure that their website is easy to find with different search strategies. Since the child healthcare worker is perceived as the most reliable information source, they should be aware of their role in educating parents about the NIP.

AB  - Although social distancing measures could be potentially perceived as thwarting conditions for basic psychological needs and thus causing psychological distress, off(on)line social support could compensate for this frustration by providing psychological proximity. Using self-determination theory, in this study, we aimed (a) to evaluate the change of perception in need satisfaction over time (before and during home-confinement and after a month of lockdown) and (b) to test the short-term longitudinal association between off(on)line social support, basic needs, and anxiety during social distancing measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. During the lockdown period decreed by Italy in March 2019 to confront the COVID-19 emergency, 1344 participants completed an online questionnaire and 131 participants completed a follow-up after 1 month. Results showed a decrease in need satisfaction during home confinement and a further reduction after a month of lockdown. Cross-sectional path analysis showed that both online and offline social support were associated with higher need satisfaction, which, in turn, was related to a lower level of anxiety. Longitudinal paths also confirmed the association between need satisfaction and anxiety. Collectively, these results suggest that maintaining psychological proximity despite social distancing measures may provide important avenues for reducing negative outcomes during forced home confinement.

AB  - This study extends an evaluation of a brief, social media intervention, called In One Voice, for raising mental health awareness and improving attitudes of youth and young adults towards mental health issues.
   A successive independent samples design assessed market penetration and attitudinal changes among the young people who completed an online questionnaire 1 year after (T3: n = 438) the intervention. This is compared with two samples that completed a survey either immediately before (T1: n = 403) or 2 months after (T2: n = 403) the campaign launch.
   The proportion of respondents who remembered the campaign grew from 24.8 % at T2 to 48.6 % at T3. Elevated website activity on mindcheck.ca was sustained 1 year after In One Voice had ended. Small but significant reductions in personal stigma and social distance were detected from T1 and T3, which were not observed at T2. Respondents' self-rated ability to help others with mental health issues and to engage in positive behaviors relating to mental health issues (e.g., seeking information) did not improve significantly from T1 to T3.
   Improved attitudes towards mental health issues were observed among young people 1 year following a brief social media campaign. The campaign was less effective at providing the tools young people need to feel capable of helping someone who may be experiencing mental health issues, and motivating them to engage in constructive behaviors related to mental health.

AB  - Background: South Korea took preemptive action against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by implementing extensive testing, thorough epidemiological investigation, strict social distancing, and rapid treatment of patients according to disease severity. The Korean government entrusted large-scale hospitals with the operation of living and treatment support centers (LTSCs) for the management for clinically healthy COVID-19 patients.
   Objective: The aim of this paper is to introduce our experience implementing information and communications technology (ICT)-based remote patient management systems at a COVID-19 LTSC.
   Methods: We adopted new electronic health record templates, hospital information system (HIS) dashboards, cloud-based medical image sharing, a mobile app, and smart vital sign monitoring devices.
   Results: Enhancements were made to the HIS to assist in the workflow and care of patients in the LTSC. A dashboard was created for the medical staff to view the vital signs and symptoms of all patients. Patients used a mobile app to consult with their physician or nurse, answer questionnaires, and input self-measured vital signs; the results were uploaded to the hospital information system in real time. Cloud based image sharing enabled interoperability between medical institutions. Korea's strategy of aggressive mitigation has "flattened the curve" of the rate of infection. A multidisciplinary approach was integral to develop systems supporting patient care and management at the living and treatment support center as quickly as possible.
   Conclusions: Faced with a novel infectious disease, we describe the implementation and experience of applying an ICT-based patient management system in the LTSC affiliated with Seoul National University Hospital. ICT-based tools and applications are increasingly important in health care, and we hope that our experience will provide insight into future technology-based infectious disease responses.

AB  - Introduction: Increasing numbers of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners are interested in evidence-based medicine (EBM). Researchers are in need of further information regarding the current status of CAM practitioners knowledge and use of EBM.
   Methods and materials: A questionnaire survey was distributed in July 2010 to all Korean medical doctors (n=388) practising in traditional Korean medicine (TKM) hospitals in Korea.
   Results: The response rate was 68.30% (n=265). Respondents tended to have a positive attitude towards EBM. Although 86% of respondents had used general databases in the previous year, they demonstrated a low level of awareness of relevant information sources and basic technical terms. Many respondents thought that applying EBM would make it easier for them to explain their treatment, progress, and prognosis to patients (26%). The majority perceived barriers to practicing EBM included differences in the fundamental concepts of EBM and CAM (30%), lack of evidence (16%) and lack of time (15%). Development of guidelines and protocols (36%) was the most appropriate method of application of EBM.
   Conclusion: CAM practitioners were rather welcoming of EBM but the advantage that they expect from EBM is in contrast to previous research on the use of EBM among practitioners and patients in biomedicine. A high percentage of practitioners had access to general bibliographic databases but failed to know how to apply it. This was the biggest perceived barrier and is another distinctive feature of CAM practitioners. The development of CAM guidelines and protocols are urgently required.

TI  - LIBERAL ALARM: WEST GERMAN PRESS COVERAGE OF US CIVIL RIGHTS, 1950s TO 1966
T2  - GERMAN LIFE AND LETTERS
LA  - English
AB  - Beginning in the 1950s, the West German press reported on US race relations. While liberal' on Civil Rights, it often expressed ambivalence or alarm. The background of these responses included the re-education' of West Germans, in which American occupation officials tried to discredit Nazi racism, but also offered a view of US history in which the post-Civil War Reconstruction of the South had allowed black men sexual access to white women. Some press writers represented Reconstruction as the origin of white resistance to equality, and often showed more sympathy for the resisters than was consistent with their stated support for black rights. Using the language of racial mixture, they evoked the fear felt by many southern whites and also alluded to contemporary West German anxiety about mixed-race children of German women and black-American GIs. About 1964, in an increasingly liberal environment, the press dropped this theme, but offered alarming accounts of black militancy. Around that time, coming to terms with the past' suggested comparisons of American with Nazi racism. The mainstream German press of the early 1960s was dividing into liberal' and conservative' branches, but both supported Civil Rights. These were also the years when a young generation of journalists rose to positions on editorial staffs, but older journalists were also supportive of the black cause. The conclusion draws attention to the lack of empathy with blacks in a discourse favouring black rights, and recommends a more concrete explanatory model than those found in a historiography favouring abstraction.

AB  - Attitudes, and attitudinal change towards persons with disabilities, is an important area of research as it can potentially enable greater understanding of the constraints that may preclude full participation in society. In the realm of sport and recreation mega sporting events have been suggested as a potential catalyst for positive societal change and shifting negative attitudes. Much of the event research to date, however, has focused on able-bodied sport events, with parasport events being largely overlooked. As a result, the impact of major parasport events on attitudinal change towards persons with a disability is assumed by sport practitioners, policy-makers and politicians but not justified by empirical evidence. The current study thus presents a starting point by examining the benefits of hosting mega sport events and in particular focuses on an important event stakeholder group; volunteers. More specifically, the current study addresses volunteer's perceptions of attitudes towards disability at two major parasport events: the 2014 Commonwealth Games (where parasport was integrated with the able-bodied sport) and the 2015 Pan Am/ParaPan American Games (where parasport was separated from the able-bodied sport). Data were collected at two time points for each event: pre-Games, and post-Games. Results revealed that both events had an impact on volunteer awareness levels of disability and accessibility-related issues, as well as positively impacting attitudes towards persons with disability. Interestingly, the integrated events at the Commonwealth Games appeared to impact attitudes to a greater degree than the non-integrated events at the ParaPan Am Games. Implications are discussed pertaining to the impact of an integrated vs. non-integrated major parasport event on disability/accessibility awareness, and attitudes towards disability.

AB  - During the Covid-19 pandemic, each of us should be able to continue working, studying, and living, although the disease imposes certain restrictions because people have to maintain a social distance and have many other limitations. The main thing for the educational space is that you have to minimize contact in all areas.
   This article aims to substantiate the feasibility of distance education and its technologies scientifically. Furthermore, the relationship between distance music education, modern computer technology, and applications that are now called know-how is revealed.
   Research methodology. The research practice is based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of the information sources and the results obtained. These collection methods are valid for secondary and primary information. The survey method became necessary in this context. Research data was obtained through thematic analysis and observations related to the research objectives of the work. The research results of the survey were used in the systematization and formation of conclusions. The introduction of audio-visual technology in the educational process contributes to the improvement of motivation to learn in the background of improved academic performance. The importance of this study is determined by the fact that it is not only concerned with the general problem of the educational system in general but pays special attention to music education in particular. The study also deals with technological innovation and all that goes along. Another factor in the importance of the study is that the methodological developments presented in the research and the research problem are relevant to workers in the field of music education, which makes the promulgation of successful teaching practices essential.

   This paper is a report of a study conducted to compare service users', nursing students' and Registered Nurses' evaluations of the usability of a patient education website intended for individuals with severe mental health problems.
   Background.
   There is an obvious need for reliable mental health information on the Internet. When evaluating the usability of Internet-based patient education methods, the opinions of all parties need to be ascertained.
   Methods.
   An explorative descriptive design was used. Twenty-one service users, 20 nursing students and 35 Registered Nurses were recruited for the study in 2003 and 2004. Data were collected using a self-developed questionnaire on the content, structure and visual appearance of the website.
   Results.
   Service users had positive attitudes towards computer and Internet use but they needed support when using the computer and Internet. According to the evaluations, the content, structure and visual appearance of the website were good and it could be adopted for clinical practise after minor revisions. There were some differences in the evaluations between participant groups. Nurses were the most critical group, and the service user group was the most satisfied, although they were less experienced with using both computers and the Internet.
   Conclusion.
   It is especially important to include service users' evaluations at the early stages of the development process of Web-based patient education systems. It is possible to produce an information technology-based patient education system for individuals with severe mental health problems. Nurses working in psychiatric services need to pay more attention to supporting service users in computer and Internet use.

AB  - This study examines the role of personalized charity advertising in promoting empathy, attitude change, and helping intentions toward stigmatized social groups. Based on theories of message involvement, empathy, and reactance, we predicted that higher levels of involvement elicited by a personalized charity advertisement would reinforce empathy and prosocial outcomes. An online experiment was conducted using a personalized and a nonpersonalized version of a charity advertisement for a campaign soliciting donations of winter coats for homeless people. As expected, structural equation modeling revealed a positive indirect effect of personalization on prosocial outcomes (attitudes and behavioural intentions toward homeless people, and willingness to donate to the campaign) that was mediated by involvement and empathy. However, in addition to promoting involvement and empathy, personalization also led to heightened reactance, which detracted from the positive effects. Theoretical as well as practical implications of the findings for personalized charity advertising are discussed.

TI  - Social distancing practice and associated factors in response to COVID-19 pandemic at West Guji Zone, Southern Ethiopia, 2021: A community based cross-sectional study
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Background
   Curtailing physical contact between individuals reduces transmission and spread of the disease. Social distancing is an accepted and effective strategy to delay the disease spread and reduce the magnitude of outbreaks of pandemic COVID-19. However, no study quantified social distancing practice and associated factors in the current study area. Therefore, the study aimed to assess social distancing practice and associated factors in response to COVID-19 pandemic in West Guji Zone, Southern Ethiopia, 2020.
   Methods and materials
   A Community based cross-sectional study design was conducted among randomly selected 410 household members of Bule Hora Town, West Guji Zone. Data were collected by pre-tested interviewer administered structured questionnaire adapted from previous peer reviewed articles. The data were coded and entered in to Epi data version 3.5 and analyzed by SPSS version 23. The bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions analysis was done to identify factors associated with social distancing practice. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval and p value <0.05 were used to declare statistical significance.
   Result
   Out of 447 planned samples, 410 participants were successfully interviewed and included into final analysis; making the response rate of 91.7%. The median (IQR) age of study participants was 28(+/- 9) years. In this study, 38.3% [95% CI: 33.5%, 43.1%)] of the study participants have good social distancing practices for the prevention of COVID-19. Age group 26-30 years [AOR = 2.56(95% CI: 1.18-5.54)] and 31-35 years [AOR = 3.57(95%CI: 1.56-8.18)], employed [AOR = 6.10(95%CI: 3.46-10.74)],poor knowledge [AOR = 0.59 (95% CI:0.36-0.95)], negative attitude [AOR = 0.55 (95% CI:0.31-0.95)] and low perceived susceptibility [AOR = 0.33(95%CI: 0.20-0.54)] were significantly associated with good social distancing practice.
   Conclusion
   Social distancing practice is relatively poor in the study area. The knowledge and attitude level of participants were identified to be the major factors for the observed poor social distancing practice. Sustained efforts to improve awareness and attitudes towards COVID-19 prevention might improve adherence to social distancing practices.

AB  - The study aims to investigate the attitudes of Nigerian postgraduate students towards information and communication technology (ICT) and their perceived competence in using ICT resources for research purpose. The influence of field of studies on their competence and attitude were also examined. A total of 77 Nigerian postgraduate students at a university in Malaysia were randomly selected for the study. Data collected through questionnaires were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistic approaches. The analysis reveals that majority of the postgraduate students have positive attitude towards ICT and they perceive that they are competent in using several basic ICT tools. There is no significant difference between science and non-science based postgraduate students' attitudes, however, there is significant difference in their perceived competence. This paper concludes that the postgraduate students require more hands-on experiences and special training programs so that they can maximize the use of ICT for research purpose. It is hoped that the findings revealed in this study will help the policy makers in designing necessary courses to improve the quality of postgraduates in the country.

AB  - Aims. The ability to recognise a mental illness has important implications as it can aid in timely and appropriate help-seeking, and ultimately improve outcomes for people with mental illness. This study aims to explore the association between recognition and help-seeking preferences and stigmatising attitudes, for alcohol abuse, dementia, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia, using a vignette-based approach.
   Methods. This was a population-based, cross-sectional survey conducted among Singapore Residents (n = 3006) aged 18-65 years. All respondents were asked what they think is wrong with the person in the vignette and who they should seek help from. Respondents were also administered the Personal and Perceived sub scales of the Depression Stigma Scale and the Social Distance Scale. Weighted frequencies and percentages were calculated for categorical variables. A series of multiple logistic and linear regression models were performed separately by vignette to generate odd ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the relationship between help-seeking preference, and recognition and beta coefficients and 95% confidence intervals for the relationship between stigma and recognition.
   Results. Correct recognition was associated with less preference to seek help from family and friends for depression and schizophrenia. Recognition was also associated with increased odds of endorsing seeking help from a psychiatric hospital for dementia, depression and schizophrenia, while there was also an increased preference to seek help from a psychologist and psychiatrist for depression. Recognition was associated with less personal and perceived stigma for OCD and less personal stigma for schizophrenia, however, increased odds of social distancing for dementia.
   Conclusion. The ability to correctly recognise a mental illness was associated with less preference to seek help from informal sources, whilst increased preference to seek help from mental health professionals and services and less personal and perceived stigma. These findings re-emphasise the need to improve mental health literacy and reinforce the potential benefits recognition can have to individuals and the wider community in Singapore.

AB  - Recently, pushed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the need of respecting social distancing has motivated several researchers to define novel technological solutions to monitor and track user movements. Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) world has addressed this challenge by means of the use of different technologies, such as Bluetooth, in order to track user interdistance and encounter time. Technology solutions should be able to not only track contacts, but also alert users to restore social distancing. In this article, we present IMPERSONAL framework, with the twofold aim of both: 1) tracking and monitoring social distancing and 2) alerting users in case of gatherings. The framework is based on a subnetwork of computer vision-based devices that are adopted to monitor and track users' movements to estimate their interdistance and compute the encounter time. Such information is then the input to an Internet of Things subnetwork, aiming to retrieve the anonymous IDs of people belonging to a gathering, as well as to send alert messages to them. We assess IMPERSONAL framework by means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations and experimental results, showing its effectiveness in terms of accuracy in correctly identifying users and gatherings in videos taken from live cameras, both in case of indoor and outdoor real scenarios. The benefits of the IMPERSONAL framework are expressed in terms of the ability to track people, solve gatherings, and send warning messages.

AB  - The present study tests a developmental model designed to explain the romantic relationship difficulties and reluctance to marry often reported for African Americans. Using longitudinal data from a sample of approximately 400 African American young adults, we examine the manner in which race-related adverse experiences during late childhood and early adolescence give rise to the cynical view of romantic partners and marriage held by many young African Americans. Our results indicate that adverse circumstances disproportionately suffered by African American youth (viz., harsh parenting, family instability, discrimination, criminal victimization, and financial hardship) promote distrustful relational schemas that lead to troubled dating relationships, and that these negative relationship experiences, in turn, encourage a less positive view of marriage.

AB  - This article is devoted to the analysis of cognitive distortion in the mass media as a method of forming a civic identity. Due to the increasing influence of mass media and information technologies, the growth of information impact, the problem of the formation of civil identity is becoming more and more significant, and the mass media is a tool for the formation of civil identity. The authors consider the method of cognitive distortion in the mass media as a method of forming a civic identity in modern media. Culture in the Russian and Chinese traditions reveals both universals and peculiarities. The authors analyze how the attitude to civil identity is transmitted in Russian and Chinese media discourses, which allows us to understand the difference in background knowledge and identify cognitive distortions in translation. The authors see differences in the ethno-pedagogic strategies of the state that ensure a positive attitude to civic identity in the Chinese digital space, which has parallels with the Soviet discourse. At the same time, the authors believe that the assimilation of Western models of admiration for their values has a negative impact on the formation of generational continuity and ethno-socio-cultural experience in the traditions of countries.

AB  - In a series of six studies, we examined the role that perceived collective continuity (PCC) plays in intergroup attitudes. While the extant literature focuses on attitudes toward ingroups, the current studies chose to expand upon this research by concentrating on three types of outgroups (national, religious, and organizational). Results indicated that for groups perceived as neutral or positive, increased PCC was associated with more positive attitudes, while for enemy groups, increased PCC was associated with more negative attitudes. Entitativity played a mediating role such that as the outgroup was perceived as more continuous, it was also seen as more entitative. Higher entitativity led to less negative attitudes toward a past ally but more negative attitudes toward a past enemy. Results held whether past conflict and PCC were measured or manipulated, further supporting our findings. PCC has negative or positive implications for judgments of outgroups depending on intergroup history.

AB  - Politics now intrudes into many aspects of social life. How does this occur and what are its consequences? We study the sources of politicized attitudes toward ESPN, a sports media outlet involved in controversies where politics and sports intersect, and consider their implications for sports news use. We assess two potential contributors to politicized attitudes toward ESPN: exposure to political media criticizing the network and encounters with its sports coverage. In survey-linked web browsing data and a survey experiment, exposure to political media led the public to evaluate ESPN in political terms, showing messages from political elites can affect opinions of entertainment media. In contrast, exposure to ESPN's typical sports coverage failed to alter views of the network. We also find these newly politicized attitudes do not reduce use of ESPN, demonstrating the intrusion of politics into a seemingly apolitical setting may not displace other considerations underlying behavior.

AB  - This study (N = 217) explores the potential for virtual reality to decrease social distance toward outgroup members among women. Raising the salience of individuals' real physical identity through avatar customization and common ingroup identity manipulations was theorized to influence social distance. Participants who customized an avatar to resemble their real selves showed increased social distance. However, avatar customization also increased user identifiability, which was linked to reduced social distance. Priming a common ingroup identity increased identity salience but did not influence social distance. In examining heterogeneous effects by prior levels of issue involvement, participants with high and moderate involvement with immigration showed increased social distance after customizing an avatar to resemble their real selves, thus implying boomerang effects. The study discusses how avatar customization, identifiability, and common ingroup primes in virtual encounters may influence outgroup attitudes and intergroup relations.

AB  - Social exclusion reduces happiness and well-being partly by creating a generalized expectation offuturerejection and lack of belonging. An experiment (N= 709) using a guided imagination task found that social exclusion led to reduced feelings of happiness. The effect was mediated by future expectations, as participants who imagined a vivid exclusion scenario thought they were more likely to experience actual rejection in the coming weeks. A correlational survey focusing on individual differences found a similar pattern. People who felt a strong sense of general belonging thought they were less likely to experience future rejection than people with weak belonging, and they also reported higher levels of current happiness.

AB  - Background: Outbreak of COVID-19, in many countries, has imposed a lockdown on their residents. The usefulness of extenuative actions is extremely reliant on society's knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward pandemic control. Objective: This study aimed to explore the awareness, attitudes, and practices of the general Pakistani population to COVID-19. Methods: From June 13, 2020, until June 30, 2020, a cross-sectional online KAP survey was conducted among the Pakistani public. For data collection, a validated self-administered questionnaire was used. The survey instrument consisted of six demographic characteristics, 14 items on knowledge, four on attitudes, and six items on practices, modified from a previously published questionnaire on COVID-19. Results: The present study included 2,307 participants, 58.3% males and 41.7% of females. The majority (86.7%) sought information from social media (SM) and television, 95% had good practices, 89.9% had positive attitudes, and two-thirds (67.4%) of the respondents had adequate knowledge. The students and people from younger age groups had more positive attitudes compared with others. Highly educated w with other groups (p < 0.001). In logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio indicated that the private job was negatively associated, and high monthly income was positively associated with adequate knowledge (OR = 0.595). Old age was the predictor of negative attitude, and high school degrees and master's degrees were associated with good practice scores. Conclusion: The Pakistani general population has an overall positive attitude and proactive practices against COVID-19, but their knowledge is inadequate. The most important source of information was SM, followed by television. These are playing a crucial role in educating the Pakistani public.

AB  - This study examines the effects of social exclusion on consumers' brand and product switching behavior. Five studies were conducted, which revealed that consumers who perceive themselves as being chronically or temporarily excluded exhibit more switching behavior than their peers who do not feel socially excluded. This effect is mediated by a decreased sense of control after social exclusion. The effect disappears when the incumbent option possesses the function of maintaining social belongingness (e.g., when the incumbent option is socially conformed or symbolizes social connection).

AB  - Background: High-quality medical resources are in high demand worldwide, and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical care may help alleviate the crisis related to this shortage. The development of the medical AI industry depends to a certain extent on whether industry experts have a comprehensive understanding of the public's views on medical AI. Currently, the opinions of the general public on this matter remain unclear.
   Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore the public perception of AI in medical care through a content analysis of social media data, including specific topics that the public is concerned about; public attitudes toward AI in medical care and the reasons for them; and public opinion on whether AI can replace human doctors.
   Methods: Through an application programming interface, we collected a data set from the Sina Weibo platform comprising more than 16 million users throughout China by crawling all public posts from January to December 2017. Based on this data set, we identified 2315 posts related to AI in medical care and classified them through content analysis.
   Results: Among the 2315 identified posts, we found three types of AI topics discussed on the platform: (1) technology and application (n=987, 42.63%), (2) industry development (n=706, 30.50%), and (3) impact on society (n=622, 26.87%). Out of 956 posts where public attitudes were expressed, 59.4% (n=568), 34.4% (n=329), and 6.2% (n=59) of the posts expressed positive, neutral, and negative attitudes, respectively. The immaturity of AI technology (27/59, 46%) and a distrust of related companies (n=15, 25%) were the two main reasons for the negative attitudes. Across 200 posts that mentioned public attitudes toward replacing human doctors with AI, 47.5% (n=95) and 32.5% (n=65) of the posts expressed that AI would completely or partially replace human doctors, respectively. In comparison, 20.0% (n=40) of the posts expressed that AI would not replace human doctors.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that people are most concerned about AI technology and applications. Generally, the majority of people held positive attitudes and believed that AI doctors would completely or partially replace human ones. Compared with previous studies on medical doctors, the general public has a more positive attitude toward medical AI. Lack of trust in AI and the absence of the humanistic care factor are essential reasons why some people still have a negative attitude toward medical AI. We suggest that practitioners may need to pay more attention to promoting the credibility of technology companies and meeting patients' emotional needs instead of focusing merely on technical issues.

AB  - Race-related media effects research often address the misrepresentations of Black characterizations and their relationship to non-Black audiences. However, very few studies center the relationship between Black audiences and protective strategies that may mitigate unfavorable outcomes. Likewise, scant research acknowledges shifts in distinct Black media representation. To address this, an exploration of media representations of Black individuals, tenets from cultivation theory, and media literacy are adopted to understand the relationship between media consumption and favorable group outcomes. Results reveal that Black viewers' media literacy skills and increased media consumption are positively associated with increased individual and racial group esteem, suggesting that Black consumers are not passive in their media consumption and may reap favorable benefits from their media viewing.

KW  - rejection sensitivity
KW  - social exclusion
AB  - This article aims to explore if social exclusion can constitute a pathway to radicalization, and if individual level of sensitivity of rejection moderates the effect of social exclusion. Humans innately seek belonging and meaning, and strive for re-establishing a sense of value and belongingness if faced with social exclusion. One way to achieve this is by adherence to a new and inviting group. In four studies, we test to what extent individuals who face social exclusion adapt to a radical including group. In Studies 1 (n = 104) and 2 (n = 308), we use a social media-like paradigm to manipulate social exclusion. In Study 3 (n = 1041), we use the so-called Cyberball paradigm, and in Study 4 (n = 40) we use a real-life manipulation. All studies show that rejected individuals who are sensitive to rejection are more prone to identify with, engage with and endorse an extreme group. The results hold over both ideological (Studies 1-3) and non-ideological (Study 4) content. Only the last study showed a main effect of social exclusion. We discuss the results in reference to the significance loss model of radicalization.

AB  - In a series of studies, we investigated the role of economic structures (farming vs. herding) and source of ostracism (close other vs. stranger) in social exclusion experiences. We first confirmed that herders rely on strangers to a greater extent than do farmers for economic success (validation study). Next, we verified that farmers and herders understand the concept of ostracism, and its emotional consequences, in similar ways (Study 1). The studies that followed provided converging evidence that cultural group membership shapes sensitivity and responses to social exclusion. Using different methodologies, in Studies 2 and 3, we showed that, whereas the psychological consequences of ostracism by close others are similar for farmers and herders, herders are more strongly affected by ostracism from strangers. The last two studies demonstrated that herders recommend more affiliative responses to ostracism by strangers than do farmers both to those involved in the ostracism event (Study 4) and to naive individuals (Study 5). Moreover, Study 5 revealed that the amount of time spent with strangers mediated cultural group differences in the extent to which affiliative and aggressive actions are recommended following social exclusion by strangers. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the economic systems on which communities are based shape how their members interact with others and that this, in turn, can shape individuals' responses to social exclusion.

AB  - This study focuses on the political attitudes of UK citizens in the aftermath of the 'Brexit' vote. It has been argued that differences within electorates across Europe are found in disputes over taxes, redistribution of wealth and social welfare, as much as in divergent ideas on how to deal with globalisation, migration, and climate change. This article uses the 2016-2017 round of the European Social Survey (N = 1959) to shed light on two important issues in regard to the relationship between 'old' and 'new' politics. By using multiple correspondence analysis, we first consider the structure, or dimensionality, of the space of political attitudes in contemporary UK society. Contrary to a prevailing discourse that forwards the argument that postmaterial values constitute an altogether separate political dimension in late modernity, we observe that such values collapse into traditional left/right standpoints. Second, we discuss the connection between class (economic capital, cultural capital, and occupational class) and position-takings in the space of political attitudes. We show that class retains a limited effect on political position-takings, where educational capital plays the most important role. The divisions between the politically interested-uninterested, old-young, men-women, and rural-urban are more clearly demarcated than differences between people of different social class positions. Furthermore, polarisation is most prevalent between a highly opinionated, relatively resourceful, small minority of the population.

AB  - Background: Given the vast literature into public beliefs and attitudes towards schizophrenia and depression, there is paucity of research on attitudes towards bipolar disorder despite its similar prevalence to schizophrenia. This study explored public beliefs and attitudes towards bipolar disorder and examined the relationship between these different components of stigma.
   Method: Using an online questionnaire distributed via email, social networking sites and public institutions, 753 members of the UK population were presented with a vignette depicting someone who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder. Causal beliefs, beliefs about prognosis, emotional reactions, stereotypes, and social distance were assessed in response to the vignette. Preacher and Hayes procedure for estimating direct and indirect effects of multiple mediators was used to examine the relationship between these components of stigma.
   Results: Bipolar disorder was primarily associated with positive beliefs and attitudes and elicited a relatively low desire for social distance. Fear partially mediated the relationship between stereotypes and social distance. Biomedical causal beliefs reduced desire for social distance by increasing compassion, whereas fate causal beliefs increased it through eliciting fear. Psychosocial causal beliefs had mixed effects.
   Limitations: The measurement of stigma using vignettes and self-report questionnaires has implications for ecological validity and participants may have been reluctant to reveal the true extent of their negative attitudes.
   Conclusions: Dissemination of these findings to people with bipolar disorder has implications for the reduction of internalised stigma in this population. Anti stigma campaigns should attend to causal beliefs, stereotypes and emotional reactions as these all play a vital role in discriminatory behaviour towards people with bipolar disorder.

AB  - This study sought to examine the suitability of the Cultural Mistrust Inventory (CMI) items for contemporary interracial social relationships on social media. The study employed qualitative cognitive interviews with 28 persons of color in the U.S. Findings suggest that the CMI may not be a suitable measure for accurately assessing relational trust across different racial groups on social media due to generational change in consciousness about race relations, and the perceived ambiguity of the CMI items. Findings also reveal that the CMI is limited in its ability to assess racial trust on social media and may not account for how trust manifests across different social media platforms. These findings suggest that the continued use of the CMI to assess contemporary interracial relationships is not recommended.

AB  - In information technology industry, the development of new technology achievements influences and inspires the business world, serves and contributes to the progress of society. This rapidly evolving technological advancement needs a legal framework in order to obtain social and commercial status. Patent Law is the legal science and patent is the legal tool that adds value to intangible assets and therefore technology scientists are motivated to ensure their invention with a patent and also dominant technology enterprises are competing for the development of a strong patent portfolio. For the first time in Greece, combining the fields of intellectual property law and technological innovation, we created a survey using a questionnaire that was distributed in 2019, to graduated students of technology institutes in Greece. The purpose of the present survey is to clarify the knowhow of students as for the legal point of view of technology. We intend to find out, whether Greece& x2019;s potential inventors have beyond their technological background, the skills and knowledge to support a potential innovative idea. The results of the survey were that students have confidence in the institution of patents; however they lack the knowledge of patenting technological inventions. At the same time they have a positive attitude and motivation for entrepreneurship in the technological industry. Consequently, it is vital to apply measures in education, for the next generation technical inventors to have the knowhow of utilizing their intellectual asset in their own free will. Then, we can refer to integrated scientist technocrats who can protect their intellectual property and manage a competitive business.

AB  - Background: Attitudes toward technology may impact the levels of technology acceptance and training willingness among nursing students. Nurse acceptance and effective utilization of technology are critical to improving patient care and safety.
   Purpose: The aims of this cross-sectional study were to measure the attitude of nursing students toward technology and to determine if demographic characteristics affect their attitudinal measures. Furthermore, the amount of formal education provided on the use of technology applications is explored.
   Methods: A convenience sample of nursing students attending a public university in Jordan was recruited, and a technology attitude scale designed to measure the attitude of nursing students toward technology was used. Scales designed to gather data on participant demographics, self-reported technology skills, and level of formal technology education were also used.
   Results: The results showed that participants held a positive attitude toward technology. Students who reported a high level of technology skill had the most positive attitude toward technology. The impact years of formal education on the use of technology applications were low, whereas academic level had a significant impact on technology attitudes. Senior student participants had the highest level of technology education, likely because of their exposure to relatively more educational opportunities, and the most positive attitude toward technology.
   Conclusions: Despite the positive attitude of nursing students toward technology, the problem of minimal technology education should be addressed in future nursing programs to further enhance positive attitudes toward technology.

AB  - Political communication researchers have shown that social network site (SNS) use and online network characteristics can impinge on people's political attitudes and behavior. Nevertheless, individual SNSs have varying site architecture, basic design features, and functionalities, which may influence usage and online network characteristics. This study thus examines whether site architecture matters for understanding the political implications of SNSs. Specifically, this article conceptualizes the distinction between public-oriented and private-oriented SNSs. It contends that the two types of SNSs would have varying impact on political behavior through the kinds of online networks that they tend to sustain. Analysis of a survey of university students in Guangzhou, China (N=897), shows that respondents using public-oriented SNSs tended to have a relatively more public' online network - larger, involving more strangers, and with more connections to public actors. Some of these network characteristics in turn affected political discussion behavior. The analysis thus demonstrates how SNS architecture can indirectly impinge on individual-level political outcomes.

TI  - The Evolution of Discourse in Online Communities Devoted to a Pandemic
T2  - HEALTH COMMUNICATION
LA  - English
KW  - INFORMATION
KW  - ALGORITHM
AB  - Online communities are increasingly important discursive spaces in which individuals obtain health information and engage in sensemaking, and they play an especially essential role during viral outbreaks in which social distancing requirements may preclude engagement with other communities and information sources. However, the manner in which those communities evolve in response to a rapidly developing public health crisis, as well as in reaction to one another, is not well-understood. This longitudinal study uses latent Dirichlet allocation to assess the co-evolution of three subreddits focused on COVID-19 during the earliest, most volatile stages of the outbreak. The results demonstrate the power of being the first online community addressing an emerging health crisis as well as the manner in which latecomers to the conversation gravitate toward distinct niches to differentiate themselves with respect to both topical foci and associated communication styles. The results also highlight individuals' detachment toward developments in even an unprecedented crisis such as a global pandemic, which represents a critical barrier that health communication professionals must overcome to persuade audiences to take health crises seriously. Future studies should examine the potential role of coordination among community administrators as well as the extent to which users are aware of and exert agency over the co-evolutionary processes spanning multiple communities.

AB  - As a concept, intimacy has been a powerful way of understanding how the ongoing pandemic has affected gender relations, expression and access. The pandemic's effects on women have been disproportionately adverse, with social distancing, intermittent lockdowns and travel restrictions that have changed the socialisation scenario, impacting relationships. Women's expression and connections are increasingly mediated through technology which is shaped by gendered dynamics of access and availability.
   Community networks (CNs) and community radio stations (CRs) have been central to ensuring last-mile connectivity through the use of frugal technologies. This has been an effective source of information dissemination, especially over the course of the pandemic. Through qualitative data from CRs in India, we show that care work and intimacy are strong elements of communications as mediated by CNs and CRs. Against the backdrop of gendered care work, we explore the conceptual depth that different aspects of intimacies and intimate economies offer to understand communications as mediated through CNs and CRs over the course of the pandemic, at the levels of personal expression, interpersonal communications and community conversations. We seek to understand how these forms of mediating technologies play a role in furthering, challenging and reimagining our understanding of intimacies as a concept.

AB  - Objectives: Favorable attitudes, emotions, personality characteristics, and self-rated health have been associated with successful aging in late life. However, less is known regarding these constructs and their relationships to mental health outcomes in the oldest old persons. This study examined cross-sectional relationships of these psychological factors to depressive symptoms in centenarians and near-centenarians.
   Methods: A selected sample of Ashkenazi Jewish older adults aged 98-107 (n = 54, 78% female) without significant cognitive impairment participated. Cognitive function was assessed by Mini-Mental Status Examination, positive attitude toward life and emotional expression by the Personality Outlook Profile Scale (POPS), self-rated health by participants' subjective rating of their present health, and depressive symptoms by the Geriatric Depression Scale.
   Results: Results demonstrated inverse associations of the positive attitude toward life domain of the POPS and self-rated health with participants' levels of depressive symptoms even after adjusting for the effects of history of medical illnesses, cognitive function, and demographic variables. Additionally, participants with high levels of care showed higher levels of depressive symptoms. Path analysis supported the partially mediating role of positive attitude toward life in the relationship between self-rated health and depressive symptoms.
   Conclusion: These findings emphasized the important roles of positive attitudes and emotions as well as self-rated health in mental health outcomes in the oldest old. Although, limited by its cross-sectional design, findings suggest these psychological factors may exert protective effects on mental health outcomes in advanced age.

AB  - Objectives: To describe the association of team climate with attitudes toward information and communication technology among nursing staff working on acute psychiatric wards.
   Background: Implementation of ICT applications in nursing practice brings new operating models to work environments, which may affect experienced team climate on hospital wards.
   Method: Descriptive survey was used as a study design. Team climate was measured by the Finnish modification of the Team Climate Inventory, and attitudes toward ICT by Burkes' questionnaire. The nursing staff (N = 181, n = 146) on nine acute psychiatric wards participated in the study.
   Results: It is not self-evident that experienced team climate associates with attitudes toward ICT, but there are some positive relationships between perceived team climate and ICT attitudes. The study showed that nurses' motivation to use ICT had statistically significant connections with experienced team climate, participative safety (p = 0.021), support for innovation (p = 0.042) and task orientation (p = 0.042).
   Conclusion: The results suggest that asserting team climate and supporting innovative operations may lead to more positive attitudes toward ICT. It is, in particular, possible to influence nurses' motivation to use ICT. More attention should be paid to psychosocial factors such as group education and co-operation at work when ICT applications are implemented in nursing.

AB  - Police integrity is a crucial steppingstone in police administrators' long-term goals of obtaining legitimacy and yielding citizens' evaluations of the police as a legitimate institution. This paper investigates the relationship between work-related experiences and police integrity, as well as the degree to which this relationship is mediated by well-known socio-political attitudes such as authoritarianism, ethnic prejudice, and social dominance orientation. Using structural equation modelling of the responses provided by 1,255 members of the Belgium police, the work-related characteristics, socio-political attitudes, and organisational dimensions of police integrity are related to three outcomes of police integrity. Results show that police officers in the field and those who had more frequent contacts with victims and perpetrators of crimes evaluate misconduct to be less serious, are less willing to say that they would report the behaviour, and advocate less severe disciplinary sanctions. Generalised socio-political attitudes related to prejudice mediate work-related experiences and perceptions of peer police integrity and are in turn negatively related to police integrity outcomes. These findings illustrate that police officers do not operate in a social vacuum as these general socio-political attitudes are non-occupation specific. This suggests that police integrity training programmes not only need to target work-related characteristics, such as an open culture to discuss problems, but also need to target general socio-political attitudes to foster police integrity.

AB  - Extant research on social distance and decision-making under risk has mostly focused on how people reach different decisions for themselves than others under the same circumstances. This research adds to this literature by studying how the social distance between the decision-maker and people in danger influences risk preference in life-saving domain. We found that decision-makers tend to be more risk-seeking when the lives of close others are at stake than distant others regardless of whether the situation is framed in terms of loss or gain. However, the effect of social distance on risk preference was eliminated when it was the responsibility of the decision-makers rather than the chance to pick the potential victims to save. By analyzing the shape of value function, we provided preliminary evidence for the hypothesis that decision-makers engage in feeling-based evaluation when close others' lives are at stake but calculation-based evaluation when distant others' lives are at stake, which could account for the effect of social distance on risk preference documented in this research. A final experiment yielded direct evidence that evaluation mode mediates the relationship between social distance and risk preference.

AB  - Power and loneliness are two important research topics in social psychology, yet remaining in separate streams of literature despite the potential relationship. To fill this gap, the present research systematically investigates how, why, and when sense of power affects loneliness. We propose that sense of power decreases loneliness, and that this effect is mediated by perceived social support and moderated by social exclusion. In a set of two studies, the hypotheses received convergent support. Study 1 was a survey study, which showed that sense of power was positively related to perceived social support and negatively correlated with loneliness. Furthermore, Study 2 used an experimental approach to provide causal evidence for the effect of power on loneliness, and to test the moderating role of social exclusion. This research contributes to the psychology literature on power, loneliness, and social exclusion.

AB  - Social norms regulate behavior, and changes in norms have a great impact on society. In most modern societies, norms change through interpersonal communication and persuasive messages found in media. Here, we examined the neural basis of persuasion-induced changes in attitude toward and away from norms using fMRI. We measured brain activity while human participants were exposed to persuasive messages directed toward specific norms. Persuasion directed toward social norms specifically activated a set of brain regions including temporal poles, temporo-parietal junction, and medial prefrontal cortex. Beyond these regions, when successful, persuasion away from an accepted norm specifically recruited the left middle temporal and supramarginal gyri. Furthermore, in combination with data from a separate attitude-rating task, we found that left supramarginal gyrus activity represented participant attitude toward norms and tracked the persuasion-induced attitude changes that were away from agreement.

AB  - Purpose Timebanking is a generalized, voluntary service exchange that promotes use of otherwise idle resources in a community and facilitates community building. Participants offer and request services through the mediation of the timebank software. In timebanking, giving help and accepting help are both contributions; contributions are recognized and quantified through exchange of time-based currency. The purpose of this paper is to explore how users perceive timebank offers and requests differently and how they influence actual use. Design/methodology/approach This survey study, conducted in over 120 timebanks across the USA, examines users' timebanking participation, adapting dimensions of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Findings The authors found that perceived ease of use in timebanking platforms was positively associated with positive attitudes toward both requests and offers, whereas perceived usefulness was negatively associated with positive attitudes toward requests and offers. The authors also found that having positive attitudes toward requests was important to elicit behavioral intention to make a request, but that positive attitudes toward offers did not affect behavioral intentions to make offers. Practical implications - The authors discussed these results and proposed design suggestions for future service exchange tools to address the issues the authors raised. Originality/ value - The study is among the first few studies that examine timebanking participation using large- scale survey data. The authors evaluate sociotechnical factors of timebanking participation through adapting dimensions of TAM.

AB  - Objectives: Using Twitter, we aim to (1) define and quantify the prevalence and evolution of facets of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US in a spatiotemporal context and (2) examine amplified tweets among social distancing facets.
   Materials and methods: We analyzed English and US-based tweets containing "coronavirus" between January 23-March 24, 2020 using the Twitter API. Tweets containing keywords were grouped into six social distancing facets: implementation, purpose, social disruption, adaptation, positive emotions, and negative emotions.
   Results: A total of 259,529 unique tweets were included in the analyses. Social distancing tweets became more prevalent from late January to March but were not geographically uniform. Early facets of social distancing appeared in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle: the first cities impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Tweets related to the "implementation" and "negative emotions" facets largely dominated in combination with topics of "social disruption" and "adaptation", albeit to lesser degree. Social disruptiveness tweets were most retweeted, and implementation tweets were most favorited.
   Discussion: Social distancing can be defined by facets that respond to and represent certain events in a pandemic, including travel restrictions and rising case counts. For example, Miami had a low volume of social distancing tweets but grew in March corresponding with the rise of COVID-19 cases.
   Conclusion: The evolution of social distancing facets on Twitter reflects actual events and may signal potential disease hotspots. Our facets can also be used to understand public discourse on social distancing which may inform future public health measures.

TI  - When the Hairy Suffer Baldness Feminized Poverty and Social Exclusion as Problems of Social Justice in Africa

KW  - Baldness
KW  - feminized poverty

AB  - This article sets out to show how poverty connects with gender equality and reduced inequalities in the discourse of social justice in Africa. Literature is replete with problems of social exclusion and inequality in the narrow sense of financial impoverishment. Poverty is then indicated by denial in education, capital intensive economic activities and politics, while little or no attention has been paid to the malignancy of inequality and social exclusion that counteract recently increased feminine agency in Africa. Consequently, this work argues that much of what obtains among urban women is social exclusion at policy-making platforms, unlike their rural counterparts who lament exclusion due largely to a lack of or limited access to welfare infrastructures to meet physiological needs. Given the above, social exclusion and feminized poverty may not be restricted to monetary criteria, but also the ability and capacity of women (curiously affect elite women) to influence social policies. This work hereby embodies social justice issues using the hair to convey the possibility of having female elites ideologically tagged 'hairy' and grassroots women tagged 'hairless'. By this, being hairless is sufficient to explain social exclusion, poverty and inequality, but more it is worrisome when the 'hairy' who are at home in policy making spheres are themselves sidelined. The present contribution designates this as 'threatened baldness'. Using methods of critical analysis and reflective argumentation, this work focuses on the social exclusion of women in policy-making processes as another dimension to feminized poverty evidence of social injustice. The work proffers symbiotic interactionism as an intra-feminist tool, positing that it is by seeking reduced inequalities that concerted efforts of women towards achieving gender equality and ultimately combating poverty can bring about social justice in Africa.

AB  - Background: Knowledge, attitude, and practice of the community can determine progress from localized to community transmission of COVID-19 in India. Aims and Objectives: To assess the knowledge, attitude and practice levels of the general population during the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: A rapid cross-sectional survey was conducted among hospital visitors of a lead tertiary care hospital. Realtime data collection from 223 respondents was done and analyzed using Stata 12.1 SE. Results: Mean age was 38.2 +/- 13.5 years, 68.2% were males, mean education was 12.1 +/- 3.7 years and 45.3% were gainfully employed. Almost all had heard about CORONA (221, 99.1%). Adequate knowledge was present on: a) mode of spread (48.0%); b) preventive measures (70.9%). Television (77.1%), social media (60.5%) and WhatsApp (44.0%) were sources of information. Positive attitude was seen for: a) wearing a mask (83.9%); b) health-seeking (85%) on presenting with symptoms; c) Self-isolation or home-quarantine (20%). Adequate knowledge towards the mode of spread, symptoms and control measures or positive attitudes for health-seeking were found to positively translate into correct practices (p=0.001). Conclusion: Attitudes and practices of social distancing, self-isolation or home-quarantine were not adequate to prevent the epidemic progress in India.

AB  - This article examines how the Ainu language, a critically endangered indigenous language of northern Japan, is deployed in the Japanese animation Golden Kamuy (Noda, 2018-). The Ainu language is mediatized as loanwords and the language of the community primarily in Ainu-Japanese interactions. The Ainu co-protagonist's skillful translation of loanwords makes Ainu culture accessible to the viewers. Such considerate representations reflect the creator's extensive research and commitment to overcoming discrimination against Ainu. Unfortunately, however, careful analysis of overall Ainu language allocational patterns reveals that the show cannot escape from reproducing race-related discourses in Japan, reflecting Japan's colonial legacy.

We investigate a number of issues, including facilitating work while social distancing, contactless commerce, person recognition, when wearing masks or in other crisis situations, COVID-19 apps and their impact on issues such as privacy, crowdsourcing, donating data, tracking cases, etc. We also investigate the notion of people that have had COVID-19 and thus may not be vulnerable to the disease, versus, those that are still vulnerable to the disease. In addition, we examine several supply chain issues, such as changing patterns of supply and demand, fragile supply chains and autonomic supply chains. Further, we investigate a number of emerging issues and the roles of data, big data, and analytics in the area of changing and evolving work and their impact on organizations and electronic commerce. Finally, we conclude with a consideration of the merging of life and work and the issue of work-life balance.

AB  - Do print media significantly impact political attitudes and party identification? To examine this question, we draw on a rare quasi-natural experiment that occurred when The Sun, a right-leaning UK tabloid, shifted its support to the Labour party in 1997 and back to the Conservative party in 2010. We compared changes in party identification and political attitudes among Sun readers with non-readers and other newspaper readerships. We find that The Sun's endorsements were associated with a significant increase in readers' support for Labour in 1997, approximately 525,000 votes, and its switch back was associated with about 550,000 extra votes for the Conservatives in 2010. Although we observed changes in readers' party preference, there was no effect on underlying political preferences. The magnitude of these changes, about 2% of the popular vote, would have been unable to alter the outcome of the 1997 General Election, but may have affected the 2010 Election.

Age was negatively related to both dependent variables. Male gender, single status, and education were positively associated with both dependent variables. Managers had negative attitudes to use, but top-level managers reported more use than other respondents. Access to social network sites at the workplace was positively related to both dependent variables, whereas policies prohibiting showed the opposite relationship. Extraversion and Neuroticism were positively related to both dependent variables. Conscientiousness, positive challenge at work, and quantitative demands were all negatively related to both dependent variables.

AB  - Purpose The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had major impacts on the performance of construction projects that have adopted social distancing measures. This study examines the effect of social distancing measures on project schedule performance through job reorganization on construction project sites. Design/methodology/approach Responses were obtained through a survey of 154 construction projects and analysed using the partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. Findings The findings established that social distancing has a negative effect on schedule performance, social distancing has a positive effect on job re-organization and job re-organization has a positive effect on schedule performance. Additionally, the results indicate that job re-organization partially mediates the relationship between social distancing and schedule performance, while social distancing moderates the relationship between job re-organization and schedule performance with low social distancing having the stronger positive effect. Originality/value This study contributes theoretically to a greater understanding of the impact of adopting COVID-19 safety measures such as social distancing on the schedule performance of construction projects. The study also shows how social distancing could lead to schedule performance through job reorganization.

AB  - Indigenous knowledge about biodiversity and conservation is valuable and can be used to sustainably manage protected areas; however, indigenous communities continue to be marginalized due to the belief that their values and behaviors do not align with the overarching mission of conservation. This paper explores the extent of local knowledge and awareness of biodiversity, conservation and protected area management of indigenous communities at Khuvsgol Lake National Park, Mongolia. We investigate current levels of biodiversity awareness and explore perceptions toward conservation values and park management governance. Most respondents had a high awareness of existing biodiversity and held positive attitudes toward nature conservation and protected areas; however, insufficient knowledge of park rules and low levels of trust between local residents and park authorities may undermine conservation objectives in the long run. We identify an unequal share of economic benefits from tourism and preferential treatment toward elite business owners as a source of conflict. Limited information channels and poor communication between local residents and park authorities are also a source for low-level participation in conservation activities. Leveraging the increasing use of information communication technology, such as mobile phones, can serve as a new mechanism for improved information sharing and transparent reporting between local communities, conservationists and protected area authorities.

AB  - Nostalgia is a fond longing for the past that has been shown to increase feelings of meaning, social connectedness, and self-continuity. Although nostalgia for personal memories provides intra- and interpersonal benefits, there may be negative consequences of group-based nostalgia on the perception and acceptance of others. The presented research examined national nostalgia (a form of collective nostalgia), and its effects on group identification and political attitudes in the United States. In a sample of US voters (N = 252), tendencies to feel personal and national nostalgia are associated with markedly different emotional and attitudinal profiles. Higher levels of national nostalgia predicted both positive attitudes toward President Trump and racial prejudice, though there was no evidence of such relationships with personal nostalgia. National nostalgia most strongly predicted positive attitudes toward president Trump among those high in racial prejudice. Furthermore, nostalgia's positive relationship with racial prejudice was partially mediated by perceived outgroup threat. Results from this study will help us better understand how the experience of national nostalgia can influence attitudes and motivate political behavior.

AB  - This article examines the link between personality traits, political attitudes and the propensity to vote in elections, using an Internet panel survey conducted in two Canadian provinces at the time of the 2008 federal election and the subsequent provincial elections. It first establishes that the two most proximate attitudes that shape one's propensity to vote are political interest and sense of civic duty. The article then look at specific personality traits (altruism, shyness, efficacy and conflict avoidance) that could affect level of political interest, civic duty and the propensity to vote in elections. In the last part of the analysis, a model is proposed and tested, according to which the impact of personality traits is indirect, being mediated by interest and duty. The article shows that the data are consistent with such an interpretation.

AB  - This experiment investigated how anonymity influenced group identification, inter-group antagonism, and attitude change in computer-mediated communication in samples of both Korean and American participants. This study also examined how self-construal moderated the effect of anonymity on inter-group antagonism. Consistent with the social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE), findings from an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test showed that anonymity fostered group identification among the discussion partners and created greater attitude change following a group discussion. Anonymity correlated negatively with the exhibition of critical comments in both Korean and American participants. Although Korean participants showed a greater interdependent self-construal than the American participants did, the effects of self-construal on group identification and inter-group antagonism did not differ from those of American participants. Implications are discussed in light of the social identity theory, SIDE, and self-categorization theory. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We conducted 2 studies to examine how social exclusion and implicit theories of personality interact to influence preferences for products that evoke nostalgia. In Study 1 we tested how individuals' implicit personality (entity vs. incremental theorist type) moderate the effects of social exclusion on nostalgic consumption. Results showed that socially excluded (vs. socially included) consumers were more likely to consume nostalgic products when the consumers were entity (vs. incremental) theorists. In Study 2 we conducted a different manipulation of social exclusion and individuals' implicit personality, and also examined the mediating role of self-continuity. Results showed that self-continuity mediated the interaction effect of social exclusion and implicit personality on preferences for nostalgic products. The results were robust whether the manipulation of social exclusion was in an online dating or fitness club application context, and for different nostalgic product choices, comprising chips and cookies.

AB  - Objectives: The proportion of US doctors using electronic health records (EHRs) has risen sharply in response to the federal Meaningful Use (MU) program, which incentivizes EHR adoption. To track consumer perceptions of EHRs during this period, we conducted a national telephone survey annually for 3 consecutive years, from 2011 to 2013, corresponding with the early years of MU.
   Study Design: Nationwide random digit-dial survey.
   Methods: The survey used random digit-dial sampling on a dual frame of landline and cell phone numbers in the continental United States, but was not otherwise stratified by geographic region, race, or other variables. Because our primary goal was to identify relationships between variables and EHR attitudes, we constructed post hoc survey weights to align all 3 samples with each other. Relationships between sociodemographics and EHR questions were assessed with logistic regression models using the survey weights. Cross-year comparisons were conducted with chi(2) tests and Cochran-Armitage tests for linear trend.
   Results: Between 2011 and 2013, the proportion of respondents with a doctor who used an EHR rose from 64% to 71%. In 2011, 64% endorsed the belief that EHRs would improve healthcare quality, dropping to 62% by 2013. Simultaneously, the proportion concerned about the effects of EHRs on privacy dropped from 48% to 41%. Consumers whose doctors used EHRs were generally more likely to believe EHRs would improve healthcare quality and less concerned about privacy risks than those whose doctors did not use EHRs.
   Conclusions: Overall, we conclude that during the early years of the MU program, exposure to EHRs increased while confidence in the benefits of EHRs and concerns about privacy risks became less marked. The subset of people exposed to EHRs via their physicians continued to have more positive attitudes toward them than those without that exposure. These attitudinal trends may be linked to increased familiarity with health information technology.

AB  - Chronic pain presents a huge burden for individuals and society and evidence suggests intrinsic links with loneliness, social exclusion and sleep. Research examining how these factors interact is warranted. We aimed to explore the relationships between social exclusion, loneliness, acute and chronic pain, and the influence of poor sleep, in the general UK population. A cross-sectional analysis of UKBiobank participants with baseline data for acute and chronic pain, loneliness and sleep. Principal components analysis (PCA) used data relating to social isolation and deprivation to establish a composite measure of social exclusion. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed. 502,528 UKBiobank participants (mean age = 56.6years, 54.4%female, 94.6%white) were included in the analysis. PCA suggested three social exclusion factors "social participation", "individual deprivation" and "area deprivation". Loneliness significantly predicted acute (OR:1.887; 95%CI1.857-1.917) and chronic pain (OR:1.843; 95%CI1.816-1.870). Each social exclusion factor alone and in combination significantly predicted pain with largest effects for individuals scoring high on all social exclusion factors, for acute (OR:2.087; 95%CI2.026-2.150) and chronic (OR:2.314; 95%CI2.249-2.380) pain. Coefficients remained statistically significant when models were adjusted for demographics and sleep. Social exclusion (as a multifaceted construct) and loneliness are associated with an increased prevalence of acute and chronic pain. Poor sleep has a potential mediating effect on these associations. Exploration of the incidence of pain in loneliness and social exclusion in the general population is warranted. From a public health perspective these findings could be used to design social interventions to prevent or manage pain and mitigate social exclusion.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic presents a serious global health challenge to humanity in recent times. It has caused fundamental disruptions to the global transportation system, supply chains, and trade. The impact on the transport sector resulting from lockdowns has led to huge losses in revenue. At the moment there are limited studies of the road transport sector response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper fills this gap using Nigeria as a case study area. A mixed method involving both qualitative and quantitative research was employed. Principal Component Analysis and Multiple Criteria Analysis were used to analyze the data. The results suggest that road transport operators strongly (90.7%) believe that 51 adopted new technologies/innovations, processes, and procedures will keep them and passengers safe from the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. A breakdown shows that observing the lockdown directive is perceived by road transport operators as the most effective response to the pandemic. The breakdown continues in descending order thus: COVID-19 safety protocols, environmental sanitation, and promotion of hygiene, information technology, facemask, and social distancing. Others are public enlightenment, palliative, inclusion, and mass media. This indicates that non-pharmaceutical measures are very effective in the fight against the pandemic. This finding leverages support for the application of non-pharmaceutical guidelines in containing the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.

AB  - Social networking sites (SNSs) are observed to have both positive and negative effects on users' social, emotional, and cognitive development, which would further influence their self-esteem and well-being. Hence, understanding the behavior of users in online social networking is important. The present study investigates the causal relationships between Facebook users' personal factors and attitude toward Facebook. The study hypothesizes that personality traits would be significantly associated with attitude toward Facebook and that the association would be mediated by computer-mediated communication (CMC) skill, CMC knowledge and CMC motivation. The participants in this study are 327 school teenagers. The results indicate that participants who are extraverted and open to experience possess a positive attitude toward Facebook. Conscientious participants possess a negative attitude toward Facebook; however, for participants who are neurotics or who are agreeable, their attitude toward Facebook is not influenced by their personalities. An important finding of this study is that the three CMC competence components are mediators that either enhance or reduce the strengths of the causal relationships between four personality traits neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness and openness to experience and participants' attitude toward Facebook.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have found that in general, poor health is associated with a lower likelihood of internet use in older adults, but it is not well known how different indicators of health are associated with different types of digital information technology (DIT) use. Moreover, little is known about the relationship between health and the types of DIT use in older ethnic minority and migrant populations.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the associations among depressive symptoms and self-rated health (SRH) with different dimensions of DIT use in older migrants.
   Methods: We analyzed data from the Care, Health and Ageing of Russian-speaking Minority (CHARM) study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling, Russian-speaking adults aged 50 years or older residing permanently in Finland (men: 616/1082, 56.93%; age: mean 63.2 years, SD 8.4 years; response rate: 1082/3000, 36.07%). Data were collected in 2019 using a postal survey. Health was measured using depressive symptoms (measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) and SRH. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between the two health indicators and the following six outcomes: daily internet use, smartphone ownership, the use of the internet for messages and calls, social media use, the use of the internet for personal health data, and obtaining health information from the internet. A number of sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors were controlled for in the logistic regression regression analysis. Analyses were performed with weights accounting for the survey design and nonresponse.
   Results: After adjusting for sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors, depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 2.68, 95% CI 1.37-5.24; P=.004) and poor SRH (OR 7.90, 95% CI 1.88-33.11; P=.005) were associated with a higher likelihood of not using the internet daily. Depressive symptoms (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.06-3.35; P=.03) and poor SRH (OR 5.05, 95% CI 1.58-16.19; P=.006) also increased the likelihood of smartphone nonuse. Depressive symptoms were additionally associated with a lower likelihood of social media use, and poor SRH was associated with a lower likelihood of using the internet for messaging and calling.
   Conclusions: Poor SRH and depressive symptoms are associated with a lower likelihood of DIT use in older adults. Longitudinal studies are required to determine the directions of these relationships.

AB  - Drawing on archival material from the Black Cultural Archives, the British Library, and the Institute of Race Relations, this article sheds fresh light on a largely overlooked 1991 visit to Britain by controversial Black American preacher Al Sharpton following the racist murder of Black teenager Rolan Adams. The extraordinary response to Sharpton's arrival by the British mainstream press revealed racist patterns of news reporting and a chauvinistic rejection of 'outside agitators', while the minister's intervention drew a mixed response from local activists. However, the furore sparked by Sharpton's visit also helped to raise public awareness of Adams' murder and galvanise local Black communities, providing an important insight into anti-racist organising and British media coverage of high-profile racist incidents prior to the death of Stephen Lawrence.

AB  - Theorizing from humanistic and motivational literatures suggests attitude change may occur because high quality listening facilitates the insight needed to explore and integrate potentially threatening information relevant to the self. By extension, self-insight may enable attitude change as a result of conversations about prejudice. We tested whether high quality listening would predict attitudes related to speakers' prejudices and whether self-insight would mediate this effect. Study 1 (preregistered) examined scripted conversations characterized by high, regular, and poor listening quality. In Study 2, we manipulated high versus regular listening quality in the laboratory as speakers talked about their prejudiced attitudes. Finally, Study 3 (preregistered) used a more robust measure of prejudiced attitudes to test whether perceived social acceptance could be an alternative explanation to Study 2 findings. Across these studies, the exploratory (pilot study and Study 2) and confirmatory (Studies 1 & 3) findings were in line with expectations that high, versus regular and poor, quality listening facilitated lower prejudiced attitudes because it increased self-insight. A meta-analysis of the studies (N = 952) showed that the average effect sizes for high quality listening (vs. comparison conditions) on selfinsight, openness to change and prejudiced attitudes were, ds = 1.19, 0.46, 0.32 95%CIs [0.73, 1.51], [0.29, 0.63] [0.12, 0.53], respectively. These results suggest that when having conversations about prejudice, highquality listening modestly shapes prejudice following conversations about it, and underscore the importance of self-insight and openness to change in this process.

AB  - In three waves, this study investigates the impact of risk and benefit knowledge on attitude formation toward genetically modified (GM) foods as well as the moderating effect of knowledge level on attitude change caused by receiving information. The data in Wave 1 (N = 561) demonstrate that both benefit and risk knowledge either directly contribute to attitude formation or indirectly affect attitudes through the mediating roles of benefit and risk perceptions. Overall, benefit and risk knowledge affect consumer attitudes positively and negatively, respectively. In Wave 2, 486 participants from Wave 1 were provided with information about GM foods, and their attitudes were assessed. Three weeks later, 433 of these participants again reported their attitudes. The results indicate that compared with the benefit and mixed information, risk information has a greater and longer lasting impact on attitude change, which results in lower acceptance of GM foods. Furthermore, risk information more strongly influences participants with a higher knowledge level. The moderating effect of knowledge on attitude change may result from these participants' better understanding of and greater trust in the information. These findings highlight the important role of knowledge in attitude formation and attitude change toward GM foods as well as the necessity of considering the determinants of attitude formation in attitude change studies.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic poses a threat to global health and security inciting governments with the responsibility to respond with measures that ensure the health and safety of their communities. We assessed public attitudes towards governmental actions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in the G7 countries. Data were collected during 19th-21st March 2020, from 7005 Kantar's online panelists aged >16 years across the G7 countries: Canada, France, Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United States. Data were post-stratified and weighted to match population distributions of the respective countries. Descriptive and multivariable analyses were conducted. Amongst the G7, Japan had the lowest level of approval of governmental response to the pandemic, rating governmental communication as good, and trusting governmental decisions (35.0%, 33.6%, and 38.0%, respectively), followed by the U.S. (52.9%, 64.6%, and 59.9%, respectively). Understanding of which measures one can personally take to help limit the spread of the coronavirus was significantly associated with approving governmental response (aOR = 2.88), rating government communication as good (aOR = 2.70) and trust in future governmental decisions (aOR = 2.73). Those who reported government/politicians and friends/family as their most trusted information source were more likely to report approval, higher rating, and/or trust toward governmental actions. Public attitudes towards governmental actions against COVID-19 varied substantially across the G7 countries and were associated with the understanding of measures and source of information that respondents most trusted. Timely and accurate communication is essential to enhance public engagement to control the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - This paper examines the effect of social exclusion and product design philosophy on consumers' design preference, its underlying mechanism, and boundary condition. We propose that rejected (vs. ignored) consumers should prefer a professional- (vs. user-) designed product through increased psychological ownership. Additionally, product complexity should moderate this effect, such that rejected (vs. ignored) consumers should prefer professional-designed products for low complexity products; for high-complexity products, we predict a preference for professional-designed products, regardless of consumers' state of social exclusion. Across four studies (including one using an incentive-compatible design), we empirically test these hypotheses using different operationalizations of social exclusion. Our research contributes to the literature on product design philosophy, social exclusion, and psychological ownership. The findings offer novel insights regarding ways for marketers to develop marketing strategies to effectively choose and advertise firms' design philosophy.

AB  - Integrating research on social exclusion with the broader literature on system justification and flexible responses to threats, we propose a novel coping strategy that individuals may use in the face of social exclusion. In particular, we suggest that because exclusion often feels unexpected, it will lead individuals to bolster the system-justifying worldview that people get what they deserve, as excluded individuals attempt to cognitively cope with the threatened order and predictability of their world. Supporting our prediction, in Study 1, social exclusion (vs. inclusion) led participants to increasingly endorse descriptive meritocratic beliefs suggesting that hard work leads to success in society. This effect was mediated by the perceived unexpectedness of the interaction outcome, providing key evidence for our hypothesized process. Study 2 used individual differences in rejection sensitivity to provide further support for our unexpectedness account, demonstrating that exclusion heightens meritocratic beliefs only insofar as participants tend to find exclusions unexpected. The results expand our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms by which people cope with social exclusion and highlight the malleability of system-justifying ideologies in response to interpersonal factors.

AB  - This longitudinal study examined the multidimensionality of motivation to transfer training. Based on self-determination theory, expectancy theory, and the theory of planned behaviour, motivation to transfer was conceptualized in three dimensions: autonomous motivation to transfer, controlled motivation to transfer, and intention to transfer. Relationships of these dimensions with attitudes toward training content, knowledge test performance, and self- and supervisory-assessed transfer were investigated to understand further the mediating role of intentions in the transfer process. Participants were 128 trainees in occupational health and safety programs. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated good fit of the proposed three-factor structure. Partial least squares (PLS) based path modelling indicated partial support of the hypothesized relationships. Knowledge gain following training was large (Cohen's d = 1.00), while attitude change was small (Cohen's d = 0.27). The findings are discussed in terms of their significance for the development of theories of training effectiveness and their implications for evaluating professional development.

AB  - Introduction: Dengue fever (DF) has become a disease of public health concern. it is a mosquito-borne virus infection caused by one of the four serotypes of the dengue virus, and the disease is prevalent in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, with a global burden in the Americas. Yearly, about 390 million cases of new infection are estimated to occur. Aims of the Study: This study was aimed atdetermining the knowledge, attitude and practices regarding dengue fever amongst health workers in a tertiary health institution in Sokoto state , Nigeria. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out at the Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital, Sokoto, among 367 health-care workers who had worked in the hospital for at least 1 year before the study were selected using a systematic sampling method. Data were collected by trained resident doctors using a standardized, pretested questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 20 with a significance set at P> 0.05. Results: There was high awareness (95.1%) among the respondents, with seminars and lectures in school as the most familiar information sources. A more significant proportion, 87.8%, 93.2%, and 76.6%, of the respondents had adequate knowledge, positive attitude, and appropriate Di , practice, respectively. Nurses and laboratory scientists had higher practice scores compared to other health-care workers (P= 0.016). Conclusion: Capacity building of health-care workers, especially the primary care physicians on surveillance, proper diagnosis, and treatment, is needed to avoid missing cases or misdiagnosis of cases, especially in developing and underdeveloped countries with limited health resources care service delivery.

AB  - This article presents a theoretical framework of how intergroup violence may figure into the activation and maintenance of group categories, boundaries, and identities, as well as the mediating role played by organizations in such processes. The framework's analytical advantages are demonstrated in an application to southern lynchings. Findings from event- and community-level analyses suggest that "public" lynchings, carried out by larger mobs with ceremonial violence, but not "private" ones, perpetrated by smaller bands without public or ceremonial violence, fed off and into the racial group boundaries, categories, and identities promoted by the southern Democratic Party at the turn of the 20th century and on which the emerging Jim Crow system rested Highlighting that racialized inequalities cannot be properly understood apart from collective processes of racial group boundary and identity making, the article offers clues to the mechanisms by which past racial domination influences contemporary race relations.

AB  - Destination Marketing Organizations (DMOs) at all levels have an ultimate goal of building strong and positive images for their destinations. However, the projected image from the supply side is not necessarily the mirror of the perceived image from the demand side. This study adopted the content analysis method to evaluate the projected image and perceived image of rural destinations in China to see whether there is any discrepancy between and within the two categories. Comparative analysis of different information sources including web contents and on-site visitor interviews were processed. The evaluation of image congruency demonstrates that official websites focus more on cognitive image elements (knowledge and beliefs of the place). Besides promoting attractions, it provides information on geography background and promotes local culture. Business web content promotes attractions, package tour, and activities which can generate revenue. The perceived image includes more sentiment contents: on-site visitors expressed more negative attitude, but social media comments are relatively positive.

AB  - This article describes patterns of compliance with social distancing measures among the Spanish population during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It identifies several factors associated with higher or lower compliance with recommended measures of social distancing. This research is part of a 67-country study, titled the International COVID-19 study on Social & Moral Psychology, in which we use a Spanish dataset. Participants were residents in Spain aged 18 or above. The sample comprises 1,090 respondents, weighted to be representative of the Spanish population. Frequencies, correlations, bivariate analysis, and six models based on hierarchical multiple regressions were applied. The main finding is that most Spaniards are compliant with established guidelines of social distance during the pandemic (State of Alarm, before May 2020). Variables associated more with lower levels of compliance with these standards were explored. Six hierarchical multiple regression models found that compliance with social distance measures has a multifactorial explanation (R-2 between 20.4 and 49.1%). Sociodemographic factors, personal hygiene patterns, and the interaction between personal hygiene patterns and the support for political measures related to the coronavirus brought significant effects on the regression models. Less compliance was also associated with beliefs in some specific conspiracy theories with regard to COVID-19 or general conspiracy mentality (Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire, CMQ), consumption patterns of traditional mass media (television, paper newspapers, magazines, and radio) and modern means to get informed (online digital newspapers, blogs, and social networks), political ideology, vote, trust in institutions, and political identification. Among the future lines of action in preventing the possible outbreak of the virus, we suggest measures to reinforce trust in official information, mainly linked to reducing the influence of disinformation and conspiracy theories parallel to the pandemic.

KW  - Latin America
AB  - Objectives: Many developing countries use social distancing as part of their mitigation strategy during epidemics. This study aimed to understand individual decisions to practice different social distancing measures in the immediate emergence of COVID-19. Study design: Utilizing social media advertising and snowball sampling, a web-based survey was administered in 16 Latin American countries. Methods: We estimated seemingly unrelated Probit models to identify factors associated with the decision to implement social distancing practices. Results: From 5,480 respondents, estimated marginal effects indicate that risk perceptions are positively related to distancing from friends or relatives and avoiding public places but do not seem to influence the decision to stay home. Results also indicate that risk perceptions are related to household income, the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the country, and perceived preparedness of the health care system. Conclusions: Our findings support the notion that people will follow social distancing measures if there is a clear understanding of risk. Providing the public ways to access accurate numbers of confirmed cases can inform perception of disease severity. Since household income was a determinant of practicing social distancing, without financial assistance, some will be forced to break regulations in order to procure food or resources for their survival.

AB  - Most of the e-campaigning literature claims that the Internet can reinforce political attitudes, but not change them. In this article, I analyze the issue through the receive-accept-sample (RAS) theory, which postulates that messages can change attitudes if they are both received and accepted by audiences. Based on qualitative elite interviews with 31 consultants and operatives involved in the 2008 United States presidential election, I argue that campaigns are finding new avenues to improve both reception and acceptance of their messages, and the implications merit close empirical scrutiny. The probability of message reception can be increased by citizens' propensity to seek out issue positions online and by diffusion through low-threshold activities by supporters; the probability of message acceptance can be augmented by video and the targeting of content; finally, indirect persuasion through interpersonal communication can increase the probability of both reception and acceptance.

Findings The results found that two factors (friendliness and telepresence) of flow experience in VR can positively affect destination image. Destination image has a significant indirect effect on how flow experience influences attitude change. Originality/value As tourism destinations are faced with strategic decisions about investment in different VR platforms or some other technologies, understanding how individuals respond to various VR stimuli is of practical importance. Therefore, this study's findings provide valuable information for tourism industry practitioners.

AB  - The transmission of national history in general and family narratives in particular is prone to censorship and bias, protecting or enhancing social identities. The authors propose that, as has been shown for national groups, families also create and pass on representations about their roles and behaviors through history. In a representative survey, 1000 German respondents estimated the percentages of victims, perpetrators, and those who helped potential victims during the time of National Socialism to be 35%, 34%, and 16%, respectively. For family representations, the percentages shifted toward helping (29%) and away from complicity (20%), while representations of victimhood were as prevalent (36%) as estimates for the general population. Systematic differences suggested an alignment of general social representations of history with family representations. Participants reporting a perpetrator family representation held more positive attitudes toward refugees coming to Germany today than participants who did not report such a representation. This link was mediated through differences in societal representations. The authors discuss family representations as an intermediate, more proximate prescriptive background and points of reference, according to which more general historical representations on a national level may be aligned, and individual present-day political attitudes and behaviors oriented.

AB  - In November 1969, a quite odd and ludicrous case of alleged discrimination was blown out of all proportion, perhaps wilfully, by Conservative politicians and the media in Britain, some eighteen months after Enoch Powell's Birmingham speech. A quite high-profile issue at the time, the case has now been completely forgotten. Yet, Esteves's article suggests that the event itself is helpful to make better sense of the British-rather than merely English-ramifications of debates on race relations and discrimination, particularly at a time of an upsurge in Scottish nationalism. More importantly, the case partakes of what Esteves calls the 'white backlash archive', a populist and popular repertoire that nativists-not only in Britain-draw from in order to underline that the state is inefficient and counter-productive when it tries to legislate against discrimination, as well as that ethnic minorities and immigrants get undue protection from the state authorities, even though the 1969 case itself had nothing to do with ethnic minorities or immigration.

AB  - Objectives COVID-19 has highlighted differences in our engagement in health prevention behaviors. The Health Belief Model (HBM), personality traits (conscientiousness, extraversion, and neuroticism), and sociodemographic variables were used to evaluate social distancing during the first month of a state-mandated Stay At Home (SAH) order. Design A web-based convenience sample of 645 Ohioans was surveyed. Hierarchical linear regression and mediation analysis were used to examine predictors of social distancing attitudes and behaviors and whether health beliefs mediated the relationship between personality and social distancing. Results Most respondents agreed with and adhered to social distancing guidelines. HBM constructs were strong predictors of SAH attitudes, while personality accounted for little additional variance. Anxiety was indirectly related to overall social distancing attitudes and behavior through its relationship with health beliefs. However, violations of social distancing were best explained by situational factors (e.g., being an essential worker). Conclusion The results demonstrate the power of components of the HBM to explain attitudes and behaviors regarding the SAH order beyond any contribution from personality. By examining the role of personality and health beliefs on social distancing attitudes and behaviors, this research will benefit public health nurses and others tasked with communicating and promoting preventative health behavior.

AB  - This study investigates the moderation effect of peer-group pressure in the context of groups chat on mobile instant messengers (MIMs). Why do adolescents engage in bullying behaviors on MIMs in opposition to their attitude toward bullying? Generally, previous research has explored modest associations between attitude toward cyberbullying and cyberbullying behaviors. However, this study focuses on the moderating role played by peer-group pressure in MIMs group chats. An interaction effect between peer-group pressure and negative attitude toward MIMs bullying is hypothesized and demonstrated based on data (N = 424) gathered via a survey conducted in July 2014 of randomly selected students from South Korean high schools and junior high schools in South Korea. The findings support the effect of interaction between the attitude and peer-group pressure. Adolescents with a highly negative attitude toward MIMs bullying tended not to engage in MIMs bullying regardless of the level of peer-group pressure to which they perceived themselves to be subject. However, adolescents with a neutral or positive attitude toward MIMs bullying who perceived a high level of peer-group pressure engaged more in MIMs bulling behaviors than did those with a similarly neutral or positive attitude who perceived a low level of PGP. It was concluded that self-justification or self-persuasion on the part of adolescents possibly resulting from the logic of cognitive dissonance can bring about engagement in MIMs bullying behaviors even against adolescents' attitudes toward MIMs bullying.

AB  - This study investigated whether negative stereotypes are responsible for the effect of ASD knowledge on social distance from individuals with ASD among college students. A sample of 869 neurotypical Chinese college students completed a cross-sectional survey to assess social distance, ASD knowledge, and negative stereotypes. Pearson correlation analysis yielded significant correlations between social distance, ASD knowledge, and negative stereotypes. Multiple mediation analysis showed that negative stereotypes mediated the link between social distance and ASD knowledge. Specifically, greater ASD knowledge predicted reduced social distance through decreased stereotyping related to dangerousness, personal responsibility for the disorder, and discontinuity, but also predicted greater social distance through increased stereotyping related to social inappropriateness. The findings deepen our understanding of the association between ASD knowledge and social distance by revealing the mediating role of negative stereotypes, and provide information that can help improve anti-stigma initiatives in college settings.

AB  - This paper has been written to assist researchers and practitioners to have an alternative view of investigating the effectiveness of personalized ads on social media. The current literature shows that consumers mostly have negative attitudes and perceptions towards social media advertising but on the other hand, few studies indicate that these ads are quite effective. The literature review, in this article, illustrates that relevance as a construct has not been given enough attention which possibly is the cause of the unclear conclusion about the role and usefulness of personalized ads, therefore, analysis is done on the relevance of personalized ads on social media. Henceforth, instead of relying on predetermined effectiveness measures, it is important to understand the role of relevance in the effectiveness of personalized social media ads (Proposition 1). Also, the literature indicates that there is an emotional experience that consumers go through that affects the way consumers respond to the personalized ads (Proposition 2). Furthermore, the analysis shows that the relevance of a personalized ad on social media is an antecedent of advertising value (Proposition 3).

AB  - In contrast to earlier in the HIV/AIDS pandemic, net of other demographic factors, formal education acts as a preventative factor in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite this trend, there has been almost no research on the causal mechanisms behind the widely reported education effect. Consistent with the education effect, structural equation modeling of the influence of education attainment on condom use with Demographic Health Survey data from nine sub-Saharan Africa nations collected between 2003 and 2005 finds that net of control variables, there is a robust, positive influence of education on condom use among sexually risky adults. Information-transfer and attitude change, the two most commonly assumed educational influences on the use of condoms, are tested, and although education attainment increases acquisition of basic facts and the inculcation of positive attitudes about HIV/AIDS, these factors have only weak influence on condom use. Given this, a new hypothesis about education's enhancement of health reasoning is developed from neuro-developmental and decision-making research. Modeling finds that education robustly influences health reasoning ability and this factor mediates a significant proportion of the education effect on condom use. The results raise concern about the enormous effort by NGOs in the region to use mainly fact-and attitude-based educational programs to reduce future HIV infections. Future research on the causal mechanisms behind the association between education and HIV/AIDS prevention should focus how on schooling enhances the cognitive skills needed for health reasoning.

AB  - Prejudice researchers have proposed a number of methods to reduce prejudice, drawing on and, in turn, contributing to our theoretical understanding of prejudice. Despite this progress, relatively few of these methods have been shown to reliably improve intergroup relations in real-world settings, resulting in a gap between our theoretical understanding of prejudice and real-world applications of prejudice-reduction methods. In this article, we suggest that incorporating principles from another field, social marketing, into prejudice research can help address this gap. Specifically, we describe three social-marketing principles and discuss how each could be used by prejudice researchers. Several areas for future research inspired by these principles are discussed. We suggest that a hybrid approach to research that uses both theory-based and problem-based principles can provide additional tools for field practitioners aiming to improve intergroup relations while leading to new advances in social-psychological theory.

AB  - Introduction: Although e-cigarette marketing on social media increases positive attitudes and experimentation, little is known about non-influencer e-cigarette portrayals of young people.
   Aims and Methods: High school adolescents (n = 928, 15-18) were recruited by Light-speed Health for an online experiment and randomized to view an Instagram post with or without e-cigarette use. Outcomes were positive and negative perceptions (prototypes), social distance, and willingness to use.
   Results: Half (50%) of participants were susceptible to e-cigarette use. E-cigarettes shown (vs. not) led to less positive prototypes, p = .017, more negative prototypes, p = .004, and more social distance, p< .001. Negative prototypes and social distance were moderated by susceptibility (both p< .05); effects among non-susceptible adolescents only. Showing e-cigarettes did not impact willingness to use if offered.
   Conclusions: Negative perceptions of e-cigarettes use challenge assumptions that vaping online is universally admirable. Highlighting unfavorable opinions of vaping or negative impacts for adolescents' social image are potential strategies for tobacco counter-marketing.

AB  - Proximity, or spatial closeness, can generate social closenessthe closer people are together, the more they interact, affiliate, and befriend one another. Mediated communication allows people to bridge spatial distance and can increase social closeness between conversational partners, even when they are separated by distance. However, mediated communication may not always make people feel closer together. Here, we test a hypothesis derived from construal theory, about one way in which mediated communication might increase spatial distance, by imposing social distance between two texting partners. In three studies, the social distance generated by a text conversation correlated with estimates of spatial distance. Conversations designed to generate social distance increased estimates of spatial distance. We discuss this relationship in light of the rise in computer-mediated communication.

AB  - Background: In 2010, 245,000 women died due to pregnancy-related causes in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. Our study is nested into the QUALMAT project and seeks to improve the quality of maternal care services through the introduction of a computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) to help healthcare workers in rural areas. Healthcare information technology applications in low-income countries may improve healthcare provision but recent studies demonstrate unintended consequences with underuse or resistance to CDSS and that the fit between the system and the clinical needs does present challenges. Aims: To explore and describe perceived needs and attitudes among healthcare workers to access WHO guidelines using CDSS in maternal and neonatal care in rural Burkina Faso.
   Methods: Data were collected with semi-structured interviews in two rural districts in Burkina Faso with 45 informants. Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis of the quantitative part of the interview corresponding to informants' background. Qualitative data were analyzed using manifest content analysis.
   Results: Four main findings emerged: (a) an appreciable willingness among healthcare workers for and a great interest to adapt and use modern technologies like computers to learn more in the workplace, (b) a positive attitude to easy access of guidelines and implementation of decision-support using computers in the workplace, (c) a fear that the CDSS would require more working time and lead to double-work, and (d) that the CDSS is complicated and requires substantial computer training and extensive instructions to fully implement.
   Conclusions: The findings can be divided into aspects of motivators and barriers in relation to how the CDSS is perceived and to be used. These aspects are closely connected to each other as the motivating aspects can easily be turned into barriers if not taken care of properly in the final design, during implementation and maintenance of the CDSS at point of care. 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Two experiments investigated the effects of manipulating quality of evidence that supports arguments on message persuasiveness. The evidence quality was systematically manipulated by violating one or two of the relevant normative criteria. In experiment one, participants were presented with arguments embedded within a persuasive message. All supportive evidence was of either high, medium or low quality (between-subjects design). In experiment two, each argument was presented separately and was supported with high, medium and low quality evidence (within-subjects design). The recipients were insensitive to manipulations of evidence quality in the first, but sensitive to it in the second experiment. The findings are discussed with reference to conceptual and methodological issues in the study of attitude change.

AB  - Social distancing to limit the spread of COVID-19 poses a unique psychological challenge, especially in light of evidence for the importance of even minimal cues of inclusion. In a German (N = 546) and a US (N = 199) sample, we examined the impact of work-related social distancing on the outcomes of ostracism, measuring need fulfillment in self-esteem, belonging, control, and meaning. Overall, social distancing was associated with decreased need fulfillment. German participants reported a higher need fulfillment compared to American participants. Compared to previous studies, social distancing impacted self-related need fulfillment less than experimental manipulations of ostracism, however more so than the baseline condition of inclusion. Working, while social distancing was associated with greater need fulfillment, as was identifying as male. Women reported lower need fulfillment overall and this difference was mediated by the need to belong. Results are discussed in terms of understanding self-related needs in different contexts of isolation.

AB  - In the face of growing pressure placed on the natural environment, the study on which this article is based considered the effectiveness of interpretive provision in mitigating the harmful effects of tourism on the environment. The aim of this research was to determine whether guided or non-guided interpretation is most effective in reaching the stated goals of interpretation. The four key goals of interpretation, namely visitor satisfaction, knowledge gain, attitude change and modification of behaviour intent, were used in the assessment of the relative effectiveness of guided and non-guided interpretation in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Through comparing responses to questionnaires from post-visit samples and observing both guided and non-guided interpretation, the research found that guided interpretation was only marginally more effective in reaching the four key goals of interpretation than the non-guided interpretive media. Guided interpretation was found to be more effective in terms of visitor satisfaction, whilst guided and non-guided interpretation had only marginal differences in effectiveness in relation to knowledge gain, attitude change and intent to modify behaviour.

AB  - Electromagnetic spectrum distribution prediction is the basis for the development of wireless communication technology. Due to the high randomness of the rough sea surface, it is difficult to accurately predict the offshore electromagnetic spectrum distribution. We present a prediction model of offshore electromagnetic spectrum distribution based on ray tracing method and Pierson-Moskowitz (PM) wave spectrum model. Based on the antenna attitude and the antenna directional pattern, the field strength calculation formulas of the electromagnetic wave sight line ray (SLR) propagation and the electromagnetic wave reflecting line ray (RLR) propagation off the sea surface are established. As the sea surface and the antenna attitude change, the effective rays from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna also change. This paper focus on the electromagnetic spectrum distribution prediction by calculating the effective angle (EA) of the transmitting antenna. We relate the EA to the antenna tilt angle and the antenna directional pattern, and combine the PM wave spectrum to establish the offshore electromagnetic spectrum distribution prediction models. Finally, we simulated the electromagnetic spectrum distribution prediction based on specific PM wave spectrum data.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the relationship between health locus of control and oral health status among Information Technology (IT) professionals in Hyderabad, India.
   Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire study was carried out among IT employees in Hyderabad city. The behaviour, attitude and perceptions of individuals towards health were assessed using the multidimensional health locus of control scale. Oral health status was evaluated clinically utilising the simplified oral hygiene index, community periodontal index, and loss of attachment index. Data were statistically analysed using SPSS software (v 21.0).
   Results: A convenience sample of 989 employees (response rate of 82.4%, mean age 26.3 +/- 5.0 years) completed the questionnaire. The overall highest mean domain score was recorded for 'chance locus of control' (CLOC; 9.0 +/- 2.1) and lowest overall mean domain score for 'internal locus of control' (ILOC; 6.7 +/- 0.9). The overall mean scores of DI-S, CI-S and OHI-S were 0.7 +/- 0.4, 0.7 +/- 0.5 and 1.4 +/- 0.8, respectively; there was an inverse relation with age groups. The mean CPI and LOA scores observed among males, ranging from 0.4 +/- 0.6 to 1.6 +/- 1.1, were statistically significantly higher than those of females, ranging from 0.2 +/- 0.5 to 1.3 +/- 1.2 (p = 0.00). Powerful locus of control had a statistically significant negative correlation with oral hygiene indices. In contrast, a positive correlation was observed between ILOC and DI-S and OHI-S (r = 0.0672 and r = 0.0639, respectively).
   Conclusion: This study highlighted that people with a positive attitude regulate their health behaviour and maintain good oral hygiene.

AB  - A growing literature examines the impact of terror on subjective well-being, focusing mainly on specific events and their local consequences. In the present paper, we study the effect of global terror intensity on the life satisfaction of Western citizens. We leverage panel datasets for six countries that we combine with daily information on all the terror attacks in the world over 20 years. Terror diminishes individual subjective well-being globally and continually. Using high frequency data over the long-run also allows us to provide a rich heterogeneity analysis on the relevant dimensions of terror. The effect is particularly strong for events broadcasted on Western television, when respondents are physically or genetically close to the victims, or for individuals who feel more exposed (e.g. living in urban areas). For a subset of countries, we also study the impact of terror on political attitudes and find that global terror significantly increases the intention to vote for conservative parties.

AB  - Social distancing plays a critical role in reducing the disease diffusion risk during the COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic period. In order to explore the social distancing obedience behavior, a comprehensive survey was conducted in this study by collecting data from 1064 Chinese residents in January 2021 by means of a questionnaire. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and hierarchical linear regression (HLR) analyses were employed to investigate the research hypotheses considered, testing the three influencing factors of social distancing obedience behavior: public guidance, risk perception, and regulation punishment. The reliability and validity of the measurements are demonstrated. The outcomes from the conducted analyses show that the public guidance significantly affects risk perception of individuals, while risk perception imposes a positive impact on social distancing obedience behavior. Moreover, risk perception serves a mediating role in the relationship between the public guidance and social distancing obedience behavior. In addition, regulation punishment positively predicts social distancing obedience behavior and could even have a greater effect by enhancing risk perception. Hence, this study suggests that the relevant authorities and agencies implement strong social distancing policies during the COVID-19 post-pandemic period from the perspective of promoting the public guidance, risk perception, and regulation punishment.

TI  - Big Data's Disparate Impact
T2  - CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - DISCRIMINATION
AB  - Advocates of algorithmic techniques like data mining argue that these techniques eliminate human biases from the decision-making process. But an algorithm is only as good as the data it works with. Data is frequently imperfect in ways that allow these algorithms to inherit the prejudices of prior decision makers. In other cases, data may simply reflect the widespread biases that persist in society at large. In still others, data mining can discover surprisingly useful regularities that are really just preexisting patterns of exclusion and inequality. Unthinking reliance on data mining can deny historically disadvantaged and vulnerable groups full participation in society. Worse still, because the resulting discrimination is almost always an unintentional emergent property of the algorithm's use rather than a conscious choice by its programmers, it can be unusually hard to identify the source of the problem or to explain it to a court.
   This Essay examines these concerns through the lens of American antidiscrimination law-more particularly, through Title VII's prohibition of discrimination in employment. In the absence of a demonstrable intent to discriminate, the best doctrinal hope for data mining's victims would seem to lie in disparate impact doctrine. Case law and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Uniform Guidelines, though, hold that a practice can be justified as a business necessity when its outcomes are predictive of future employment outcomes, and data mining is specifically designed to find such statistical correlations. Unless there is a reasonably practical way to demonstrate that these discoveries are spurious, Title VII would appear to bless its use, even though the correlations it discovers will often reflect historic patterns of prejudice, others' discrimination against members of protected groups, or flaws in the underlying data.
   Addressing the sources of this unintentional discrimination and remedying the corresponding deficiencies in the law will be difficult technically, difficult legally, and difficult politically. There are a number of practical limits to what can be accomplished computationally. For example, when discrimination occurs because the data being mined is itself a result of past intentional discrimination, there is frequently no obvious method to adjust historical data to rid it of this taint. Corrective measures that alter the results of the data mining after it is complete would tread on legally and politically disputed terrain. These challenges for reform throw into stark relief the tension between the two major theories underlying antidiscrimination law: anticlassification and antisubordination. Finding a solution to big data's disparate impact will require more than best efforts to stamp out prejudice and bias; it will require a wholesale reexamination of the meanings of "discrimination" and "fairness."

AB  - Objective Data on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is limited in Ethiopia and other parts of Africa. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its associated factors in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Design A community-based concurrent mixed-method study. Setting In a community setting. Participants Adult residents (n=422) of Akaki Kality subcity who were recruited by a two stage sampling technique and 24 adults who were selected purposively were included for the quantitative and qualitative part of the study respectively. Outcome measures Data were collected by face-to-face interview using a semistructured questionnaire. Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were identified by multivariable binary logistic regression model. Results One out five (19.1%, 95% CI 15.3% to 24.6%) participants were not willing to get vaccinated. In the multivariable analysis, vaccine hesitancy was significantly associated with being female (aOR=1.97; 95% CI 1.10 to 3.89), having negative attitude towards COVID-19 and its preventive measures (aOR=1.75; 95% CI 1.08 to 3.02), and primary information source being social media (internet) (aOR=3.59; 95% CI 1.75 to 7.37). Study participants have predominantly stated that they did not have enough information about the vaccine, feared it would not be effective or have too many side effects, and reflected their uncertainty towards the quality of the vaccine. Conclusions A considerable proportion of the people in Addis Ababa have concerns on COVID-19 vaccines and unwilling to accept them. This was due to the misconceptions, negative attitudes and use of social media as their primary source of information. Providing the community with health education and consistent efforts to enhance the prevention measures are important, particularly using different medias including social media.

AB  - Ex-offenders face many barriers during the process of community reentry, including difficulty obtaining housing or employment. These barriers are often the result of stigma and discrimination that can negatively affect domains of functioning and well-being that are central to successful reintegration. Implicit theory suggests that stigmatizing attitudes may be explained through beliefs regarding the invariable (fixed mindset) or malleable (growth mindset) nature of human attributes. Prior work demonstrated how these mindsets can explain attitudes toward ex-offenders and support for community reentry. In this manuscript, we report on two studies that examined whether attitudes toward ex-offenders and support for their reentry can be influenced through a brief mindset-based persuasive reading. In Study 1, we piloted a brief, experimental manipulation among a student sample (n = 352) to induce growth mindsets regarding criminal behavior to foster positive attitudes toward ex-offenders and their reentry. In Study 2, we replicated the first study in a community-based sample (n = 451) and tested ex-offender race as a potential moderator. Mediation analyses demonstrated a causal pathway between mindset condition, attitudes toward ex-offenders, and support for reentry, and provided empirical evidence that the mindset-based experimental manipulation can foster growth mindsets and support for ex-offender community reentry, regardless of ex-offender race. Findings present directions for developing a potentially low-cost and time-effective strategy that can be disseminated easily through online or other media platforms, and tailored to target specific barriers to reentry. Further research is needed to establish the persistence of effects on attitudinal changes over time.

AB  - In times of crisis, the media play a crucial role in offering people information and updates related to the ongoing events. Thus, the media implicitly shape public opinion on the issues they cover and, as a result, influence public attitudes and behaviors. In this context, this paper aims at analyzing the media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, by means of quantitative content analysis (N=1511) conducted on both television and online news stories released during March 18-31 2020, this study sheds light on the agenda-setting effects of the media and the phenomenon known as intermedia agenda-setting. Main results show that, in spring 2020, both television and online news stories extensively covered COVID-19 topics, focusing on domestic issues such as decisions taken by the authorities in order to manage the pandemic, effects of the virus, and statistics. Furthermore, results show a relatively high intermedia agenda-setting effect within the Romanian media environment. Content published online (either in the form of social media content or online stories) is frequently "borrowed" and cited in both online and television news stories, leading us to the idea that digital media might have become mainstream information sources.

The 2X2 Achievement Goal Orientations Scale and Mathematics Attitudes Scale were used as measures. The relationships between achievement goal orientations and math attitudes were examined using correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis. According to the results negative attitudes were predicted positively by learning-avoidance and performance-approach/avoidance goal orientations. Furthermore, positive attitudes were predicted positively by learning-approach/avoidance goal orientations and negatively by performance-approach/avoidance goal orientations. The results were discussed in the light of literature.

AB  - Drawing upon data from the China Labor Dynamics Survey, this study examines the mediating role of social exclusion between migrant status and subjective well-being. Our empirical findings suggest that not only current migrants are socially excluded in the cities of destination but also returned migrants are insufficiently reintegrated into their villages of origin. The experienced social exclusion, in particular, the lack of social support, the feeling of vulnerability, and the deficiency in the sense of community persistently undermines the subjective well-being of both current and returned migrants. Our findings shed new light on how migration decisions could affect people's perceptions of their lives and create inequality across social groups.

AB  - This study examined various parental racial socialization messages as mediators between school-based racial discrimination and racial identity formation over 4 years for African American boys (N = 639) and African American girls (N = 711). Findings indicated that school-based racial discrimination was associated with racial identity beliefs. For African American boys, behavioral racial socialization messages mediated the relation between school-based racial discrimination and racial centrality over time. Mediation also resulted for African American girls, but for a different set of race-related messages (negative messages and racial barriers) and racial identity beliefs. The developmental significance of the findings and implications for future research are discussed.

AB  - Theoretically guided by communication infrastructure theory and theory of planned behavior, this study has two aims: to assess the experiences and intentions of Seoul residents with regard to their localized use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and to identify the factors influencing those experiences and intentions. Online survey data (n = 901) were collected from adult residents of Seoul in the summer of 2013. The results indicate that various ICT channels (especially websites, online news sites, blogs, online cafes, and smartphone apps) could potentially be customized to serve urban neighborhoods. Positive attitudes and subjective norms related to localized ICT use behavior were significant factors for use of almost all ICT channels considered in the current study. Individuals' integrated connectedness to community storytelling network was a consistently significant and positive factor in relation to both experience and intention of localized uses of ICTs. Among four community engagement variables included in the current study, community activity participation was associated with the experience (but not with the intention) of localized ICT uses.

AB  - The 1969 Vietnam draft lottery assigned numbers to birth dates in order to determine which young men would be called to fight in Vietnam. We exploit this natural experiment to examine how draft vulnerability influenced political attitudes. Data are from the Political Socialization Panel Study, which surveyed high school seniors from the class of 1965 before and after the national draft lottery was instituted. Males holding low lottery numbers became more antiwar, more liberal, and more Democratic in their voting compared to those whose high numbers protected them from the draft. They were also more likely than those with safe numbers to abandon the party identification that they had held as teenagers. Trace effects are found in reinterviews from the 1990s. Draft number effects exceed those for preadult party identification and are not mediated by military service. The results show how profoundly political attitudes can be transformed when public policies directly affect citizens' lives.

AB  - Objective: We sought to test whether participation in an online group including IUD users influenced IUD-related knowledge, attitudes, and behavior among IUD non-users, as a proof-of-concept evaluation of information dissemination for less commonly used or novel contraceptives.
   Study design: We conducted a blinded, randomized controlled trial on the effect of online communication with IUD users within an online program called Birth Control Connect. Participants were women age 1845 living in the United States who had never used an IUD. We invited participants randomized to the intervention to join two-week, nine-member discussion groups including four satisfied IUD users and five IUD non-users; we invited control participants to groups including nine IUD non-users. We performed chi-squared tests on IUD knowledge, information-seeking, informational support and use in immediate post-surveys, and t-tests comparing change in IUD attitudes and frequency of logins to discussion groups.
   Results: We invited 488 IUD non-users and enrolled them into 70 groups between October 2015 and April 2016. We found increased positive attitudes towards the IUD in the intervention arm (0.65-point increase between pre- and post-surveys, versus 0.05 mean change for control arm, p = 0.03 for hormonal IUD, with a trend in the same direction for the non-hormonal IUD). Informational support also increased, with 70.3% of intervention arm participants self-reporting that they gained a better idea of what the IUD would be like, compared to 51.3% in control arm (p < 0.01). Of intervention participants, 63.3% versus 51.3% of control participants reported gaining new information from their group (p = 0.03). There were no differences in correct responses to knowledge items or information-seeking between groups.
   Conclusions: Online exposure to IUD users increased positive attitudes toward the IUD and informational support for decision-making about the IUD among non-users. Implications statement: Online spaces provide a promising environment for the exchange of accurate, useful contraceptive information based on real user experiences. Interventions aiming to harness social communication through structured online conversations (e.g., on existing social media platforms) about user experiences with lesser-known contraceptive methods such as the IUD may be worthwhile.

AB  - We argue that there is a need to understand impacts of information and communication technologies (ICT) projects in their local context, considering the participants' perspectives at the micro (community) level. Hence, this paper reports on the development and refinement of an extended framework to investigate ICT impact on development in three village areas in the developing country, Bangladesh. Through an interpretive study, we argue that previous studies failed to encapsulate many aspects such as mobility restriction, negative attitude towards female group and religious influences of ICT impact, especially at the micro level. Our extended framework demonstrates that ICT projects can lead to development, but only when social constraints are addressed.

AB  - China is one of the world's most sophisticated Internet censoring countries. Chinese Internet users who wish to visit blocked Web sites will have to use circumvention tools to get around the Great Firewall, a censoring system inspecting, filtering, and blocking foreign Web sites outside China. Using a nationally representative survey dataset, this study compares circumvention tool users and nonusers in terms of demographic features, Internet-use motivation, levels of media trust, and, most importantly, political attitude and behavior differences. We found that more than 11% of Chinese Internet users had ever used circumvention tools and they were most likely to be young and well-educated. Compared to nonusers, circumvention tool users were more likely to oppose censorship, to place less trust in news media, and to participate more actively in civic activities. However, circumvention tool users tend to hold more politically conservative attitudes than nonusers.

AB  - The act of creating graffiti is often perceived as being tied to risks, such as arrest or becoming a target for rival gangs. While graffiti writers seem aware of these risks, some use graffiti to send messages about issues such as race relations, governmental oppression, and war, while others see graffiti as an art form similar to painting on a traditional canvas. Using Lash's work on aesthetic reflexivity within a risk model framework, we investigate internet images and newspaper accounts of graffiti to highlight the gap between the aesthetics of graffiti writing and the accounts of those who hold positions of power within structures such as city offices and police departments. This gap makes it difficult to distinguish between graffiti that is meant to enliven an area and graffiti that is used to promote violence.

AB  - Introduction: HIV prevalence among pregnant women in Kenya is high. Furthermore, there is a high risk of maternal mortality, as many women do not give birth with a skilled healthcare provider. Previous research suggests that fears of HIV testing and unwanted disclosure of HIV status may be important barriers to utilizing maternity services. We explored relationships between women's perceptions of HIV-related stigma and their attitudes and intentions regarding facility-based childbirth.
   Methods: 1,777 pregnant women were interviewed at their first antenatal care visit. We included socio-demographic characteristics, stigma scales, HIV knowledge measures, and an 11-item scale measuring health facility birth attitudes (HFBA). HFBA includes items on cost, transport, comfort, interpersonal relations, and services during delivery at a health facility versus at home. A higher mean HFBA score indicates a more positive attitude towards facility-based childbirth. The mean HFBA score was dichotomized at the median and analyses were conducted with this dichotomized HFBA score using mixed effects logit models.
   Results: Women who anticipated HIV-related stigma from their male partner had lower adjusted odds of having positive attitudes about giving birth at the health facility (adjusted OR = .63, 95% CI 0.50-0.78) and less positive attitudes about health facility birth were strongly related to women's intention to give birth outside a health facility (adjusted OR = 5.56, 95% CI 2.69-11.51).
   Conclusions: In this sample of pregnant women in rural Kenya, those who anticipated HIV-related stigma were less likely to have positive attitudes towards facility-based childbirth. Furthermore, negative attitudes about facility-based childbirth were associated with the intention to deliver outside a health facility. Thus, HIV-related stigma reduction efforts might result in more positive attitudes towards facility-based childbirth, and thereby lead to an increased level of skilled birth attendance, and reductions in maternal and infant mortality.

AB  - The current study tests the influence of threatening-mediated intergroup contact on intergroup relations. A 2 (Immigration: Threat, No-threat) x 2 (Ingroup Group Exemplar: Present, Absent)+1 (Control Condition) experimental design was used to examine both the direct and indirect influence of news exposure on attitudes toward immigration. The moderating role of previous local news consumption was also investigated. Results indicate that exposure to a threatening news story about immigration directly affected attitudes toward immigrants' human rights, but not attitudes toward immigration policy. News exposure also indirectly influenced both types of immigration attitudes through feelings of intergroup anxiety, particularly for heavy news consumers. The discussion highlights the implications for both intergroup threat theory and cultivation research.

AB  - This article is dedicated to examine the impact of social exclusion (i.e., being rejected, isolated, excluded or ignored by other individuals or groups in society) on consumers' intention of green consumption. Based on Costly Signaling Theory, three experiments have been conducted to explore one main effect and the corresponding mechanism together with two boundary conditions. Specifically, the first study tests the main effect and internal mechanism by manipulating the state of social exclusion. The results show that social exclusion enhances consumers' intention to buy green products and consumers' desire for self-sacrifice mediates that relationship. Study 2 manipulates audience state to examine the first boundary condition. The findings show that the effect of social exclusion on green consumption exists only in public purchasing scenarios. Study 3 tests the second boundary condition by manipulating the stability of exclusion causes. The results indicate that the main effect is significant only when causes of exclusion are not stable. The final part discusses theoretical contributions and practical implications of this study in the field of both social exclusion and green consumption.

AB  - Evidence on mental illness stigma abounds yet little is known about public perceptions of intellectual disability. This study examined causal beliefs about intellectual disability and schizophrenia and how these relate to awareness of the condition and social distance. UK lay people aged 16+(N=1752), in response to vignettes depicting intellectual disability and schizophrenia, noted their interpretation of the difficulties, and rated their agreement with 22 causal and four social distance items. They were most likely to endorse environmental causes for intellectual disability, and biomedical factors, trauma and early disadvantage for schizophrenia. Accurate identification of both vignettes was associated with stronger endorsement of biomedical causes, alongside weaker endorsement of adversity, environmental and supernatural causes. Biomedical causal beliefs and social distance were negatively correlated for intellectual disability, but not for schizophrenia. Causal beliefs mediated the relationship between identification of the condition and social distance for both conditions. While all four types of causal beliefs acted as mediators for intellectual disability, for schizophrenia only supernatural causal beliefs did. Educating the public and promoting certain causal beliefs may be of benefit in tackling intellectual disability stigma, but for schizophrenia, other than tackling supernatural attributions, may be of little benefit in reducing stigma.

AB  - This paper argues that citizens are capable of developing and promoting complex policy symbols, and that these symbols include supporting frames that explain and justify them. Based on a long-term study of education policies in Los Angeles, California, the paper uses interpretive methods to reconstruct and analyze these frames. Citizens developed two specific policy symbols while the district was engulfed in a desegregation debate; citizens identified schools as places where students gained academic knowledge and as institutions that affected broader race relations. However, education policy in Los Angeles could not support these two symbols over a long period of time, and a political movement to end mandatory busing eventually caused the academic symbol (originally the weaker of the two symbols) to become dominant. This trend reflects broader national discussions, in which education is now discussed in terms of standards and accountability and is evidence of continuing racism in US policy.

AB  - Importance Knowledge and attitude influence compliance and individuals' practices. The risk and protective factors associated with high compliance to these preventive measures are critical to enhancing pandemic preparedness.
   Objective This survey aims to assess differences in mental health, knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of preventive measures for COVID-19 amongst healthcare professionals (HCP) and non-healthcare professionals.
   Design Multi-national cross-sectional study was carried out using electronic surveys between May-June 2020.
   Setting Multi-national survey was distributed across 36 countries through social media, word-of-mouth, and electronic mail.
   Participants Participants >= 21 years working in healthcare and non-healthcare related professions.
   Main outcome Risk factors determining the difference in KAP towards personal hygiene and social distancing measures during COVID-19 amongst HCP and non-HCP.
   Results HCP were significantly more knowledgeable on personal hygiene (AdjOR 1.45, 95% CI -1.14 to 1.83) and social distancing (AdjOR 1.31, 95% CI -1.06 to 1.61) compared to non-HCP. They were more likely to have a positive attitude towards personal hygiene and 1.5 times more willing to participate in the contact tracing app. There was high compliance towards personal hygiene and social distancing measures amongst HCP. HCP with high compliance were 1.8 times more likely to flourish and more likely to have a high sense of emotional (AdjOR 1.94, 95% CI (1.44 to 2.61), social (AdjOR 2.07, 95% CI -1.55 to 2.78), and psychological (AdjOR 2.13, 95% CI (1.59-2.85) well-being.
   Conclusion and relevance While healthcare professionals were more knowledgeable, had more positive attitudes, their higher sense of total well-being was seen to be more critical to enhance compliance. Therefore, focusing on the well-being of the general population would help to enhance their compliance towards the preventive measures for COVID-19.

AB  - The literature identifies rural, older people as at risk of social exclusion, as a result of rural disadvantage. In this context, improved access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) has potential to build social inclusion, yet current evidence shows that rural, older people are the lowest current users of technology. This paper draws on the practice and local knowledge of rural practitioners from one Victorian region in order to explore: (a) the practice issues associated with ICT use among rural, older people; and (b) the characteristics of effective practice models in the rural, social work context. An analysis of findings highlights the need to respond to the diverse skills, needs, and learning styles of older people, to demonstrate the benefits of ICTs, involve users, and build confidence. Major barriers include poor ICT usage by many rural agencies and low practitioner capacity, as well as access and resources.

AB  - Social distancing is an effective means of containing the spread of COVID-19, but only if we all participate. Who are the individuals who are least likely to adhere to social distancing recommendations, presently and in the long term? Such knowledge is important for policy makers looking to sustain the public's buy-in to social distancing. Using survey data from a sample of U.S. residents (n = 1,449), the authors show that some demographic factors (gender, age, race, political party) help predict intent to adhere to social distancing. Yet demographic factors are relatively poor predictors compared with individual attitudes and media diets. Public officials should make efforts to inform and persuade the public of the importance of social distancing, targeting media such as television and radio, where audiences are less likely to currently engage in social distancing or are less likely to envision themselves sustaining strict social distancing for several weeks or months.

AB  - Digitization of the communication medium has transformed the mute, marginalized 'audience' into a heterogeneous and credible content 'producer.' Drawing on this dynamics and operation of the digital media, it has urged the need to re-theorize 'marginalization' and 'race.' Hence, this paper critiques the digital-media tool, blogs, using a rhetoric-textual analysis method and critical discourse analysis method for the fictional text, Americanah. These methods employ the psychoanalytical-Althusserian critique of Adichie's fictional narrative, Americanah. In the psychoanalytical sense, blog-writing call qualify as a mechanism of 'sublimation' in the post-modern world. In the Althusserian sense, blogs become persuasive mechanisms for a subject's interpellation into non-dominant ideology. Among the plethora of marginalized global communities, African-Americans are enormously embracing the virtual communication trends for socio-political motives. This paper theorizes the correlations between race-related blogging, psychoanalytic sublimation, and the socio-political repudiation of power structure by employing the literary text as material evidence. Accordingly, the literary study has concluded that digital-mediums (i.e., in this case, political blogs) can depose the power vested in the ideologicalstate-apparatuses and impose a high potential for expression of unrestrained, credible, and democratic voice of the marginalized. It also validates that blogs/blogging influences and moulds national/political/racial discourses by lending a liberated voice and context-independent perspective to the racially oppressed.

Using a large sample of adolescents from across the United States, this study examined adolescents' motivations for social distancing, their engagement in social distancing, and their mental and social health.
   Methods: Data were collected on March 29th and 30th, 2020, two weeks after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency in the United States. The sample consisted of 683 adolescents recruited using social media. A series of multiple linear regressions examined unique associations among adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing, perceived amount of social distancing, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness.
   Results: Almost all respondents (98.1%) reported engaging in at least a little social distancing. The most commonly reported motivations for social distancing concerned social responsibility and not wanting others to get sick. Motivations concerning state or city lockdowns, parental rules, and social responsibility were associated with greater social distancing, whereas motivations concerning no alternatives were associated with less social distancing. Specific motivations for social distancing were differentially associated with adolescents' anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness.
   Conclusions: Understanding adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing may inform strategies to increase social distancing engagement, reduce pathogen transmission, and identify individual differences in mental and social health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - This paper considers the direct involvement of students in degree programme curricula design, specifically four computer science teacher students designing new curricula for the Faculty of Information Technology of the University of Jyvaskyla. They participated in a project to make recommendations for the 2017-2020 master's and bachelor's programme curricula. We examined how these recommendations were implemented in the new curricula and what hindered student voice. The project led to major changes: making basic studies in mathematics optional, adding three new courses, and defining new learning goal descriptions for two master's programmes. Several factors hindered student voice: insufficient perceived expertise, doubts about project significance, negative attitudes towards student involvement, and lack of personal interest. Hence, despite the project leading to considerable changes, the students themselves expressed rather critical attitudes towards student involvement in curriculum design. Consequently, promoting student voice in higher education curricula design is a more tensioned phenomenon than has been discussed in earlier research.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant challenges but also unprecedented opportunities for transportation researchers and practitioners. In this article, the major lessons and gaps in knowledge for those working in the transportation sector are identified, including the following: (1) integration between public health and transportation; (2) technology to support contact tracing and tracking of travelers; (3) focus on vulnerable, at-risk operators, patrons, and underserved members of society; (4) re-engineering of travel demand models to support social distancing, quarantine, and public health interventions; (5) challenges with Big Data and information technologies; (6) trust relationships between the general public, government, private sector, and others in disaster management; (7) conflict management during disasters; (8) complexities of transdisciplinary knowledge and engagement; (9) demands for training and education; and (10) transformative change to support community resilience. With a focus on transportation planning and community resilience, the lessons from the pandemic need to be shared and customized for different systems, services, modalities, and users. While many of the interventions during the pandemic have been based on public health, the management, response, recovery, adaptation, and transformation of transportation systems resulting from the crisis require multi-disciplinary, multi-jurisdictional communications and coordination, and resource sharing. Further research to support knowledge to action is needed.

AB  - With the development of science and technology, buying has become much easier. At the same time, however, impulsive buying has many negative consequences for college students, such as dissatisfaction and debt; the causes of impulsive buying should, therefore, be explored urgently. There are numerous empirical studies indicating that social exclusion may be a potential factor of impulsive buying, and the underlying mechanisms of this association remain unclear. In this study, we used the Social Exclusion Scale, Self-Esteem Scale, Risk Preference Scale, and Impulsive Buying Scale, as well as a cross-sectional design to investigate the roles of self-esteem and risk preference in the relationship between social exclusion and impulsive buying among 768 college students (387 were female, M-age = 20.25 years). The results were as follows: (1) when controlling for gender, age, family monthly income, and monthly living expenses, social exclusion significantly and positively predicted impulsive buying; (2) self-esteem played a mediating role between social exclusion and impulsive buying; (3) risk preference moderated the relationship between the second half of the mediating path and the direct path. These results reveal the mechanism underlying impulsive buying in college students, that is, social exclusion will predict the decrease in college students' self-esteem, and low self-esteem will further predict college students' impulsive buying, which is a way for them to gain a sense of self-worth. Relatively low risk preference can well alleviate the negative impact of social exclusion and low self-esteem on impulsive buying. What is more, these results have implications for impulsive buying interventions and preventions. Schools should aim to create a good peer atmosphere by implementing certain rules that help to reduce social exclusion, and parents and education departments should cultivate students' risk awareness to avoid risk behaviors in college students, such as impulsive buying behavior. This study fills the research gap regarding college students' impulsive buying and explores its internal psychological mechanism.

AB  - We examined the association of the combination of direct intergroup contact and mass media news with attitudes toward immigrants and gay people in Italy, hypothesizing that direct intergroup contact would buffer the negative association between media news and attitudes, but only when contact was intimate or positive. Measuring contact variables and attitudes toward immigrants (Study 1, N = 428; Study 2, N = 426) and gay men and women (Study 3, N = 220), we found that intimate and positive direct intergroup contact was associated with more positive attitudes toward outgroup members, whereas exposure to negative news was related to more negative attitudes. Moreover, our results supported the buffering hypothesis, as the negative association between negative news and intergroup attitudes was significantly weaker amongst respondents with higher levels of intimate and positive intergroup contact.

AB  - As COVID-19 spreads across the globe, new technologies are being leveraged to enforce social distancing requirements. I explore social distancing through the theoretical lens of Michel Foucault's biopolitics, with an emphasis on recognizing unauthorized movement and controlling circulation. Although reporting and widely shared data visualizations about COVID-19 have made many people newly aware that their movements are being tracked and surveilled, governments are already implementing new measures such as geofencing and artificial intelligence (AI)-based facial recognition to facilitate the enforcement of social distancing. The tracking of COVID-19 spread and social distancing behaviors of the public has made more visible the practices of biopolitics but also generated new opportunities for even greater surveillance and control. The current moment offers an opportunity to shift public perceptions about data surveillance, technological control, and the racial disparities of biopower, much in the same way that public perceptions around social media shifted during and after the Arab Spring. How we collectively respond to these biopolitical processes will, in part, determine how such power relations are articulated in the future.

AB  - Background. Social distancing and stringent hygiene seem to be effective in reducing the number of transmitted virus particles, and therefore the infectivity, of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and could alter the mode of transmission of the disease. However, it is not known if such practices can change the clinical course in infected individuals.
   Methods. We prospectively studied an outbreak of COVID-19 in Switzerland among a population of 508 predominantly male soldiers with a median age of 21 years. We followed the number of infections in 2 spatially separated cohorts with almost identical baseline characteristics with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) before and after implementation of stringent social distancing.
   Results. Of the 354 soldiers infected prior to the implementation of social distancing, 30% fell ill from COVID-19, while no soldier in a group of 154, in which infections appeared after implementation of social distancing, developed COVID-19 despite the detection of viral RNA in the nasal and virus-specific antibodies within this group.
   Conclusions. Social distancing not only can slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of young, healthy adults but it can also prevent the outbreak of COVID-19 while still inducing an immune response and colonizing nasal passages. Viral inoculum during infection or mode of transmission may be a key factor determining the clinical course of COVID-19.

AB  - As evidenced by research in evolutionary psychology, humans have evolved sophisticated psychological mechanisms tailored to solve enduring adaptive problems of social life. Many of these social problems are political in nature and relate to the distribution of costs and benefits within and between groups. In that sense, evolutionary psychology suggests that humans are, by nature, political animals. By implication, a straightforward application of evolutionary psychology to the study of public opinion seems to entail that modern individuals find politics intrinsically interesting. Yet, as documented by more than fifty years of research in political science, people lack knowledge of basic features of the political process and the ability to form consistent political attitudes. By reviewing and integrating research in evolutionary psychology and public opinion, we describe (1) why modern mass politics often fail to activate evolved mechanisms and (2) the conditions in which these mechanisms are in fact triggered.

AB  - The 2012 election season provided increased opportunities for the collaboration among citizens, new media, and democracy. The social media election saw a rise in online user-generated political content posted to YouTube. These videos, often satirical in nature, were viewed by millions, making the potential impacts from this new form of political communication deserving of inquiry. Using experimental design, this study explored the relationship between user-generated political satire and normative political attitudes. The results revealed that viewing satirical representations of political candidates did not affect individuals' level of political cynicism or political information efficacy; however, perceptions of candidate credibility and favorability were altered.

Study 3 (N = 875) explored lay beliefs about the strength of the relationships between social media use and false consensus effects. Across studies, we found that heavier use of social media was associated with stronger false consensus effects. However, these effects were smaller in magnitude than lay beliefs about these linkages.

AB  - Ghosting and orbiting occur when a relationship is ended unilaterally by suddenly withdrawing from all communication and without explanation. However, in orbiting, the disengager still follows the victims on social networking sites after the breakup. With the advent of the digital era, these practices have become increasingly common, gaining attention from psychology research. Within the theoretical framework of social exclusion, the present study (N = 176) investigated victims' consequences of ghosting and orbiting, considering the two breakup strategies as instances of ostracism. Participants were invited to fill an online survey and randomly assigned to recall an episode of ghosting, orbiting, or rejection. Following the recall task, participants completed a series of questionnaires to measure the typical outcomes threatened by ostracism (i.e., emotions, basic psychological needs, breakup's cognitive evaluation, and aggressive inclinations). The results showed a consistent pattern across most of the constructs measured. Specifically, ghosting led to worse outcomes than rejection, whereas the disengagers' ambiguous signals characterizing orbiting seemed to buffer the victims partially from the consequences of relationship dissolution. Results are discussed in the light of social exclusion literature, adding to the growing research on ghosting.

AB  - Seizures have long been associated with misconceptions and stigma. Exponential growth in Internet use has seen the rapid expansion of social media, such as Twitter, for health promotion. In view of the popularity of Twitter, we sought to explore how seizures are being portrayed on this social networking website and to consider its potential for information dissemination. A 48-hour Twitter search was used as a preliminary data set to determine an appropriate classification scheme of "seizure"-related posts ("tweets"). Analysis was then conducted using "seizure" tweets from a 7-consecutive day sample period. Tweets were analyzed and coded by two independent reviewers. Predominant categories were Metaphorical (32%), Personal Accounts (31%), Informative (12%), and Ridicule/Joke (9%). This study supports the notion that stigmatization associated with seizures continues to flourish, as 41% of "seizure" tweets were derogatory in nature. Although Twitter could be used to disseminate accurate information on seizures and epilepsy, this study suggests that it is currently propagating negative attitudes toward seizures with potential for fueling stigma. In recent years there have been significant advancements in technology offering many new methods of sharing information. Social networking sites allow real-time communication while providing the opportunity for exchange of information and opinions. Twitter, a website launched in 2006, allows users to communicate through "tweets" limited to 140 characters. Twitter's popularity has drastically increased since its inception, with approximately 110 million tweets per day from 200 million users worldwide, as of January 2011 (http://blogs.forbes.com/oliverchiang/2011/01/19/twitter-hits-nearly-200m-users-110m-tweets-per-day-focuses-on-global-expansion/). Such social media facilitate communication about an array of health-related topics including seizures and epilepsy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The current study focuses on a moral dilemma in military situations: the amount of force to be used in order to neutralize a "most wanted" terrorist. This study examines the association between this moral dilemma with 4 independent variables: agreement with the proportionality principle (mediating variable), level of religiosity, authoritarian personality, and political attitudes. Three equal groups of participants (together, N = 357) were included: Israeli regular army combat soldiers, Israeli reserve combat soldiers, and Israeli students. In accordance with the study hypotheses, the 4 independent variables significantly correlated with each other and with moral decisions. Structural equation modeling indicated that agreement with the proportionality principle is the best predictor of moral decision, and mediated the association between level of religiosity and political attitudes and moral decisions.

AB  - This paper tests a meaning-making model of conspiratorial thinking by considering how one's search for meaning mediates between social exclusion and the endorsement of conspiratorial (Study 1) and superstitious (Study 2) beliefs. In Study 1, participants first wrote about a self-selected personal event that involved a social interaction, they then indicated how socially excluded they felt after the event, and, finally, they rated their endorsement of three well-known conspiracy theories. In Study 2, participants were randomly assigned to a Social Inclusion, a Social Exclusion, or a Control condition, after which they indicated the association between improbable events in three scenarios. In addition, both studies mechanistically tested the relation between social exclusion and conspiratorial/superstitious thinking by measuring the participants' tendency to search for meaning. Both Study 1 (correlational) and Study 2 (experimental) offer support for the hypothesis that social exclusion is associated with superstitious/conspiratorial beliefs. One's search for meaning, correlational analyses revealed, mediated this relation. We discuss the implication of the findings for community-wide belief dynamics and we propose that social inclusion could be used to diminish the dissemination of superstitious beliefs and conspiracy theories.

AB  - Across 2 studies, we investigated the ethical consequences of physiological responses to social exclusion. In Study 1, participants who were socially excluded were more likely to engage in unethical behavior to make money and the level of physiological arousal experienced during exclusion-measured using galvanic skin response-mediated the effects of exclusion on unethical behavior. Likewise, in Study 2, results from a sample of supervisor-subordinate dyads revealed a positive relationship between experience of workplace ostracism and unethical behaviors as rated by the immediate supervisors. This relationship was mediated by employees' reports of experienced physiological arousal. Together, the results of these studies demonstrate that physiological arousal accompanies social exclusion and provides an explanatory mechanism for the increased unethical behavior in both samples. Theoretical implications of these findings for research on ethical behavior and social exclusion in the workplace are discussed.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the relationships between self-sacrifice and hope as well as the possible intervening roles of perceived family support and attitudes to aging in this relationship among Chinese older adults. A total of 475 older adults participated in the current study. They completed measures related to self-sacrifice, hope, perceived family support, and attitudes to aging. Attitudes to aging measured the extent to which older adults hold positive and negative attitudes toward aging in three domains of physical change, psychological growth, and psychosocial loss. The results showed that self-sacrifice was positively associated with older adults' hope. Mediation analyses revealed that perceived family support mediated the relationship between self-sacrifice and older adults' hope. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that attitudes to physical change moderated the relationship between self-sacrifice and older adults' hope, and attitudes to psychological growth moderated the relationship between perceived family support and older adults' hope. Specifically, the association between self-sacrifice and hope was stronger for older adults with less positive attitudes to physical change than for those with more positive attitudes to physical change. The association between perceived family support and hope was stronger for older adults with more positive attitudes to psychological growth than for those with less positive attitudes to psychological growth. The findings can contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between self-sacrifice and hope and can aid in designing effective interventions aimed at improving older adults' hope.

AB  - Background: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, health information related to COVID-19 has spread across news media worldwide. Google is among the most used internet search engines, and the Google Trends tool can reflect how the public seeks COVID-19-related health information during the pandemic. Objective: The aim of this study was to understand health communication through Google Trends and news coverage and to explore their relationship with prevention and control of COVID-19 at the early epidemic stage. Methods: To achieve the study objectives, we analyzed the public's information-seeking behaviors on Google and news media coverage on COVID-19. We collected data on COVID-19 news coverage and Google search queries from eight countries (ie, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Singapore, Ireland, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand) between January 1 and April 29, 2020. We depicted the characteristics of the COVID-19 news coverage trends over time, as well as the search query trends for the topics of COVID-19-related "diseases," "treatments and medical resources," "symptoms and signs," and "public measures." The search query trends provided the relative search volume (RSV) as an indicator to represent the popularity of a specific search term in a specific geographic area over time. Also, time-lag correlation analysis was used to further explore the relationship between search terms trends and the number of new daily cases, as well as the relationship between search terms trends and news coverage. Results: Across all search trends in eight countries, almost all search peaks appeared between March and April 2020, and declined in April 2020. Regarding COVID-19-related "diseases," in most countries, the RSV of the term "coronavirus" increased earlier than that of "covid-19"; however, around April 2020, the search volume of the term "covid-19" surpassed that of "coronavirus." Regarding the topic "treatments and medical resources," the most and least searched terms were "mask" and "ventilator," respectively. Regarding the topic "symptoms and signs," "fever" and "cough" were the most searched terms. The RSV for the term "lockdown" was significantly higher than that for "social distancing" under the topic "public health measures." In addition, when combining search trends with news coverage, there were three main patterns: (1) the pattern for Singapore, (2) the pattern for the United States, and (3) the pattern for the other countries. In the time-lag correlation analysis between the RSV for the topic "treatments and medical resources" and the number of new daily cases, the RSV for all countries except Singapore was positively correlated with new daily cases, with a maximum correlation of 0.8 for the United States. In addition, in the time-lag correlation analysis between the overall RSV for the topic "diseases" and the number of daily news items, the overall RSV was positively correlated with the number of daily news items, the maximum correlation coefficient was more than 0.8, and the search behavior occurred 0 to 17 days earlier than the news coverage. Conclusions: Our findings revealed public interest in masks, disease control, and public measures, and revealed the potential value of Google Trends in the face of the emergence of new infectious diseases.
   Also, Google Trends combined with news media can achieve more efficient health communication. Therefore, both news media and Google Trends can contribute to the early prevention and control of epidemics.

AB  - When discussing immigration on the campaign trail in 2016, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump used the term 'bad hombres' to criticise immigrants, and in particular Latino men. Using a novel dataset of images accompanying immigration news stories in three major news magazines from 2000-2010, we examine the extent to which press coverage helped set the stage for this sort of racialised and gendered association. We find overwhelming support for the 'bad hombres' hypothesis, demonstrating that in comparison to the true demographics of immigrants in the U.S., press portrayals significantly over-represent Latino men and under-represent all other immigrant groups. Our results are particularly important in light of research demonstrating that individuals' political attitudes are influenced by the perceived 'target group,' or beneficiary, of a given policy, as well as scholarship demonstrating the media's role in fostering a sense of 'Latino threat.'

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic changed expectations for information dissemination and use around the globe, challenging accepted models of communications, leadership, and social systems. We explore how social media discourse about COVID-19 in Italy was affected by the rapid spread of the virus, and how themes in postings changed with the adoption of social distancing measures and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI). We used topic modeling and social network analysis to highlight critical dimensions of conversations around COVID-19: 1) topics in social media postings about the Coronavirus; 2) the scope and reach of social networks; and 3) changes in social media content as the nation moved from partial to full social distancing. Twitter messages sent in Italy between February 11th and March 10th, 2020. 74,306 Tweets sent by institutions, news sources, elected officials, scientists and social media influencers. Messages were retweeted more than 1.2 million times globally. Non-parametric chi-square statistic with residual analysis to identify categories, chi-square test for linear trend, and Social Network Graphing. The first phase of the pandemic was dominated by social media influencers, followed by a focus on the economic consequences of the virus and placing blame on immigrants. As the crisis deepened, science-based themes began to predominate, with a focus on reducing the spread of the virus through physical distancing and business closures Our findings highlight the importance of messaging in social media in gaining the public's trust and engagement during a pandemic. This requires credible scientific voices to garner public support for effective mitigation. Fighting the spread of an infectious disease goes hand in hand with stemming the dissemination of lies, bad science, and misdirection.

T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Objective: Social distancing policies are key in curtailing severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread, but their effectiveness is heavily contingent on public understanding and collective adherence. We studied public perception of social distancing through organic, large-scale discussion on Twitter.
   Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study.
   Methods: Between March 27 and April 10, 2020, we retrieved English-only tweets matching two trending social distancing hashtags, #socialdistancing and #stayathome. We analyzed the tweets using natural language processing and machine-learning models, and we conducted a sentiment analysis to identify emotions and polarity. We evaluated the subjectivity of tweets and estimated the frequency of discussion of social distancing rules. We then identified clusters of discussion using topic modeling and associated sentiments.
   Results: We studied a sample of 574,903 tweets. For both hashtags, polarity was positive (mean, 0.148; SD, 0.290); only 15% of tweets had negative polarity. Tweets were more likely to be objective (median, 0.40; IQR, 0-0.6) with similar to 30% of tweets labeled as completely objective (labeled as 0 in range from 0 to 1). Approximately half of tweets (50.4%) primarily expressed joy and one-fifth expressed fear and surprise. Each correlated well with topic clusters identified by frequency including leisure and community support (ie, joy), concerns about food insecurity and quarantine effects (ie, fear), and unpredictability of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its implications (ie, surprise).
   Conclusions: Considering the positive sentiment, preponderance of objective tweets, and topics supporting coping mechanisms, we concluded that Twitter users generally supported social distancing in the early stages of their implementation.

AB  - Social exclusion is a potent elicitor of distress. Previous studies have shown that medial frontal theta oscillations are modulated by the experience of social exclusion. Using the Cyberball paradigm, we examined event-related dynamics of theta power in the EEG at medial frontal sites while children aged 8-12 years were exposed to conditions of fair play and social exclusion. Using an event-related design, we found that medial frontal theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) increase during both early (i.e., 200-400ms) and late (i.e., 400-800ms) processing of rejection events during social exclusion relative to perceptually identical "not my turn" events during inclusion. Importantly, we show that only for the later time window (400-800 ms) slow-wave theta power tracks self-reported ostracism distress. Specifically, greater theta power at medial frontal sites to "rejection" events predicted higher levels of ostracism distress. Alpha and beta oscillations for rejection events were unrelated to ostracism distress at either 200-400 ms or 400-800 ms time windows. Our findings extend previous studies by showing that medial frontal theta oscillations for rejection events are a neural signature of social exclusion, linked to experienced distress in middle childhood.

AB  - We document how prior experiences with racism, sequentially mediated by co-rumination about racial problems with a friend and thought intrusions, are associated with negative reactions to a racially charged eventthe fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman and the subsequent trial and acquittal of Mr. Zimmerman. African Americans' prior experiences with racial discrimination predicted more co-rumination about racial problems with a friend. In turn, co-rumination was associated with more thought intrusions about the trial, leading to more negative affect and less forgiveness for Zimmerman. Co-rumination about racism and worrisome thinking about high-profile race-related events may amplify concern about racism for a frequent target of racial discrimination, lowering the threshold for negative psychological reactions to racist acts (including acts of violence) that may happen to other African Americans or to oneself.

AB  - As the pace of modern life accelerates, social exclusion occurs more and more frequently in interpersonal interactions. The type of social exclusion can lead to different psychological needs of individuals, and, thus, affects the tendency of word-of-mouth (WOM) recommendation. There are three experiments in this research. Experiment 1 explores the influence of social exclusion types on the willingness of WOM recommendation. The result shows that being rejected increases individuals' willingness to WOM recommendations while being ignored decreases individuals' willingness. Experiment 2 explores the internal psychological mechanism of the influence of social exclusion types on WOM recommendation behavior and proves the mediating role of psychological needs (affiliative-focused needs; power/provocation need). In experiment 3, the moderating effect of product attributes (scarcity/popularity) on the main effect is analyzed. This research is the first to explore the influence of social exclusion types on individuals' willingness to WOM recommendations, which enriches the research on social exclusion in the field of WOM recommendations.

AB  - Background: Young adults are at risk for HIV/STIs because they generally have an active sex life with multiple sexual partners; moreover, they use condoms to a lesser extent. Travelling increases sexually risky behaviour, and among both women and men, sexual contacts abroad are common. Better knowledge of how young adults experience prevention efforts prior to travelling, and what they prefer, is important when planning prevention efforts to this group. Experiences of and attitudes towards prevention efforts against HIV/STI among young adults in Sweden who have travelled abroad were investigated.
   Method: We conducted 12 focus-group interviews and four individual interviews with young adults (20-29 years) who had travelled abroad within the last 12 months. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using thematic content analysis. Results were discussed from a salutogenic perspective.
   Results: Only a few had any experience of prevention efforts against HIV/STIs. The majority welcomed the idea of prevention efforts prior to travelling and would have welcomed more, preferably short reminders or links to reliable websites, or someone professional to discuss the issue with. Most of the young adults would use the Internet to search for information. They proposed the possibility of reaching young adults through social media, and the importance of better basic knowledge in school.
   Conclusion: It is difficult to reach young adults before their trips abroad. Prevention efforts on HIV/STI must therefore focus on the use of established forums. Setting the foundation for a positive attitude towards condom use is needed during school years. Even social media, where there is the possibility for dialogue, should be used as an information source.

AB  - Immigrant Chinese Americans made the recent polling news by being the least racially tolerant in comparison to other Asian American groups over redistributive issues such as college admissions. Rather than treating Chinese immigrants as of monolithic interests and ultimately unassimilable, this study seeks to provide a more nuanced understanding of the contours and sources of their racial attitudes and beliefs. How do new immigrants from China think of issues of race, race relations, and notions of racial equality and justice in multiracial America? What explains their patterns of racial attitudes and opinions especially the controversial issue of race-based college admissions? These are the main research questions we asked through semistructured interviews conducted in Mandarin of 15 undergraduate students from China studying in STEM, social sciences, and humanities in a public research university on the West Coast. We hypothesize that the formation of racial attitudes of U.S. undergraduate students from China is influenced by their own upbringing in China as well as personal experiences of discrimination, local school context, interracial contacts, media exposure, and classroom learning of U.S. racial history on both sides of the Pacific. These experiences, in turn, help structure their perceptions of the dominant ideology, racial beliefs, and race-based policy preferences in the host society of the United States. Our findings confirm prior research on racial learning but also offer new insights on the contours and sources of racial policy opinion on affirmative action in college admissions.

AB  - The eligibility of COVID-19 vaccines has been expanded to children aged 12 and above in several countries including Japan, and there is a plan to further lower the age. This study aimed to assess factors related to parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. A nationwide internet-based cross-sectional study was conducted between May 25 and June 3, 2021 in Japan. The target population was parents of children aged 3-14 years who resided in Japan, and agreed to answer the online questionnaire. Parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (their intention to vaccinate their child) and related factors were analyzed using logistic regression models. Interaction effects of gender of parents and their level of social relationship satisfaction related to parental vaccine hesitancy was tested using log likelihood ratio test (LRT). Social media as the most trusted information source increased parental vaccine hesitancy compared to those who trusted official information (Adjusted Odds Ratio: aOR 2.80, 95% CI 1.53-5.12). Being a mother and low perceived risk of infection also increased parental vaccine hesitancy compared to father (aOR 2.43, 95% CI 1.57-3.74) and those with higher perceived risk of infection (aOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.04-2.32) respectively. People with lower satisfaction to social relationships tended to be more hesitant to vaccinate their child among mothers in contrast to fathers who showed constant intention to vaccinate their child regardless of the level of satisfaction to social relationship (LRT p = 0.021). Our findings suggest that dissemination of targeted information about COVID-19 vaccine by considering means of communication, gender and people who are isolated during measures of social distancing may help to increase parental vaccine acceptance.

AB  - The rapid development of information and communication technologies has demonstrated their potential to enable people with physical disabilities (PPD) to improve their livelihoods and reduce social exclusion in China. Only a few studies have been conducted to investigate how online social support boosts PPD's sense of belonging and to determine which type of social support they need. We followed the sense of belonging theory and social support theory to review the related literature and understand the mechanisms by which PPD may use mobile applications to receive support in the online environment. Both personal interviews and questionnaire surveys were conducted. We collected data from 337 PPD from the China Disabled Person's Federation. Results of the statistical analysis revealed that both emotional and informational support are significantly related to sense of belonging. Furthermore, sense of belonging affects social connection and social well-being. The results of the moderation analysis showed female and male PPD received different kinds of support. The findings offer insights for disability service institutions interested in better enablement of PPD.

AB  - This article draws on race relations arguments to explore the nexus between the media, race, and protest policing. The media's coverage of Black Lives Matter (BLM) and protests opposing COVID-19 restrictions bring to light differences in police intervention at these events. How the media portrays this apparent imbalance is the focus of the current study. Using news reports from major U.S. outlets (e.g., New York Times, Washington Post), we find that protests anchored to racial justice issues are more often framed as a threat to the public interests. Our results highlight the media's role in promoting notions of racial threat and exacerbating state repression. We discuss the implications of these findings for constitutional rights, social control, and journalism.

AB  - The uptake of mobile media with internet connection has increased rapidly in almost every part of the world, and this has significantly changed how public transport passengers use their travel time. Studies have documented that use of mobile information and communication technologies (ICT) while traveling has the potential to enrich use of travel time and in some cases, strengthen positive attitudes towards public transport. The alternative hypothesisthat mobile communication technologies make travelers more critical and demanding, e.g., due to the risk of interferencehas so far hardly been explored through empirical studies. Based on a web-based survey of travelers in two of the largest cities in Norway (Oslo and Trondheim), this paper investigates how use of smart devices are related to general attitudes toward public transportation services. A segmentation of travelers in three clusters based on their mobile use habits, shows that the most active group of mobile media usersa group of younger and middle-aged urban dwellerswere those who bore the most critical attitudes to the public transport services. In contrast, the groups that used their mobile phones rarely, or less actively, on their public transport trips were more satisfied. The findings suggests that a new generation of equipped travelers has developed expectations regarding their public transport journeys that service providers might have problems to fulfill in current times. Thus, there is a risk of the most active smartphone users developing negative attitudes to public transport if (or when) their experiences are not improved.

AB  - Information and communication technologies (ICT) are being used more and more as part of teaching processes in both formal and informal settings. In this regard, it is important to understand university students' attitudes towards using ICT as they will shortly form part of the productive sector of society. The aim of this study was to analyze student attitudes during their final years pursuing various degrees at a university in Costa Rica. We used a non-experimental transactional design and probabilistic sampling that involved 1187 students. We used a questionnaire containing a Likert-type scales to measure attitudes, which was structured according to affective, cognitive, and behavioral components. The results showed positive attitudes in general, with higher scores in the cognitive and behavioral components, and moderate scores in the affective component. In addition, we found differences in attitudes according to sex, prior training in technology, and academic performance.

KW  - Drama projects
KW  - Holistic learning

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study is to address the situation that although the theoretical benefits of using drama projects in the Teaching of English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) have been described in a number of studies, researchers have identified a lack of literature on their practical use, particularly in terms of different institutional settings, teaching styles, learning styles and proficiency levels. This paper therefore describes three case studies in universities in Korea, showing that the use of drama projects can be successfully used in different teaching situations and is an effective means of promoting meaningful language learning in students often demotivated by traditional methods and the test-driven classroom.
   Design/methodology/approach - In these adult-learner EFL settings, a process approach to drama projects aimed to promote meaningful language acquisition and holistic learning in students of different proficiencies and majors. Drama projects were used as: syllabus supplementation by an individual teacher in a Korean-mediated English program (Case Study 1); core content on an English-mediated pre-service teacher training course (Case Study 2); and syllabus content on a Freshman English program taught by 25 native-speaking instructors (Case Study 3). Data were collected from pre/post-course questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and students' evaluations. These were then triangulated to identify trends in participant perceptions.
   Findings - Results indicated positive attitude change and promotion of cognition, positive affect and social skills in all three case studies, confirming earlier research findings and showing that the drama project is a viable and effective educational tool for the foreign language teacher, from individual syllabus supplementation to incorporation into a language program curriculum. Rather than resisting the innovation presented by drama projects, the adult learners involved welcomed the opportunities for creativity, autonomy, group work and performance.
   Originality/value - The practical confirmation of the theoretical benefits of EFL drama projects across individual and institutional settings indicates the potential value of including them in university language programs and teacher-training EFL curricula, enabling and encouraging language teachers to promote holistic, meaningful language learning.

AB  - Choosing a larger-later reward over a smaller-sooner reward may be thought of as altruism toward one's future self. A question that arises in this connection is: What is the relation between delay and social discounting? To begin to answer this question, social and delay discount functions need to be comparable. Delay is ordinarily measured on a ratio scale (time), which allows for meaningful division and addition. Social distance is ordinarily measured on an ordinal scale (rank order of social closeness). To convert social distance to a ratio scale we use a psychophysical distance function obtained via magnitude estimation (Stevens, 1956). The distance functions obtained are well described by a power function (median exponent = 1.9); we show how they may be used to rescale ordinal to ratio social discount functions.

AB  - Objective This article explores whether there are different consequences from Internet use-in the form of changed political attitudes-for older Chinese as compared to their younger counterparts. Methods Using data from a nationwide representative survey of Chinese adults, analyses include both cross-tabulation and multiple regression. Results It is found that millennials are more open to political change than are older Chinese, that older Internet users-as compared to older nonusers-have attitudes more similar to those of millennials, and that differences in attitudes are greater between older users and nonusers than between millennial users and nonusers. Conclusion The findings support the conclusion that Internet use has had greater consequences for changed political attitudes for older Chinese than for their younger counterparts.

AB  - The study integrates social-psychological and educational research to examine the relations between preservice teachers' race-related perceptions of Black students and the instructional approaches they endorse. Based on survey and race Implicit Association Test data from preservice teachers (N = 258; White = 82%) in the United States, we predicted that the association between motivation to be unprejudiced and motivation to appear unprejudiced would predict endorsement of culturally and motivationally supportive instructional practices via implicit and explicit biases about Black students. Path analyses revealed significant mediated associations among motivation to be unprejudiced and endorsed instructional approaches and practices via explicit bias, contingent on the motivation to appear unprejudiced. Furthermore, it is troubling to note that White preservice teachers, in contrast to their ethnic minority counterparts, displayed significant implicit preference for White over Black students. Implications of these findings for preparing a culturally responsive and motivational supportive teaching task-force are discussed.

AB  - Background: England's Time to Change programme to reduce mental health-related stigma and discrimination included a social marketing campaign using traditional and social media, and targeted middle-income groups aged 25-45 between 2009 and 2016. From 2017, the same age group on low to middle incomes were targeted, and the content focused on men's mental health, by changing the advertising and adapting the 'key messages'. This study investigates changes in stigma-related public knowledge, attitudes and desire for social distance in England since Time to Change began in 2008-19 and for 2017-19. Methods: Using data from a face-to-face survey of a nationally representative quota sample of adults for England, we evaluated longitudinal trends in outcomes with regression analyses and made assumptions based on a simple random sample. The pre-existing survey used a measure of attitudes; measures of knowledge and desire for social distance were added in 2009. Results: Reported in standard deviation units (95% CI), the improvement for knowledge for 2009-19 was 0.25 (0.19, 0.32); for attitudes, 2008-19, 0.32 (0.26, 0.39) and for desire for social distance, 2009-19 0.29 (0.23, 0.36). Significant interactions between year and both region and age suggest greater improvements in London, where stigma is higher, and narrowing of age differences. There were significant improvements between 2017 and 2019 in knowledge [0.09 (0.02, 0.16)] and attitudes [0.08 (0.02, 0.14)] but not social distance. Conclusion: The positive changes support the effectiveness of Time to Change but cannot be definitively attributed to it. Inequalities in stigma by demographic characteristics present targets for research and intervention.

KW  - EXTENDED CONTACT
KW  - IDENTITY
AB  - Can a soap opera influence political attitudes and engagement among U.S. Latinos, particularly those perceiving a threat from immigration legislation? The extended contact hypothesis predicts that ingroup fictional characters can encourage positive affect and attitudes toward real-world groups and issues with which they are associated. We tested the impact of a Telemundo soap opera, Mas Sabe El Diablo, which portrayed a Latino character's involvement with the 2010 Census. During the census-collection period and directly following the passage of Arizona's Senate Bill 1070 immigration act, we randomly assigned Latino participants in Arizona, Texas, and New Jersey to view (1) pro-census scenes or (2) control scenes featuring the character but not the census. Compared to control viewers, census viewers expressed more positive attitudes and less negative affect toward the U.S. government and more behavioral support for the census (wearing pro-census stickers and taking informational flyers). Affinity for the character was associated with stronger effects. The soap opera did not positively influence Arizona participants who were directly affected by SB 1070.

AB  - This experiment explores the effects of a role-playing videogame on participants' attitudes toward Israelis and Palestinians. Participants (N = 172) were randomly assigned to the role of either an Israeli or a Palestinian leader in PeaceMaker, a videogame simulation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Participants' explicit and implicit attitudes toward both groups were assessed before and after a 20-minute gameplay experience. Results showed that gameplay changed participants' explicit stereotypes of the two national groups in a role-congruent fashion. Participants assigned to play the role of the Palestinian President or the Israeli Prime Minister negatively changed their evaluations of the opposing national group. Moreover, implicit bias moderated stereotype change. Results are discussed within the framework of self-persuasion and an associative-proposition evaluation model of attitude change.

AB  - Previous research has revealed that self-persuasion can occur either through role-playing (i.e., when arguments are generated to convince another person) or, more directly, through trying to convince oneself (i.e., when arguments are generated with oneself as the target). Combining these 2 traditions in the domain of attitude change, the present research investigated the impact on self-persuasion of the specific target of one's own persuasive attempt (i.e., others vs. oneself). We found that the efficacy of self-persuasion depended on whether people believed that they would have to put more or less effort in convincing the self or others. Specifically, we found opposite effects for self-generated arguments depending on whether the topic of persuasion was proattitudinal or counterattitudinal. Across 4 studies, it was shown that when the topic of the message was counterattitudinal, people were more effective in convincing themselves when the intended target of the arguments was themselves versus another person. However, the opposite was the case when the topic was proattitudinal. These effects were shown to stem from the differential effort perceived as necessary and actually exerted in trying to produce persuasion under these conditions.

AB  - The ageing of the national population along with the rapid diffusion of technological innovations necessitate it to turn our attention to the significance of considering the adoption of technology by the Indian elderly. The impact of social distancing and the role of technology on the everyday lives of the older people during the pandemic remain under-researched. The public health crisis created by COVID-19 has deepened the roots of digital divide by digitally marginalizing older people especially in the developing nations who often lack awareness, access and training to use technology. This study captures the success stories, ordeals or challenges faced by the older people in coping with social distancing measures through the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Results of the qualitative in-depth interviews conducted on 30 professionals aged at least 60 years, residing in a metropolitan city in eastern India show that as the participants feel isolated, they reconfigure their traditional norms of face-to-face social interaction and rely upon their touchscreens and keyboards to continue everyday interaction, to work from home, access information and avail 'essential services'. Apart from focusing on their impetus to adopt ICT, the study highlights the blocks in active usage of ICT namely attitudinal barriers, prior negative experience, concerns over cyber security, complicated technical instructions and lack of supportive learning environment. In order to create a technologically inclusive society for the older people, it is essential to cater to their unique needs and design elderly friendly technologies.

AB  - In the context of social exclusion and pro-social or pro-environmental behaviors, past research has yielded inconclusive results. This study extended the theory of planned behavior (TPB) by including green self-identity (GSI) as a boundary condition to check the impact of social exclusion on green product consumption intentions through TPB's components. This study collected data from 476 respondents through online questionnaires. Structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was applied to test the proposed model. Green product attitudes, subjective norms about green products, and perceived behavioral control (PBC) were significantly predicted by social exclusion. Our results also reveal that TPB's components play an interceding role between social exclusion and green product consumption intentions. Moreover, regarding boundary conditions of GSI, the interaction between social exclusion and GSI was significant for green product attitudes and subjective norms about green products; however, it was not significant for PBC. Furthermore, the results of moderated mediation revealed that green self-identity moderated the indirect effects of social exclusion on green product consumption intentions through green product attitude and social norms about green products. Moreover, these effects were not significant in the case of PBC. This study has several implications for organizations and policymakers in the context of social exclusion and green product consumption.

The study sample consisted of 151 preservice IT teachers who took an elective course including a Scratch module in the 2013-14 academic year. Three online questionnaires (Personal Information Questionnaire, The Computer Programming Self-Efficacy Scale and The Computer Programming Learning Attitude Scale) were used to gather the quantitative data and focus group interviews were conducted to collect the qualitative data regarding the preservice IT teachers' views in more detail. According to the results, there were significant increases in the mean of the preservice IT teachers' self-efficacy perceptions regarding almost all complex programming tasks after their Scratch programming experience. The results also showed that the preservice IT teachers' negative attitudes towards programming decreased significantly and programming in the Scratch platform had significantly positive effects on the preservice IT teachers' attitudes regarding some items in the scale.

AB  - Data from the 1996 and 2006 General Social Survey were analyzed to examine the relationship between the desire for social distance from individuals with mental illness and a number of factors that were thought to contribute to it, including perceptions of mental illness and dangerousness. Random samples of participants were assigned to one of four experimental conditions, in which they were read a vignette describing a character who presented with alcoholism, depression, schizophrenia, or minor problems. The desire for social distance from characters whose presenting problems were alcoholism or depression was significantly lower in 2006 than in 1996. The participants' perceptions that the character was mentally ill and/or dangerous to others partially mediated the association between presenting problem and social distance. Participants who were younger, white, better educated, and attended religious services more often required less social distance from the vignette characters than did their counterparts.

AB  - Introduction: Biobanking is a relatively new concept in the Arab region. Targeting different stakeholders to introduce the concept of biobanking and develop an acceptance of it among them is important for the growth of biobanking in the region. Undergraduate students of life sciences represent an important segment of stakeholders, since they constitute potential future biobank customers. Limited funding, lack of awareness of the existence of the term biobanking itself among these students, and questions regarding best marketing strategies presented challenges to planning for the most effective message delivery to this target group. Methods: A specific course was designed for undergraduate students of life sciences, which was conducted at the Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt. The course was conducted twice in 2016 and included lectures covering biobanking, quality, ethics, information technology, and translational research. Facebook and word-of-mouth were used for marketing and advertising. Results: A total number of 125 participants attended both courses cumulatively. Facebook appeared to have been an effective marketing outlet, especially when paid advertisements were used. Evaluation of knowledge, measured using a pretest and posttest, demonstrated some improvement in knowledge of participants. Evaluation forms filled after the course showed positive attitude toward content and message delivery by a majority of participants. Facebook was also used as an evaluation method through analysis of engagement with posts created after course completion. Conclusions: Biobanking education can be carried out effectively with limited resources. Understanding the needs of the target group and using appropriate methods of communication are essential prerequisites to a well-tailored curriculum and effective message delivery. Using Facebook appears to be an effective and affordable method of communication and advertising. Targeting undergraduate students of life sciences interested in research is a good investment and can be very effective in increasing awareness about biobanking inside the research community.

AB  - The changes in teaching due to COVID-19-related restraints generated distress among teachers, putting their job-related efficacy and satisfaction at risk. This study deepens the community-related protective and risk factors in teachers' experience. An online questionnaire detecting social distancing burnout, job-related distress experience, efficacy and satisfaction, and Sense of Community (SoC) was administered to 307 Italian teachers. A multiple mediation model was tested with Structural Equation Modeling. Evidence showed that social distancing burnout could increase teachers' distress rates and, through them, impact their job-related efficacy and satisfaction; however, its effects on the latter depended on the kind of distress mediating. Conversely, SoC could support their job-related efficacy and satisfaction, yet no association with their distress rates emerged. The role of social distancing and Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs)-related distress as the main threats for teachers stems, along with the one of job distress and the community of belonging as assets on which teachers relied.

   In this study, we tested the effectiveness of a multicomponent sports-based program aimed at promoting early intervention, help seeking, and resilience among a sample of adolescent male sport participants. Methods
   The Ahead of the Game program comprised four intervention components and a messaging campaign. Two components targeted mental health literacy, intentions to seek and provide help, and resilience among adolescent boys. A mental health literacy program for parents and a coach education program to assist in the support of athletes' psychological needs were also included. We evaluated the program using a nonrandomized controlled trial matching two regional communities. In total, 350 sport participants (mean, 14.53 yr) were included in an intervention group, whereas 466 (mean, 14.66 yr) received usual practice in a matched control community. One hundred and eighty parents or caregivers and eight coaches also participated in the intervention components. Between-group mean differences on the primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed models, adjusted for clustering at club level, participant age, and socioeconomic status. Results
   Significant positive group-time interactions were found for the primary outcomes of depression and anxiety literacy, intentions to seek help from formal sources, confidence to seek mental health information, and resilience. We also found a significant positive group-time interaction for the secondary outcome of well-being. There were no group-time interactions for social distance (stigma), intentions to seek help from informal sources, implicit beliefs about adversity, perceived familial support, or psychological distress. Conclusions
   Given the high rates of sport participation worldwide and the increasing focus on mental health in this domain, translation and dissemination of the program may be warranted after replication.

AB  - For many individuals, the media function as a primary source of information about preventative measures to combat COVID-19. However, a considerable number of citizens believe that the media coverage about pandemics is exaggerated. Although the perception of media exaggeration may be highly consequential for individual health behaviors, we lack research on the drivers and consequences of this perception. In a two-wave panel study, we examined associations between trust in science, perceptions of media exaggeration about COVID-19, and social distancing behavior during the lockdown in Austria (N-T2 = 416). Results showed that trust in science at T1 led to less perceptions of media exaggeration about COVID-19 at T2. Furthermore, consistent with the theory of psychological reactance, perceptions of media exaggeration about COVID-19 at T1 caused less social distancing behavior at T2. Thus, findings suggest that trust in science may positively affect individuals' social distancing behavior by decreasing perceived media exaggeration about COVID-19 over time. Implications for research on media effects in times of COVID-19 and conclusions for journalists are discussed.

AB  - This research explored how perceived homophily and reverence of consumers bridge the gap between endorser characteristics and consumer-celebrity para-social interaction (PSI). Online surveys were utilized to collect data from consumers. The results based on structural equation modeling showed that the perceived attractiveness and expertise of a celebrity were separately antecedent to the perceived homophily and reverence of consumers for the celebrity. This in turn allowed consumers to build PSI with the celebrity and led to a positive attitude toward the celebrity-endorsed brand. No differences were found between non-fans and fans of the selected celebrity regarding the confirmed path from celebrity characteristics to consumer brand attitude via PSI and its influencing factors. This work highlighted the significance of consumer-celebrity relations for endorsement effectiveness through proving consumer-celebrity PSI and its drivers as indispensable steps in the endorsement process.

AB  - The use of social networking sites (SNSs) has increased exponentially, especially among adolescents. While parents use SNS more than the general population of adults, very little is known about parents' of adolescents behaviors in a social networking environment. Guided by a uses and gratification perspective, the purpose of this study was to examine parents' of adolescents (N = 649) use of SNSs to monitor and connect with their children's life. Analyses revealed that parents of adolescents used SNSs for parenting more often than other online social activities such as instant messaging, Skype, chat rooms, or blogging. The top two reasons for using SNSs were to communicate with children and extended family. Hierarchical logistic regression results indicated that parents of adolescents who used a greater number of SNS activities were more likely to use SNSs to communicate with their children, their children's friends, and the parents of their children's friends. Those parents who had positive attitudes toward technology were more likely to use SNSs to communicate with their children's friends but less likely to communicate with parents of their children's friends. Parents of older adolescents were more likely to use SNSs to communicate with their children. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between media using habits, frequency and duration, and body mass index on eating attitudes.
   Material and Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted with female students who received nutrition and dietetics education in Istanbul. A questionnaire consisting of a socio-demographic questionnaire, Eating Attitude Test (EAT-40), and Social Media Attitude Scale was applied to 1248 female volunteers by the face-to-face interview method.
   Results: It was found that 35.7% of the participants had abnormal eating attitudes and 89.6% showed a positive attitude towards social media. 93.7% of the group with abnormal eating attitudes indicated a positive attitude towards social media, 0.4% had a negative attitude and the difference was statistically significant (p=0.001). It was observed that a significant difference between EAT-40 and thought of an eating problem, having a social media membership, and spending time on social media (p<0.05).
   Conclusions: Social media have an effect on nutrition dietetics students on abnormal eating attitude; it did not show a significant effect on BMI.

AB  - This research adds to the growing body of literature on the role of celebrities as emergent spokespersons in climate advocacy using Twitter. This study investigates the effects of framing of celebrities' messages (emotional framing and framing of celebrity involvement) on public attitudes and behaviors to address climate change. A sequential mediation process is examined with structural equation modeling. In addition, this study assesses the role of parasocial relationship (PSR) with celebrities as predictors and moderators of the impact of framing of celebrity involvement. The results indicate that fear appeals were more effective than hope appeals in driving participation in activism, but emotional framing did not affect any other variables. Framing of celebrity involvement appeals using first-person pronouns led to more positive attitudes, but had no effect on behaviors. In addition, PSR was a strong positive predictor of attitudes and behaviors.

AB  - Background: Effective leadership and change management are thought to contribute to the successful implementation of health information technology innovations. However, limited attention has been paid to the role of frontline leaders in building health professional support for new technical innovations.
   Objective: First, we examined whether frontline leaders' positive expectations of a patient portal and perceptions of its implementation were associated with their support for the portal. Second, we explored whether leaders' positive perceptions influenced the same unit's health professional support for the portal.
   Methods: Data were collected through an online survey of 2067 health professionals and 401 frontline leaders working in 44 units from 14 health organizations in Finland. The participating organizations run a joint self-care and digital value services project developing a new patient portal for self-management. The survey was conducted before the piloting and implementation of the patient portal.
   Results: The frontline leaders' perception of vision clarity had the strongest association with their own support for the portal (beta=.40, P<.001). Results also showed an association between leaders' view of organizational readiness and their support (ss=.15, P=.04). The leaders' positive perceptions of the quality of informing about the patient portal was associated with both leaders' own (beta=.16, P=.02) and subordinate health professionals' support for the portal (beta=.08, P<. 001). Furthermore, professional participation in the planning of the portal was positively associated with their support (beta=.57, P<.001).
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that assuring good informing, communicating a clear vision to frontline leaders, and acknowledging organizational readiness for change can increase health professional support for electronic health (eHealth) services in the pre-implementation phase. Results highlight the role of frontline leaders in engaging professionals in the planning and implementation of eHealth services and in building health professionals' positive attitudes toward the implementation of eHealth services.

AB  - Being excluded and ignored has been shown to threaten fundamental human needs and cause pain. Such reflexive reactions to social exclusion have been conceptualized as direct and unmoderated (temporal need threat model of ostracism). Here, we propose an extension and argue that reflexive reactions depend on how social exclusion situations are construed. If being excluded is understood as a violation of an inclusion norm, individuals will react with pain and threat. In contrast, if being excluded is consistent with the prevailing norm, the exclusion situation is interpreted as less threatening, and negative reflexive reactions to ostracism should be attenuated. Four studies empirically support this conceptual model. Studies 3 and 4 further show that to guide situated construal, the norm has to be endorsed by the individual. In both Studies 1 and 3, the effect of the norm is mediated by the objective situation's subjective construal.

AB  - The desire for social distance towards individuals with obesity as part of the stigmatization process has not been investigated. The aims of this study include: (a) determining the prevalence of social distance and its domains in a population-based sample; (b) reporting levels of emotional response; and (c) investigating the association of BMI, emotional response and social distance. The data were derived from a large population based telephone survey in Germany (total n = 3,003, this sub-sample n 1008). Emotional response to individuals with obesity was assessed for the emotions discomfort, pity, insecurity, amusement, sympathy, help and incomprehension (5-point Liken scale). Social distance was measured on a 5-point Likert scale covering different areas of social interaction. This served as the dependent variable for a linear regression model and mediation models that included BMI and emotional response. Social distance was highest for job recommendation, introduction to a friend, someone with obesity marrying into the family and renting out a room. Means of emotional responses were highest for pity (Mean = 2.58), sympathy (Mean = 2.87) and wanting to help (M = 2.76). In regression analyses, incomprehension (b = 1.095, p < 0.001) and sympathy (b = 0.833, p < 0.001) and the respondents' own BMI (b = 0.145, p < 0.001) were significantly associated to the overall amount of social distance. Mediation models revealed a significant mediation effect of BMI through sympathy (b = 0.229, % of total effect through mediation = 10.3%) and through incomprehension (b = 0.057, % of total effect through mediation = 27.5%) on social distance.
   Social distance towards individuals with obesity is prevalent in the general public in Germany and it is associated with emotional responses. Altering the emotional responses may, therefore, be a starting point in anti-stigma interventions. Evoking sympathy and lowering incomprehension may result in lower overall social distance.

AB  - Methods of communications and the nature of messaging are critically important in influencing public behavior. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in major disruptions to all aspects of life globally and has triggered multiple approaches of health messaging to the general public to communicate COVID-19 preventative measures. This study aimed to identify: (1) differences between age groups in the main avenues used by people to obtain COVID-19 related information; and (2) whether age and information sources were associated with correct interpretation of government messaging relating to how people understand or interpret the terms "self-isolation" and "social distancing." An online survey was conducted in 2020. Participants were aged over 18 years and grouped into age group decades. Differences in sources of COVID-19 information were compared visually between age groups. Logistic regression was used to determine whether age and each of the various methods of communication of COVID-19 information were independently associated with correct response to the self-isolation, or the social distancing statements. There were 3,300 survey respondents 85% female; age sub-groups: 18-29 (7.4%); 30-39 (10.6%); 40-49 (17.6%); 50-59 (22.9%); 60-69 (25.9%); 70-79 (13.9%); and 80+ (1.7%). People accessed public health messaging information from a wide variety of sources that changed as they aged (e.g., older people were more likely to be exposed to COVID-19 information via television news programs and less likely via social media platforms). Age was frequently associated with whether the message key terms were interpreted correctly or incorrectly, but in some cases, it promoted more correct responses whereas in others, fewer correct responses. There was no difference between being exposed to COVID-19 information via mainstream media, compared with social media, or compared with Government sources of information, in terms of whether COVID-19 messages were interpreted correctly. In order to improve future public health messaging, there is a need for multiple avenues of communication to meet the needs and preferences across and within age groups. Further investigation is warranted into the clarity of the content and method of delivery of public health messages, to ensure optimal understanding of public health messages by vulnerable populations and across the community.

AB  - Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is highly prevalent in adolescence and has been suggested as an autonomous diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5). Social rejection is as potential risk factor for NSSI and depression in adolescence. Objectives of this study were to identify differences in neural processing of social rejection in depressed adolescents with and without co-morbid NSSI and healthy controls. Participants were 28 depressed adolescents (14 with co-morbid NSSI, 79% females) and 15 healthy controls, with an average age of 15.2 years (SD = 1.8). Social exclusion was implemented using the Cyberball paradigm 'Cyberball' during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). All participants reported feelings of social exclusion after fMRI scanning. Investigating the effects of NSSI, we found that depressed adolescents with NSSI showed relatively enhanced activation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vIPFC) compared to depressed adolescents without NSSI and also compared to healthy controls. Results point towards divergent processing of social exclusion in depressed adolescents with NSSI as compared to adolescents with mere depression in brain regions previously related to the processing of social exclusion. This finding of distinct neurophysiological responses may stimulate further research on individual treatment approaches. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Applying logic from both the model of intuitive morality and exemplars and construal level theory, we examined the impact of baseline moral intuition salience and social distance on the moral judgment of a narrative character confronted with a moral dilemma. After completing a measure of baseline intuition salience, participants in an experiment first read an article about a fighter pilot who shot down a plane and then judged the pilot's actions as morally right or wrong. The article indicated that the plane had been hijacked by a terrorist who wanted to let it crash into a nearby stadium, and that the pilot shot down the plane to save the spectators in the stadium. Participants were randomly assigned to read the article either as if they were the pilot (social distance low) or as objectively as possible (social distance high). Results showed that baseline intuition salience and social distance interacted in determining moral judgment. Finally, moral judgment predicted whether participants would find the pilot guilty or not. In a second study using the same design as in the first study, we ensured that readers focused on different aspects of the dilemma depending on social distance.

AB  - Background Conspiracy theories about the origins of COVID-19 are widespread and have even been propagated by highly ranked state officials and politicians in the US. Health authorities have cautioned that such theories, although not questioning the existence of the pandemic, may increase the spread of the virus by reducing people's efforts to socially distance. Methods We test this proposition empirically using longitudinal survey data collected at five timepoints during the early outbreak of the virus in the US (N = 403). Results Multivariate growth curve analyses showed that, although conspiracy beliefs decreased and social distancing increased over time, people holding more conspiracy beliefs at the beginning of the pandemic showed the lowest increase in social distancing. Moreover, cross-lagged analyses demonstrated that people who reported more conspiracy beliefs at any wave tended to report less social distancing at the following wave. Conclusions Our findings show that COVID-19 conspiracy theories pose a significant threat to public health as they may reduce adherence to social distancing measures.

AB  - Background: The weathering hypothesis views the elevated rates of illness, disability, and mortality seen among Black Americans as a physiological response to the structural barriers, material hardships, and identity threats that comprise the Black experience. While granting that lifestyle may have some significance, the fundamental explanation for heath inequalities is seen as race-related stressors that accelerate biological aging. Objective: The present study tests the weathering hypothesis by examining the impact on accelerated aging of four types of adversity frequently experienced by Black Americans. Further, we investigate whether health risk behaviors mediate the effect of these conditions. Method: Our analyses utilize data from 494 middle-age, African American men and women participating in the Family and Community Healthy Study. The newly developed GrimAge index of accelerated aging is used as an indicator of weathering. Education, income, neighborhood disadvantage, and discrimination serve as the independent variables. Three health risk behaviors - diet, exercise, and alcohol consumption - are included as potential mediators of the four types of adversity. Marital status and gender are entered as controls. Results: Multivariate analyses indicated that the four types of adversity predicted acceleration whereas marriage predicted deceleration in speed of aging. Males showed greater accelerated aging than females, but there was no evidence that gender conditioned the effect of adversity. The health risk behaviors were unrelated to accelerated aging and did not mediate the effect of the stressors. Conclusion: Modern medicine's emphasis on life style as the primary explanation for race-based health disparities ignores the way race-related adversity rooted in structural and cultural conditions serves to accelerate biological decline, thereby increasing risk of early onset of illness and death. Importantly, these social conditions can only be addressed through social policies and programs that target institutional racism and promote economic equity.

AB  - While cross-sectional studies have shown that hookah tobacco smoking (HTS) is an increasingly popular behavior among university students, little is known about factors associated with initiation. This study sought to determine associations between knowledge, attitudes, and normative beliefs and initiation of HTS among university students.
   Data were from a prospective longitudinal cohort study of 569 randomly selected first- and second-year university students. Online questionnaires that were developed in accordance with our composite theoretical model were completed in September 2010 and April 2011.
   About one-seventh (13%) of participants initiated HTS by follow-up. Positive attitudes and favorable normative beliefs were associated with increased adjusted odds of initiation (AOR = 4.12, 95% CI = 2.56, 6.59; and AOR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.35, 2.99, respectively), while negative attitudes were associated with decreased adjusted odds (AOR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.48, 0.80). Correct knowledge regarding toxicants associated with HTS was not significantly associated with initiation.
   While positive attitudes and favorable normative beliefs are associated with initiation of HTS in a cohort of never-users, increased knowledge about toxins is not associated with lower initiation. It may be particularly valuable for educational interventions to attempt to alter positive attitudes and normative beliefs related to HTS.

AB  - Do popular films activate authoritarianism? We theorize that, because of the willing suspension of disbelief, films encourage social learning, which primes viewers to respond to messages activating latent personality traits such as authoritarianism. This activation then affects citizens' political attitudes. To test our theory, we use a 1 x 3 posttest experimental design where treatment groups watch feature-length films. As treatments, subjects watch 300 and V for Vendetta, and the control film is 21 Jump Street. Consistent with our hypotheses, we find that 300 activates authoritarianism while V for Vendetta activates antiauthoritarianism. As expected, 21 Jump Street has no effect. In addition, we show that the activation of authoritarianism produces significant differences in attitudes on U.S. primacy, rights of protestors, immigration, and military service. This research demonstrates how the causal mechanism between entertainment media and latent personality activation affects political attitudes, which advances both the American political behavior and media politics literature.

AB  - Purpose - The authors conceptually aim to replicate and update an early stream of research to find the key dimensions used by today's audiences. They also show that the dimensions are directly related with attitude toward the ad, product attitude change and product recommendation and test the moderating impact of FCB Grid product type.
   Design/methodology/approach - Across two studies, the authors survey a nationally representative sample of 1,223 US adults.
   Findings - Consumers evaluate commercials using the dimensions: Dislikable, Meaningful, Ingenious and Warm. The latter three are positively related with ad attitude, attitude change and recommendation, whereas Dislikable is negatively related. Furthermore, results show that High and Low Involvement Think products moderate the relation between all four dimensions and all three outcomes. Only Meaningful affects the outcomes for High Involvement Feel products, whereas only Ingenious affects Low Involvement Feel product outcomes.
   Research limitations/implications - The research is limited to TV commercials, limiting generalizability to other media. Furthermore, the sample is limited to the USA.
   Practical implications - The paper provides a parsimonious four-dimension model for advertiser use. These dimensions also predict ad attitudes, product recommendation, and attitude change. The results further show that for emotionally driven products with high involvement, commercials should focus on meaningfulness. For emotionally driven products with little involvement, ads should emphasize creative elements.
   Originality/value - Addressing the paucity of replications in marketing, this paper replicates and extends a stream of research to reveal dimensions consumers use to evaluate commercials and demonstrates their practical applications.

AB  - Is copying unavoidable? Is it an inherent element of creativity? When is imitation appropriate? Justifiable? Beneficial? Welcomed? What actually gets copied? Form? Intention? Aesthetics? Concepts? What about energy? Can you copy that? What about cultural appropriation or the powerful plundering the disenfranchised? These questions all bubbled up during a creative process inspired by Krumping. To discuss these questions further, the author revisits an incident that caused a mini-furor. Beyonce Knowles was accused of plagiarizing sections of Rosas danst Rosas, an avant-garde contemporary dance by Anna Teresa De Keersmaeker. Subsequent media discussions were filled with side-taking, indignance, and justification. But what did these two women do? What did their narrative reveal about dance, about fields of practice, about intentions, protocols, permissions, silences, acknowledgements, ethics, race relations, and feminism? The complexity of these questions creates a spinning disco ball of perspectives.

AB  - This article examines the Kim Sisters, a trio of female performers from South Korea, as a case study to explore the transpacific exchange of ethnic talent between the United States and Korea during the Cold War. It illustrates how U.S. military occupation, popular music, and Cold War diplomacy were visibly intertwined in entertainment television programming. The performances of the Kim Sisters in variety shows as a display of ethnic spectacle under the mask of internationalism constructed a false projection of race relations while the United States sought to win the cultural Cold War. The Kim Sisters navigated the complex structures of American Orientalism that television ascribed to them.

AB  - This article examines if the emergence of more partisan media has contributed to political polarization and led Americans to support more partisan policies and candidates. Congress and some newer media outlets have added more partisan messages to a continuing supply of mostly centrist news. Although political attitudes of most Americans have remained fairly moderate, evidence points to some polarization among the politically involved. Proliferation of media choices lowered the share of less interested, less partisan voters and thereby made elections more partisan. But evidence for a causal link between more partisan messages and changing attitudes or behaviors is mixed at best. Measurement problems hold back research on partisan selective exposure and its consequences. Ideologically one-sided news exposure may be largely confined to a small, but highly involved and influential, segment of the population. There is no firm evidence that partisan media are making ordinary Americans more partisan.

AB  - This study demonstrates how reporter-written obituaries of Black civil rights movement leaders reinforce a limited, facile view of the African American freedom struggle that haunts even today's race relations. The obituaries remember a movement that Julian Bond characterized as a morality play of Black saints against southern White sinners. What these articles rememberand in some cases forgetis critical because collective memory research shows that obituaries reflect what the present thinks of the past. Five nostalgic, racialized frames emerge from these obituaries: (a) the importance of violence inflicted on Blacks, (b) the importance of the dutiful suffering endured by Blacks, (c) news media's documentation of White southern oppression, (d) the salience and valence of the early-1960s Martin Luther King Jr., and (e) the idealism of integration over Black nationalist goals.

AB  - The online environment offers nearly unlimited sources and information, giving people unprecedented agency over selection. This article offers a test of three factors predicting selective exposure to opinionated news online-prior political attitudes, source credibility, and individual social identity based on race (Study 1) and gender (Study 2)-testing their independent and interactive effects. Two original selection studies on samples of adult Americans offered articles that were (1) pro- or counter-attitudinal with regard to individual attitudes on two political issues, (2) from high- versus low-credibility sources conceptualized in two different ways, and (3) featuring participants' social in-group or out-group. Unobtrusively logged behavioral selection data suggest that prior political attitudes, and their strength and importance in Study 1, more strongly predict pro-attitudinal exposure than both source credibility and the demographically based social identity. Both studies additionally reveal nuanced interactions between the tested factors.

AB  - Children are exposed to animated cartoons at an early age, and the gender, class, and race-related messages are likely to be influential in the development of children's beliefs and attitudes about gender roles, class, and racial groups. Although representations of females and minority children in animated cartoons have improved over the years, stereotypical and racially biased portrayals of females and racial minority groups remain. Using an intersectionality theoretical lens, a textual analysis was conducted to examine the representation of the two current leading, minority female characters in children's animated cartoons: Doc McStuffins and Dora the Explorer. Character portrayals, stereotypes, challenges to traditional stereotypes, and the intersecting role of race, gender, and class on the representations of the characters are explored in this analysis.

AB  - The relationships between social value orientation, socio-political attitudes and prejudice was investigated in three studies (total N = 1069). Participants filled in questionnaires containing measures of social value orientation, left-right political orientation, social worldviews (i.e. dangerous world and competitive jungle), right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO) and prejudice towards immigrants. Study 1 showed that a proself orientation was associated to right-wing political orientation through the mediation of RWA and SDO. Study 2 revealed that social worldviews mediated the relationships of a proself orientation with RWA and SDO. Finally, Study 3 indicated that a proself orientation was related to prejudice through the intervention of social worldviews, RWA and SDO. Overall, these findings provided robust evidence about the elevant role of interpersonal orientation underpinning socio-political attitudes and prejudice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to assess the sources of COVID-19 information used, behavioral changes in response to the pandemic, and factors associated with adherence to social distancing guidelines among adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: We conducted a self-administered online survey of AYAs with cancer (aged 18-39 years) diagnosed between ages 15 and 39 and living in Canada during January and February 2021. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with adherence to the social distancing guidelines.
   Results: In total, 805 AYAs were included. Participants were most likely to obtain COVID-19-related information from social media (60.5%), news reports (51.6%), and medical professionals (46.5%). The preferred modes of receiving information were websites of cancer organizations (47.9%), social media (44.8%), and medical professionals (40.2%). The common behavioral changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic included wearing a protective mask (60.2%), avoiding crowded and public places (56.9%), and abiding by social distancing rules (49.4%). On multivariable analysis, participants were more likely to adhere to social distancing rules if they were women, unemployed or collecting disability/unemployment benefits, or had a personal income of <$40,000 in year 2020 (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Social media and websites of cancer organizations are the preferred modes of COVID-19 information. Since many AYAs are nonadherent to preventative health measures, cancer organizations should help develop and disseminate digital resources that provide tailored information to AYAs with cancer during this pandemic.

AB  - This paper provides a critical review of the progress in understanding the linkages between transport disadvantage and social exclusion. It follows earlier work in proposing social capital as a concept that mediates those linkages but argues that transport researchers must not confine themselves to conceptualisations of social capital as predominantly benign and capable of reducing transport disadvantage and social exclusion. A range of hypothetical pathways is discussed, highlighting the Janus-faced character of social capital as a medium for both the effectuation of progressive social change and the perpetuation and creation of social inequalities. An analysis is provided of the extent to which the recent transport-related literature supports or rejects the hypothesised pathways, and key avenues for future research are identified.

AB  - Most religions teach individuals to "love thy neighbor" where "neighbor" extends to out-group members. To date, the love thy neighbor hypothesis, which posits that religiosity is associated with tolerance toward out-group members, has been tested indirectly by examining religiosity's association with negative (prejudiced) attitudes. The present study directly tested the love thy neighbor hypothesis by examining religiosity's association with positive attitudes toward out-groups once statistically controlling for right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), a measure of cognitive rigidity and a known mediator of the relationship between religiosity and prejudice. Two hundred forty-nine adult Americans completed measures of religiosity and allophilia, a measure of positive attitudes toward members of an out-group. Mediation path analyses revealed that RWA aggression, a subcomponent of RWA that measures a cognitively rigid ideology, fully mediated the relationship between religiosity and positive attitudes toward ethnic/racial out-groups (Arabs, African Americans, and Hispanics). This positive association between religiosity and positive attitudes toward ethnic/racial out-groups suggests that religiosity is associated with loving some neighbors. Both RWA aggression and RWA conventionalism (a subcomponent of RWA that measures traditional cognitive rigidity) fully mediated the relationship between religiosity and positive attitudes toward value-violating out-groups (lesbians, gay men, and atheists). Religiosity showed no association with attitudes toward value-violating out-groups once controlling for these rigid ideologies, providing partial support for the love thy neighbor hypothesis. Implications of the present results for understanding how religiosity can be associated with and even promote tolerance toward out-groups are discussed.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between social distance perception and company/sustainability campaign evaluations. The study also investigates the moderating role of consumer ethnocentrism in the relationship between the variables. This study further compares the effects of construal message framing (high-level vs. low-level construal) on social distance perception. The SPSS PROCESS macro analysis revealed that social distance perception from a corporation negatively affects company evaluations. Moreover, the results demonstrated that consumer ethnocentrism significantly moderates the relationship between social distance perception and company/sustainability campaign evaluations. Finally, the results indicate that construal message framing significantly affects the level of social distance perception from the host of a sustainability campaign. This paper provides practical suggestions for corporates' sustainability communications and adds to the literature on the reverse effect of construal level theory and social distance reduction.

AB  - Social exclusion is a covert and widespread social behavior. Different from previous studies on the role of internal and social functions in the relationship between social exclusion and maladjustment, the study aims to explore the influence of individual interaction on the individual-group relationship as well as the impact of relationship changes on adolescent social maladjustment. Based on an integration of social information processing theory and social identification theory, we analyzed the association between social exclusion and adolescents' social maladjustment, especially the mediating role of group identification and the moderating role of parent-child cohesion. Participants were 1,506 Chinese adolescents (M-age= 16.18 years,SD= 0.81). The results demonstrated that the association between social exclusion and adolescent social maladjustment was partly mediated by group identification. Parent-child cohesion was found to moderate the direct effect and first half of mediating path after splitting gender variable. Our findings expand the extant insights on how social exclusion could contribute to adolescent social maladjustment and highlight the important role of father in later adolescence development.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine the relationship between individual bicultural identity and attitudes toward diversity. The authors also theorize and test the mechanism through which individual bicultural identity will be more likely to result in positive attitudes toward diversity. Design/methodology/approach The authors collected survey data drawing from two different samples and two different measures of attitudes toward diversity. To test the hypotheses, the authors conducted structural equation modeling analyses. Findings The authors found that individual bicultural identity increases positive attitudes toward diversity and cultural intelligence partially mediates this relationship. Individual bicultural identity increases positive attitudes to others not necessarily known to us. Originality/value The authors integrate the cultural intelligence framework and the common in-group identity model in assessing the role of cultural intelligence in both individual bicultural identity and attitudes toward diversity.

AB  - This research project aims to assess how information and communication technologies (ICTs) are a tool for the social integration of disadvantaged groups. To that end, we studied a group of young people in social exclusion from the Initial Professional Qualification Programs of the Federico Ozanam Foundation in Zaragoza (Spain); we focused on the relationship between their level of digital literacy and their feeling of integration in the main social group. We evaluated their social capacities, their life skills as defined by the World Health Organization, their relational and informative habits and their feeling of empowerment in digital contexts. The goal was to find out if the relationship between these factors and their feeling of integration was directly proportional. The results were positive for most of the indicatives studied.

AB  - Hostile attitudes toward refugees are on the rise, yet individuals who hold negative beliefs toward out-groups are the most difficult to persuade. Is an explicit persuasive appeal effective for such groups, or should fictional narratives with implicit messages be used instead? An online experiment (N=1, 749) was conducted to test this possibility with three possible media-based interventions: a fictional sympathetic portrayal, a fictional hostile portrayal, or a documentary-based portrayal. Hostile portrayals increased negative attitudes toward refugees, while documentary portrayals increased positive attitudes and promoted stereotype reversal. These effects were observed regardless of nationalism or social dominance orientation.

AB  - Despite a well-established literature investigating race-related predictors of riot incidence, the racial aftermath of riots remains unexamined. In this study, I use the 1960s U.S. race riots to investigate trends in black residential segregation levels following large-scale riot activity in seven major U.S. cities. I use a novel approach-namely, synthetic control matching-to select a group of cities against which segregation trends can be compared. I find that levels of black segregation rose in 1970 for four of the seven cities, but these increases disappeared in 1980 and 1990 except in Detroit. These results mask differential trends at lower geographic levels: suburban neighborhoods in affected areas experienced larger and longer-term increases in segregation, particularly in traditionally hypersegregated cities in the Midwest and Northeast.

AB  - The effect of mental illness stigma can be greater in the developing world where sufferers are additionally affected by destitution. This study investigated the attitudes of the Igbo people of Southeastern Nigeria toward mental illness to establish the extent and determinants of negative attitudes. Multistage sampling was used to select participants (n = 602), to whom questionnaires were administered. More than half of all the demographic groups demonstrated authoritarian attitude and primary social distance. A third of the sample equally endorsed social restrictiveness, anticommunity care, and secondary social distance. Low education, male gender, older age, Protestant denomination, and not being familiar with people with mental illness predicted more negative attitudes. Culture, stereotypes, causal explanations, and poor mental health knowledge were the leading mediators of negative attitudes. The determinant role of culture and demographic variables in the stigma dynamics indicate that contextualized and targeted interventions could be more effective than general campaigns.

AB  - We investigated how victim sensitivity and news media exposure conjointly contribute to the formation of political attitudes in the context of the euro crisis. Study 1 (N = 208) showed that observer-sensitive individuals were more likely and victim-sensitive individuals were less likely to support solidarity with countries in need of financial support. These correlations were mediated by affective components of political attitudes, namely nationalistic concerns, resentment about and empathic concerns with debtor countries. In Study 2 (N = 51), using a pre-post within-subjects design, we showed that framing the euro crisis in an 'exploitation frame'' (compared to a 'solidarity frame') in news media reports was more likely to trigger nationalistic concerns and, consequently, decrease support of solidarity in victim-sensitive individuals compared to their less victim-sensitive counterparts. These results are in line with the SeMI model and previous findings that victim sensitivity is linked to fear of being exploited in intergroup relations.

AB  - Attitude toward smart working reflects feelings of favorableness towards this object; attitudes influence intentions, which in turn guide behaviors. Recent research confirms the positive influence that attitude toward smart working has on expected usage of it. Despite a direct influence, other factors could interact in the context of opportunities for ICT usage for teleworkers; among these factors, work engagement stands out. In turn, work engagement influences the perception of job satisfaction and life satisfaction. Considering that literature suggests that among the antecedents of work engagement are attitudes, the present study analyzes the role of positive attitude towards smart working on work engagement, and consequently on job satisfaction and on life satisfaction, hypothesizing that work engagement could mediate between positive attitude towards smart working and job and life satisfaction. The participants were 342 workers (115 males and 227 females) in private and public organizations, aged 24 to 66 years. The results showed that a positive attitude towards smart working, along with work engagement as a mediator, positively influences job satisfaction and life satisfaction. This means that employers and human resources managers (HRM) can organize training sessions to enhance the positive attitude toward smart working and this can help workers feel more engaged and satisfied.

AB  - Cost and misperceptions may discourage lower income Singaporeans from utilizing primary care. We investigated sources of primary care in a low-income Singaporean community in a mixed-methods study.
   Residents of a low-income public rental flat neighbourhood were asked for sociodemographic details and preferred source of primary care relative to their higher income neighbours. In the qualitative component, interviewers elicited, from patients and health care providers, barriers/enablers to seeking care from Western-trained doctors. Interviewees were selected via purposive sampling. Transcripts were analyzed thematically, and iterative analysis was carried out using established qualitative method.
   Participation was 89.8% (359/400). Only 11.1% (40/359) preferred to approach Western-trained doctors, 29.5% (106/359) preferred alternative medicine, 6.7% (24/359) approached family/friends and 52.6% (189/359) preferred self-reliance. Comparing against higher income neighbours, rental flat residents were more likely to turn to alternative medicine and family members but less likely to turn to Western-trained doctors (P < 0.001). For the qualitative component, a total of 20 patients and 9 providers were interviewed before data saturation was reached. Patient and provider comments fell into the following content areas: primary care characteristics, knowledge, costs, priorities, attitudes and information sources. Self-reliance was perceived as acceptable for small illnesses but not for big ones, communal spirit was cited as a reason for consulting family/friends and social distance from primary care practitioners was highlighted as a reason for not consulting Western-trained doctors.
   Western-trained physicians are not the first choice of lower income Singaporeans for seeking primary care. Knowledge, primary care characteristics and costs were identified as potential barriers/enablers.

AB  - Two conjoint studies were undertaken in the USA on relative preferences for sources and food vehicles for long chain omega-3 fatty acids (LCO3FA). Study 1 (n = 202) investigated consumer acceptance of the source of LCO3FA (fish oil, algal oil and novel oilseed) in the most popular, well established vehicle foods (bread, milk and supplements). Study 2 (n = 211) investigated consumer acceptance of the source of LCO3FA (fish-meal, novel oilseed and fish oil) used to enrich the diet of animals for meat production (beef, chicken, pork and fish). Product concepts were varied by base product (vehicle); source of LCO3FA; information source; health claim and additional cost.
   These samples of US consumers reported preferences for novel (genetically modified, GM) oilseed incorporated into enriched foods (i.e., bread, milk and supplements) and also for meats above fish and fish oil as sources of LCO3FA and vehicles for consumption. Overall conjoint analysis revealed a general positive relative utility (worth or value) for novel oilseeds which were related to neutral or positive attitudes towards GM.
   Generally, the acceptance of enriched foods was dependent on the type of the base food and the cost of fish, with bread preferred over milk and supplements. Similarly, for meat, base (vehicle) product was significantly the most important driver of preference, with about 80% of the sample expressing highest preferences for chicken, fed oilseed (as a source of LCO3FA). However, cost was not an important driver of acceptance of meat alternatives.
   Further, knowledge that the novel oilseed was derived from a GM source did not impact on the acceptance of food alternatives. Thus, incorporating GM oilseeds rich in LCO3FA into animal feed, particularly for chicken and beef, and for enriching bread was found to be acceptable amongst the majority. These two studies suggest the existence of a potential demand for novel 'non-fish' source of LCO3FA, providing potential health benefits not currently realised. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Richard Wright's 1951 film of Native Son could have been the essential African-American film noir, as Wright, a Black expatriate living in Paris, was part of the very intellectual scene that invented the noir sensibility. However, contemporary prints of the film reveal it to be an ugly, difficult film. Using archival historical research into the film's production and censorship, and analysis of the film's noir components, this article explores how Wright (and co-writer and director Pierre Chenal) used the film's darkness and its lacks to create a cinematic text critical of capitalism, criminalization, and American race relations, one grounded in an aesthetic that is Blacker than noir.

AB  - Lebanon has witnessed multiple waves of displaced peoples throughout its recent history, including the displacement of Palestinians to Lebanon after the occupation of Palestine in 1948, the internal displacement of families from occupied Southern Lebanon after the Israeli invasion of 1978, and the influx of Syrian refugees after the outbreak of the Syrian crisis in 2011. Many Syrian families had to reconstitute their lives in Lebanon because of the crisis in their country, often in tented and informal settlements or in overpopulated or even abandoned buildings. This article focuses on the process of hosting Syrian refugees in Saida in Southern Lebanon after 2011. It explores service provisions and the two dominant types of housing for Syrian refugees: collective shelters and single apartments within local neighbourhoods. The article argues that mechanisms of exclusion emerge with intensity in cities like Saida that have received and accommodated multiple waves of displacement. Such mechanisms of exclusion in Saida are politically attuned to the historical depth of the hosting experience and emerge at multiple levels, both social and spatial. This is despite Saida's mobilization to provide aid, and its departure from housing refugees in camps, which is based on a model of containment, and its move toward housing refugees across the urban landscape, which is based on a model of disbursement.

AB  - Social exclusion is an interactive process between multiple people, yet previous research has focused almost solely on the negative impacts on targets. What advice is there for people on the other side (i.e., sources) who want to minimize its negative impact and preserve their own reputation? To provide an impetus for research on the interactive nature of exclusion, we propose the Responsive Theory of Social Exclusion. Our theory postulates that targets and sources' needs are better maintained if sources use clear, explicit verbal communication. We propose that sources have three options: explicit rejection (clearly stating no), ostracism (ignoring), and ambiguous rejection (being unclear). Drawing on psychology, sociology, communications, and business research, we propose that when sources use explicit rejection, targets' feelings will be less hurt, their needs will be better protected, and sources will experience less backlash and emotional toil than if sources use ambiguous rejection or ostracism. Finally, we propose how the language of rejections may impact both parties.

AB  - Trust is a central construct of social research. While numerous studies have investigated trust as either a dependent or independent variable, little attention has been paid to its relationship with health-related behaviors in the context of a public health crisis. How trust in different entities influences people's social distancing intention is therefore an important question that merits academic scrutiny. Moreover, the relationship between trust and social distancing intention cannot be well understood without an account of the information environment. As previous studies have reached a consensus about the limited effects of information exposure on individual outcomes, this research focuses on possible moderating effects. Results show that information exposure, no matter via interpersonal or media sources, has no direct effects on behavioral intention. Rather, risk communication serves as a moderator of the relationship between trust and social distancing intention.

AB  - The relationships between the media, public attitudes, and crime are complex, with evidence suggesting that public interaction with these press reports influencing wider social and political attitudes. Here, 543 articles from 8 of the 10 most-read British national newspapers were examined in terms of their representativeness of crime rates, and their linguistic properties. Results include a 9:1 representation of sexual crime, a 2.5:1 representation of violent crime, and a 1:4 representation of acquisitive crime within press articles compared with official statistics. Rating the linguistic content indicates that sexual crime articles comprised angrier and more emotionally negative tones than stories on all other groups. Tabloid and broadsheet differences were found in headlines, but not in the main bodies of the articles. Cognitive-experiential self-theory is offered as just one social psychological framework for understanding the role of emotion in sexual crime reporting.

AB  - Background Social distancing is a key behavior to minimize COVID-19 infections. Identification of potentially modifiable determinants of social distancing behavior may provide essential evidence to inform social distancing behavioral interventions.
   Purpose The current study applied an integrated social cognition model to identify the determinants of social distancing behavior, and the processes involved, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods In a prospective correlational survey study, samples of Australian (N = 365) and U.S. (N = 440) residents completed online self-report measures of social cognition constructs (attitude, subjective norm, moral norm, anticipated regret, and perceived behavioral control [PBC]), intention, action planning, habit, and past behavior with respect to social distancing behavior at an initial occasion. Follow-up measures of habit and social distancing behavior were taken 1 week later.
   Results Structural equation models indicated that subjective norm, moral norm, and PBC were consistent predictors of intention in both samples. Intention, action planning, and habit at follow-up were consistent predictors of social distancing behavior in both samples. Action planning did not have consistent effects mediating or moderating the intention-behavior relationship. Inclusion of past behavior in the model attenuated effects among constructs, although the effects of the determinants of intention and behavior remained.
   Conclusions Current findings highlight the importance of subjective norm, moral obligation, and PBC as determinants of social distancing intention and intention and habit as behavioral determinants. Future research on long-range predictors of social distancing behavior and reciprocal effects in the integrated model is warranted.

AB  - The research features the results of the effective introduction of information and communication technologies (ICT) into the process of senior preschoolers' moral education in preschool educational institutions (PEI). The benefits of ICT implementation in preschool education in different countries are discussed, and the balance between ICT and moral education is clarified. The necessity to find new approaches to increase the level of senior preschoolers' moral education was emphasized, which determined the topicality of the raised scientific problem. An experimental study of ICT implementation in the senior preschoolers' (n = 432) moral education was conducted, which included constitutive, formative and control stages. Criteria (cognitive, emotional and value-oriented, behavioral), their indexes and levels of senior preschoolers' moral education were specified. Based on the diagnostic method "Me and My Friends", the initial levels (high, sufficient, medium and low) were determined. An experimental method of ICT implementation in senior preschoolers' moral education is presented. This method was developed considering the requirements of the Basic Component of Preschool Education of Ukraine (2021) and partial program (additional thematic program on the organization of moral education in preschool education) "Treasury of Morality" (2020). The method is aimed at building children's positive attitude to ICT as a source of information that promotes the consolidation of knowledge about moral norms and development of skills of moral behaviour in society. The educational potential of ICT is analyzed, which should be implemented to increase the level of senior preschoolers' moral education, namely: videos, multimedia presentations, cartoons, video tales, online games, smart cards etc. The sequence of the method implementation at the information-introductory, reconstructive-formative and affirmative-consolidating stages is revealed. The effectiveness of ICT implementation in the senior preschoolers' moral education was assessed at the control stage. Positive dynamics of high and sufficient levels in senior preschoolers' moral education in the experimental group (EG) is proved to have risen. Importance of the ICT introduction into the modern system of senior preschoolers' moral education of PEI is confirmed. The following prospective directions of the initiated study are outlined: interaction with parents in the context of children's moral education involving ICT, ensuring consistency of PEI and primary school in children's moral education, as well as the development of moral competence of university students majoring in "Preschool education".

AB  - This article examines portrayals of Muslim women in US news media. I test two hypotheses derived from theories of gendered orientalism. First, US news coverage of women abroad is driven by confirmation bias. Journalists are more likely to report on women living in Muslim and Middle Eastern countries if their rights are violated but report on women in other societies when their rights are respected. Second, stories about Muslim women emphasize the theme of women's rights violations and gender inequality, even for countries with relatively good records of women's rights. Stories about non-Muslim women, on the other hand, emphasize other topics. I test these hypotheses on data from thirty-five years of New York Times and Washington Post reporting using a structural topic model along with statistical analysis. The results suggest that US news media propagate the perception that Muslims are distinctly sexist. This, in turn, may shape public attitudes toward Muslims, as well as influence policies that involve Muslims at home and abroad.

AB  - Sleep timing undergoes profound changes during adolescence, often resulting in inadequate sleep duration. The present study examines the relationship of sleep duration with positive attitude toward life and academic achievement in a sample of 2716 adolescents in Switzerland (mean age: 15.4 years, SD = 0.8), and whether this relationship is mediated by increased daytime tiredness and lower self-discipline/behavioral persistence. Further, we address the question whether adolescents who start school modestly later (20 min; n = 343) receive more sleep and report better functioning.
   Sleeping less than an average of 8 h per night was related to more tiredness, inferior behavioral persistence, less positive attitude toward life, and lower school grades, as compared to longer sleep duration. Daytime tiredness and behavioral persistence mediated the relationship between short sleep duration and positive attitude toward life and school grades. Students who started school 20 min later received reliably more sleep and reported less tiredness. (C) 2012 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The affective news extended model (Knobloch-Westerwick et al., 2020) demonstrated that narratives with a suspense-inducing format, a linear compared to inverted pyramid format, led to attitude change across four political topics. Given the lack of narrative persuasion research which considers the audio modality, the present research seeks to extend this model by using audio clip stimuli to (1) investigate whether the findings of Knobloch-Westerwick et al. (2020) will extend to the audio modality and (2) compare persuasive mechanisms and outcomes between the textual and audio modalities to understand the unique impact of suspense on narrative persuasion. Results demonstrated that (1) suspense did not differ by format, nor did it mediate the relationship between format and attitude change in the audio modality. (2) Comparisons between textual and audio modalities revealed that when exposed to the audio modality, participants were persuaded by transportation, feelings of being mentally and emotionally involved in the narrative. Future research and implications for the ANEM, audio narratives, and persuasion are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: Substantial distribution of information, education, and communication related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are the most cost-effective means to deliver desirable behavioral changes to stop/diminish the spread of the disease.
   Material and methods: In the present study, a cross-sectional study was conducted, and the sample size was determined using a single population proportion formula. Collected data was processed with SPSS version 22.0 statistical software, and descriptive method of data analysis was used. A total of 363 participants were included from March to June 2020, using stratified sampling followed by a simple random sampling technique.
   Results: The findings revealed that, major source of information used by university students on HIV/AIDS was radio (52.3%), followed by television (47.1%). From the study subjects, 60.3%, 39.4%, and 31.9% of them labeled currently available information sources as group specific, fear arousing, and boring, respectively. Students from College of Medicine and Health Sciences showed a better understanding of the virus. Moreover, a small number of the study subjects, i.e., 66 (18.2%), had a negative attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS.
   Conclusions: Most participants had fair knowledge about definition, transmission, and prevention of HIV/AIDS. However, knowledge by itself could not guarantee a change in behavior, as students were involved in different risky activities. In nearly all the cases, academic years of the participants and their field of study had an influence on the magnitude of behavioral changes delivered.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally altered life for individuals worldwide. Specifically, at the time of data collection (late April 2020), most forms of face-to-face interactions were limited and, in some cases, prohibited, as close contact with others increases the rate of transmitting the virus. As social beings, engaging in social distancing may have negative consequences on well-being. However, many individuals maintained their social connections by means of computer-mediated communication (CMC), such as hosting FaceTime happy hours or family reunions. Utilizing a nationally representative sample of 985 adults from the United States, this study investigated the association between social distancing adherence and positive affect and the extent to which this association might be mediated by CMC frequency. Results did not indicate a direct effect of social distancing adherence on positive affect. However, an indirect effect between these two variables occurred when mediated by CMC frequency. Specifically, greater social distancing adherence predicted greater frequency of CMC, which predicted greater positive affect. These findings held controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, relationship status, and income. Results suggest that despite social distancing, CMC may be a beneficial way to engage with others during and, perhaps, beyond COVID-19.

AB  - To maintain social distancing in the long term, in the current COVID-19 scenario, people's motivation must be strong and of high quality. Many governments adopted measures enforcing social distancing. Enforcement, however, can produce feelings of defiance and backfiring effects. The present work aims at investigating the relationship between autonomous motivation and intentions to maintain social distancing, through adherence to recommendations and feelings of defiance. A sample of 502 Italian residents, from different parts of Italy, completed an online survey assessing their present behavior, levels of autonomous motivation and feelings of defiance, as well as intentions to observe social distancing in the short and long term. Results support the hypotheses that autonomous motivation is related to stronger intentions to maintain social distancing, particularly in the long term, and that feelings of defiance mediate this relationship. These results underline importance of promoting understanding and internalizing reasons for social distancing, beyond norms.

AB  - In four studies, we addressed whether group membership influences behavioral and neural responses to the social exclusion of others. Participants played a modified three-player Cyberball game (Studies 1-3) or a team-selection task (Study 4) in the absence or presence of a minimal group setting. In the absence of a minimal group, when one player excluded another player, participants actively included the excluded target. When the excluder was from the in-group and the excluded player from the out-group, participants were less likely to intervene (Studies 1-3) and also more often went along with the exclusion (Study 4). Functional magnetic resonance imaging results (Study 3) showed that greater exclusion in the minimal group setting concurred with increased activation in the dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex, a region associated with overriding cognitive conflict. Self-reports from Study 4 supported these results by showing that participants' responses to the target's exclusion were motivated by group membership as well as participants' general aversion to exclude others. Together, the findings suggest that when people witness social exclusion, group membership triggers a motivational conflict between favoring the in-group and including the out-group target. This underscores the importance of group composition for understanding the dynamics of social exclusion.

AB  - Ethical and political attitudes are not randomly distributed in a population. Attitudes of family members, for example, tend to be more similar than those of a random sample of the same size. In the fields of social psychology and political science, the historically standard explanation for these attitude distribution patterns was that social and political attitudes are (at least partially) a function of environmental factors like parental socialization and prevailing social norms. This received view is, however, complicated by more recent work in behavioral genetics, which consistently and repeatedly demonstrates that certain ethical and political attitudes dealing with issues like censorship, abortion, capital punishment, and immigration policy have a significant heritability coefficient, to wit, a substantial percentage of attitude variance in a population can be attributed to genetic variance, independent of environmental factors. In this paper, I argue that the genetic influence on our ethical and political attitudes is mediated by what we can agree to be irrelevant and distorting factors that can lead moral reasoning astray. Further, I argue that we should significantly lower our credences in ethical and political attitudes that fall within the domains of belief that involve significant genetic influence.

AB  - Background: Parental attitudes play a key role in their decisions to vaccinate adolescents against the human papillomavirus (HPV). Little is known, however, about the formative experiences that shape parents' attitudes about the HPV vaccine.
   Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 parents of 11-17 year old adolescents in Wisconsin who changed their HPV vaccine attitudes (per prior surveys) over one year. A modified grounded theory approach was then used to generate primary themes of attitudinal determinants.
   Results: Participants were predominately mothers. We identified three major themes that shaped parents' HPV attitudes: (1) the perceived likelihood of the HPV vaccine preventing cancer, (2) agency in adolescence and gauging their adolescent child's intent for sexual activity, (3) the credibility of HPV vaccine information sources. General messaging around cancer prevention did not always supersede some parents' concerns about the vaccine's perceived link to sexual activity. Parents often viewed their adolescent child's feelings about the HPV vaccine as a gauge of their (child's) intent for sexual activity. Interviewees felt a sense of responsibility to educate themselves about the HPV vaccine using multiple sources and particularly looked to their medical provider to filter conflicting information.
   Conclusions: More family-specific (vs. disease-prevention) messaging and recommendations may be needed in the clinical environment to sway some parents' negative attitudes about the HPV vaccine. Future research should explore additional strategies to improve HPV vaccine attitudes, such as situating the vaccine in the context of a monogamous lifestyle that many parents wish to impart to their children.

AB  - This paper aims to examine the correlates of foreign policy attitudes in Moldova by a multilevel analysis, and to also reveal some characteristics of the Moldova's difficult geopolitical and economic context, such as the ethnical conflicts and poverty. A set of four foreign policy attitudes are explained upon individual- and regional level socio-economic and demographic correlates, of which poverty is the main focus, being represented here by several objective, subjective, uni- and multidimensional indicators. An indicator of deprivation is derived from a group of poverty indicators by the method Item Response Theory. Deprivation, subjective poverty, ethnicity and the Russian media influence are found to be associated with negative attitudes toward all foreign policies, while satisfaction with economic conditions in the country and a positive attitude toward refugees are both associated with positive attitudes toward all foreign policies.

AB  - While media research has long ago acknowledged that watching TV is a social activity, only a few studies have examined the effects of co-viewing on adult reactions to a televised text. In the current investigation, we used social-cognitive theory combined with previous research on the intra-audience effect, audience identification, transportation, and attitude change to develop hypotheses connecting co-viewers' reactions, co-viewers' gender, and viewer's post-exposure attitudes. Participants watched a movie segment that ended in a rape scene. We manipulated their confederate co-viewers' displayed reaction (enthusiastic or bored) and gender, and subsequently measured perceived co-viewers' attributions of responsibility for the rape, the viewers' transportation, identification with the male protagonist, and acceptance of the rape myth (the tendency to attribute responsibility for sexual violence to the victim). Results demonstrated that for those participants who correctly perceived the engagement manipulation, the effect of the confederate co-viewer's engagement manipulation on rape myth acceptance was positive and significant. In addition, both manipulations had an indirect effect on rape myth acceptance, sequentially mediated through transportation and identification.

AB  - We explored the impact of admiration of others regarding their morality, positive attitude, and skills on the fatigue of social media users through the mediators of social media loneliness and social media anxiety. We collected data for analysis from 688 social media users through an online survey. The results show that admiration for morality relieved social media fatigue through the mediator of social media loneliness, and admiration for positive attitude relieved social media fatigue through the mediators of both social media loneliness and social media anxiety. However, admiration for skill aggravated social media anxiety and, further, led to social media fatigue. Admiration for morality and for positive attitude could directly relieve social media fatigue, but admiration for skill led to social media fatigue only when it was transformed into social media anxiety. Our findings have implications for ways to relieve social media fatigue.

AB  - Social distancing behaviour is a primary preventive measure for reducing COVID-19 transmission. Improved understanding of factors associated with adherence to social distancing is vital for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 in South Africa. The study assessed adherence to social distancing and its associated factors during the state-implemented lockdown in South Africa. Data was analysed from a large-scale public survey conducted in South Africa from 8 to 29 April 2020, which was administered online and telephonically. Invitations to participate were distributed widely on local websites and social media networks, including on a data-free platform. Adherence to social distancing was measured by self-report of having engaged in close physical contact with someone outside the home. Simple and multiple logistic regression models examined the association between social distancing and potential explanatory variables. Of the 17,586 participants, 9.2% came into close physical contact with a person outside their home by hugging, kissing, or shaking hands during the past 7 days. The odds of coming into close physical contact with other people were significantly higher for males, students, and those with incorrect knowledge on physical distancing, angry attitudes about the lockdown, lack of confidence in the government response, high-risk perception, movement out of the local area, travelling to shops using public transport, households with communal water facilities and higher household size. The 25-59-year olds compared to 18-24-year olds, and the White and Indian/Asian compared to the African population groups had significantly lower odds of close physical contact with others outside the home. The study identifies subgroups of individuals for whom public health interventions to improve adherence to social distancing should be prioritised and tailored. Interventions and policies should take cognisance of the social determinants of health as well as culturally accepted greeting practices like hand shaking.

AB  - Previous neuroimaging research has identified brain regions activated when peoples fairness consideration changes under conditions of social exclusion. The current study used EEG data to examine the temporal process of changes in fairness consideration under social exclusion. In this study, a Cyberball game was administered to manipulate participants social exclusion or inclusion. Then, in the following Ultimatum game (UG), participants brain potentials were recorded while they received fair/unfair offers from someone who previously excluded them, someone who previously included them, or a stranger. Results showed that feedback-related negativity (FRN) after onset of distribution outcome was more pronounced for unfair offers compared to fair offers. Moreover, the FRN was more negative-going in response to unfair offers from people who previously excluded them than from the includer and the stranger. Fair offers elicited a larger P300 than unfair offers. In addition, P300 was more positive-going for unfair offers from the stranger than from the excluder and the includer. This study reveals a temporal process in which the effects of social exclusion on fair consideration are reflected in FRN in the early stage of outcome evaluation. These data also suggest that the FRN is modulated by the subjective evaluation of outcome events in a social context.

AB  - While there is a considerable body of evidence on the influence of individual and situational, and to a lesser extent community factors, on police use of force, little is known about the influence of police agency factors on use of force by police. Greater use of community policing approaches has recently been recommended for U.S. policing agencies, in the wake of a series of high-profile police-involved deaths of predominantly African American citizens. However, there is limited empirical evidence that community policing can influence or impact the use of force by police. The current study uses an online survey of Australian police officers to examine whether frequency of community engagement affects officers' attitudes towards coercive and non-coercive policing responses to a vignette, and whether social distance might explain this relationship. Regression analyses demonstrated that community engagement was positively related to endorsement of non-coercive policing responses and negatively related to endorsement of coercive policing responses. Social distance mediated the former relationship, but not the latter. These results suggest that community policing approaches may increase the propensity for non-coercive policing responses, and that a reduction in social distance to the community is one pathway through which this occurs.

AB  - A substantial body of literature indicates that certain forms of media consumption may increase anxiety about crime and support for social controls. However, few studies have examined whether Internet news consumption is positively associated with such attitudes. The void is significant given the public's increasing use of online news sources. This study addresses this research gap.
   We draw on data from four national surveys conducted between 2007 and 2013, which collectively include interviews with more than 13,000 Americans. Using OLS and logistic regression, we assess the relationships between exposure to traditional and online media and perceptions of victimization risk, support for punitive crime policies, and views about police powers.
   Consistent with prior work, we find positive relationships between exposure to traditional forms of media-television news and crime programming-and anxiety about victimization and support for harsh crime policies. In contrast, Internet news exposure is generally not associated with anxieties about crime or support for getting tough on criminals. However, there is evidence of an interactive relationship between political ideology and Internet news exposure.
   The results provide little support for cultivation theory in the context of Internet news consumption. We discuss the import of our findings, and suggest new lines of research to explore the correlates and the effects of exposure to online news sources.

AB  - Globalization, international migration and food promotion via media platforms have led to increased consumption of ethnic food. The main aim of the research is to explore the relation between attitudes and behaviour in the ethnic food consumption. An on-line survey was conducted on a sample of 230 respondents. Most respondents consume ethnic food, mostly on a weekly basis, at home and in restaurants. The largest share of respondents has neutral attitudes towards ethnic food. Respondents with positive attitudes towards ethnic food consume ethnic food more often at home, those with neutral attitudes consume such food in restaurants, while respondents who have negative attitudes about ethnic food consume ethnic food mostly at friend's. The respondents with positive attitudes towards ethnic food give higher importance to all ethnic food attributes. Results of this research can serve producers and distributors of ethnic foods to better suit the demands of modern consumers.

AB  - Social distancing is one of the most recommended policies worldwide to reduce diffusion risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on a risk management perspective, this study explores the mechanism of the risk perception effect on social distancing in order to improve individual physical distancing behavior. The data for this study were collected from 317 Chinese residents in May 2020 using an internet-based survey. A structural equation model (SEM) and hierarchical linear regression (HLR) analyses were conducted to examine all the considered research hypotheses. The results show that risk perception significantly affects perceived understanding and social distancing behaviors in a positive way. Perceived understanding has a significant positive correlation with social distancing behaviors and plays a mediating role in the relationship between risk perception and social distancing behaviors. Furthermore, safety climate positively predicts social distancing behaviors but lessens the positive correlation between risk perception and social distancing. Hence, these findings suggest effective management guidelines for successful implementation of the social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic by emphasizing the critical role of risk perception, perceived understanding, and safety climate.

AB  - Social media like Facebook can blend classroom work with collaborative online learning. Different instructional approaches may support such online learning phases. Group awareness tools provide collaborating learners with additional information about the processes and the knowledge in the group and how these are distributed within a group to support the regulation of learning. Scripts are a form of external regulation of collaborative learning processes. Scripts may complement group awareness tools and promote active processing of the additional group information. In a 1 x 3 (group awareness tool with script vs. without script, and control group) quasi-experimental field study (N=63) we observed long-term effects of a group awareness tool and its combination with a script on processes and outcomes of argumentative learning in a seminar accompanied by Facebook discussions. In addition to domain-specific learning outcomes, this study explores attitude change as a potential outcome of prolonged periods of argumentative knowledge construction. Results showed a main effect of group awareness tools on declarative knowledge, but no significant effects on argumentative knowledge. Participants with group awareness tool (with script vs. without) attained an attitude which aligned with the learning goals. This attitude change partly correlates with the significantly higher learning outcomes on declarative knowledge. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background:Participation of the public is an important and most effective approach for controlling the spread of novel coronavirus. However, considering its novel nature, it is important to create awareness among the public to be able to take timely preventive measures. On the contrary, misinformation and myths from online communities result in severe damages in mitigation of this novel disease. Objective:Focusing on these aspects, this manuscript reviews public awareness about COVID-19, myths surrounding it, its symptoms, treatment, transmission, importance of information sources, types of information to be considered in awareness campaigns, promotional channels, and their implications in Saudi Arabia. Methods:An online questionnaire-based survey was used for collecting data related to five major aspects related to COVID-19 and awareness creation process. The survey was accessed by 1,881 people, out of whom 741 people participated in the survey. However, 150 dropouts left the survey in between, as a result of which a final sample of 591 was achieved, indicating the response rate of 39.3% and a completion rate of 79.76%. Results:Awareness levels of the participants related to COVID-19, its means of transmission, preventive measures, symptoms, and treatment were identified to be moderate to high (60-80%). However, reliance on a few myths and violation of certain preventive measures were identified with majority of the participants (more than 60%). The Ministry of Health was identified to be the most reliable source of information followed by family and friends. Moreover, 15 types of information were identified to be highly relevant and important, which need to be effectively disseminated among the public through effective communication channels. Conclusions:Lack of awareness can result in serious outcomes in relation to COVID-19. Effective awareness campaigns including relevant information from reliable sources can improve the knowledge of people, and they must be effective in developing positive attitudes among the public toward adopting preventive measures.

KW  - INFECTION
AB  - Background Key infection prevention and control measures to limit transmission of COVID-19 include social distancing, hand hygiene, use of facemasks and personal protective equipment. However, these have limited or no impact if not applied correctly through lack of knowledge, inappropriate attitude or incorrect practice. In order to maximise the impact of infection prevention and control measures on COVID-19 spread, we undertook a study to assess and improve knowledge, attitudes and practice among 119 healthcare workers and 100 general public in Thailand. The study setting was two inpatient hospitals providing COVID-19 testing and treatment. Detailed information on knowledge, attitudes and practice among the general public and healthcare workers regarding COVID-19 transmission and its prevention were obtained from a combination of questionnaires and observations. Results Knowledge of the main transmission routes, commonest symptoms and recommended prevention methods was mostly very high (> 80%) in both groups. There was lower awareness of aerosols, food and drink and pets as sources of transmission; of the correct duration for handwashing; recommended distance for social/physical distancing; and about recommended types of face coverings. Information sources most used and most trusted were the workplace, work colleagues, health workers and television. The results were used to produce a set of targeted educational videos which addressed many of these gaps with subsequent improvements on retesting in a number of areas. This included improvements in handwashing practice with an increase in the number of areas correctly washed in 65.5% of the public, and 57.9% of healthcare workers. The videos were then further optimized with feedback from participants followed by another round of retesting. Conclusions Detailed information on gaps in knowledge, attitudes and practice among the general public and healthcare workers regarding COVID-19 transmission and its prevention were obtained from a combination of questionnaires and observations. This was used to produce targeted educational videos which addressed these gaps with subsequent improvements on retesting. The resulting videos were then disseminated as a resource to aid in efforts to fight COVID-19 in Thailand and worldwide.

AB  - Experiences of social exclusion, including ostracism and rejection, can last anywhere from a few seconds to many years. Most research focused on short-term social exclusion, whereas virtually no empirical work has investigated the experiences of long-term social exclusion. Williams theorized that prolonged experiences of social exclusion (i.e., ostracism) would cause individuals to pass from the reflexive and reflective stages to the resignation stage characterized by the inability to recover threatened psychological needs and feelings of alienation, unworthiness, helplessness, and depression. Across two studies, we explored this predictionand, in light of pain overlap theories, considered the possibility that chronic exclusion and chronic pain induce common psychological responses. Study 1 consisted of a quasi-experimental study involving five groups of participants: (1) those with chronic experiences of social exclusion (n = 82), (2) those with chronic physical pain (n = 82), (3) those with chronic hypertension (n = 69), (4) those with chronic kidney disease (n = 60), and (5) a group of healthy people (n = 83). Participants filled out a questionnaire including measures of need threat, negative emotions, and the four key outcomes linked to the resignation stage (i.e., alienation, unworthiness, helplessness, and depression). Although our data showed little evidence to support the psychological overlap between chronic exclusion and chronic physical pain, the results suggested that chronic experiences of social exclusion were associated with higher levels of negative emotions and resignation stage outcomes compared to participants in all the other groups. Furthermore, we found that threatened psychological needs mediated the effect of social exclusion on the resignation stage outcomes. Study 2 tested, but found no support for, the possibility that acute experiences of social exclusion could increase the resignation stage outcomes. Overall, our research indicates that when people are exposed to short-term exclusion, they recover their threatened psychological needs. However, when enduring chronic social exclusion, they do not, and enter the resignation stage.

AB  - Purpose The importance of psychological capital (PsyCap) and perceived organizational support (POS) have been identified over the years, however, the underlying relationship of both constructs with different employee outcomes is still a subject of research. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether POS helps in mediating the effect of PsyCap on employee engagement (EE). Design/methodology/approach In total, 420 samples (middle-level information technology (IT) professionals) were collected from different IT industry located in India by using online survey questionnaires. The collected data were further analyzed using regression analysis, factor analysis, structural equation modeling, reliability and validity analysis, mediation analysis and model fit indices analysis. Findings The results of the present study confirmed the full mediating effect of POS on the PsyCap-EE relationship and demonstrated that employees with a higher level of PsyCap, contribute more positively to the POS level which further enhances the employee's level of engagement at the workplace. Research limitations/implications The samples collected for the current study included only middle-level IT professionals of the IT industry in India; therefore, the present study results have limited general applicability. The results and findings of the current study are only on the basis of inferential statistical analysis, and descriptive analysis was not performed on the collected data. Further, the study does not investigate the influence of time. Practical implications This study would assist practitioners of human resources in organizational development by enhancing the employee's positive attitude and commitment toward their study. Further, EE can also be improved by enhancing the levels of POS and PsyCap of employees, which is in line with the findings of the current study. Originality/value The current study examines the mediating effect of POS on psychological capital and EE the relationship for the first time.

AB  - Greece has been suffering a severe crisis starting in about 2009. This paper examines the impact of the recent economic crisis in Greece on employee work-related attitudes via changes in regulatory focus. We collected data in a large and heterogeneous sample of employees (N = 1024) during the crisis and compared them with a matched sample of employees surveyed (N = 882) half a decade earlier, i.e., before the crisis. Participants reported their job satisfaction, organizational commitment and their self-regulatory focus. Results show, as expected, that participants after start of the crisis were lower in extrinsic job satisfaction, affective organizational commitment and were also (unexpectedly) lower in normative commitment, while these attitudinal changes were explained by decreased promotion orientation and increased prevention focus. Rather unexpectedly, pre-crisis and crisis samples did not differ in levels of continuance commitment. This paper makes a relevant contribution by showing that the threatening crisis event does not only have negative effects on work-related outcomes, but also that changes in regulatory foci occur and explain attitudinal change indicating an adaptive mechanism to the threatening situation of an economic crisis.

AB  - Genetic essentialism suggests that beliefs in genetic causes of mental illness will inflate a desire for social distance from affected individuals, regardless of specific disorder. However, genetic contingency theory predicts that genetic attributions will lead to an increased desire for social distance only from persons with disorders who are perceived as dangerous.
   To assess the interactive effect of diagnosis and attribution on social distance and actual helping decisions across disorders.
   Undergraduate students (n = 149) were randomly assigned to read one of the six vignettes depicting a person affected by one of the three disorders (i.e., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression) with either a genetic or environmental causal attribution for disorder. Participants completed measures of perceived dangerousness, social distance, empathic concern, familiarity with mental illness, and actual helping decisions.
   When provided with genetic attributions, participants' desire for social distance was greater for targets with schizophrenia relative to targets with depression or bipolar disorder. This effect was mediated by perceived dangerousness. The indirect effect of diagnosis on helping decisions, through social distance, was significant within the genetic attribution condition.
   Consistent with genetic contingency theory, genetic attributions for schizophrenia, but not affective disorders, lead to greater desire for social distance via greater perceived dangerousness. Further, results suggest that genetic attributions decrease the likelihood of helping people with schizophrenia, but have no effect on the likelihood of helping people with affective disorders. These effects are partially accounted for by desired social distance from people with schizophrenia.

AB  - The purpose of the current study was to explore the association between gender and previous acquaintance with social workers (SWs) and between attitudes towards SWs. Attention was given to three categories of role relationships, reflecting respondents' status with regard to SWs: (i) current and former clients of social services departments (SSDs), (ii) activists and volunteers at SSDs and (iii) people who never had any interpersonal interaction with SWs. Data were collected in Israel by means of structured questionnaires among 806 participants aged twenty-one and older. The findings show that women have more positive attitudes towards SWs than men and rank them higher than do men for professionalism and effectiveness. In almost all parameters related to attitudes towards SWs (aside from appreciation), current and former clients of SSDs indicated more negative attitudes than volunteers and activists or than people who never had any interpersonal interaction with SWs. The conclusions were that personal encounters with SWs, as part of the therapist-client relationship, do not necessarily guarantee better attitudes towards them. Additionally, based on the finding that men have more negative attitudes towards SWs than women, it is also important to promote men's awareness and knowledge of the functions of SWs.

AB  - Although the negative bias of the news media is generally recognized in many countries, the media also regularly feature various types of positive news, ranging from touching human interest stories to news about national or community achievement. However, few scholarly analyses have examined whether and how professional journalists value positive news. This article examines Hong Kong journalists' perceptions of the values of five types of positive news stories. We hypothesized that professional beliefs about media roles, market considerations, and political attitudes are related to the perceived value of positive news. The analysis of data from a journalist survey revealed that journalists regard news stories that tell touching stories and promote social values and norms as important, but they do not consider important stories that promote national development and achievement. Our findings showed that belief in the cultural role of the press, acknowledgement of market influence on the media, and national and local identification significantly predicted the perceived value of positive news.

AB  - The research hypothesis of this paper stems from the argument that the Bulgarian authorities and the broader audiences decode Roma integration through the prism of an inequalities-poverty-social exclusion framework, meaning that the growth of 'being integrated' is viewed as a gradual decrease of the value of indicators related to social exclusion and a steady rise in indicators of well-being. In elaborating their argument, the authors consult the recent 'integration literature' and then theoreticize the Bulgarian NRIS and the change of 'integration' vocabulary over time. A representative sociological survey is deployed as an empirical foundation for proving, or disputing, that the effects and consequences of the NRIS can be assessed based on the presented data. The explored data represent the self-assessment of individual exposures to the risk of discrimination and social exclusion in access to healthcare, employment and public services alongside the progress of NRIS. In addition, a baseline from an earlier period is used to visualize the course of social processes.

AB  - This article argues that news coverage plays an important role for national identity building in the way that it evaluates the own nation better than foreign nations (in-group/out-group bias). This notion is being transferred to the media as an element of national cultural identity. This article identifies analogies between national identity building through the mass media and the third-person perception, which states that people assume others to be more vulnerable to negative media influences. It is hypothesized that patterns of an international third-person perception occur in news coverage, i.e. the news media should present media influences in the own country to be weaker than in other countries. A first standardized content analysis (N = 2204) of newspaper coverage from the US and Germany on elections in own and other countries supports this hypothesis. Consequences are discussed and directions for future research are pointed out.

AB  - This article considers the interplay between Aboriginal people's remembrances about race relations in rural mid-twentieth-century Australia and the frames of remembrance provided by the American Civil rights movement. It takes as its focus two key Australian sites of racial segregation - country town cinemas and public swimming pools - to explore the ways in which since, and in no small part due to, the desegregationist politics of the 1960s they have become prominent sites of public memory. Drawing on three examples from a range of media - art, film and published memoirs - the article traces the ways in which different ways of narrating and remembering these twisted spaces' contributes to and makes possible alternative and at times unsettling interpretations of experiences and histories of relations between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people during what is commonly referred to as the assimilation era'.

AB  - The integration of Quick Response (QR) codes in classrooms have been identified as an important tool in promoting active as well as distributed learning, especially in higher education. Even though the versatility of this technology within the educational milieu cannot be over-emphasized, the initial perceptions of students who are at the centre of QR integration are important towards achieving the prospects of this technology in the pedagogical process, particularly in a large classroom context. Against this backdrop, Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology2 (UTAUT2) were employed as theoretical foundation to study students' perceptions. A questionnaire was used to collect data from 200 students, based on a purposive sampling technique with Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) employed for statistical analysis. Initial results suggested that students had very positive attitudes towards QR code utilization for course related activities which ultimately determined their intentions to accept this technology. However, their positive attitude was anchored on their perceived usefulness and easiness towards QR code which were promoted by perceived playfulness, facilitating conditions and hedonic motivation respectively. The social influence variable was not a predictive factor of students' perception towards the usefulness of QR codes. The study provided practical examples of how QR codes can be integrated in teaching and also recommended future experimental research into QR code effectiveness as well as instructor acceptance if the technology is to be integrated on a wider national scale.

AB  - Research by the Institute of Race Relations into over one hundred incidents of racial violence reported in the mass media in the month after the EU referendum indicates that the spike' in such attacks has to be understood in terms of the racist climate created not just during the clearly nativist referendum debate, but also in the divisive policies and programmes of successive governments preceding it. The politicians and police chiefs, who have recently condemned the violence, analyse it in terms of already given media frameworks about hate crime': bigoted individuals are to blame; this is a law-and-order issue not a socially based problem - thus avoiding any responsibility for the creation of state racism. The research also reveals the central role of the police, at the expense of community groups' or victims' voices, when the media decides an attack is newsworthy.

AB  - ObjectivesMedia effects research has generally ignored the possibility that popular films can affect political attitudes. This omission is puzzling for two reasons. First, research on public opinion finds the potential for persuasion is highest when respondents are unaware that political messages are being communicated. Second, multiple studies have found that entertainment media can alter public opinion. Together, this suggests that popular films containing political messages should possess the potential to influence attitudes.
   MethodsWe develop a laboratory experiment where subjects were randomly assigned to watch a control movie with no political messages, a movie with subtle political messages, or a movie with strong and explicit political messages.
   ResultsWe find that popular movies possess the ability to change political attitudes, especially on issues that are unframed by the media. Furthermore, we show such influence persists over time and is not moderated by partisanship, ideology, or political knowledge.
   ConclusionsOur key findings suggest that a renewed scholarly interest in the political influence of popular movies is clearly warranted.

AB  - Objectives. To evaluate the effectiveness of the Acceptance Journeys social marketing campaign to reduce homophobia in the Black community in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
   Methods. We assessed the campaign's effectiveness using a rolling cross-sectional survey. Data were collected annually online between 2011 and 2015. Each year, a unique sample of Black and White adults, aged 30 years and older, were surveyed in the treatment city (Milwaukee) and in 2 comparison cities that did not have antihomophobia campaigns (St. Louis, MO, and Cleveland, OH; for total sample, n = 3592).
   Results. Black self-identification and Milwaukee residence were significantly associated with exposure to the campaign, suggesting successful message targeting. The relationship between exposure and acceptance of gay men was significantly mediated through attitudes toward gay men, perceptions of community acceptance, and perceptions of the impact of stigma on gay men, but not through rejection of stereotypes. This model accounted for 39% of variance in acceptance.
   Conclusions. This evidence suggests that the Acceptance Journeys model of social marketing may be a promising strategy for addressing homophobia in US Black communities.

AB  - From past research it is well known that social exclusion has detrimental consequences for mental health. To deal with these adverse effects, socially excluded individuals frequently turn to other humans for emotional support. While chatbots can elicit social and emotional responses on the part of the human interlocutor, their effectiveness in the context of social exclusion has not been investigated. In the present study, we examined whether an empathic chatbot can serve as a buffer against the adverse effects of social ostracism. After experiencing exclusion on social media, participants were randomly assigned to either talk with an empathetic chatbot about it (e.g., "I'm sorry that this happened to you") or a control condition where their responses were merely acknowledged (e.g., "Thank you for your feedback"). Replicating previous research, results revealed that experiences of social exclusion dampened the mood of participants. Interacting with an empathetic chatbot, however, appeared to have a mitigating impact. In particular, participants in the chatbot intervention condition reported higher mood than those in the control condition. Theoretical, methodological, and practical implications, as well as directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - This article identifies the increased exposure of racialized violence against Black Americans directly and via the media as potentially posing a deleterious threat to the emotional health and well-being of Black youth. We consider this process of cumulative witnessing to be a form of racial trauma that is deserving of adequate attention in family science. Drawing on previous race-related trauma scholarship, we present a conceptualization of cumulative witnessing that is particularly salient for Black youth and families. We identify both the potential negative effects of increased exposure to racial violence, but also acknowledge the potential for critical consciousness-raising through the familial process of racial socialization. Racial socialization efforts can also be augmented by clinicians who recognize the stress, emotional injury, and trauma related to racism and seek to address these offenses in a clinical context.

AB  - Objective: Black patients and their physicians tend to form relatively negative impressions of each other, and these may contribute to racial disparities in health outcomes. The current research tested the hypothesis that the interaction between positive and negative affective behavior predicts the most positive impressions in clinic visits between Black patients and their oncologists.
   Method: Naive coders rated patients' and oncologists' positive and negative affective behavior in thin slices from 74 video recorded clinic visits. We examined whether (a) physician positive affect, negative affect, or their interaction predicted patients' perceptions of patient-centeredness, trustworthiness, and confidence in recommended treatments and (b) patient positive affect, negative affect, or their interaction predicted physicians' perceptions of patient cognitive ability, likelihood of treatment adherence, and likelihood of treatment tolerance. We also tested whether affective behavior mediated relationships between race-related attitudes and post-visit impressions or influenced post-visit impressions independently of attitudes.
   Results: When oncologists displayed relatively high levels of both positive and negative affect, patients were more confident in recommended treatments but did not rate physicians higher in patient centeredness or trustworthiness. When patients expressed relatively high levels of positive and negative affect, oncologists perceived patients to be higher in cognitive ability and more likely to adhere to treatment recommendations, but no more likely to tolerate treatments. Affective behavior influenced impressions independently of race-related attitudes.
   Conclusions: Positive and negative affective behaviors jointly contribute to impression formation in clinic visits between Black patients and oncologists, and may have implications for patient treatment and outcomes in this underserved patient population.

AB  - Exposure to an outgroup member voicing criticism of his or her own group fosters greater openness to the outgroup's perspective. Research suggests that this effect owes its influence to a serial process in which participants' perception of the risk involved in voicing internal criticism leads to an increase in the perceived credibility of the speaker. The credibility makes it possible for the speaker to be viewed as open-minded, which subsequently inspires greater hope. This process culminates in an increased openness to the outgroup. These findings have been restricted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but here we examine their generalizability to racial conflict in the United States. Results reveal that White Americans exposed to internal criticism expressed by a Black authority figure express greater openness to African-American perspectives on race relations and are more willing to support policies of racial equality. Replicating past research, this effect is serially mediated by risk, credibility, and hope.

AB  - Background:
   Multiple theoretical frameworks identify attitudes and expectancies as important predictors of alcohol behavior. Few studies have examined demographic predictors of these evaluative and belief-based cognitive mediators in the general population, and none have examined them in large-scale studies of Hispanics, a group at higher risk for drinking behavior and problems. This study probes the extent to which dimensions of attitudes and expectancies share common demographic predictors in a large sample of Puerto Ricans, Cuban-Americans, Mexican-Americans, and South/Central Americans.
   Methods:
   The 2006 Hispanic Americans Baseline Alcohol Survey (HABLAS) used a multistage cluster sample design to interview 5,224 individuals randomly selected from households in Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Houston, and Los Angeles. This study focused on 2,773 respondents self-identified as current drinkers. Multiple linear regression was used to identify predictors of positive and negative dimensions of attitudes and expectancies, controlling for various background variables.
   Results:
   Religious affiliation selectively predicted alcohol attitudes, with Catholics having more positive and fewer negative attitudes than other religious groups. Hispanic group selectively predicted alcohol expectancies, with Cuban-Americans having less positive and less negative expectancies than other groups. Being U.S.-born or male predicted more positive attitudes and expectancies, but birthplace and gender did not predict negative dimensions of attitudes or expectancies. Higher acculturation and more education were linked to a decreased tendency to agree with any item. Age was positively and negatively associated with negative expectancies and positive attitudes, respectively, and having never been married, higher income, and unemployment were each linked to fewer negative attitudes.
   Conclusions:
   Although there is some overlap, attitudes and expectancies are influenced by different sociodemographic variables. Positive and negative dimensions of those constructs also show distinct patterns of relations. Prevention and treatment programs targeting cognitive mediators of behavior should be mindful of these differential determinants and future modeling endeavors should incorporate them.

AB  - The opportunities that information and communication technologies (ICTs) provide in the field of healthcare are many and constantly growing. They enable consumers to access health information and remotely receive consultations and treatment. Also, they help improve health promotion activities whose mission is to establish health as a core value.
   The aim of the present study is to examine the attitudes towards the use of ICTs in healthcare.
   Materials and Methods: A direct anonymous survey was conducted among 356 respondents, randomly selected and with an average age of 38.26 +/- 0.15 (110 men and 246 women). The data analysis was performed using statistical software SPSSv.23.0.
   Results: The results showed that 91.6% of respondents have used or are willing to use digital devices to search for health information. A statistical gender difference was found in answer to the question about using a digital device for self-registration of information, as women are more likely to do so. Elderly people are more reserved and hesitant about providing health information to a government agency. Smartphone and computer/laptop are among the most preferred digital modalities in the healthcare field, with men and younger respondents being more likely to use digital devices in relation to their health. Women are more critical about the use of ICTs in healthcare (chi(2) =48.2, P <0.05).
   Conclusion: The present study found a positive attitude among all respondents towards the introduction of ICTs in the healthcare field and the opportunity for a remote contact with medical professionals, using digital devices.

AB  - A majority of Americans identify as sports fans, and sports broadcasts attract substantially larger audiences than news on both broadcast and cable television. But despite the outsize role of sports in American life, we know little about how-or whether-sports fandom is related to political attitudes. This paper draws on a representative survey to examine (1) the association between sports fandom and political opinions; and (2) opposition to the "politicization" of sports. Republicans and Democrats are equally likely to follow sports closely. However, sports fandom is positively associated with individualistic attributions for economic success and support for the US military. In addition, conservatives are more likely to resist the intrusion of partisan politics into sports.

AB  - This study investigates a video game's effects on implicit and explicit attitudes towards depicted historical events in the short- and long-term on a sample of 148 young adults. We used, as an intervention tool, a serious game Czechoslovakia 38-89: Borderlands that deals with the expulsion of the Sudeten Germans from the former Czechoslovakia after the WWII. Results showed more negative pretest-posttest explicit attitude changes towards the expulsion on a general level (d = -0.34) and a specific level (d = -0.53) compared to the control group. Over the long-term, group differences in attitude change remained significant for the specific level (d = -0.44), but not for general one (d = -0.16). Exploratory analysis on the item level indicated that especially attitudes towards the expulsion's (un)fairness were affected by the game. However, no significant changes were found in implicit attitudes in the experimental group. This study is the first of such scale to empirically investigate video games' effects on a society's historical awareness.

KW  - HESITANCY
AB  - COVID-19 severely impacted world health and, as a consequence of the measures implemented to stop the spread of the virus, also irreversibly damaged the world economy. Research shows that receiving the COVID-19 vaccine is the most successful measure to combat the virus and could also address its indirect consequences. However, vaccine hesitancy is growing worldwide and the WHO names this hesitancy as one of the top ten threats to global health. This study investigates the trend in positive attitudes towards vaccines across ten countries since a positive attitude is important. Furthermore, we investigate those variables related to having a positive attitude, as these factors could potentially increase the uptake of vaccines. We derive our text corpus from vaccine-related tweets, harvested in real-time from Twitter. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), we derive the sentiment and emotions contained in the tweets to construct daily time-series data. We analyse a panel dataset spanning both the Northern and Southern hemispheres from 1 February 2021 to 31 July 2021. To determine the relationship between several variables and the positive sentiment (attitude) towards vaccines, we run various models, including POLS, Panel Fixed Effects and Instrumental Variables estimations. Our results show that more information about vaccines' safety and the expected side effects are needed to increase positive attitudes towards vaccines. Additionally, government procurement and the vaccine rollout should improve. Accessibility to the vaccine should be a priority, and a collective effort should be made to increase positive messaging about the vaccine, especially on social media. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of the emotional challenges associated with vaccine uptake and inform policymakers, health workers, and stakeholders who communicate to the public during infectious disease outbreaks. Additionally, the global fight against COVID-19 might be lost if the attitude towards vaccines is not improved.

AB  - Three experiments investigated whether and why sharing experiences of social exclusion or social acceptance with others strengthens social bonds. Participants experienced either social exclusion or social acceptance alongside another co-participant who either also experienced the same outcome, or experienced a different outcome, as them. Multilevel modeling results showed that participant dyads who shared the experience of social exclusion or social acceptance felt closer to each other than those who experienced different outcomes, and that perceived similarity mediated the effect of shared experiences on social bonds. Interestingly, participants felt closer to one another after having shared social acceptance, more so than when they have shared social exclusion. Implications of the present findings are interpreted in light of theories of social exclusion, shared experiences, and social bonding.

KW  - Pandemic
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly altered the behavior of adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer. No data exists on how gender influences the adherence of individuals with cancer to COVID-19 related public health guidelines and their preferred methods of receiving COVID-19 related information.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of adolescents and young adults with cancer. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess differences in adherence to COVID-19 preventative behaviors, and differences in preferred information sources of COVID-19 related information between men and women.
   Results: Among 633 participants, adherence to key COVID-19 preventative measures was 44.9-58.8% for males and 53.4-68.1% for females. After adjusting for key confounding variables in multivariable analysis, males were less likely to adhere to frequent hand washing (AOR [adjusted odds ratio] 1.45, 95% CI [confidence interval] 1.03-2.03), not touching face (AOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.29-2.56) and social distancing (AOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.37-2.71) than females. Both genders preferred to receive information from their cancer institutes and social media.
   Discussion: Gender-specific interventions are needed to improve the adherence of males to COVID-19 precautionary measures. Information should be disseminated via cancer institutes and social media as these are the preferred sources of COVID-19 related information among AYAs with cancer.

AB  - Introduction: Secure parental attachment improves the perception of available social support and the socialization of emotion regulation strategies. Research has suggested that both perceived social support and emotion regulation help individuals reappraise stressful situations as less stressful. Individuals under stress are at an increased risk for psychological problems. Method: The current study examined whether social support, emotion regulation, and psychological inflexibility mediated the relation between parental attachment and psychological problems after a social exclusion task. Results: Results indicated that secure parental attachment was associated with an increased ability to up-regulate emotions and with an increase in the perception of available social support. Secure attachment to either parent was indirectly associated with psychological problems reported after social exclusion. Discussion: Indirect effects were found only for pathways from attachment through emotion regulation strategies, which suggests that emotion regulation may be a driving factor between attachment to parental figures and stress induced psychological problems. Further results, limitations, and implications were discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to understand the process of attitudinal changes towards a brand in crisis and the brand's communication around the crisis by utilising balance theory and brand personality. Four crisis case studies were selected and data was collected from brands' Twitter platforms on either side of the crisis event horizon. Results demonstrate an opportunity to update the balance theory approach in a crisis by considering the type of crisis (product harm vs. moral harm) relative to brand personality (brand competence vs. brand character). Balance theory helps explain how consumer attitude changes occur through a crisis. Further, the mapping of brand communications in social media over four selected case studies show that brand personality identity can change as a result of a crisis and demonstrate how brand managers can actively frame their online communication to help the brand to recover more effectively from a crisis.

AB  - Purpose: The COVID-19 outbreak has caused governments to put pandemic-related guidelines requiring compliance and understanding by healthcare professionals to mitigate its spread uncontrollably. We studied pharmacists' knowledge, attitude, and practice towards the COVD-19 outbreak compared with other healthcare workers during the pandemic in Saudi Arabia. Methods: We surveyed pharmacists' socio-demographics (n=50) compared with other healthcare professionals (n=378) during lockdown starting in June 2020. We measured respondents' level of knowledge (n=10 questions, maximum score of 10), attitude (n=17 questions, maximum score of 80), and their practices (n=16 questions, maximum score of 80) towards COVID-19 infection. Results: Median knowledge score was 8 (25th-75th percentiles: 7-9), attitude score 76 (70- 80) and practice score 74 (68-78). Good knowledge predictors were >20 years working experience [OR: 2.05 (95% CI: 1.03-4.06); P=0.04] and >50% working in clinical practice [OR: 1.72 (95% CI: 1.12-2.66); P=0.01], in inverse relationship with paramedical profes-sions [OR: 0.45 (95% CI: 0.45 (0.28-0.72)); P=0.001] and working in a university hospital [OR: 0.51 (95% CI: 0.33. 0.81); P=0.004]. Availability of pharmaceutical information and treatment options was associated with good attitude [OR: 2.19 (95% CI: 1.04-4.59); P=0.039] and acquaintance as primary information sources negatively associated with good attitude [OR: 0.34 (95% CI: 0.15-0.8); P=0.013]. Good practice predictors were female gender [OR: 3.84 (95% CI: 2.37-6.24); P<0.001], military hospital employment [OR: 2.32 (95% CI: 1.25-4.31); P=0.008], USA [OR: 3.41 (95% CI: 1.03-11.22); P=0.044] or UK [OR: 8.86 (95% CI: 1.91-41.07); P=0.005] qualifications, and information on supportive measures [OR: 2.2 (95% CI: 1.36-3.56); P=0.001]. Conclusion: Health workers displayed good knowledge about COVID-19, while profession and working experience predicted adequate knowledge, positive attitude, or practice towards disease management.

AB  - This paper is aimed to document the observed social exclusion and discrimination in the outbreak of COVID-19 across the world and inside of China. Discrimination and social exclusion has occurred in various forms, while 25.11% of respondents overseas experienced discrimination in the breakout of COVID-19, and 90% of respondents inside of China exhibited discriminatory attitudes. The discrimination and social exclusion also lead to a range of damaging social outcomes. Thus, this is an urgent call for the inclusiveness in policy and media in the face of this public health emergency.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate students' intention to continue using online learning platforms during face-to-face traditional classes in a way that is parallel to their usage during online virtual classes (during the pandemic). This investigation of students' intention is based on a conceptual model that uses newly used external factors in addition to the technology acceptance model (TAM) contrasts; hence, it takes into consideration users' satisfaction, the external factor of information richness (IR) and the quality of the educational system and information disseminated. The participants were 768 university students who have experienced the teaching environments of both traditional face-to-face classes and online classes during the pandemic. A structural equation modelling (SEM) test was conducted to analyse the independent variables, including the users' situation awareness (SA), perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, satisfaction, IR, education system quality and information quality. An online questionnaire was used to explore students' perceptions of their intention to use online platforms accessibly in a face-to-face learning environment. The results showed that (a) students prefer online platforms that have a higher level of content richness, to be able to implement the three dimensions of users' situation awareness (perception, comprehension and projection); (b) there were significant effects of TAM constructs on students' satisfaction and acceptance; (c) students are in favour of using a learning platform that is characterised by a high level of educational system quality and information quality and (d) students with a higher level of satisfaction have a more positive attitude in their willingness to use the online learning system.

KW  - DISTRACTION
KW  - ERRORS
AB  - This research investigated the direct and indirect effects of the characteristics of motor vehicle drivers in Nebraska, including their socioeconomic characteristics, safe driving knowledge, and attitudes to inattentive driving at highway-rail grade crossings (HRGCs). A random statewide mail survey of drivers aged 19 years or older provided the data analyzed in this research. The use of a structural equation model (SEM) enabled identification of direct and indirect effects among the variables. Conclusions were that drivers' attitudes toward safety issues at HRGCs had both direct and indirect effects on drivers' inattentive behavior. Drivers' intent to violate or obey driving regulations indirectly influenced driver inattention. Their overall knowledge of safely negotiating HRGCs did not directly affect inattentive driving, but it indirectly affected inattentive driving through interference with drivers' intent to violate or obey regulations. Drivers' perceptions of delay, safety, clarity, and reliability indirectly affected their inattentive behavior. Variables associated with fewer instances of inattentive driving included: positive attitudes toward safety issues at HRGCs; lower intent to violate (or greater intent to obey) driving rules at HRGCs; less frequent use of HRGCs; higher perceptions of the safety, reliability, and so forth of local HRGCs; older drivers (>= 60); better knowledge of safely negotiating HRGCs; lower educational levels; male drivers; lower income households (<US$30 k per year); and longer residency in the current city. Safety information dissemination, high household income (>US$100 k per year), and younger drivers had direct effects on drivers' safe driving knowledge and could lead to higher overall knowledge levels of safely negotiating HRGCs.

AB  - Loneliness has a significant impact on the health and wellbeing of people. The COVID-19 pandemic has demanded individuals to socially distance, which has implications for loneliness and social isolation. This cross-sectional study explored the ways in which people in the United States (N = 412) are meeting their social needs in a time of social distancing, how these activities relate to levels of loneliness, and any differences among young, middle-aged, and older adults. Results indicated higher levels of loneliness and social isolation for the entire sample and across the three age groups from pre- to during COVID-19 with younger adults experiencing higher levels of emotional loneliness during COVID-19. The extent to which the activities were related to loneliness was only found among the young adults and older adults where outdoor meet-ups, talking on the phone, and texting was associated with lower levels of loneliness among the young adults, and engaging in social media and talking on the phone was associated with lower levels of loneliness among the older adults. The findings support social work and public health recommendations for addressing loneliness during times of social distancing under the COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises.

AB  - This study employed a qualitative approach to explore the attitudes and experiences of older people towards using gerontechnology, and to determine the underlying reasons that might account for their use and non-use of gerontechnology. Four focus group discussions and 26 individual interviews were undertaken. Qualitative data were analyzed using NVivo software and were categorized using coding and grounded theory techniques. The result indicated that old people in Hong Kong had an overall positive attitude toward technology. Positive attitudes were most frequently related to enhanced convenience and advanced features. Negative attitudes were most frequently associated with health risks and social problems arising from using technology (e. g., social isolation and addiction). Usage of technology is driven by outcome expectations and social influences, and supported by facilitators, whereas non-use of gerontechnology relates to the personal (e. g., health and functional capacities), technological (e. g., cost and complexity), and environmental barriers experienced. Use of gerontechnology is a synthesis of person, technology, and environment. To encourage non-users to adopt technology, there is a need to remove barriers at personal, technological, and environmental levels.

Students (N=3628) at a university in the Philippines completed a survey assessing the above constructs. The results showed that attitude towards technology, number of social network site memberships and GPA-predicted global citizenship identification, and subsequent prosocial outcomes (e.g. intergroup helping, responsibility to act for the betterment of the world), through the perception that valued others prescribe a global citizen identity (normative environment) and perceived knowledge of the world and felt interconnectedness with others (global awareness). The results highlight the associations between technology and academic performance with a global identity and associated values.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a public health emergency. Social distancing is a key approach to slowing disease transmission. However, more evidence is needed on its efficacy, and little is known on the types of areas where it is more or less effective. We obtained county-level data on COVID-19 incidence and mortality during the first wave, smartphone-based average social distancing (0-5, where higher numbers indicate more social distancing), and census data on demographics and socioeconomic status. Using generalized linear mixed models with a Poisson distribution, we modeled associations between social distancing and COVID-19 incidence and mortality, and multiplicative interaction terms to assess effect modification. In multivariable models, each unit increase in social distancing was associated with a 26% decrease (p < 0.0001) in COVID-19 incidence and a 31% decrease (p < 0.0001) in COVID-19 mortality. Percent crowding, minority population, and median household income were all statistically significant effect modifiers. County-level increases in social distancing led to reductions in COVID-19 incidence and mortality but were most effective in counties with lower percentages of black residents, higher median household incomes, and with lower levels of household crowding.

AB  - Y The world is facing an unprecedented economic, social and political crisis with the spread of COVID-19. The Corona Virus (COVID-19) and its global spread have resulted in declaring a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The deadly pandemic of 21st century has spread its wings across the globe with an exponential increase in the number of cases in many countries. The developing and underdeveloped countries are struggling hard to counter the rapidly growing and widespread challenge of COVID-19 because it has greatly influenced the global economies whereby the underdeveloped countries are more affected by its devastating impacts, especially the life of the lowincome population. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) were particularly useful in spreading key emergency information and helping to maintain extensive social distancing. Updated information and testing results were published on national and local government websites. Mobile devices were used to support early testing and contact tracing. The government provided free smartphone apps that flagged infection hotspots with text alerts on testing and local cases. The purpose of this research work is to provide an in depth overview of emerging technologies and recent ICT developments to combat COVID-19 Pandemic. Finally, the author highlights open challenges in order to give future research directions.

AB  - We examined differences in the ways in which men and women perceive and react to social exclusion. Men typically experience agentic-type threats in a social exclusion context and are motivated to improve their agentic belief in themselves, whereas women experience communal-type threats and pay greater attention to others. In this study, we employed the pursuit of money as an agentic form of compensation and pursuit of attention as a communal form of compensation. In 2 experiments with high school students as participants (N = 103 and 126, respectively), we found that social exclusion increases the preference of men for a high salary and the preference of women for conspicuous products, and that self-focus mediates these effects. We have contributed to the literature by exploring the different coping strategies of men and women who face social exclusion.

AB  - A woman's social behaviour reportedly varies across the menstrual cycle. In this study, we estimated changes in sensitivity to social exclusion across the menstrual cycle and scrutinized the related role of progesterone. Fortynine naturally cycling women played a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball) to manipulate social inclusion. All participants underwent inclusion and exclusion conditions during the late follicular and the luteal phase. We assessed salivary progesterone concentrations at each cycle phase. After each Cyberball session we measured positive/negative mood using the Multidimensional Mood State Questionnaire (MDMQ). Multilevel analyses indicated that women showed worse mood following exclusion as compared to inclusion conditions (p = 0.014). Notably, this exclusion effect was more pronounced during the luteal phase than the late follicular phase (p = 0.029). As expected, progesterone concentrations were higher during the luteal phase as compared to the late follicular phase, but interestingly, progesterone concentrations were negatively associated with exclusion effects. When accounting for mediation via progesterone, direct cycle-phase related differences in social exclusion effects even increased as compared to the model without mediator. These findings suggest that progesterone may function as buffer against negative feelings that result from being socially excluded. The relevance of these findings for Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) are discussed, and we conclude that social exclusion may represent an important research domain criterion (RDoC) of relevance for PMDD, with progesterone pointing to new potential pharmacological targets.

AB  - Searching for information on the web is regarded as a complex problem-solving activity involving a range of cognitive and affective processes. Anxiety is a key affective factor. In this article, we describe the construction and initial validation stages of the Information Retrieval on the Web Anxiety Rate (IROWAR) scale. The final structure of this inventory was validated with a sample of 183 English-speaking Internet users. Reliability analyses indicated that the factors were internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha: 0.92). When we checked divergent validity, we found negative correlations with both self-efficacy and positive attitude towards the Internet. There were no effects of either sex or age on the total IROWAR score, but the Internet search anxiety sum score decreased with the length of use. This scale will be useful in several domains, including research on the determinants of web anxiety, individuals' experience of web anxiety and ways of supporting them and Internet learning.
   RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS
   We report the construction and validation of a web anxiety scale with a good fit.
   Physical feelings and negative cognitions of anxiety are both factors for web search anxiety.
   Self-efficacy and positive attitude towards the Internet are negatively linked to anxiety.
   Anxiety decreases with the length of Internet use.
   There is no link between anxiety and self-reported skills.
   The Information Retrieval on the Web Anxiety Rate (IROWAR) scale will be useful in research on the determinants of Web anxiety in both educational and work environments.

TI  - Valorization of an 'Enemy Language': Politics of 'Progressive Anti-War' Position and English-Worship in the Japanese TV Show Massan
T2  - JAPANESE STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - This article analyzes portrayals of English in Japan during World War II in Massan, a Japanese television show that features the life of a mixed-race bilingual couple, Masaharu (the Japanese husband) and Ellie (the Scottish wife), and their adopted Japanese daughter (Ema) living in Japan. I argue that the show constructs a hierarchy of languages where English is valorized as a sign of an anti-war position, speaking one's mind and material wealth, all framed as progressive, in contrast to Japanese language. As the use of language is connected to race relations in the drama, this hierarchisation of English and Japanese languages is consistent with the historical and current valorization of English and whiteness in Japan. However, this hierarchy contradicts the show's explicit message of inclusiveness of all races. This article analyses a set of performative messages conveyed by this highly popular drama in the current Japanese political and racial context to show the ways uses of language convey unarticulated and sometimes contradictory messages.

AB  - Two experiments examined the effects of different sources (celebrity versus peer consumer) of celebrity brand-related user-generated content (UGC) embedded in a social networking site (SNS). Consistent with the basic premises of warranting theory (stronger effects of other-endorsement than self-endorsement) and social identity theory (more positive effects of ingroup than outgroup), Experiment 1 demonstrated more positive effects of celebrity brand endorsements posted on a peer consumer's (other; in-group identity) Facebook profile page on source credibility perception and parasocial interaction with the celebrity than celebrity brand endorsements posted on the celebrity's own (self; out-group identity) Face book profile page. Social identification mediated the effects of the Facebook profile source on parasocial interaction with the celebrity. Experiment 2 indicated that a movie star's Facebook presence contributed to a more positive attitude toward the celebrity. A peer Facebook user's movie endorsement UGC resulted in greater advertising believability, more positive attitude toward, and more positive emotional reactions toward system-generated content (SGC) sponsored Facebook advertising than the movie star's self promotion on his own Facebook page. In addition, movie involvement moderated the relationship between the Facebook profile source and advertising effectiveness. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To minimise risk, consumers seek out eWOM, recommendations, and reviews from others before making purchasing decisions. However, it is not uncommon to see companies masterminding deceptive eWOM, disguising promotional messages as user-generated product reviews to attract and retain consumers. The extant literature is extremely limited regarding deceptive eWOM and its long-term effects. Ours is the first longitudinal study to examine consumers' belief and attitude changes in the context of deceptive eWOM. This study found that, in a herding situation, deceptive eWOM can strongly influence changes in consumers' beliefs and attitudes, whether in the early phase or mainstream phase, at the pre-adoption stage. If deceptive eWOM emerges earlier, it has a more powerful influence later. At the post-adoption stage, once they have used it, consumers may change their evaluations of a new product. However, this new evaluation is still subject to the initial anchoring effect brought by deceptive eWOM. If consumers sense deceptive eWOM and attribute it to a certain responsible party, the anchoring effect will be weakened. These findings provide further knowledge and understanding of the effects of deceptive eWOM, with implications for firms seeking to develop more effective eWOM marketing strategies.

AB  - This article examines the emotive narratives surrounding the "new normal" of social distancing practices during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic, as revealed by religion-focused Internet memes. In March 2020, many people were introduced to the concept of "social distancing" for the first time via news reports and media coverage of the spreading COVID-19 pandemic which led to the first lockdown. As the year progressed, social distancing discourse was combined with discussion of the practices of masking and quarantining, all of which became part of many countries' normal routines as a public health management strategy. Over time, social distancing has become a widely used public health strategy impacting many social groups, including religious adherents and their places of worship. Memes became a discursive space where practices of social distancing and religious attitudes towards these practices were expressed and debated. By examining memes centered on American Christianity, this study reveals that memetic narratives in the early months of the pandemic indicate a positive framing of behaviors intended to help reduce the spread of COVID-19, and a negative framing of the attitudes of religious individuals and organizations who seem to privilege the cultural practices of their belief over the core values of the Christian faith.

AB  - It is well established that mainstream personality traits are associated with moderate, traditional political attitudes. However, very little is known regarding trait predictors of extreme political attitudes. In the current study (N = 511 U.S. residents), we examined the relationships between the Dark Triad traits, Entitlement and three extreme political attitudes that are highly covered in mainstream media: White Identitarianism ('Alt-Right'), Political Correctness-Authoritarianism, and Political Correctness-Liberalism. We found that Dark Triad traits and Entitlement had incremental validity in the prediction of these 3 attitudes over demographic factors. The Dark Triad traits and Entitlement explained a substantial portion of variance in White Identitarianism and Political Correctness-Authoritarianism, and only a small portion of variance in Political Correctness-Liberalism. Across all attitudes, Psychopathy and Entitlement were the most consistent, strongest predictors. Results indicate that, from a Dark Triad perspective, Authoritarian PC advocates have more in common with extreme right advocates than those holding PC views related to compassion.

AB  - This study investigates to what extent greetings on a social network site popular with South Asians are associated with the degree of interpersonal closeness of the users, educated middle class Bengalis in the United States. Computer-mediated discourse analysis, face-to-face interviews, and participant observation were employed to analyze the textual comments exchanged in 79 Bengali dyads. The analyses reveal a relationship between degree of social distance and frequencies of Bangla greetings when type of greeting (regular vs. ritualistic) and manner of expression (unmarked vs. intensified) are taken into account. However, some aspects of the interplay between interpersonal closeness and greetings can only be understood if cultural nuances and medium factors are taken into consideration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose Currently, consumers can easily access social media to share information and experiences. How a relationship between these consumers influences their decisions has not been clearly investigated. When consumers participate in information sharing activities, they usually communicate with each other and can perceive their social distance from others. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore the direct and indirect effects of perceived social distance on eWOM sharing intentions.
   Design/methodology/approach Specifically, a moderated mediation model was validated, in which the indirect effect of perceived social distance on eWOM sharing intentions through reciprocity expectations was moderated by trust.
   Findings Perceived social distance had a positive indirect effect on eWOM sharing intentions through reciprocity expectations, which was found to be negatively moderated by trust.
   Originality/value This study integrates the concept of perceived social distance into the eWOM research area. Moreover, this result adds to the s-commerce literature by specifying the conditions of the indirect effect of perceived social distance through reciprocity expectations on eWOM sharing intention.

AB  - Phubbing (phone-snubbing) has become a pervasive public communication phenomenon which adversely affects its targets and sources. Yet, research on phubbing is not built on a consistent theoretical basis and examinations on its effects on the public are still missing. This study aimed at addressing these research gaps by conceptualizing the behavior as an act of smartphone-induced social exclusion and investigating whether phubbing impacts its observers. In a between-subject experiment, N = 160 participants observed photos of dyadic interpersonal interactions in different everyday contexts which depicted one-sided, reciprocal, or no phubbing. Results revealed that observers of phubbing experienced negative affect and stress. Observers also derogated individuals who used their smartphones in social interactions regarding their warmth and competence; these effects were mediated by observers' perceived relationship quality between the observed persons. Affective and cognitive outcomes emerged independently of observers' gender. As these findings are in line with the effects and processes outlined in the temporal need-threat model of ostracism (i.e., social exclusion), they support the assumptions that phubbing is a form of smartphone-induced social exclusion and that its negative effects go beyond social interactions in which the behavior occurs. With this, the present study expands research regarding a modern communication phenomenon by strengthening its theoretical foundation and arriving at important theoretical and practical implications concerning targets, sources, and observers of phubbing.

AB  - Purpose The increase in autism prevalence and presentation in the media suggests a rise in public awareness. This paper aims to explore what factors (contact, knowledge and ethnicity) may be associated to positive attitudes towards individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Design/methodology/approach An online survey examined contact with and knowledge of ASD among Black, Asian and White ethnic groups to predict public attitudes to people with ASD. Findings In multiple regression models, the results suggested that the level of contact predicts positive attitudes towards autism when demographic factors were accounted. The level of knowledge about autism were significantly associated to attitudes, but not consistently when demographic factors were accounted. However, differences in knowledge and attitudes to people with ASD were identified amongst Black, Asian and White ethnic groups. Research limitations/implications These findings have implications for policy and public health and education campaigns, including ensuring contact and knowledge of autism among the public. Originality/value These findings have implications for policy and public health and education campaigns, including ensuring contact and knowledge of autism among the public. Additionally, further effort is required to target public knowledge and attitudes to autism, particularly among ethnic groups. Institutional support tailored to encourage structured and unstructured contact across public domains such as education, health, social and care practices could effectively reduce prejudice between the public and people with ASD over time.

AB  - Studies on cyberbullying have revealed an inconsistent relationship between trait empathy and bystanders' aggressive tendencies towards victims. We believe that these studies have overlooked the role of social exclusion. We infer that high-severity social exclusion suppresses the negative relationship between trait empathy and bystanders' aggressive tendencies. In Study 1,226 participants read a news report concerning a singer's humiliation by netizens due to lack of talent. The results revealed that trait empathy predicted lower aggressive tendencies towards the singer for participants with fewer experiences of social exclusion. However, trait empathy was unrelated to aggressive tendencies for participants with more experiences of social exclusion. In Study 2,146 participants were randomly assigned to a low-severity or a high-severity social exclusion condition and were required to recall their experiences of low- or high-severity social exclusion, respectively. The results demonstrated that in the low-severity condition, trait empathy was negatively associated with participants' aggressive tendencies towards the singer and this relationship was mediated by state empathy. However, there was no evidence that the process was at work in the high-severity condition. This study further presents implications and directions for future research.

AB  - Background: This experimental study tests effects of exposure to video narratives about successful symptom relief with Medical Cannabis (MC) on attitudes, beliefs, and intentions related to recreational cannabis use.
   Methods: Patient video testimonials were modeled after those found in extant media coverage. Israeli participants (N = 396) recruited through an online survey company were randomly assigned to view a narrative or a non-narrative video containing equivalent information about MC. Video content was further manipulated based on whether the protagonist had a stigmatized disease or not, and whether attribution of responsibility for his disease was internal or external.
   Results: Exposure to patient testimonials indirectly increased positive attitudes, beliefs and intentions related to recreational cannabis use through changing attitudes, beliefs and intentions related to MC. Furthermore, exposure to narratives in which the patient was presented as not to blame for contracting his illness (external attribution) was associated with more positive attitudes, beliefs and intentions toward MC, a factor that was significantly associated with more positive attitudes, beliefs and intentions related to recreational cannabis use.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that narrative news media coverage of MC may influence public attitudes toward recreational cannabis. Because such media stories continue to be commonplace, it is important to examine potential spillover effects of this coverage on public perceptions of recreational cannabis. Cannabis prevention programs should address the role of media coverage in shaping public opinion and address the distinction between medical and recreational cannabis use.

AB  - When the leader of a firm commits a professional transgression, how would customers' judgments of the transgressor's professional performance and immorality differ from those of noncustomers'? This research answers this question by investigating factors that explain the discrepancy in moral judgments between noncustomers and customers affiliated with the firm of a transgressing leader. Drawing on construal level theory, our two experimental studies consistently demonstrate that relative to high social distance (i.e., noncustomers), low social distance (i.e., customers) leads to more positive judgments of the transgressor's professional performance, but differences in the social distance do not directly lead to disparities in judgments of immorality. Social distance, however, affects both performance and immorality judgments when mediating mechanisms (conscious and nonconscious moral reasoning) are accounted for, such that low social distance indirectly influences customers to be more lenient in not only their performance judgments but also their immorality judgments. This research contributes to the topic of morality that permeates the current discourse on ethical business transgressions and, in particular, to an understanding of specific mechanisms that guide consumers' moral judgments.

AB  - Social distancing during the coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is crucial to reduce the spread of the virus. However, its effectiveness hinges on adherence by individuals who face substantial burdens from the required behavioral restrictions. Here, we investigate sources of individual variation in adhering to social distancing guidelines. In a high-powered study (N= 895), we tested direct and indirect effects of boredom and self-control on adherence. The results showed that both traits were important predictors of adherence but the underlying mechanisms differed. Specifically, individuals high in boredom perceived social distancing as more difficult, which in turn reduced their adherence (i.e., a mediated effect). In contrast, individuals high in self-control adhered more to the guidelines without perceiving them as more or less difficult; however, self-control moderated the effect of difficulty on adherence. Our results are immediately relevant to improve the efficacy of social distancing guidelines in the COVID-19 response.

AB  - Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) show interpersonal deficits, and altered emotional and oxytocin (OT) responses to social exclusion (Cyberball). In order to extend previous findings, this study applies a novel Cyberball variant. Nineteen BPD patients and 56 healthy controls (HC) played Cyberball for 2 minutes of inclusion, 5 minutes of partial exclusion by one of two co-players, and 2 minutes total exclusion by both. Plasma OT levels at baseline and after 7, 9, 15, and 40 minutes were measured with radioimmunoassay. BPD patients showed a greater aversive reaction and a trend for greater OT reduction after social exclusion than HC. BPD patients also tended to play less frequently with the excluder. Though limited by our sample size, we partially replicate previous findings. Our preliminary behavioral data support the notion of an altered OT regulation and reduced capacity for social cooperation in BPD.

AB  - With the tourism and hospitality sector reopening post-lockdown of COVID-19, the recovery of customers' purchase intentions is essential to reboot the sector. This study aims to examine the relationship between social distancing measures and purchase intentions in the UK's restaurant and hotel sectors using a propensity score weighting experimental design method. The findings suggest that the impact of social distancing measures on purchase intentions is mediated by the trust in the targeted restaurant and hotel. Risk tolerance significantly moderates the influence of social distancing measures on trust; (non-) cash promotions have an insignificant impact on purchase intentions. The introduction of the propensity score weighting scheme addresses the endogeneity caused by the sampling bias in non-probability sampling experiment studies.

AB  - Neuroimaging studies using the social-exclusion paradigm Cyberball indicate increased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and right insula activity as a function of exclusion. However, comparatively less work has been done on how social status factors may moderate this finding. This study used the Cyberball paradigm with 85 (45 females) socio-economically diverse participants from a larger longitudinal sample. We tested whether neighborhood quality during adolescence would predict subsequent neural responding to social exclusion in young adulthood. Given previous behavioral studies indicating greater social vigilance and negative evaluation as a function of lower status, we expected that lower adolescent neighborhood quality would predict greater dACC activity during exclusion at young adulthood. Our findings indicate that young adults who lived in low-quality neighborhoods in adolescence showed greater dACC activity to social exclusion than those who lived in higher quality neighborhoods. Lower neighborhood quality also predicted greater prefrontal activation in the superior frontal gyrus, dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and the middle frontal gyrus, possibly indicating greater regulatory effort. Finally, this effect was not driven by subsequent ratings of distress during exclusion. In sum, adolescent neighborhood quality appears to potentiate neural responses to social exclusion in young adulthood, effects that are independent of felt distress.

AB  - Fear acquisition and generalization play key roles in promoting the survival of mammals and contribute to anxiety disorders. While previous research has provided much evidence for the repercussions of social exclusion on mental health, how social exclusion affects fear acquisition and generalization has received scant attention. In our study, participants were divided into two groups according to two Cyberball paradigm conditions (exclusion/ inclusion). Both groups underwent a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and skin conductance response (SCR) assessments. We aimed to determine the effects of social exclusion on fear acquisition and generalization and whether modulation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) mediates this relationship. Our results showed that socially excluded participants featured significantly higher and lower shock risk scores to safety stimuli (conditioned stimulus, CS-) and threatening stimuli (CS+), respectively, than did socially included subjects during fear acquisition. The exclusion group had increased skin conductance re-sponses (SCRs) to CS and exhibited heightened shock risk and increased SCRs to generalized stimuli compared with the inclusion group. The fNIRS results demonstrated that the CS + evoked larger oxy-Hb changes in the mPFC in the inclusion group than in the exclusion group during fear acquisition. Furthermore, the oxy-Hb of left mPFC of CS + mediated the effect on the association between social exclusion and perceived risk of CS+ in the fear acquisition. Our results indicate that social exclusion impairs fear acquisition and generalization via the mediation of the mPFC and that social exclusion increases susceptibility to anxiety disorders through bias pro-cessing of fear discrimination in fear acquisition and generalization. By studying the role of social relationship in fear acquisition and generalization, our research provides new insights into the pathological mechanisms of anxiety disorder.

AB  - Building on common identity theory and intergroup contact theory, this study sought to further understanding of people-place relationships by developing a holistic theoretical model to scrutinize place attachment as an antecedent of social distance, mediated by emotional solidarity and moderated by frequency of contact between tourists and residents. Visitor data analyzed with SEM revealed that place dependence is a significant predictor of social distance given it affects affinity positively and avoidance negatively, both of which are mediated by the three dimensions of emotional solidarity. Furthermore, the mediated relationships (via emotional solidarity) between place attachment and social distance vary by level of visitors' frequency of interaction with residents. This study expands current theorization by examining the merits of emotional solidarity as an affective link in a tourist cognitive-behavioral model. From a practical standpoint, DMOs need to understand these construct linkages and include residents in their marketing strategies to increase repeat visitation.

AB  - Since the late 1990s public opinion about cannabis legalization has become drastically more liberal, and some states have begun to legalize cannabis for recreational use. Why have attitudes changed so much? Prior research has considered a few of the reasons for this change, but this is the first comprehensive and empirically-based study to consider the wide range of potential causes for how and why this happened. We use data from the General Social Survey, National Study of Drug Use and Health, and word searches from the New York Times. We find that attitudes largely liberalized via intracohort changes. Most Americans developed more liberal views, regardless of their race and ethnicity, gender, education, religious or political affiliation, or religious engagement. Changes in cannabis use have had minimal effects on attitudes, and legalization of cannabis has not prompted attitude change in neighboring states. As to root causes, evidence suggests that a decrease in religious affiliation, a decline in punitiveness, and a shift in media framing all contributed to changing attitudes.

AB  - The characteristics of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and their implementation at a global level have led to significant changes in different areas, especially institutional ones. This article presents the results of a research study whose purpose was to observe the level of digital competence of university students of education and to verify whether the variables of gender and age have any influence on it. A quantitative methodology was used, with a non-experimental, descriptive and inferential method, and the digital questionnaire was employed as an instrument for collecting information on the dimensions of knowledge and management of ICT as well as attitudes towards them. The data were analyzed based on a comparison of mean values, using non-parametric tests. The results show that the sample studied self-evaluated their knowledge of ICT concepts negatively, considered their management of devices, tools and services positively, and showed a very positive attitude toward technology. Regarding the variables studied, significant differences were found in favor of men in relation to knowledge and management, and in favor of older respondents with regard to attitude.

AB  - We examined whether adolescents' neural responses to social exclusion and inclusion are influenced by their own popularity and acceptance and by the popularity of their excluders and includers. Accepted adolescents are highly prosocial. In contrast, popular adolescents, who are central and influential, show prosocial as well as antisocial behaviors, such as peer exclusion. Fifty-two 12-16 year-old adolescents underwent an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan while playing the ball-tossing game Cyberball in which they received or did not receive the ball from other virtual players. The other virtual players were described as either highly popular or average in popularity. Participants' own popularity and acceptance were assessed with peer nominations at school (n = 31). Participants' acceptance was positively correlated with activity of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during exclusion. Participants' popularity was positively associated with ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex activity during exclusion, but only when the excluders were popular virtual players. Participants showed increased rostral ACC activation to inclusion by players who were average in popularity. These findings indicate that peer status plays an important role in adolescents' neural processing of social exclusion and inclusion. Moreover, these findings underscore that popularity and acceptance are distinct types of high peer status in adolescence, with not only distinct behavioral correlates, but also distinct neural correlates.

AB  - Self-generated thought has an important impact on attitude change, with repeated demonstrations of increased opportunity for thought about an attitude object increasing attitude extremity. The traditional explanation for this mere thought effect is that more time to think allows people to produce more attitude-consistent thoughts, which polarize their attitudes. Expanding on this structural perspective, the current research explores a metacognitive account for the effect of time on attitude polarization. Three experiments demonstrate that thought confidence plays an independent mediating role in the mere thought effect (Experiment 1), that it accounts for reversals in the mere thought effect when people have too much time to think (Experiment 2), and that this reversal is tied to the difficulty people have retrieving thoughts when too much time is provided (Experiment 3). Thus, taking metacognitive features of thought into account sheds new light on self-persuasion in the mere thought paradigm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Social distancing is an important component of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic Minimizing social interactions and travel reduces the rate at which the infection spreads and "flattens the curve" so that the medical system is better equipped to treat infected individuals. However, it remains unclear how the public will respond to these policies as the pandemic continues.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to present the Twitter Social Mobility Index, a measure of social distancing and travel derived from Twitter data. We used public geolocated Twitter data to measure how much users travel in a given week.
   Methods: We collected 469,669,925 tweets geotagged in the United States from January 1, 2019, to April 27, 2020. We analyzed the aggregated mobility variance of a total of 3,768,959 Twitter users at the city and state level from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Results: We found a large reduction (61.83%) in travel in the United States after the implementation of social distancing policies. However, the variance by state was high, ranging from 38.54% to 76.80%. The eight states that had not issued statewide social distancing orders as of the start of April ranked poorly in terms of travel reduction: Arkansas (45), Iowa (37), Nebraska (35), North Dakota (22), South Carolina (38), South Dakota (46), Oklahoma (50), Utah (14), and Wyoming (53). We are presenting our findings on the internet and will continue to update our analysis during the pandemic.
   Conclusions: We observed larger travel reductions in states that were early adopters of social distancing policies and smaller changes in states without such policies. The results were also consistent with those based on other mobility data to a certain extent. Therefore, geolocated tweets are an effective way to track social distancing practices using a public resource, and this tracking may be useful as part of ongoing pandemic response planning.

AB  - Purpose Rates of diseases caused by poor diet have seen no reduction in recent years. In this scenario, nutritional information labels and health claims could play a decisive role in modifying product attitudes and purchase intention (consequently, eating habits). In this frame, the first objective is to analyze the role of three antecedents on attitudes toward nutritional labels and credibility from health claims. These three starting antecedents are as follows: psychological characteristics of the consumer associated with eating disorders, body image attitudes and affective reactions (pleasure and arousal). Second, this paper aims to analyze if both elements (attitudes toward nutritional labels and credibility from health claims) improve (or not) food product attitudes and then, its purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach The sample comprised 300 young people between 18 and 25 years old. They provided their opinion about a healthy product by completing a structured and personal questionnaire after inspecting the packaging. Path analysis with partial least squares (PLS) was carried out to test the hypotheses stated. Findings First, psychological characteristics associated with eating disorders (self-concept and self-esteem) have a positive significant influence on body image attitudes. Second, attitudes toward their body image have a great effect on the perception that these consumers have about the information provided by healthy food packaging. Insofar as those whose attitudes toward their body image is "damaged" seek in the nutritional label indications that make them feel calm understanding that the food they are going to buy is not harmful to their health. Moreover, credibility from health claims improves positive attitudes toward the nutritional label. On the contrary, those consumers with higher punctuations in body image assigned lower values to those items concerning nutritional information and health claims in the packaging. Third, if attitudes to nutritional information improve, then product attitudes improve too. Fourth, if product attitudes improve, then purchase intention improves too. So, food product managers should be aware of the need to improve product attitudes by working on the packaging (label and claim) to improve purchase intention. Originality/value First, although previous literature has investigated individual psychological characteristics related to food disorders in the health area, the study of these specific individual psychological characteristics (ineffectiveness, perfectionism, interpersonal distrust, interceptive awareness, maturity fears), is under-researched in the marketing discipline. Second, to date, different authors have investigated how important the use of credibility from health claims in packaging can be in terms of increasing product attitudes and purchase intention, as well as the development of positive attitudes toward nutritional information on the label. However, the joint study of both information sources in the packaging (credibility from health claims and attitudes toward nutritional labels) remains under-investigated.

TI  - News Attention and Social-Distancing Behavior Amid COVID-19: How Media Trust and Social Norms Moderate a Mediated Relationship
T2  - HEALTH COMMUNICATION
LA  - English
AB  - Despite the fact that social distancing is an effective mean to slow the spread of COVID-19, individuals often fail to practice this behavior. Major US news media provided information to the public about social distancing after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, potentially spurring this preventative health practice. Using data from a representative sample of US residents, this study aims to understand the relationship between news media attention and social-distancing behavior via three potential mediators: perceived effectiveness of social distancing, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, and perceived negative consequences of infection. Media trust and social norms concerning social distancing were included as potential moderators of these relationships, along with political ideology. With multiple regression and mediation analyses, we found that news media attention was positively associated with social-distancing behavior during this period. Perceived effectiveness of social distancing mediated this relationship, while perceived susceptibility and negative consequences of COVID-19 did not. Notably, media trust negatively moderated news attention's impact on the perceived effectiveness of social distancing, with the relationship being more pronounced among those who have lower trust in media. Political ideology did not moderate the relationship between news attention and perceived effectiveness. Further, social norms negatively moderated the relationship between perceived effectiveness and social-distancing behavior, with this relationship growing stronger among those uncertain about the adoption of social-distancing norms in their circle. Overall, the study found news media to have an important role in promoting social-distancing behavior when they emphasized safety measures across the ideological spectrum.

AB  - Studies of a variety of media have found a negative slant in portrayals of individuals with mental illness. These portrayals may contribute to harmful public stigma. As consumers shift focus to online sources of news, it is important to understand whether negative portrayals are also found online. The current study analyzed language use and other coverage choices in online articles (N = 811) about mass shooting events as a function of the mental illness status of the shooter. Regression analyses controlling for relevant crime characteristics showed that less angry language was used and more positive details about the shooter were included when the shooter had a mental illness. The number of victim fatalities, location of and motive for the crime, and shooter age were also related to language use and coverage choices. Whereas the current results do not align with prior findings of overtly negative media portrayals of individuals with mental illnesses, it is not clear whether this reflects a modern improvement in media portrayals or whether it is perhaps a more subtle sign of continued bias toward associating mental illness with dangerousness and lack of responsibility for committing violent acts. Future work should focus on the impact of online information sources on public attitudes and stigma toward individuals with mental illness.

AB  - Climate change poses a key threat to today's societies and is caused by greenhouse gas emissions, mainly carbon dioxide emissions. Capture and Utilization of Carbon Dioxide (CCU) is a technological approach to reduce CO2 emissions. Coincidentally, the approach also reduces the depletion of limited fossil resources by incorporating CO2 as a raw material in the manufacture of products (e.g., plastics), thereby replacing fossil resources such as conventionally used oil. Even though some CCU products are nearing market maturity, systematic research on the acceptance of these products, especially regarding the (dis)trust in the companies that produce them, is still in its initial phase. Since a lack of trust could lead to a rejection of innovative products and technologies, the present study empirically investigates (dis)trust factors related to the acceptance of CCU plastic products. In a first step, interviews were carried out and analyzed to reveal relevant (dis)trust criteria for credibility of companies, desired information and marketing issues, and how CCU products are perceived. Afterwards, an online survey (n = 127) was conducted to identify and quantify important (dis)trust dimensions, and their connection to the acceptance of CCU products. The results showed that the participants had a slightly positive attitude toward CCU, and potential environmental, sustainability related, and economic benefits were acknowledged. In addition, potential barriers of CCU (sustainability risks, unknown risks, and health concerns) were rated rather neutrally and were thus not perceived as real barriers of CCU. When comparing companies to other institutions (e.g., research institutions, NGOs), the participants reported to trust companies least. Furthermore, four relevant trust (e.g., customer relationship) and distrust (e.g., bad customer orientation) dimensions were identified using CCU companies as an example of companies which manufacture innovative products. Finally, some first insights concerning the connection between the identified trust factors, CCU perception, credibility of the information sources, and the marketing of innovative products, are presented. The results enable deriving user-specific CCU product communication and information strategies.

AB  - The current investigation examined how experiencing a shared reality during the social reconstruction of the past might relate to communicators' perceived authenticity and self-esteem. In two experiments, participants were randomly assigned to describe an autobiographical memory to an audience who had either a positive or negative attitude toward the memory topic. Participants then reported perceptions of shared reality, authenticity, and self-esteem. Across both experiments, experiencing a shared reality with an audience who held a positive attitude was associated with greater self-perceived authenticity and self-esteem, whereas experiencing a shared reality with an audience who held a negative attitude was associated with lower ratings of authenticity and lower self-esteem. The effect of shared reality on self-esteem was mediated by perceptions of authenticity.

AB  - In recent years, the number of migrant children has continued to increase in China. This study aims to investigate how social exclusion and sense of school belonging influenced the mental health of Chinese migrant children. Data were from the 2013-2014 wave of the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS), a school-based national multistage probability sample of Chinese junior high school students. 1898 children who had experienced migration were selected as research sample. Structural equation model was adopted to test the hypothetical framework. The results suggested that social exclusion was not significantly associated with children's mental health, whereas a high sense of school belonging was related to their enhanced mental health outcomes. The sense of school belonging fully mediated the effect of social exclusion on migrant children's mental health. Our study validated the applicability of rejection identification model, social identity theory, and cognitive experiential self-theory in Chinese context. This study also provided implications for the social work intervention and social policy focused on migrant children in China.

AB  - This mediation analysis was conducted to determine mediators of improvements in infant SS practices in an effective mHealth intervention. OBJECTIVES:To determine mediators of improvements in infant safe-sleep (SS) practices in a mobile health intervention.METHODS:In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, mothers received SS intervention or breastfeeding control videos for 60 days. Maternal responses about infant sleep position and location (outcomes) and mediators (attitudes, perceived social norms, and perceived control) from the theory of planned behavior were assessed. Intervention effects on mediators and association between mediators and outcomes were examined.RESULTS:Of 1600 recruited, 1263 mothers participated. Mothers receiving SS videos were more likely to have positive attitudes and norms for supine sleep (attitudes: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.35 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 3.20]; norms: aOR = 1.75 [95% CI 1.27 to 2.42]) and recommended sleep location (attitudes: aOR = 1.91 [95% CI 1.54 to 2.36]; norms: aOR = 1.37 [95% CI 1.13 to 1.66]). Positive attitudes and norms toward supine sleep and room-sharing without bed-sharing were associated with higher odds of both practices (supine: aOR = 8.25 [95% CI 4.72 to 14.43] for positive attitudes and aOR = 6.67 [95% CI 4.25 to 10.46] for norms; room-sharing: aOR = 7.14 [95% CI 5.35 to 9.53] for positive attitudes and aOR = 4.44 [95% CI 3.03 to 6.51] for norms). Both positive attitudes and positive norms mediated the effect of the intervention.CONCLUSIONS:The intervention achieved success in improving adherence to SS recommendations by changing maternal attitudes and norms about supine sleeping and room-sharing without bed-sharing. Recognition that these attitudes and norms appear to be the main drivers of mothers' choices regarding infant-sleep practices should inform health messaging strategies to promote SS.

AB  - Objectives: Factors contributing to diminishing quality of life (QOL) of migrants have been examined, but little is known about the impact of relative deprivation. This study aimed to clarify the effects of relative deprivation on QOL and mediating effects of social exclusion among Chinese internal migrants.
   Study design: This is a secondary data analysis of a nationally representative survey.
   Methods: We obtained data from 14,816 internal immigrants, aged 15-59 years, throughout China using the 2014 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS). We measured relative deprivation via a modified Yitzhaki Index, social exclusion using a four-point Likert scale, and QOL using the Kessler Psychological Distress Short Scale, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, and a subscale of the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey. Survey data of 15,996 local residents were also retrieved and analyzed to make possible comparisons between the local and migrant population. Furthermore, we used descriptive and statistical analyses with data from the CMDS to identify relative deprivation and social exclusion.
   Results: The results show relative deprivation both directly and indirectly influences Chinese internal migrants' QOL. Specifically, compared with the local population, relative deprivation triggers serious social exclusion (beta = 0.008, P < 0.001), ultimately deteriorating QOL. Social exclusion partially mediated the total effects of relative deprivation on mental illness (beta = 0.004, P < 0.001), self-rated health (beta = -0.285, P < 0.001), and life satisfaction (beta= -0.020, P < 0.001) among Chinese internal migrants.
   Conclusion: Relative deprivation significantly impacts QOL by exacerbating mental illness, eroding selfrated health, and inhibiting life satisfaction. Relative deprivation is significantly directly associated with various indicators of QOL and indirectly affects QOL through social exclusion. In addition, our results demonstrate that the relative deprivation theoretical approach and the modified Yitzhaki Index are worthy of future investigation in studies of migrants' health.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to characterize the Portuguese general population's knowledge and attitudes about postpartum depression, and analyze its sociodemographic and clinical correlates.
   Design: A cross-sectional internet survey.
   Setting: Participants were recruited through advertisements on social media websites, in thematic forums and by email.
   Participants: A total of 621 people in the general population (88.1% women) participated in the study.
   Measurements: Participants were questioned about sociodemographic and clinical data, personal contact with postpartum depression, awareness of public education campaigns about postpartum depression and knowledge and attitudes towards postpartum depression (outcome variables).
   Findings: The sample presented a good level of knowledge and positive attitudes about postpartum depression despite the existence of some gaps in knowledge and some stereotypes. Personal contact with postpartum depression was associated with higher levels of knowledge (p < .001) and more positive attitudes towards postpartum depression (p < .001) and participants who assisted to public education campaigns reported higher levels of knowledge about postpartum depression (p < .001). Lower levels of knowledge and more negative attitudes about postpartum depression were found in men and older and less educated people.
   Key conclusions and implications for practice: These results show the importance of awareness-raising and education campaigns directed at the general population, particularly focusing on people who can act as the postpartum women's support network (e.g., partners, parents, in-laws), to increase the level of knowledge and to foster more positive attitudes towards postpartum depression.

AB  - Federal and local government agencies were quick to issue orders for residents to shelter-in-place in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. This study utilized data collected from Unacast Inc., spanning observations of 3,142 counties across 50 states and the District of Columbia (N = 230,846) from March 8, 2020 to April 13, 2020 (n = 104,930) and from April 14, 2020 to May 24, 2020 (n = 131,912) in a 3-level multilevel model to examine the correlates of social distancing behavior, as measured by the relative reduction in (1) distance traveled and (2) non-essential visitations since baseline pre-COVID-19 times. Results showed that educational attainment and political partisanship were the most consistent correlates of social distancing. State-level indicators of culture appeared to have differentiated effects depending on whether the model outcomes were reduction in general mobility or to non-essential venues. State-level neuroticism was generally positively related to social distancing, but states marked by high neuroticism were slower to engage in such behaviors. Counties and states characterized as already engaging in preventive health measures (e.g., vaccination rates, preparedness for at-risk populations) enjoyed quicker engagement in social distancing. Specific implications of findings and future directions are discussed.

AB  - Aims To describe nurse anesthetists' attitudes towards the importance of parental presence during their child's anaesthesia induction and to explore associating factors. Design A cross-sectional design. Methods Nurse anesthetists from 55 Swedish hospitals were asked to participate (n = 1,285). A total of 809 completed the questionnaire, Families' Importance in Nursing Care-Nurses' Attitudes (FINC-NA) during 2018. Data were analysed by descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression analysis. Results Nurse anesthetists generally had a positive attitude towards the importance of parental presence. They reported a more positive attitude in family as a resource in nursing care (median = 40) followed by family as a conversational partner (median = 25), family not as a burden (median = 17) and family as its own resource (median = 13). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that working in a district hospital, working only with children, having routines/memorandum about parental presence, being a woman, allowing both parents to be present in their child's anaesthesia and greater experience of children's anesthesia, were associated with a more positive attitude. Conclusion This nationwide survey contributes important knowledge for understanding nurse anesthetists' attitudes and the result shows that nurse anesthetists generally have a positive attitude towards the importance of parents. Areas of improvement were, however, identified; the nurses tend to not value family as its own resource and family as a conversational partner highly. Impact Nurse anesthetists have a crucial role in children's anesthesia care since the quality of parental presence experience depends on a positive attitude from the nurses. Parental involvement is important to establish a child-centered anaesthesia care, which should be highlighted in the education of nurse anesthetists. Parental involvement should also be addressed in healthcare policies and routines should be established.

AB  - Background Age and race-related disparities in technology use have been well documented, but less is known about how health literacy influences technology access and use.
   Objective To assess the association between patients' literacy skills and mobile phone ownership, use of text messaging, Internet access, and use of the Internet for health-related purposes.
   Methods A secondary analysis utilizing data from 1077 primary care patients enrolled in two, multisite studies from 2011-2013. Patients were administered an in-person, structured interview.
   Results Patients with adequate health literacy were more likely to own a mobile phone or smartphone in comparison with patients having marginal or low literacy (mobile phone ownership: 96.8 vs. 95.2 vs. 90.1%, respectively, P < 0.001; smartphone ownership: 70.6 vs. 62.5 vs. 40.1%, P < 0.001) and to report text messaging (78.6 vs. 75.2 vs. 53.1%, P < 0.001). They were also more likely to have access to the Internet from their home (92.1 vs. 74.7 vs. 44.9%, P < 0.001) and to report using the Internet for email (93.0 vs. 75.7 vs. 38.5%, P < 0.001), browsing the web (93.9 vs. 80.2 vs. 44.5%, P < 0.001), accessing health information (86.3 vs. 75.5 vs. 40.8%, P < 0.001), and communicating with providers (54.2 vs. 29.8 vs. 13.0%, P < 0.001). Relationships remained significant in multivariable analyses controlling for relevant covariates.
   Conclusions Results reveal that literacy-related disparities in technology access and use are widespread, with lower literate patients being less likely to own smartphones or to access and use the Internet, particularly for health reasons. Future interventions should consider these disparities and ensure that health promotion activities do not further exacerbate disparities.

KW  - CARE
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, social distancing has been necessary to help prevent disease transmission. As a result, medical practices have limited access to in-person visits. This poses a challenge to maintain appropriate patient care while preventing a substantial backlog of patients once stay-at-home restrictions are lifted. In practices that are naive to telehealth as an alternative option, providers and staff are experiencing challenges with telemedicine implementation. We aim to provide a comprehensive guide on how to rapidly integrate telemedicine into practice during a pandemic.
   METHODS: We built a toolkit that details the following 8 essential components to successful implementation of a telemedicine platform: provider and staff training, patient education, an existing electronic medical record system, patient and provider investment in hardware, billing and coding integration, information technology support, audiovisual platforms, and patient and caregiver participation.
   RESULTS: Rapid integration of telemedicine in our practice was required to be compliant with our institution's COVID-19 task force. Within 3 days of this declaration, our large specialty-care clinic converted to a telemedicine platform and we completed 638 visits within the first month of implementation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Effective and efficient integration of a telemedicine program requires extensive staff and patient education, accessory platforms to facilitate video and audio communication, and adoption of new billing codes that are outlined in this toolkit.

AB  - The expansion of ICTs (information and communication technologies) and the intensification of competition have induced firms to sell online. Insurance companies, for instance, have been urged to rely on such new technologies to be able to strengthen their presence on the market. This research used the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to study the factors that influence the e-insurance adoption. This study gathers data through a face-to-face administered survey involving insured persons. The hypotheses and the model were tested using AMOS co-variance-based structural equation modeling. The findings showed that perceived ease of use, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and attitude are the predominant predictors of the intention to buy insurance online. Those findings provide decision-makers in insurance companies with information useful in designing online offerings, creating a positive attitude towards e-insurance, and attracting customers.

TI  - Woman-centered research on access to safe abortion services and implications for behavioral change communication interventions: a cross-sectional study of women in Bihar and Jharkhand, India
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA  - English
KW  - MEDICAL-CARE
AB  - Background: Unsafe abortion in India leads to significant morbidity and mortality. Abortion has been legal in India since 1971, and the availability of safe abortion services has increased. However, service availability has not led to a significant reduction in unsafe abortion. This study aimed to understand the gap between safe abortion availability and use of services in Bihar and Jharkhand, India by examining accessibility from the perspective of rural, Indian women.
   Methods: Two-stage stratified random sampling was used to identify and enroll 1411 married women of reproductive age in four rural districts in Bihar and Jharkhand, India. Data were collected on women's socio-demographic characteristics; exposure to mass media and other information sources; and abortion-related knowledge, perceptions and practices. Multiple linear regression models were used to explore the association between knowledge and perceptions about abortion.
   Results: Most women were poor, had never attended school, and had limited exposure to mass media. Instead, they relied on community health workers, family and friends for health information. Women who had knowledge about abortion, such as knowing an abortion method, were more likely to perceive that services are available (beta = 0.079; p < 0.05) and have positive attitudes toward abortion (beta = 0.070; p < 0.05). In addition, women who reported exposure to abortion messages were more likely to have favorable attitudes toward abortion (beta = 0.182; p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Behavior change communication (BCC) interventions, which address negative perceptions by improving community knowledge about abortion and support local availability of safe abortion services, are needed to increase enabling resources for women and improve potential access to services. Implementing BCC interventions is challenging in settings such as Bihar and Jharkhand where women may be difficult to reach directly, but interventions can target individuals in the community to transfer information to the women who need this information most. Interpersonal approaches that engage community leaders and influencers may also counteract negative social norms regarding abortion and associated stigma. Collaborative actions of government, NGOs and private partners should capitalize on this potential power of communities to reduce the impact of unsafe abortion on rural women.

AB  - We inquire about the correlations between contact and perceived social distance: Whether in line with the contact theory, online as well as offline contacts that Israeli Jews have with Arabs affect their perceived social distances from Arabs, or rather whether Israeli Jews who feel closer to Arabs maintain more offline and online contacts with Arabs, according to the social homophily approach.
   We found that social distance, online contact and offline contact were mutually supportive, whereas the background variables included in the regression analysis (age, gender, religiosity, place of residence, education and income) had no effect on either of them. While the three are mutually supportive, perceived social distance and offline contacts had greater explanatory value than online contacts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study addresses the popularity of 'social media influencer' (SMIs) by examining the effect of users' perceived social distance from SMIs on their broadcasting intention on social live streaming platforms. Drawing on motivational factors related to social distance and applying Cognitive Transactional Theory as a theoretical lens, our empirical analysis is based on 657 broadcasters on the market-leading social live streaming platforms in China. This study reached the following Findings: Users' social distance from SMIs is positively related to their broadcast intention. Challenge stressors and hindrance stressors have different mediating effects between social distance and broadcast intention. Challenge stressors positively mediate the relationship between social distance and broadcast intention, and hindrance stressors negatively mediate the relationship between these two variables. Users' material values moderate the relationship between hindrance stressors and broadcast intention. These conclusions extend the understanding of the theoretical motivation behind the booming phenomenon of 'SMIs' and can help platform managers to motivate users' continued participation on these platforms.

AB  - In every society, refugees face social and economic exclusion. In particular, social distance towards refugees may be seen remarkably in cities where host people and refugees live together intensely. This study examined essential predictors of social distance towards refugees: religiosity, socioeconomic status (SES), satisfaction with life, and threat perception towards refugees. A quantitative research strategy was used to collect cross-sectional data from 1453 individuals via an online questionnaire in Turkey. Confirmatory factor, correlation, regression, and mediation analyses were conducted. In this study, the effect of religiosity and socioeconomic status on social distance towards refugees and the serial mediation effects of satisfaction with life and threat perception towards refugees on this relationship were analyzed. Questions related to age, gender, marital status, education level, and having refugee neighbors or not were used as control variables. It was found that religiosity and SES were associated with social distance towards refugees. Furthermore, in the effect of religiosity and SES on social distance towards refugees, the serial mediating roles of satisfaction with life and threat perception towards refugees, respectively, were identified.

AB  - The present study applied the common sense model (i. e., cause, controllability, timeline, consequences, and illness coherence) to understand public attitudes toward mental illness and help-seeking intention and to examine the mediating role of perceived controllability between causal attributions with public attitudes and help seeking. Based on a randomized household sample of 941 Chinese community adults in Hong Kong, results of the structural equation modeling demonstrated that people who endorsed cultural lay beliefs tended to perceive the course of mental illness as less controllable, whereas those with psychosocial attributions see its course as more controllable. The more people perceived the course of mental illness as less controllable, more chronic, and incomprehensible, the lower was their acceptance and the greater was mental illness stigma. Furthermore, those who perceived mental illness with dire consequences were more likely to feel greater stigma and social distance. Conversely, when people were more accepting, they were more likely to seek help for psychological services and felt a shorter social distance. The common sense model provides a multidimensional framework in understanding public's mental illness perceptions and stigma. Not only should biopsychosocial determinants of mental illness be advocated to the public, cultural myths toward mental illness must be debunked.

AB  - To examine the contribution of background variables, threat variables, and personal and community resources to participants' perceived social distance toward unauthorized migrants. Study participants were 168 Israeli citizens/longtime residents of three disadvantaged neighborhoods in Israel, who filled out self-report questionnaires. We applied a hierarchical regression model and also examined the direct and indirect contribution of the abovementioned variables to the social distance of these longtime residents toward unauthorized migrants in Israel. All participants reported high levels of social distance, irrespective of their physical proximity to the migrants. Cultural disparity was perceived as a major threat. Residents who lived in close proximity to migrants particularly expressed concern about harm to their economic well-being. Although political preference had no statistically significant direct effect on social distance, the mediation analysis revealed a complete indirect mechanism of the effect of political preference on social distance through threat perceptions. The research broadened our understanding of longtime neighborhood residents' perceived social distance toward migrants.It migrants. It also contributes to the development of knowledge, which will form the basis for intervention programs in the community

AB  - The Western hemisphere has witnessed recent increased immigration flows generating social and political debate across Europe. In one view, migration flows represent an opportunity to construct a diverse social cohesion. In another view, migration flows are perceived as a threat to existent national cultures. This view is held by political nationalisms and right-wing populist forces installed in the majority of EU countries' parliaments, accentuating discrimination against immigrants and residents in Europe. We theorize that European identity predicts positive attitudes toward immigrants (prosocial behavior and support for inclusive policies), whereas national identity's predictions of attitudes toward immigrants' inclusion depends on participants' political tendency. Moreover, we test the mediation effect of positive (humanitarian concerns and economic benefit) and negative (jobs scarcity, cultural deterioration, and invasion) arguments used in political discourses regarding immigrants' inclusion on the relation between national and European identities and attitudes toward immigrants' inclusion. Results (Portuguese sample,N= 176) show that national identity predicts negative attitudes toward immigrants' inclusion, but only among right-wing individuals. Among left-wing individuals, national identity predicts less contestation to immigrant's inclusion sustained by humanitarian concerns. Interestingly, European identification weakened right-wing individuals' adherence to discriminatory arguments and increased perceived economic contribution that immigrants bring to society, increasing agreement with prosocial behavior and immigrants' inclusion. We discuss that European identity, sustained in humanitarian values and economic benefit, may stimulate a stronger multicultural social cohesion, intergroup trust, and social well-being based on democratic values, social justice, and equality, and on the respect for human dignity.

AB  - COVID-19 is an emerging and highly infectious disease that is becoming a global health challenge affecting all sectors. To prevent COVID-19 transmission, all education institutions were closed and advised to turn to online learning. The present study sought to determine the factors affecting the acceptance and use of electronic learning among Ugandan University students in three universities. The study relied on two data collection instruments: a questionnaire and a semi-structured interview. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted on a population of students in three pre-selected universities: Kyambogo (KYU), Makerere (MAK), and Kampala International University (KIU). Of the 614 questionnaires returned, 578 were valid; 65.4% of the respondents were males; 60.7% were from MAK and the majority being in their third year of study (49%). Overall, 69.2% had good knowledge, 22.5% had positive attitudes toward e-learning. The semi-structured interviews revealed connectivity and skills challenges as the main barriers to the implementation of e-learning. For better implementation of e-learning by Universities, effective planning needs to be done with active students' involvement to avert negative attitudes. We recommend more studies be done on the Universities' preparedness for the implementation of e-learning. Universities should collaborate with telecommunication companies to provide subsidized prices for internet costs and information and communications technology (ICT) equipment to students.

AB  - The global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2020 has been an international public health threat. Early strong social distancing efforts is needed to stop transmission of the virus. The purpose of the present study is to identify individual and environmental factors related to individuals' compliance with the recommended social distancing, as well as the moderating role of social media in influencing individuals' implementation of social distancing. A total of 2130 Chinese adults were surveyed in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression analyses were performed to ascertain the predictors of social distancing. Overall, the majority of respondents (95.6%) reported compliance with social distancing. Women were more likely to practice social distancing compared to men (odds ratio [OR] = 3.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.93-5.02). Psychological distress, depressive symptoms, and social media were significant predictors of social distancing after controlling for other individual and environmental factors. Social media moderated the effects of psychological distress on social distancing (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.94-0.99). Findings from the study indicates that mental health status and social media are influential factors of social distancing, which have significant implications in enhancing the effectiveness of prevention strategies to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Mediation analyses revealed that the negative effects of social exclusion on wellbeing were partially mediated by stress, academic self-efficacy, and school satisfaction. Given its important role in students' social, academic, and psychological development, researchers and practitioners may need to give more attention to social exclusion as a key risk factor for decreased wellbeing.

AB  - Social exclusion is a complex phenomenon, with wide-ranging immediate and delayed effects on well-being, hormone levels, brain activation and motivational behavior. Building upon previous work, the current fMRI study investigated affective, endocrine and neural responses to social exclusion in a more naturalistic Cyberball task in 40 males and 40 females. As expected, social exclusion elicited well-documented affective and neural responses, i.e., increased anger and distress, as well as increased exclusion-related activation of the anterior insula, the posterior-medial frontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex. Cortisol and testosterone decreased over the course of the experiment, whereas progesterone showed no changes. Hormone levels were not correlated with subjective affect, but they were related to exclusion-induced neural responses. Exclusion-related activation in frontal areas was associated with decreases in cortisol and increases in testosterone until recovery. Given that results were largely independent of sex, the current findings have important implications regarding between-sex vs. within-sex variations and the conceptualization of state vs. trait neuroendocrine functions in social neuroscience.

AB  - Over the years, race-related incidents involving Greek letter organizations (GLOs), especially fraternities, continue to arise despite the ensuing controversy and negative media attention that inevitably follow such incidents. The present study examines whether there is an association between GLO membership and negative ethnoracial attitudes given a range of relevant psychological, sociological, and political theories about ethnoracial attitudes. Building on insights from microclass research on attitudinal structuring and drawing on the National Longitudinal Study of Freshmen (N = 2,817), results of linear regression models indicate that GLO membership is associated with heightened negative ethnoracial attitudes, particularly among white male students. Moreover, a measure of ethnoracial group affiliation partially mediates this effect. This latter finding suggests that among the various ethnoracial attitude theories, group position theory may be better formulated to explain an association between GLO membership and negative ethnoracial attitudes, given its consideration of both ingroup boundary formation and organizations. The results also support microclass processes and suggest future research to more clearly account for pre-occupational structuring that later feeds into occupational processes.

AB  - Using a nationally representative dataset from Turkey, we examined the effects of national identity, religious identity, religious practice, and intergroup contact on social distance towards disliked groups along ethnic (Turks vs. Kurds), religious (Sunnis vs. Alevis) and ideological divides (supporters vs. opponents of the Adalet ve Kallanma Partisi, AKP). We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine two mechanisms (via perceived threat and empathy) through which ingroup identification and intergroup contact influence social distance toward disliked groups. Perceived threat, but not empathy, mediated the effect of national identification on higher social distance towards Kurds, AKP supporters and AKP opponents. Both perceived threat and empathy mediated the effects of religious practice on distance towards Alevis. Intergroup contact had both direct and indirect effects (via threat and empathy) on social distance. Multigroup SEM showed that contact's effects did not vary across outgroup targets. By contrast, the effects of national and religious identity on social distance varied depending on the outgroup target. The findings highlight the importance of considering identity content and meaning attached to social categories in making predictions about the influence of identification with different social categories.

AB  - Public and commercial news follow distinct logics. We evaluate this duality in television news coverage on immigration. First, by means of a large-scale content analysis of Flemish television news (N = 1630), we investigate whether immigration coverage diverges between both broadcasters. Results show that, despite an overall negativity bias and relative homogeneity between the broadcasters, commercial news contains slightly more sensational and tabloid characteristics than public news. The latter promotes a more balanced view of immigration. These differences are stable over time. Second, using cross-sectional and panel data, we assess whether a preference for public versus commercial news is associated with an attitudinal gap in anti-immigrant attitudes. Findings demonstrate that individuals who prefer commercial news are more negative towards immigrants. We suggest that differences in news content may explain this attitudinal gap. In light of the debate around 'public value' offered by public service media across Europe, we tentatively conclude that public broadcasters have the potential to foster tolerance and provide balanced information by prioritizing a normative view over a market logic. The linkage between news coverage and the gap in attitudes between commercial and public news viewers warrants closer investigation in the future.

AB  - Background: The Eat Well Campaign (EWC) was a social marketing campaign developed by Health Canada and disseminated to the public with the help of cross-sector partners. The purpose of this study was to describe factors that influenced cross-sector partners' decision to adopt the EWC.
   Methods: Thematic content analysis, based primarily on an a priori codebook of constructs from Roger's diffusion of innovations decision process model, was conducted on hour-long semi-structured telephone interviews with Health Canada's cross-sector partners (n = 18).
   Results: Dominant themes influencing cross-sector partners' decision to adopt the EWC were: high compatibility with the organization's values; being associated with Health Canada; and low perceived complexity of activities. Several adopters indicated that social norms (e.g., knowing that other organizations in their network were involved in the collaboration) played a strong role in their decision to participate, particularly for food retailers and small organizations. The opportunity itself to work in partnership with Health Canada and other organizations was seen as a prominent relative advantage by many organizations. Adopters were characterized as having high social participation and positive attitudes towards health, new ideas and Health Canada. The lack of exposure to the mass media channels used to diffuse the campaign and reserved attitudes towards Health Canada were prominent obstacles identified by a minority of health organizations, which challenged the decision to adopt the EWC. Most other barriers were considered as minor challenges and did not appear to impede the adoption process.
   Conclusions: Understanding factors that influence cross-sector adoption of nutrition initiatives can help decision makers target the most appropriate partners to advance public health objectives. Government health agencies are likely to find strong partners in organizations that share the same values as the initiative, have positive attitudes towards health, are extremely implicated in social causes and value the notion of partnership.

AB  - Digital tech nology constitutes a substantial presence in higher education and notions like 'digital natives' and '21st century digital skills' dominate educational discourse. However, within the last decade, scholars have started questioning the prevailing techno-optimism and practitioners have started debating whether and how to regulate the use of digital devices. Based on a systematic qualitative analysis of 100 written evaluations and mapping sessions with five students, this study explores students' experiences in an undergraduate course in which the teacher restricted the use of digital devices in discussion classes. We found that students expressed mostly positive attitudes towards resulting class engagement and mostly negative attitudes towards taking, sharing, and searching their notes. Finally, we discuss our findings based on the notion of media affordances.

AB  - Objectives This study aims to describe the perception of dental professionals in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia (SA) towards the practice of teledentistry, its usefulness and challenges. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out among 190 dentists from January 2021 to April 2021. The participants were included in the study using snowball sampling method. A 26-item adopted questionnaire was distributed using different social media channels. Chi-square test was used for analysis. Results Out of 190 participants, 46.3% were from Pakistan and 53.7% were from SA. The majority of participants in both countries agreed that teledentistry would enhance guidelines and advice (74.2%), improve peer-to-peer interaction (79.5%) and make patient's referrals more efficient (75.8%). For the usefulness, most participants agree that it is economical for the patients (61.1%), improves communication (74.7%), helps in educating the patients (86.3%), avoid unnecessary travel (76.8%), helps monitoring (71.6%), and benefits patients in remote areas (74.7%); however, more Pakistani participants perceived that time spent with the patient would increase compared to SA participants (p < 0.001) and a higher proportion of SA participants believe that it helps in communication and monitoring of patients (p < 0.001) than Pakistani participants. Regarding the challenges in the use of teledentistry, few participants think that it violates the patient's privacy (22.6%) or is difficult to use (14.7%) or have distrust towards the teledentistry equipment (24.2%). Conclusion The results indicated a high awareness and a positive attitude towards teledentistry, and its adaptation in their dental practice in both countries. However, limited infrastructure, set-up cost, and information technology (IT) literacy are the main challenges in integrating teledentistry which can be overcome by strategic government initiatives, policies, and programs.

AB  - Events in Ferguson (MO), the Eric Garner incident, and most recently Chicago (IL), have again brought perceptions of race to the forefront of the public's conscience. Often perceptions of racially charged events are split along racial lines with Whites often siding with law enforcement and Blacks seeing a miscarriage of justice. Bifurcated perceptions along racial lines are nothing new, dating back to the early 1900s. Despite this schism, few analyses have examined the genesis of this difference in perceptions on racial issues. This analysis looks to fill that gap. Specifically, we examine the role media frames and people's preexisting attitudes and motivations play in determining what they think of contentious race issues and the people involved in them. Using the Jena Six incident as a case study, we find that people with less egalitarian racial attitudes-and low motivation to hide those attitudes-are less likely to blame race-related problems on mitigating cultural factors. They are also more likely judge news stories about a racial issue as being low quality. However, thematically framed stories that include discussion of the cultural aspects of the event may help to reduce this process.

AB  - Social exclusion often evokes social pain in excluded individuals. Although this pain can trigger various interpersonal difficulties (e.g., aggression, depression), it is still unclear which psychological approach might best help to regulate social pain. However, recent work suggests that temporal distance helps to facilitate adaptive coping and self-control. The present study measured ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) activity during social exclusion, using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to examine the functional relationship between "temporal distance approach," or thinking about the distant future, and the social pain regulation process. Participants that imagined the distant future, next year, and beyond, felt less social pain and showed increased right (r)VLPFC activity during social exclusion, as compared to imagining events in the near future, such as tonight and tomorrow. Furthermore, rVLPFC activity mediated the relationship between temporal distance and social pain. On the basis of these findings, the effect of temporal distance on the process of adaptation after social exclusion is discussed. It is suggested that temporal distance moderates the process of regulating the impact of social exclusion.

AB  - In referendums on issues of European integration, it is often unclear how important attitudes toward Europe are and whether these attitudes change during the campaign. Extant research showing the importance of EU attitudes particularly in salient and contested referendums has often had to rely on static data and limited conceptualizations of EU attitudes. This potentially underestimates the role of ( different types of) EU attitudes and hampers the ability to assess the dynamics of them. For the analysis of dynamics in EU attitudes, we mainly rely on pre - and post-waves for the Dutch Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement referendum, which extends a panel study leading back to the EP14 elections. This allows us to assess both long-term changes of EU attitudes since the last EP elections and also during the referendum campaign. We examine the effect of campaign-induced attitude changes for the referendum vote, while controlling for other relevant determinants. Our findings first show significant changes in EU attitudes during the referendum campaign, and second, highlight the relevance of some of these changes for the referendum vote. Both strengthening and especially emotional attitudes play respective significant roles, with the latter being in part dependent on media exposure.

TI  - Older adults' perceived sense of social exclusion from the digital world
T2  - EDUCATIONAL GERONTOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - INTERNET USE
KW  - TECHNOLOGY
AB  - A great deal of information and many services can now be accessed digitally. In order to make use of such services, however, it is necessary to have some form of Internet access. A lack of involvement in digital society may produce new forms of social exclusion. Older adults are particularly at risk of Internet-related social exclusion, since they tend to use the Internet less than younger adults. Little is known, however, about whether this lower level of Internet use among older people is in fact accompanied by a sense of social exclusion. In order to investigate the subjective sense of digital social exclusion resulting from a lack of Internet usage, we conducted a secondary analysis of a representative, cross-sectional telephone survey of 1,037 adults aged 65 years and over and living in Switzerland. We found that 33% of "onliners" reported that they would feel socially excluded were they to stop using the Internet, compared with 14% of "onliners" who felt socially excluded on account of their lack of Internet use. Our analyses show that onliners' attitudes toward Internet use and the variety of online applications available were related to their sense of social exclusion. By contrast, offliners' attitudes toward Internet use and their feelings of loneliness in general were predictors for their sense of social exclusion as a result of not using the Internet. The results of the study as well as its implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Out of what some call America's first truly multiracial riot in Los Angeles in 1992 was spawned a clarion call from Black newspapers to build an interminority alliance to avert a repeat performance. This article examines whether and how the Los Angeles Sentinel changed its coverage of Black-Asian American relations in the years after 1992. Using Ethnic NewsWatch, the author analyzed 102 articles published from 1993 to 2000 that included some discussion about that connection. Several things stand out: (a) The Sentinel's reporting for that period almost tripled output from all Black newspapers for 1980-1992; (b) the focus and breadth of coverage changed, from highlighting enmity between Korean (American) merchants and Blacks to emphasizing interminority collaboration and inclusion in a wide range of settings; and (c) rarely noted were intimate relationships and personal ties. The Sentinel provides proof that news organizations can significantly improve their coverage of race relations very quickly.

AB  - Two characteristics of millennial behaviour motivate the present study - an increasing concern for various life issues, and an increasing level of social media usage. In the present study, we focused on millennials' societal concerns, financial concerns and social exclusion concerns and examined how these concerns influence social media behaviour. Adopting the compensatory consumer behaviour framework, we proposed that millennials' social media behaviour can be understood as a form of compensatory consumption, that is, a coping mechanism for dealing with major life concerns. Data collected from a commercial survey of Australian millennials supported most of our hypotheses. We observed that social exclusion concerns directly influenced social media behaviour, whereas societal and financial concerns influence social media behaviour indirectly through influencing social exclusion concerns. Our proposed model explained more than half of the variance in social exclusion concerns, and more than one-third of the variance in social media behaviour.

AB  - Can "urban-centric" local television news coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic affect the behavior of rural residents with lived experiences so different from their "local" news coverage? Leveraging quasi-random geographic variation in media markets for 771 matched rural counties, we show that rural residents are more likely to practice social distancing if they live in a media market that is more impacted by COVID-19. Individual-level survey responses from residents of these counties confirm county-level behavioral differences and help attribute the differences we identify to differences in local television news coverage-self-reported differences only exist among respondents who prefer watching local news, and there are no differences in media usage or consumption across media markets. Although important for showing the ability of local television news to affect behavior despite urban-rural differences, the media-related effects we identify are at most half the size of the differences related to partisan differences.

AB  - This study explores whether and how people with a negative biotechnology-related perception can change their attitudes when they are exposed to a positive message in two different frames. The two frames differ in terms of the medium, the language used, and the general tone. A frame is thus conceptualized as unified symbolic entities, rather than just words or positioning in terms of valence (positive/negative). An exploratory stage was conducted through in-depth interviews, which resulted in three audience categories. Results of the experimental study indicated that it is, in fact, possible to turn negative attitudes into positive attitudes for people with intuitive perceptions. People with analytical and ideological perceptions change their attitudes only when the frame is scientific.

AB  - Background: Anecdotal reports suggest a rise in anti-Asian racial attitudes and discrimination in response to COVID-19. Racism can have significant social, economic, and health impacts, but there has been little systematic investigation of increases in anti-Asian prejudice. Methods: We utilized Twitter's Streaming Application Programming Interface (API) to collect 3,377,295 U.S. race-related tweets from November 2019-June 2020. Sentiment analysis was performed using support vector machine (SVM), a supervised machine learning model. Accuracy for identifying negative sentiments, comparing the machine learning model to manually labeled tweets was 91%. We investigated changes in racial sentiment before and following the emergence of COVID-19. Results: The proportion of negative tweets referencing Asians increased by 68.4% (from 9.79% in November to 16.49% in March). In contrast, the proportion of negative tweets referencing other racial/ethnic minorities (Blacks and Latinx) remained relatively stable during this time period, declining less than 1% for tweets referencing Blacks and increasing by 2% for tweets referencing Latinx. Common themes that emerged during the content analysis of a random subsample of 3300 tweets included: racism and blame (20%), anti-racism (20%), and daily life impact (27%). Conclusion: Social media data can be used to provide timely information to investigate shifts in area-level racial sentiment.

AB  - Since the Apollo missions, human spaceflight has been advocated as a means of promoting positive attitudes towards science. In 2015, Principia launched Britain's first government-funded astronaut to the International Space Station, a core objective being education and inspiring young people. In this study, we examined how spaceflight education policy was enacted during the Principia mission, found out the ways in which young people encountered space, and how these encounters shaped their attitudes. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 102 children and analysed through the construction of an actor-network. Young people encountered space through formal education in school as well as through non-formal encounters with family, friends, media and social media. Social media influences were associated with forming positive attitudes, whereas friends and teachers were associated with both positive and negative attitudes. The human dimension of spaceflight was important in young people encountering space but was not sufficient to stimulate sustained interest in space: children and young people wanted to know more about the science of human spaceflight. Young people confused science with science fiction. In some schools, young people became 'spaced out' by saturation of the curriculum with space. The findings have implications for policymakers and practitioners. The scientific stories associated with human spaceflight need greater attention. Social media could be used to greater effect in communicating science directly to young people. Non-formal education initiatives must be designed to align with teachers' objectives, and there needs to be recognition and reward of teachers' time and contributions.

AB  - Background: Negative attitudes toward breastfeeding in public have consistently been identified as a key barrier to breastfeeding continuation. In order to design effective social marketing campaigns to improve public attitude toward breastfeeding in public, it is critical to identify segments of the population who are less likely to support this activity, their underlying reasons, and the medium through which they can be reached. Research aim: The aims were to (a) identify the underlying dimensions that drive acceptance or opposition to breastfeeding in public, (b) test whether specific population segments were more or less likely to support breastfeeding in public, and (c) identify suitable media outlets to reach them. Methods: A cross-sectional survey testing agreement with 60 statements was administered online between May 2016 and May 2017 and was completed by 7190 respondents. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify 12 dimensions driving acceptance or opposition to breastfeeding in public. The influence of demographics and media consumption on attitudes toward breastfeeding in public was tested using Welch's t tests and one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Results: Acceptance of breastfeeding in public was found to differ with gender, age, religion, and parental and breastfeeding status, but not household income. Support for breastfeeding in public also varied with media consumption habits. Conclusions: This work lays the foundation to design effective social marketing campaigns aimed at increasing public support for breastfeeding in public.

AB  - To help inform the debate over whether social media is related to political polarization, we investigated the effects of social media use on changes in political view using panel data collected in South Korea (N = 6411) between 2012 and 2016. We found that, although there were no direct effects of social media use, social media indirectly contributed to polarization through increased political engagement. Those who actively used social network sites were more likely to engage in political processes, which led them to develop more extreme political attitudes over time than those who did not use social network sites. In particular, we observed a clear trend toward a more liberal direction among both politically neutral users and moderately liberal users. In this study, we highlight the role of social media in activating political participation, which eventually pushes the users toward the ideological poles. The implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Background: School closures have inevitably deprived students of their traditional source of information. The objective of this study was to determine knowledge, attitudes, and safety practices about COVID-19 among high school students in Iran.
   Methods: This study was conducted from March 24th-April 3rd, 2020. Data were collected via an online-parent-administrative questionnaire.
   Results: Responses of 704 students were analyzed. Students' mean (SD) knowledge score was 21.5 (4.6) of 30. More than 90% of students knew about the cause of the disease, the routes of transmission, and the most renowned symptoms: dyspnea and cough. Social-and- audiovisual-media were the leading information source. Most students believed that people need to keep safe physical distancing, everyone should isolate themselves upon symptoms onset, people should avoid unnecessary in-person contact with family and friends, and that cities need to go under lockdowns if needed. Students' mean (SD) practice score was 20.2 (2.5) of 24. Most students did not go on a trip, and more than 80% said they would wear facemasks when going outside.
   Conclusions: High school students' knowledge and safety practices about COVID-19 were somewhat satisfactory, and their attitudes toward the disease were mainly positive. Nevertheless, some witnessed knowledge gaps, negative attitudes, and unsafe practices in the study highlighted the need for targeted education on the pandemic. Social and mass media's significant role and potential could be utilized to battle misinformation and deliver proper knowledge to young adolescents.

AB  - Background: In recent years, the increasing number of empty-nest elderly has become a significant global social problem, and the rapid development of medical technology and information technology has improved the feasibility of telenursing. However, few studies have been conducted on needs of telenursing among the empty-nest elderly. The aim of this study is to explore the needs of telenursing for community-dwelling empty-nest elderly who are completely independent in activities of daily living (ADL), or who are mildly disabled, and to provide a reference for improving the remote care quality.
   Methods: A questionnaire survey aiming to explore telenursing needs of the elderly was conducted among 268 community-dwelling empty-nest elderly who were selected using random sampling and then data were analyzed based on the Kano Model.
   Results: Chi-square goodness-of-fit test showed that there were significant differences between actual and expected counts for each item of telenursing needs (p < 0.01 for all), indicating that the sample had specific individual preference for the Kano category. The desired degree of telenursing service ranged from 48.37% to 80.86%, the better values (satisfaction) were between 57.09% and 67.56%, and the worse values (dissatisfaction) were between 11.92% and 37.93%. The items, remote one-button emergency caller and remote emergency assistance arrangement, were considered to be one-dimensional qualities by empty nesters and the rest were attractive qualities. In the quadrant analysis diagram, all the remote care services were categorized as attractive qualities.
   Discussion: The community-dwelling empty-nest elderly with ADL independence or mild impairment have positive attitudes toward telenursing services, especially the needs of remote first aid nursing. Medical policy makers and nursing managers can provide targeted telenursing services according to empty nesters' requirements, thus improving nursing care quality and satisfaction of the elderly.

AB  - It has long been recognized that voters bring their political behaviors in line with economic assessments. Recent work, however, suggests that citizens also engage in economic behaviors that align with their confidence-or lack thereof-in the political system. This alignment can happen consciously or, as we suggest, unconsciously, in the same way that positivity carries over to other behaviors on a micro-level. Using monthly time series data from 1978 to 2008, we contribute further evidence of this relationship by demonstrating that political confidence affects consumer behavior at the aggregate level over time. Our analyses employ measures more closely tied to the theoretical concepts of interest while simultaneously accounting for the complex relationships between subjective and objective economic indicators, economic behavior, political attitudes, and the media. Our results suggest that approval of the president not only increases the electorate's willingness to spend money, but also affects the volatility of this spending. These findings suggest that the economy is influenced by politics beyond elections, and gives the "Chief Economist" another avenue by which they can affect the behavior of the electorate.

AB  - Introduction: COVID-19 has been a global public health problem since December 2019. Higher education institutions are risky areas for the transmission of COVID-19. But, still there is insufficient information on the prevention of the disease in this setting.
   Objective: To assess knowledge, attitude, and prevention practices towards COVID-19 among students of Ethiopian higher education institutions.
   Methods: Institutin-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from December 1 to 30, 2020 among randomly selected 407 undergraduate students from higher education institutions in Ethiopia. The outcome variables were knowledge, attitude, and practices towards COVID-19. Binary logistic regression models at 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to determine the factors affecting knowledge, attitude, and practices towards COVID-19. In multivariable analysis, variables with a p-value of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant and independently associated with outcome variables at 95% CI.
   Results: About 75.9% (95% CI: 72.2-79.9%) of University students had a good knowledge, 62.4% (95% CI: 58.2-67.1%) had a positive attitude, and 56.8% (95% CI: 52.6-61.9%) had a good COVID-19 prevention practices. Students over the age of 30 (AOR=5.8; 95% CI: 1.5, 10.6), third-year students (AOR=3.1; 95% CI: 1.1, 8.9), and being health science students (AOR=4.4; 95% CI: 2.2, 8.9) were significantly associated with a good knowledge towards COVID-19. Urban residents (AOR=0.6; 95% CI: 0.3-0.9), having an average family monthly income of $75USD (AOR=3.5; 95% CI: 1.8-6.7), use of at least one type of social media (AOR=4.7; 95% CI: 1.7-12.9), and having a positive attitude (AOR=2.2; 95% CI: 1.3-3.5) were significantly associated with COVID-19 prevention practices.
   Conclusion: Despite three-fourths of the participants had a good knowledge, the attitude and prevention practices were low. Age, study year, College of study, presence of chronic illnesses, use of social media, family income, and residence were factors of knowledge, attitude, and prevention practices towards COVID-19. Hence, multiple information dissemination strategies using multiple media outlets should be implemented continuously.

AB  - In this paper, we analyze the interrelation between technological, institutional, and geographical peripheries. By distinguishing between the quality and quantity of access to information and communication technologies, together with institutional and geographical factors, and using a sample of 229 European regions during the period 2007-2018, we find that the diffusion and quality of information and communication technologies foster economic development and decrease the risk of social exclusion. A similar effect is found for institutional and geographical factors, suggesting that the interplay of these three determinants may be crucial to set up place-based policies.

KW  - Local development
AB  - Spatial exclusion as a result of social exclusion is a complex problem that hinders the development of territories and undermines social cohesion in society. These are issues that need to be addressed at a local level through cooperation between the various influential bodies (public administration, politicians, citizens, social workers, the media among others). This article examines social exclusion based on an internationally recognised case that occurred in the Czech Republic 10 years after the 1989 democratic revolution. The starting point for this article is 1999, when a chain of decisions made by public administration resulted in the emerging spatial segregation in Maticni Street in the region's capital Usti nad Labem. The article is based on semi-structured oral history interviews with social participants. It identifies barriers for the successful resolution of issues at that time on the basis of the Pierson theory of social exclusion (2010) as the insufficient use of local participation and networks and their abuse for political and media purposes. Using the lens of social actors, it is looking for important milestones and lessons learned for the future development in public policies.
   Highlights for public administration, management and planning:
   Social exclusion is posing a problem in the Czech Republic since 1990s, resulting in a serious barrier to the growth of opportunities within the region.
   Social cohesion in society is undermined as a result of mistreatment due to social exclusion, especially in regions with limited resources.
   Regional planners can learn from past examples where social exclusion was specifically addressed in a region or locality (e.g. the case study of Maticni Street which may be applied to the Usti nad Labem region).
   Public administration is not able (or not willing) to react locally and with flexibility and cooperation when social problems arise.

AB  - There is an increasing global call to adopt information and communication technologies (ICTs) in teaching and learning. ICTs have become so essential that the South African government has introduced the e-education policy. ICTs are powerful enabling tools that play a significant role in the teaching and learning process. This article reports on a study that sought to explore teachers' perceptions of adopting ICTs in teaching and learning at some secondary schools in Eastern Cape, South Africa. The purposive sampling technique was used to identify three secondary schools and five study participants from each school. Data was collected through face-to-face interviews and focus group discussions. A thematic approach was adopted to analyse and present the collected data. The study found that the teachers had a positive attitude towards the adoption of technologies and were ready to integrate ICTs in teaching and learning but they lacked the requisite ICT skills. The article concludes that ICT is an important vehicle in education, and further recommends the training of both teachers and learners in ICT usage.

AB  - Background: Risk for suicide is growing among certain groups of Black Americans, yet the topic remains understudied. Discrimination appears to increase risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, but the evidence has been mixed for Black Americans. This study aimed to examine the association between major discriminatory events and suicidal thoughts and behaviors among Black American adults.
   Methods: We drew data from the National Survey of American Life, a representative sample of Black Americans, and used multivariable logistic regression to examine the associations between nine major discriminatory events and suicidal thoughts and behaviors (ideation, plan, attempt), adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and psychiatric disorders.
   Results: We found that some major discriminatory events increased odds of reporting suicidal thoughts and behaviors, while others did not. Further, findings suggest the mediating role of psychiatric disorders.
   Limitations: The study drew from cross-sectional data and did not allow for causal inferences.
   Conclusions: Major discriminatory events have important implications for clinical practice, as well as diagnostic criteria when considering race-related stressors as a precipitator of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

AB  - The girl child marriage practice (a forced marriage involving a young woman under age 18) is a serious problem in Turkey as it is in many developing countries. It is important to investigate the reasons behind individuals' support for girl child marriages. The aim of the present study is to examine attitudes toward girl child marriages in Turkey within the perspective of social dominance theory (Sidanius and Pratto 1999). Namely, we investigate the relationship between social dominance orientation and attitudes toward girl child marriages. We also examine the mediating role of ambivalent sexism (both hostile and benevolent) in this association. Students (N = 388) from two universities in Ankara completed the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, the Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) Scale, and our Attitudes toward Girl Child Marriages Scale. Results indicate that men have more positive attitudes toward girl child marriages than women do. In addition, SDO predicts positive attitudes toward girl child marriages. Also, hostile, but not benevolent, sexism mediates the relationship between SDO and attitudes toward girl child marriages. The present study shows that those who endorse male dominance and gender inequality also have more positive attitudes toward girl child marriages. It also shows that these people draw on their hostile attitudes toward women in order to legitimize these kinds of marriages.

AB  - Two studies tested whether social exclusion can increase gambling behavior. In Study 1, participants were asked to relive a socially painful instance, a physically painful instance or a control condition and were then presented with a real online gambling device (i.e., a slot machine). The results revealed that participants who relived a socially painful instance played longer on the gambling device. In Study 2, we induced actual feelings of social disconnection and manipulated slot machine anthropomorphization. The results revealed a significant interaction between inclusionary status and anthropomorphism in predicting gambling. More specifically, excluded participants gambled longer when presented with an anthropomorphized slot machine. However, the gambling behavior of excluded and included participants was no different when participants were reminded that slot machines are inanimate objects. Finally, positive and negative game experience mediated the influence of both inclusionary status and anthropomorphism on gambling. Overall, this research identifies another potential vulnerability produced by experiences of social exclusion, namely, gambling behavior. Implications for pathological gambling and future research directions are outlined.

AB  - Viruses are a major threat causing massive yield loss and economical damage to crop production worldwide. Through complex evolutionary processes, plants encounter and overcome viral infection by developing effective resistance mechanisms. Over the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in understanding the nature of plant resistance to viruses at the molecular level. This review summarizes the major resistance strategies that plants use to prevent viral infection. Recent investigations suggest that antiviral RNA silencing is the most prevalent defense strategy in plants. Other forms of resistance include R gene-mediated resistance and host factor-related recessive resistance. Naturally occurring resistances arise and are maintained in numerous virus-plant pathosystems based mainly on arms-race relationships and the cost-efficiency of resistance acquisition. In addition to the current status of the known resistance mechanisms, this review discusses the future prospectus for the practical application of plant resistances that influence resistance durability in agricultural ecosystems. Such applications include molecular breeding strategies using advanced molecular marker systems and the utilization of trans- or cis- genetics via the acquisition of engineered disease resistances.

KW  - COVID-19
AB  - Social media have become popularly use to seek for medical information and have fascinated the general public to collect information regarding corona virus pandemics in various perspectives. During these days, people are forced to stay at home and the social media have connected and supported awareness and pandemic updates. The present study aims at highlighting the present situation of Indonesian society, where the outbreak position is quite high. The study collects the data from social media users from March and April 2020. The data were also compiled from the secondary sources, like opinions, the literature and scientific articles from reputable journals. The total number of 348 responses were collected from respondents through random sampling technique, and the majority respondents show positive attitudes toward using social media as medical information instruments. The results demonstrate that social media have been used to seek social supports from the respondents' online networks and offline friends, relatives, and colleagues. The study also examines that the usage of social media platforms is perceived as easy and accessible to every individual for sharing, posting, and reacting to any medical information regarding the pandemic. Since people continue work from home, and ensuring the social distance, so, the majority of users have seen family and friends have provided support and attempt to raise awareness by sharing and circulating a range of information within their closed-social network.

AB  - Previous imaging studies have suggested that there is an age-related decline in brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) measures in healthy subjects. This paper addresses whether the availability of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B (5-HT1B) is seen to decrease with aging via PET imaging. Methods: Forty-eight healthy control subjects (mean age +/- SD, 30 +/- 10 y; age range, 18-61 y; 33 men, 15 women) underwent C-11-P943 scanning on a high-resolution PET tomograph. Regions were examined with and without gray matter masking, the latter in an attempt to control for age-related gray matter atrophy on nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) as determined by a validated multilinear reference tissue model. Results: 5-HT1B BPND decreased in the cortex at an average rate of 8% per decade without and 9% with gray matter masking. A negative association with age was also observed in all individual cortical regions. Differences in the putamen and pallidum (positive association) were significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. No sex- or race-related effects on 5-HT1B BPND were found in any regions. Conclusion: These findings indicate that age is a relevant factor for 5-HT1B in the cortex of healthy adults.

AB  - Rivers in urban areas have been associated with water quality problems because of the practice of discharging untreated domestic and industrial waste into the water bodies. However, to what extent the public can identify specific environmental problems and whether people are ready to cope with potential risks is to a great extent unknown. Public environmental awareness of factors underpinning the pollution of rivers and approaches for reducing it were studied in Rasht City of Guilan Province in northern Iran, with Zarjub and Goharrud rivers as a case study. Data were collected from residents on the banks of the studied rivers using a questionnaire. Industrial areas, hospitals, and poultry farms were perceived as the main factors deteriorating water pollution of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers in Guilan Province. The discharge of urban sewage into the rivers was the second most important polluting factor. Most residents on the banks of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers showed high interest in the conservation of the environment. Overall, 62.7% of the residents had moderate, 20% had high, and 4% had very high environmental awareness. Families and mass media (TV and radio) were perceived of being the most important sources of information of family members concerning environmental awareness. According to the residents, the main approach for alleviating the pollution of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers were creating green spaces, dredging the rivers, establishing a water purifying system, and establishing a waste incinerator with a separation system (based on municipal planning). The public in the study area appeared well prepared to cope with the risks of water pollution, but further improving environmental awareness of the community can be a first step for preventing environmental degradation. The positive attitudes of the residents towards environmental conservation, the use of proper information sources, and practical training in the context of extension services can be effective in conserving water resources in urban areas.

AB  - Most studies use survey data to study people's prejudiced views. In a digitally connected world, research is needed on out-group sentiments expressed online. In this study, we show how one can elaborate on existing sociological theories (i.e. group threat theory, contact theory) to test whether anti-immigrant sentiments expressed on Twitter are related to sociological conditions. We introduce and illustrate a new method of collecting data on online sentiments, creating a panel of 28,000 Twitter users in 39 regions in the United Kingdom. We apply automated text analysis to quantify anti-immigrant sentiments of 500,000 tweets over a 1-year period. In line with group threat theory, we find that people tweet more negatively about immigrants in periods following more salient coverage of immigration in the news. We find this association both for national news coverage, and for the salience of immigration in the personalized set of outlets people follow on Twitter. In support of contact theory, we find evidence to suggest that Twitter users living in areas with more non-western immigrants, and those who follow a more ethnically diverse group of people, tweet less negatively about immigrants.

AB  - Social exclusion is a distressing experience and can result in a reduction of prosocial behavior. In this fMRI study we examined the neural networks involved in social exclusion and subsequent fairness considerations across adolescent development. Participants from 3 age groups (10-12, 14-16 and 19-21 year olds) participated in the study and performed two tasks; first, participants played Cyberball to induce feelings of social inclusion and exclusion, followed by a Dictator game in which participants were asked to divide coins between themselves and the players who previously included or excluded them. Results revealed a network of regions associated with social exclusion, which involve the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)/ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), subgenual ACC and the lateral PFC, as well as the insula and the dorsal ACC. Although social exclusion generated strong distress for all age groups, 10-12 year olds showed increased activity in the subgenual ACC in the exclusion game, which has been associated in previous studies with negative affective processing. Results of the Dictator game revealed that all age groups selectively punished the excluders by making lower offers. These offers were associated with activation in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), superior temporal sulcus (STS) and the lateral PFC. Age comparisons revealed that adults showed additional activity in the insula and dorsal ACC when making offers to the excluders. The results are discussed in the light of recent findings on neural networks involved in social exclusion and the development of social brain regions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - ObjectivesBuilding individuals' positive attitudes during a pandemic is essential for facilitating psychological resilience. However, little is known about how public health measures may improve people's positive attitudes during a pandemic. We investigated the potential mechanism underlying the association between individuals' perceived effectiveness of public health measures and positive attitudes towards the success of pandemic control during the COVID-19 pandemic, by examining the parallel mediating effects of three types of threat appraisals: concerns about contracting the virus, perceived impact of the pandemic on life and estimated duration of the pandemic.Design, setting and participantsIn February 2020 when the COVID-19 infection was spreading rapidly in China, a large cross-sectional survey was conducted among 132054 adults from the 16 districts in Shanghai, China.Outcome measuresPerceived effectiveness of the public health measures, positive attitudes towards the success of pandemic control and threat appraisals.ResultsResults of structural equation modelling supported the hypothesised mediation model: perceived effectiveness of public health measures was associated with lower levels of concerns about contracting the virus (beta=-0.20), perceived impact of the pandemic (beta=-0.13) and perceived duration of the pandemic (beta=-0.20), which were then associated with higher levels of positive attitudes towards the success of pandemic control (beta s=-0.12to -0.25).ConclusionsThe findings suggest that threat appraisals may be important pathways through which individuals' evaluations of prevention strategies may influence their attitudes towards the success of pandemic control. The health authorities should consider reducing people's inappropriate threat appraisals when designing public health policies to facilitate people's positive attitudes during a pandemic.

AB  - The United States lags other nations in adapting policy approaches that would stimulate cleaner consumption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) by limiting the use of potentially toxic materials in electronics production. This study analyzes nationally-representative U.S. data from a unique web-based survey to investigate whether American households are willing to support greening the ICT devices by paying a premium for a green cell phone. Green cell phone does not contain hazardous materials and can be safely disposed with general municipal waste. A survey-based economic technique of contingent valuation was utilized to examine the relationship between socio-psychological and economic parameters for evaluating and explaining a stated willingness to pay a green phone premium, controlling for socio-economic and demographic characteristics. The findings indicate that respondents with higher scores on general environmental beliefs, greater engagement in pro-environmental behavior, and positive attitudes toward recycling small electronics are likely to be willing to pay a premium to purchase a green cell phone compared to a conventional cell phone with similar capabilities. This suggests that educating the public about benefits of electronics recycling, promoting pro-environmental norms, and encouraging pro-environmental behavior can help increase public support for implementing policies aimed at greening ICT production and consumption in the United Sates.

AB  - This article explores the meaning of valence-framing theory in political communication. It examines the influence of valence frames on the formation of political attitudes among the public. The valence-framing effect is derived from the information context value (positive, negative) and applies if people's attitudes towards a certain subject match the context value of the information received. The article presents a case study of reports during the crisis of Mirek Topolanek's government in the Czech Republic in 2009. It examines to what extent the context of the statements on the Czech news concerning the parliamentary parties Civic Democratic Party (ODS, leader Mirek Topolanek) and the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD, leader Jirl Paroubek) related to the existing political attitudes of their prospective audiences. The article argues that the valence-framing effect was more evident in the public broadcasting programme Udalosti CT than the commercial programme Televizni noviny, a paradox which can be explained by the unique link between the attributes of the Czech media environment and the political opinions of their viewers.

AB  - The present work investigated the interpersonal functions of facial mimicry after social exclusion. Specifically, we examined two distinct functions that facial mimicry may serve in promoting reconnection: facilitating the understanding of others' emotions and/or fostering interpersonal rapport. Using a novel facial mimicry paradigm, we found that although people exhibited both greater facial mimicry (Studies 1 and 2) and superior emotion-decoding accuracy (Study 2) after exclusion, facial mimicry did not mediate the relationship between exclusion and decoding accuracy (Study 2). Instead, we found support for facial mimicry serving to promote interpersonal rapport. Specifically, in Study 3, na < ve judges rated videos of target-participant pairs from Study 1 for social closeness. Findings indicated that pairs with a previously-excluded participant were rated as socially closer than pairs with a previously-included participant (Study 3). Importantly, enhanced facial mimicry was found to mediate the relationship between exclusion and rated closeness. Altogether these findings suggest that facial mimicry may promote reconnection after social exclusion by fostering rapport.

AB  - The aim of the study was to compare first and second generation Digital Natives' attitudes toward and use of the Internet. The sample of first generation Digital Natives consisted of 558 students who we surveyed in 2002 and who were born after 1980. The sample of second generation Digital Natives consisted of a sample of 458 students who we surveyed in 2012 and were born after 1993. They completed a questionnaire in the first semester of their first academic year, which consisted of a measure of Internet experience, an Internet anxiety scale, and an Internet identification scale. Second generation Digital Natives had more positive attitudes toward the Internet than first generation Digital Natives. They had higher scores on the Internet identification scale and lower scores on the Internet anxiety scale compared with first generation Digital Natives. Furthermore, we found that second generation Digital Natives used the Internet more than first generation Digital Natives. E-mail was the most popular activity for both generations, although second generation Digital Natives used it significantly more than first generation Digital Natives. Social networking sites emerged as very popular for second generation Digital Natives. Both generations reported low use of Web 2.0 technologies.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has changed lives in an unprecedented way. The most notable and urgent requirement to combat the epidemic was to transform the way human interacts with each other. The adherence to maintaining social distance has given an upsurge to the increased usage of mobile app users. This change in human interaction for fulling their basic to social to work needs through the intervention of app usage has led to privacy concerns by users. By keeping in view the changing dynamics of the way society works, this study is an endeavor to investigate gender differences of ad intrusive and privacy concerns on app usage behavior. Employing a quantitative research design, 371 respondents were surveyed using through an online structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed by using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Results suggest that advertising intrusiveness and privacy concerns are significant in determining the consumer's attitude toward App usage, and a positive attitude toward App usage results in App usage behavior. However, gender's moderating role in attitude toward app usage and app usage behavior is insignificant for this study. The study provides a more comprehensive understanding and complements prior insights on ads intrusiveness and privacy concerns toward app usage.

AB  - This study addresses the effect of narratives offering a positive depiction of gay men on the audience's change in attitude towards homosexuality. Specifically, it analyzes the relationship of character identification, inter-group contact, religiosity and gender with homophobia reduction. One hundred and fifty students of a Serbian University (M-Age = 22.13, SD = 2.28) filled in a questionnaire measuring socio-demographic information and the instrument H25 assessing homophobia. Two months later, they watched a movie depicting gay men in a positive manner and completed a questionnaire containing the homophobia scale and questions related to identification with the main character, inter-group contact and religiosity. The results showed that watching the movie is related to a reduction of homophobia and that character identification and inter-group contact are negatively correlated with homophobia, whereas religiosity is positively correlated with it. Results also show that there is a negative correlation between religiosity and the attitude change induced by the movie, and that men express higher level of homophobia than women. The study contributes to the knowledge of the mechanisms reducing homophobia through media.

AB  - Purpose:The purpose of this study is to examine the differences in preventive behaviors of COVID-19 between urban and rural residents, as well as identify the factors that might contribute to such differences.Methods:Our online survey included 1591 participants from 31 provinces of China with 87% urban and 13% rural residents. We performed multiple linear regressions and path analysis to examine the relationship between rural status and behavioral intention, attitude, subjective norms, information appraisal, knowledge, variety of information source use, and preventive behaviors against COVID-19.Findings:Compared with urban residents, rural residents were less likely to perform preventive behaviors, more likely to hold a negative attitude toward the effectiveness of performing preventive behaviors, and more likely to have lower levels of information appraisal skills. We identified information appraisal as a significant factor that might contribute to the rural/urban differences in preventive behaviors against COVID-19 through attitude, subjective norms, and intention. We found no rural/urban differences in behavioral intention, subjective norms, knowledge about preventive behaviors, or the variety of interpersonal/media source use.Conclusions:As the first wave of the pandemic inundated urban areas, the current media coverage about COVID-19 prevention may not fully satisfy the specific needs of rural populations. Thus, rural residents were less likely to engage in a thoughtful process of information appraisal and adopt the appropriate preventive measures. Tailoring health messages to meet rural populations' unique needs can be an effective strategy to promote preventive health behaviors against COVID-19.

AB  - This research examines whether varying the number of words in which thoughts are expressed can influence subsequent evaluations. Across six studies, keeping the number of thoughts constant, we tested to what extent the length of the thoughts, the personal importance of the topic, and the extent of practice in short versus long thought expression influenced attitude change. In the first two studies, expressing thoughts in one word (vs. many words) led to less thought use when the topic was high in importance (Experiment 1) but to more thought use when topic was low in importance (Experiment 2). In a third study, the number of words used was manipulated along with the perceived importance of the experimental task. As predicted, expressing thoughts was perceived to be easier with one vs. many words when the task was low in importance but the opposite held when it was high in importance. In Experiment 4, attitudes were more influenced by thoughts when one word was used in a task that was framed to low importance task but many words were used on the task framed with high importance. Experiment 5 included a direct manipulation of ease and extended these results from a motivational framework to an ability setting by using a paradigm in which familiarity (based on prior training) interacted with thought length to affect attitudes. A final study replicated the key effect with more real-world materials, and extended the contribution from an experimental approach to testing process to a measurement approach to mediation.

AB  - Recent studies examine politicians' decisions to use social media, as well as the content of the messages that these political actors disseminate on social media platforms. We contribute to this literature by examining how race competitiveness and a candidate's position in the race relative to her opponent affect their decisions to issue attacks. Through content analysis of nearly 15,000 Facebook posts for tone (positive or negative), we find that while competitive races encourage both candidates to issue more negative posts, candidates in less competitive races embrace attack messages with more or less frequency depending on whether they trail or lead their opponent. We find that social media negativity is much more likely to be a desperation strategy employed by underdog candidates in less competitive races. We also run separate models examining the factors that drive policy and personal attacks. While underdog candidates are more likely to engage in issue attacks, candidates in competitive races are significantly more likely to use Facebook to make personal attacks.

AB  - This paper revisits the longstanding question of why segregation douses ethnic tensions in some places but exacerbates them in others. Anchored on the concept of social distance and drawing on empirical evidence from Jos, Nigeria's hotbed of ethnoterritorial conflict, this article provides a nuanced analysis of why segregation mediates both the emergence and the prevention of ethnic conflict. In the examined case study, the role of social distance in conflict mitigation varies according to neighbourhood type. Animosity was already deep-seated across the region when social distancing - the effect of partition and segregation - was cemented following the outbreak of conflict in some communities in 2001. Yet the conflict spread to some ethnically unmixed neighbourhoods but not others. In conflict-affected areas, social distance did not avert future conflicts compared to neighbourhoods where the initial conflict was avoided. However, past conflict is not a predictor of future outbreaks in socially distanced neighbourhoods given that in the areas that avoided future conflicts, social distance occurred simultaneously with extensive informal bi-communal leadership engagements. Therefore, the paper shows that even imperfect unmixing can dampen violence when combined with observable leadership engagement.

AB  - Purpose COVID-19 and its precautions, including social distancing, have revolutionized traditional retailing- and consumption patterns. In this turbulent environment, the purpose of this study is twofold. First, this paper explores the direct effect of consumers' internal/external health locus-of-control on their hygiene consciousness, which, in turn, affects their social distancing behavior. Second, this study posits that social distancing, in turn, impacts consumers' current online grocery shopping behavior and their future online grocery shopping intentions, thus uncovering important insight. Design/methodology/approach To address these gaps, this paper develops a model that links consumers' internal/external health locus-of-control to their adoption of e-tailing-based grocery services. Data collected through a web-based survey was analyzed by using partial least squares-based structural equation modeling. Findings The results indicate that consumers' health locus-of-control indirectly affects the way they shop for their groceries during the pandemic. In particular, consumers' internal (external) health locus-of-control drives higher (lower) hygiene consciousness and greater (lower) social distancing behavior. In turn, consumers' online grocery shopping behavior was found to increase during the pandemic, with their corresponding intent to continue this behavior in the future. Moreover, this study finds the effects of consumers' social distancing on their current grocery shopping behavior and future intentions to be contingent on consumer age, with stronger effects identified for older consumers. Originality/value This study shows how consumers' internal/external health loci-of-control exert opposing effects on their social distancing behavior, as mediated by hygiene consciousness. Overall, the empirical analyzes corroborate the association of consumers' social distancing- and online grocery shopping behavior (for consumers of different age profiles), both during and after the pandemic.

AB  - Attitudes toward immigrants and immigration policies are divisive issues in American politics. These attitudes are influenced by factors such as political orientation and religiousness, with religious and conservative individuals demonstrating higher prejudice toward immigrants and refugees, and endorsing stricter immigration policies. Christian nationalism, an ideology marked by the belief that America is a Christian nation, may help explain how religious nationalist identity influences negative attitudes toward immigrants. The current research addresses this through four studies among participants in the US. Across studies, our results showed that Christian nationalism was a significant and consistent predictor of anti-immigrant stereotypes, prejudice, dehumanization, and support for anti-immigrant policies. These effects were robust to inclusion of other sources of anti-immigrant attitudes, including religious fundamentalism, nationalism, and political ideology. Further, perceived threats from immigrants mediated the relationship between Christian nationalism and dehumanization of immigrants, and attitudes toward immigration policies. These findings have implications for our understanding of the relations between religious nationalism and attitudes toward immigrants and immigration policy in the US, as well as in other contexts.

AB  - In a social context, customer participation in the innovation process is often accompanied by social exclusion situations, which are generally believed to have a negative impact on individuals. However, research results and marketing practices show that social exclusion can also exert a positive influence on creativity, product selection, perceived risk, and so on. Through two experimental studies, this research explores the relationship between social exclusion and customer participation in innovation. It finds that social exclusion has a positive influence on customer participation in innovation and that customer-company identification mediates this relationship.

AB  - In two studies we examined the role of two regulatory foci (i.e., prevention and promotion) in predicting Australian's attitudes to different types of migrants. According to regulatory focus theory, promotion-focused self-regulation is concerned with nurturance and accomplishment needs and involves the pursuit of wishes and aspirations. As such, it results in sensitivity to positive outcomes and to relative pleasure from gains. On the other hand, prevention-focused self-regulation is concerned with security needs and is directed at meeting duties and obligations. As such, it results in sensitivity to negative outcome and relative pain from losses. In Study 1, as predicted, the extent of promotion focus (i.e., a concern with accomplishment and the pursuit of ideals) predicted more positive attitudes to culturally similar and economically beneficial migrants, whereas the extent of prevention focus (i.e., concern with security and meeting obligations) predicted more negative attitudes to migrants who are culturally dissimilar. In Study 2 we replicated and extended these findings, showing that the extent of promotion focus and a lack of concern with threats predicted positive attitudes to both culturally similar and economically beneficial migrants, which, in the case of the latter group, was mediated by a focus on the benefits these migrants provide. In the case of culturally dissimilar migrants, the extent of promotion focus and a concern with gains predicted more positive attitudes. However, for economically less beneficial migrants, neither the extent of promotion nor prevention focus was a predictor. Only lower concerns with threat predicted more positive attitudes to this migrant group. The results are discussed with respect to other determinants of attitudes to migrants and the implications for migration and asylum-seeker policy.

However, relatively little research has investigated the psychological foundations of attitudes towards this minority group. The following study employs a dual process model of intergroup attitudes to explore the motivational basis of non-vegetarians' attitudes towards vegetarians and vegans. Participants were 1,326 individuals recruited through advertisements in a national newspaper in New Zealand. Non-vegetarian participants first completed measures of ideological attitudes and social worldviews, and then were randomly assigned to complete a measure of outgroup attitudes towards either vegetarians or vegans. Although non-vegetarians' attitudes towards both vegetarians and vegans were generally positive, attitudes towards vegans were significantly less positive than attitudes towards vegetarians, and male participants expressed significantly less positive attitudes towards both outgroups than female participants. The structural equation model predicting attitudes towards vegetarians and vegans fit the data well and explained a significant amount of the variance in attitudes.

AB  - Hungary takes the fourth place regarding the incidence and the fifth regarding the mortality of cervical cancer among the member countries of the European Union, with 500 deaths due to this preventable illness and nearly 1200 new cases diagnosed every year. Although the vaccines have been available for 3 years, the estimated rate of the female population vaccinated against HPV is approximately 10% in the 12-26-year-age cohort. The aim of this study was to determine factors and motivations affecting the uptake of HPV vaccination among Hungarian adolescents. Examining the effects of some possible sociodemographic predictors (age and gender) and the exposure to health information on HPV vaccine acceptability were also focused on, as well as assessing the most trusted sources of information about sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
   A nationwide anonymous questionnaire survey with a sample of 1769 students attending public primary or secondary schools was organised by the authors in 16 Hungarian cities and towns. Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).
   Adolescents' awareness of HPV was relatively low. Only 35% of the participants reported they had heard about HPV prior to the survey. Almost 70% of the potentially affected study population had not heard about the vaccine previously. Every fourth student did not believe that vaccination against HPV can prevent cervical cancer. If the vaccination was available free of charge, almost 80% of respondents would request it, but in case they had to pay for it, this number would significantly decrease. Significantly better knowledge and also more positive attitudes towards HPV vaccination was found in relation to the number of information sources. The majority of respondents (62-83%) were open for further information about STDs. The main trusted mediators were school-health services (61.3%), education on health at school (49.2%), health professionals (42.2%) and electronic media (24.6%).
   Since Hungarian adolescent students expect guidance about STDs principally from school health education, an urgent need for well-designed, HPV-focused educational programmes, emerges. Launching such programmes would be especially important for the adolescent population to increase their awareness of the risks associated with HPV infection thus reducing the high incidence of cervical cancer in Hungary in the future.

AB  - It is common nowadays for parents to share information about their children on social network sites (SNSs). However, little is known on how adolescents think and feel about this sharenting behavior. Therefore, this study explores adolescents' perception of the reasons why parents share information about their adolescent children on SNSs, and adolescents' attitudes toward sharenting. A survey study was conducted among 817 adolescents. Factor analyses pointed toward four perceived sharenting motives: parental advice motives, social motives, impression management motives, and informative-archiving motives. Adolescents believed that parents mainly shared information about their children due to informative-archiving motives. They believed that parental advice motives were less common. Preliminary analyses pointed out that adolescents largely disapproved of sharenting. They mainly considered it as embarrassing and useless. Regression analysis indicated that when adolescents perceived sharenting as an impression management issue, the more negative their attitudes were toward sharenting. Conversely, the more adolescents thought that parents shared information about their children due to informative-archiving motives, the less they disapproved of sharenting. Additionally, when adolescents themselves disclosed more personal information or when they were more often confronted with sharenting, they had more positive attitudes toward sharenting. Adolescents who were more concerned about their online privacy, were more likely to disapprove of sharenting.

AB  - COVID-19 has had far-reaching effects on people's lives, with evidence of a disproportionate impact on marginalized groups. Given existing health disparities and research on minority stress, COVID-19 may have uniquely impacted psychological well-being among sexual minorities. In an online survey of adults in the U.S. (N = 1,007) conducted in April 2020, we examined differences between sexual minority and heterosexual participants in psychological well-being, social distancing, computer-mediated communication, and COVID-19-related worry and experiences. Sexual minorities reported lower thriving and greater psychological distress, social distancing, computer-mediated communication, and COVID-19 worry and experiences than heterosexual participants. Social distancing and distress were positively correlated among sexual minorities and more frequent computer-mediated communication predicted greater thriving across groups. Path analyses showed sexual minorities' poorer psychological well-being was mediated by their greater COVID-19 worry and social distancing, in particular. These findings shed light on the distinct impact of COVID-19 on sexual minorities.

AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate the relationship between transformational, transactional leadership and task performance and to clarify the mediating effects of job satisfaction. Besides, we examined the effects of the moderating effects of social distance on transformational, transactional leadership and job satisfaction. Two hundred and sixty six employees from 43 electronic companies in Taiwan participated in this study. The results showed that transformational and transactional leadership had a significant positive relationship with task performance. Job satisfaction was a mediator of the relationship between transformational, transactional leadership and task performance. Finally, we found that social distance had negative moderating effects: When the degree of social distance was high, the positive relationship between transactional leadership and job satisfaction was weaker; on the other hand, when the degree of social distance was low, the negative relationship between transactional leadership style and task performance was stronger.. But social distance did not have significant moderating effects on transformational leadership.

AB  - Independent of the left-right model of ideological structure, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food and agriculture are resented across the political spectrum in Switzerland. In the absence of any real experience with genetically modified (GM) food but faced with continuous exposure to warning messages in the media, conditioned feelings related to such a politically sensitive product may have a significant influence on revealed consumer choice. In our large-scale field study, we examined this assumption by selling three types of bread labeled as 'made with organic corn', 'made with genetically modified corn' and 'made with conventional corn' respectively in five locations across Switzerland using different price scenarios and selling groups. Customers who decided to buy bread also received an envelope containing a questionnaire about their prior political attitude expressed through their voting decision in a national referendum on a five-year ban on GMOs in 2005. The results demonstrate that consumer purchase decisions are determined by contextual factors not captured by general political attitudes. Surprisingly, the mere presence of GM food did have a positive impact on overall sales. The assumption that consumers would feel turned off by the mere presence of GM food for political reasons can therefore be safely discarded.

AB  - Introduction: Technology and Neuroscience have formed a strong collaboration to improve education. The effective use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education practice requires that both students and teachers maintain a positive attitude towards these technologies, and develop their use in educational contexts to update teaching methodologies based on educational neuroscience and neuropsychology. Thus, the use of ICT requires a positive attitude when using these tools during the teaching-learning process, as a starting point to improve the quality of the process. The article was written in the year 2016 in the faculty of Education of the Universidad Internancional de la Rioja. Methodology: The aim of this study is to analyze the student's attitudes towards the use of new technologies in primary school classrooms. We designed a questionnaire and gave it to 1,770 students aged 11 and 12 years from 50 CEIP (Infant and Primary schools). Results: In general, the results show that whilst students of 11 and 12 years do not show a rejection of the use of ICT, a low percentage demonstrate that they would prefer to use them in a group. Conclusions: An adequate use of ICT in the classroom would depend on the predisposition of the students, and the knowledge of the technologies and their use by teachers and students. Therefore, it is recommended for ICT to be implemented in the classroom in order to improve the teaching-learning process and to incorporate new methodologies from neuroscience research.

AB  - Research has shown that social exclusion has devastating psychological, physiological, and behavioral consequences. However, little is known about possible ways to shield individuals from the detrimental effects of social exclusion. The present study, in which participants were excluded during a ball-tossing game, examined whether (reminders of) secure attachment relationships could attenuate neurophysiological pain- and stress-related responses to social exclusion. Social exclusion was associated with activation in brain areas implicated in the regulation and experience of social distress, including areas in the lateral and medial prefrontal cortex, ventral anterior cingulate cortex, and hypothalamus. However, less activation in these areas was found to the extent that participants felt more securely attached to their attachment figure. Moreover, the psychological presence (i.e., salience) of an attachment figure attenuated hypothalamus activation during episodes of social exclusion, thereby providing insight into the neural mechanisms by which attachment relationships may help in coping with social stress.

AB  - An increasing body of research demonstrates that narrative-based communication can be effective in eliciting attitude change, especially when recipients become transported into the narrative. Using data from a national sample of viewers of Super Bowl XLV (2011) or XLVI (2012), this study addresses whether some people are more disposed to be transported by narrative advertising and how they react to it. Evidence is presented to suggest that people differ in their receptivity to narrative messaging and that these differences are significantly related to advertising effectiveness. Managerial implications of this work are discussed.

AB  - Purpose Consumers who experience social exclusion often prefer high-risk financial products over low-risk financial products. The aim of this study is to examine how this effect can be attenuated by applying the theories of mental budgeting and pain of payment. The authors' aim in pursuing this research is to improve the effectiveness of financial professionals and others in educating consumers on healthy financial practices. Understanding how social exclusion experiences influence financial decision-making is essential for continued progress in consumer financial education. Design/methodology/approach The authors examine the effect of consumers experiencing social exclusion on preference for high-risk financial products using an experimental design involving the manipulation of social exclusion/inclusion experiences. Data were collected from 148 consumers of mutual fund investment services via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Findings The study found that consumers experiencing social exclusion are more likely to make high risk investments. It also found that this effect is moderated by consumers' level of mental budgeting such that at high levels of mental budgeting the effect of social exclusion on investment choice is attenuated. The study further finds that the moderating effect of mental budgeting is mediated by pain of payment. Social implications The findings of this study suggest that policymakers can reduce unduly risky personal investment behavior by triggering mental budgeting thoughts using methods such as advertising and explicit mention of transaction fees. Originality/value The present study builds on existing research demonstrating the adverse behavioral consequences of social exclusion but refines our understanding by demonstrating the attenuating effect of mental budgeting and the mediating effect of pain of payment on high risk financial purchases.

AB  - Preventive behavior, such as hand hygiene, facemask wearing, and social distancing, plays a vital role in containing the spread of viruses during pandemics. However, people in many parts of the world usually encounter difficulties adhering to this behavior due to various causes. Thus, this article aims to develop a research framework and propose design strategies to prompt individuals' behavior change during pandemics. Initially, we integrated a literature review and a structured interview (n = 22) to ascertain the core factors impacting behavior change during pandemics. These factors were categorized into four aspects: perceptional factors (attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavior control, risk perceptions); social factors (knowledge and information dissemination, governmental regulations); physical factors (tools and facilities and surveillance); and sociocultural factor (cultural contexts). Then, a theoretical framework with antecedents was developed to reveal behavior intention and formation process. After that, an empirical study was carried out to test the research framework through a questionnaire survey (n = 549). The research findings indicated that all derived factors could directly or indirectly affect individuals' preventive behavior during pandemics. This article strives to provide valuable insights for different stakeholders when coping with pandemic situations.

AB  - Popular entertainment often involves political messages, and entertainment elements are now commonly used in politics coverage. This study examines how suspense drives impacts of political entertainment media content on attitudes, building on the "affective news" extended model. Hypotheses were tested with four texts on controversial political issues (within-subjects), presented in alinearorinverted-pyramidstructure and either asnewsorfiction. The resulting 2 x 2 x 3 x 4 online experiment (N= 227) showed that linear texts produced greater suspense and attitude change than inverted-pyramid texts. Suspense mediated attitude impacts. Both news and fiction versions influenced attitudes, with impacts still detectable 1 day after exposure.

AB  - This study aimed to compare female and male students' attitudes and achievements within different learning settings determined by e-learning and in-classroom learning modalities, collaborative (CL), and traditional (TL) learning pedagogies and investigated the effect of single-gender (SG) and mixed-gender (MG) grouping in an undergraduate biology course. 1375 biology students enrolled in a public university were randomly divided into 12 learning settings. Keller's ARCS model and Vygotsky's Socio-cultural Theory were the theoretical frameworks that guided this study. Results indicated that females attained higher achievement and more positive attitude towards biology in TL and CL sections in single-gender compared to mix-gender classes; overall, academic achievements between females and males demonstrated a significant difference at P < .05. Females students performed relatively low achievement and had a negative attitude toward biology in mix-gender CL groups (2 Females + 2 Males) compared to single-gender CL groups (4 Females) in in-classroom modality. E-learning attenuated the negative impact of mixed-gender grouping on female students within e-learning CL settings. The effect size value indicated that males benefited more than females from mixed-gender CL (2F + 2 M) pedagogy in e-learning and in-classroom modalities. Thus, e-learning may encourage female students to overcome the socio-cultural barrier that leads them to feel reticence in mixed-gender groups. The study helps to understand the most suitable learning settings for female and male students to decrease gender disparities, reduce the negative influences of stereotypical threats in different socio-cultural environments, and develop learning strategies to further equalize opportunities for females and male students, promoting students' attitudes and achievement in undergraduate biology education.

AB  - This paper offers an insight into the role of young people in shifting risk perception of the current global pandemic, COVID-19, via social distancing narratives on social media. Young people are creatively and affectively supporting the social distancing initiatives in Brunei Darussalam through the use of social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and Tik Tok. Using qualitative content analysis (QCA) data of social media content by Bruneian youth, this paper reveals the localised and contextualised creative production of five 'social distancing' narratives as a response to the national and global concerns in times of a global pandemic: narrative of fear; narrative of responsibility; narrative of annoyance; narrative of fun; and narrative of resistance. This paper reflects on three key socio-cultural reconfigurations that have broader implications beyond the COVID-19 crisis: new youth spatialities and social engagements; youth leadership in development; and consideration of social participation and reach in risk communication.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors which influence refugee migrants' adoption of digital technology and its relevance to their social inclusion in Australia.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research developed a conceptual framework keeping the "use" of digital technology as the centre-piece of the digital divide. The empirical data were derived from a series of focus group discussions with refugee migrants in an Australian regional city, Toowoomba in Queensland.
   Findings - There is a digital divide among refugee migrant groups and it is based on inequalities in physical access to and use of digital technology, the skills necessary to use the different technologies effectively and the ability to pay for the services. The opportunities to use digital technology could support the social inclusion of refugee migrant groups in the broader Australian community.
   Research limitations/implications - Further research is required to examine whether this digital divide is unique in the regional context or common to Australian society and to confirm factors that might contribute significantly to refugee migrants' social inclusion.
   Originality/value - This paper determined the role digital technology can play in building social capital and hence social inclusion among refugee migrant groups. Many of the factors identified as influencing refugee migrants' use of digital technology can inform the Australian government and the information and communication technology industry in devising supportive policies and plans to reduce the risk of social exclusion, alienation and marginalisation among refugee migrant groups.

AB  - A longitudinal survey study was conducted to examine which strategies for reducing cognitive dissonance were used among men engaging in infidelity. Data were collected in two waves, 1 month apart (n (time1) = 1514, n (time2) = 425), from a sample of male users of Ashley Madison, a "married dating" site targeting users who are seeking to engage in infidelity. Because perpetrators of infidelity may justify their behaviors differently depending on whether they cheated in an online environment, both online and offline infidelity behaviors were considered. Results indicated that attitude change and self-concept change were positively related to online infidelity, while only self-concept change was positively related to offline infidelity, suggesting their differential effectiveness for various communication media. Self-concept change, attitude change, and denial of responsibility were negatively related to psychological discomfort and perceived negative impact at time 2, indicating their relative success for reducing negative psychological outcomes compared to other strategies such as adding consonant cognitions.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the framing and re-framing of activism efforts enacted by LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, Chris Paul, and Carmelo Anthony during the 2016 ESPYS through the theoretical lens of critical race theory. Specifically, comments made to three posts on ESPN's Facebook page pertaining to these calls for activism were analyzed. Qualitative coding of 10,658 comments led to the discovery of four primary themes including (a) discussing race; (b) law enforcement accountability; (c) realities of violence; and (d) debating crime. While the athletes (i.e. the messengers) engaging in activism received attention via Facebook comments, users focused significant attention on the messages being disseminated. Ultimately, this social media discourse illuminated the complex nature of race relations in the United States today, highlighting the persistence of deeply ingrained cultural stereotypes and beliefs that are often left unshaken by athlete activism.

AB  - To increase public awareness and disseminate health information, the WHO and health departments worldwide have been visualizing the latest statistics on the spread of COVID-19 to increase awareness and thus reduce its spread. Within various sources, graphs are frequently used to illustrate COVID-19 datasets. Limited research has provided insights into the effect of different graphs on emotional stress and ineffective behavioral strategies from a cross-cultural perspective. The result of current research suggests a graph with a high proportion size of the colored area (e.g., stacked area graph) might increase people's anxiety and social distancing intentions; people in collectivist culture might have a high level of anxiety and social distancing intentions; the effect of different graphs on social distancing intentions is mediated by anxiety experienced. Theoretical contribution and practical implications on health communication were also discussed in this study.

AB  - Introduction: Deficits in area of communication, crucial for maintaining proper social bonds, may have a prominent adverse impact on quality of life in patients with schizophrenia. Social exclusion, lack of employment and deterioration of family life, may be consequences of aggravated social competencies, caused by inability to properly exhibit and interpret facial expressions. Although this phenomenon is known since first clinical descriptions of schizophrenia, lack of proper methodology limited our knowledge in this area. Aim of our study was to compare facial expressivity of the patient with schizophrenia, and the healthy individual.
   Methods: 47-years old patient suffering from schizophrenia, and 36-years old healthy individual were invited to participate in our study. They underwent the examination in Human Facial Modelling Lab in Polish-Japanese Institute of Information Technology in Bytom (Silesia, Katowice). Both participants were presented with two video materials, first one contained different facial expressions, which they had to imitate. Second one a part of comedy show, during which spontaneous reactions were recorded. Acquisition of facial expressions was conducted with marker-based technology of modelling. Obtained data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel.
   Results and conclusions: An overall facial expression intensity, expressed as an average value of distances traveled by markers during shifts from neutral position was higher in case of a healthy participant during both part of the study. The difference was especially visible in case of an upper half of the face. Utilization of marker-based methods in analysis of human facial expressions seem to be reliable and remarkably accurate.

AB  - The extensive proliferation of recent coronavirus (COVID-19), all over the world, is the outcome of social interactions through massive transportation, gatherings and population growth. To disrupt the widespread of COVID-19, a mechanism for social distancing is indispensable. Also, to predict the effectiveness and quantity of social distancing for a particular social network, with a certain contagion, a generalized model is needed. In this manuscript, we propose a social distancing mediated generalized model to predict the pandemic spread of COVID-19. By considering growth rate as a temporal harmonic function damped with social distancing in generalized Richard model and by using the data of confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, USA and India, we find that, with time, the cumulative spread grows more rapidly due to weak social distancing as compared to the stronger social distancing, where it is explicitly decreasing. Furthermore, we predict the possible outcomes with various social distancing scenarios by considering highest growth rate as an initial state, and illustrate that the increase in social distancing tremendously decreases growth rate, even it tends to reach zero in lockdown regimes. Our findings not only provide epidemic growth scenarios as a function of social distancing but also provide a modified growth model to predict controlled information flow in any network.

AB  - Online Social Networking Sites (SNSs) are immensely popular, especially among adolescents. Activity on these sites leaves digital footprints, which may be used to study online behavioral correlates of adolescent psycho. logical distress and to, ultimately, improve detection and intervention efforts. In the present work, we explore the digital footprints of adolescent depression, social rejection, and victimization of bullying on Facebook. Two consecutive studies were conducted among Israeli adolescents (N = 86 and N = 162). We collected a range of Facebook activity features, as well as self-report measurements of depression, social rejection, and victimization of bullying. Findings from Study 1 demonstrate that explicit distress references in Facebook postings (e.g., "Life sucks, I want to die") predict depression among adolescents, but that such explicit distress references are rare. In Study 2, we applied a bottom-up research methodology along with the previous top-down, theory driven approach. Study 2 demonstrates that less explicit features of Facebook behavior predict social rejection and victimization of bullying. These features include 'posts by others', 'check-ins', 'gothic and dark content', 'other people in pictures', and 'positive attitudes towards others'. The potential, promises and limitations of using digital Facebook footprints for the detection of adolescent psychological distress are discussed.

AB  - This study analyzed spatial patterns of colorectal cancer (CRC) in Miami-Dade County (MDC), Florida, evaluating them in relation to neighborhood characteristics and the 1996 Welfare Reform Act. Late-stage CRC cases and CRC-related mortality from the Florida Cancer Data System were mapped. Age-adjusted spatial patterns of CRC were then analyzed in relation to indices of neighborhood-level socioeconomic status (SES) derived from United States Bureau of the Census data releases. Statistical analyses were repeated for two distinct time periods corresponding to before and after the 1996 Welfare Reform Act. CRC incidence and mortality are significantly associated with poverty-related factors in the first time period, and race-related factors in the second. There was a possible shift in the role of SES in mediating CRC outcomes at this scale of analysis after the Welfare Reform Act implementation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Covid-19 has changed consumer behaviour, probably forever. Initial consumer stockpiling led to stockouts, threat and uncertainty for consumers. To overcome shortages, consumers expanded their use of channels and many consumers started buying online for the first time. In this paper, we aim to address important research gaps related to consumer behaviour during the pandemic and especially stockpiling. Our paper starts by presenting the findings of our pre-study, which used social media to elicit or confirm potential constructs for our quantitative models. These constructs complemented the protection motivations theory to explain stockpiling behaviour, forming the basis for study 1, the stockpiling preparation stage and study 2, the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic disruptor on customer service logistics and lockdown shopping channel preferences. For studies 1 and 2 we gathered data via a UK online panel-structured questionnaire survey (n = 603). Results confirm that consumer-driven changes to supply chains emanate largely from consumer uncertainty. Lockdown restrictions led to consumers feeling socially excluded, but enhanced consumers' positive attitudes towards shopping online and increased consumers' altruism. In response, consumers stockpiled by visiting physical stores and/or ordering online. Lockdown restrictions led to feelings of social exclusion but, importantly, stockpiling helped to minimize consumer anxiety and fear and even increase wellbeing.

AB  - Background/Purpose There is an increasing trend in the utilization of long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods globally. The study assessed the utilization of LARC methods and its determinants in a tertiary hospital, southwestern Nigeria using a mixed method study. Methods A cross-sectional study of women attending the Family Planning Clinic of the tertiary hospital was conducted between November 1, 2018 and October 31, 2019 using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative data was collected using structured questionnaire while in-depth interviewer topic guide was used to obtain qualitative data from the respondents. The quantitative and qualitative data obtained from the respondents were analyzed using SPSS version 22 and open code version 3.6.2, respectively, and the determinants of utilization of LARC methods were identified using multivariate regression model. Results The current utilization rate of LARC methods was 65.6% and implants accounted for 75% of LARC used. Higher education (p = 0.035), more than 3 living children (p = 0.030), previous use of LARC (p = 0.028), good knowledge (p = 0.025) and positive attitude of the women about LARC (p = 0.026) were significant determinants of utilization among the women. Limiting size of family was the commonest reason among LARC users, while partner disapproval, fear of procedure and side effects were reasons given by non-users. Conclusions The utilization rate of LARC methods are high, and this should be sustained through improved information dissemination, education of women and involvement of male partners in reproductive health matters including family planning.

AB  - In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, striking public health measures have been implemented to encourage physical distancing in order to slow the spread of disease. However, the impact of these measures on health and wellbeing is not well understood. In the current study a daily diary methodology was used to investigate the effects of social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic on a variety of outcomes with 230 undergraduate students. Participants completed an online diary for 3 days, reporting on daily social distancing behaviors, psychological wellbeing/resources, social/interpersonal connection with others, health behaviors, and health outcomes. Overall, daily social distancing (close adherence to social distancing guidelines) was associated with decreases in psychological wellbeing/resources, less social/interpersonal connection with others (including technology-mediated communication), fewer positive health behaviors, and increased reports of stress-related physical illness symptoms. Discussion centers on implications of these findings as well as the importance of identifying ways to mitigate the effects of these necessary but costly measures on health and wellbeing.

AB  - Moralized issues, such as abortion and same-sex marriage, are some of the most polarizing and divisive issues in politics. These topics motivate political engagement but present a barrier to democratic resolution. Yet we know little about how some issues become "moral issues" and others do not. In this article, I argue that exposure to persuasive frames, particularly those eliciting anger and disgust, serves to moralize and polarize public opinion. I test these hypotheses across three experiments on emerging debates over food politics. The results consistently show that persuasive frames increase issue moralization and, in turn, facilitate polarization. A panel analysis demonstrates that the effect of a single exposure lasts at least two weeks. Mediation analyses suggest that feelings of disgust and anger help explain how persuasive frames moralize political attitudes, while anger alone seems to explain the polarizing effects of framing. Overall, the findings provide new insight into framing, emotion, and the development of moral issues.

AB  - The desire to build and maintain positive relations is a fundamental and universal need of humans. Therefore, individuals' perception of social exclusion has been investigated as a potentially important factor for mental health and wellbeing. In order to enhance adolescents' wellbeing and promote mental health at school, the purpose of the present study was to investigate whether academic self-regulation mediated and moderated the effect of social exclusion on youths' mental health (internalizing and externalizing problems) and affective wellbeing at school. Participants comprised 313 adolescents (55.3% girls), ranging in age between 11 and 19 years (M = 15.678, SD = 1.739). Findings from structural equation analyses indicated a partial mediating effect of academic self-regulation on adolescents' mental health problems and affective wellbeing, and that it promoted their mental health and wellbeing in the face of social exclusion. In addition, moderation analyses supported these results, demonstrating a significant moderating role of academic self-regulation on youths' wellbeing and mental health. Taken together, these results support the importance of academic self-regulation on youths' mental health and wellbeing in the face of social exclusion, and contribute to the design of school-based services in order to protect their mental health and wellbeing. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Purpose: It is extremely important for teachers to have the psychological capital to enhance their performance outputs in educational organizations. Teachers having psychological capital will positively influence all the members of the school. This kind of teacher will develop and support colleagues' and students' positive attitudes attitudes such as competence, hope, motivation, and productivity. The purpose of this research is to determine the relationship between psychological capital and stress, anxiety, burnout, job satisfaction, and job involvement. Research Methods: The sample of this study consists of 335 teachers in 27 schools that were selected randomly from the schools at Hatay's Kinkhan district in the 2014-2015 academic year. The Psychological Capital Scale, Stress Scale, Anxiety Scale, Burnout Scale, Job Satisfaction Scale, and Job Involvement Scale were used to collect the data. Findings: As teachers' psychological capitals increase, their stress levels decrease. Psychological capital has a negative impact on anxiety levels of teachers through the full mediation effect of stress. Psychological capital negatively affects teachers' burnout levels through the partial mediation effects of stress and anxiety. Psychological capital has a positive effect on teachers' job satisfaction through the partial mediation effects of stress, anxiety, and burnout. Psychological capital has a positive effect on the job involvement levels of teachers through the partial mediation effects of stress, anxiety, burnout, and job satisfaction. Implications for Research and Practice: It is essential for school administrators to contribute to the development and strengthening of teachers' psychological capital if they wish for teachers to feel negative attitudes less frequently and to develop more positive attitudes at work.

AB  - Plagiarism is a problematic issue in universities across the globe (Curtis & Vardanega, 2016). This study explored the relationship between negative emotionality and positive attitudes toward plagiarism through the mediation of academic self-efficacy and self-control. Negative emotionality was examined as three components: stress, anxiety, and depression. Self-report surveys were completed by 454 university students to investigate the relationship between negative emotionality and positive attitudes toward plagiarism, as well as the mediating role of academic self-efficacy and self-control in this relationship. The hierarchical multiple regression found that negative emotionality significantly predicted positive attitudes toward plagiarism over and above age and gender (i.e., where male students and younger students were more likely to plagiarise). Furthermore, three mediation analyses showed that academic self-efficacy and self-control mediate the relationship between positive attitudes toward plagiarism and each component of negative emotionality. Considering these results, subsequent research should investigate whether implementing strategies that alleviate stress, anxiety, and depression could increase academic self-efficacy and self-control, which in turn, could then reduce positive attitudes toward plagiarism.

The results of a confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling of a sample of more than 1100 people indicate that all components of coolness except subcultural appeal lead to users' intentions to utilize smart TVs based on their positive attitude toward them. The results of this study validate the role of the components of the coolness concept as effective and appropriate motivations for the intention to use. The paper also presents the implications of the results and the accompanying limitations of the study.

AB  - Information technology has brought with it many advantages for organisations, but information security is still a major concern for organisations which rely on such technology. Users, whether with intent or through negligence, are a great source of potential of risk to information assets. A lack of awareness, negligence, resistance, disobedience, apathy and mischievousness are root causes of information security incidents in organisations. As such, insider threats have attracted the attention of a number of experts in this domain. Two particularly important considerations when exploring insider threats are motivation and opportunity. Two fundamental theories relating to these phenomena, and on which the research presented in this paper relies, are Social Bond Theory (SBT), which can be used to help undermine motivation to engage in misbehaviour, and Situational Crime Prevention Theory (SCPT), which can be used to reduce opportunities for misbehaviour. The results of our data analysis show that situational prevention factors such as increasing the effort and risk involved in a crime, reducing the rewards and removing excuses can significantly promotes the adoption of negative attitudes towards misbehaviour, though reducing provocations does not have any effect on attitudes. Further, social bond factors such as a commitment to organisational policies and procedures, involvement in information security activities and personal norms also significantly promotes the adoption of negative attitudes towards misbehaviour. Flowever, attachment does not significantly promote an attitude of misbehaviour avoidance on the part of employees. Finally, our findings also show that a negative attitude towards misbehaviour influences the employees' intentions towards engaging in misbehaviour positively, and this in turn reduces insider threat behaviour. The outputs of this study shed some light on factors which play a role in reducing misbehaviour in the domain of information security for academics and practitioners. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: To evaluate the association between social distancing quantified by mobile phone data and the current prevalence of COVID-19 infections in the U.S. per capita.
   Methods: Data were accessed on April 4, 2020, from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Report, and the United States Census Bureau to report prevalence of COVID-19 infections, mobility data, and population per state, respectively. Mobility data points were defined as daily length of visit or time spent in a single location based on mobile phone users shared locations from February 7 - March 29, 2020. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate relationships between normalized per capita infection prevalence and six parameters of social distancing.
   Results: Mobility data indicated the following percent changes compared to median values of baseline activity: -50% in transit stations, -45% in retail/recreation, -36% in workplaces, -23% in grocery/pharmacy, -19% in parks, and +12% in residential living areas. Multivariable linear regression revealed significant correlation between prevalence of infection per capita and parameters of social distancing (R= 0.604, P= 0.002). Time at home was not an independent predictor for prevalence of infection per capita (beta= 0.016; 95% CI, -0.003 to 0.036; P= 0.09).
   Conclusion: Based on mobility reports from mobile phone GPS data and six characteristics of social distancing, significant associations were identified between geographic activity and prevalence of COVID-19 infections in the U.S. per capita. Mobile phone data utilizing 'location history' may be warranted to monitor the effectiveness of social distancing parameters on reducing prevalence of COVID-19 in the U.S.

TI  - Do Mass Media Shape Stereotypes About Intellectually Gifted Individuals? Two Experiments on Stigmatization Effects From Biased Newspaper Reports

AB  - Negative stereotypes about intellectually gifted individuals prevail among teachers and in society although empirical research has debunked them. They are also dominant in mass media representations of gifted individuals such as newspaper reports. The present study investigated whether stereotypic representations in newspaper articles contribute to the stigmatization of gifted individuals and whether nonstereotypic, evidence-based representations might help destigmatize gifted individuals. Two randomized controlled studies with N = 431 and N = 432 university students, respectively, were conducted. In both experiments, the stereotypic representation caused more negative attitudes toward gifted individuals (d = 0.86/0.81), whereas the evidence-based representation caused more positive attitudes (d = -0.54/-0.58), compared with a control group. Quality of previous relationships with gifted persons moderated both effects to some extent; however, both effects were quite robust against potential moderators. Results indicate that the media should be aware of their influence on recipients' attitudes. Giftedness researchers should more actively join in the public debate to counteract stigmatization of intellectually gifted individuals.

AB  - This study employs indicators of child poverty and social exclusion to examine the relationships between the risk of children falling into poverty and their chances of being socially excluded in Taiwan. This study defines 'children in poverty' as those in a household deprived of 60% of an equivalent median income. The dimensions of child social exclusion include necessities, health, leisure activities, local services, neighbourhood problems, and care. This study analyses the data of the '2012 Child Welfare and Needs Survey of Taichung City', with a sample of 604 children randomly selected from the population under 18 years of age in Taichung City. It is found that 27% of the children are in income poverty; female, disabled, children in single-parent or grandparent-headed families, and children of rural areas have higher poverty rates. As for poor-non-poor children comparisons, children in poverty are significantly more likely to be deprived of common necessities, access to Internet, leisure activities, a variety of local services, a safe neighbourhood, and care for children. These findings suggest that material deprivation (poverty) has multiple impacts on facets of the child's social life and his or her living standards. To promote children's participation in society, raising them out of poverty is the most important task.

AB  - Previous studies on the human likeness of service robots have focused mainly on their human-like appearance and used psychological constructs to measure the outcomes of human likeness. Unlike previous studies, this study focused on the human-like behavior of the service robot and used a sociological construct, social distance, to measure the outcome of human likeness. We constructed a conceptual model, with perceived competence and warmth as mediators, based on social-identity theory. The hypotheses were tested through online experiments with 219 participants from China and 180 participants from the US. Similar results emerged for Chinese and American participants in that the high (vs. low) human-like behavior of the service robot caused the participants to have stronger perceptions of competence and warmth, both of which contributed to a smaller social distance between humans and service robots. Perceptions of competence and warmth completely mediated the positive effect of the human-like behavior of the service robot on social distance. Furthermore, Chinese participants showed higher anthropomorphism (perceived human-like behavior) and a stronger perception of warmth and smaller social distance. The perception of competence did not differ across cultures. This study provides suggestions for the human-likeness design of service robots to promote natural interaction between humans and service robots and increase human acceptance of service robots.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is more complex and abstract than previous information and communication technologies as there are many connections occurring. New challenges for users arise from increased amount of data, decisions made automatically, less visibility and more ambiguity, and magnified security and privacy risks. There is a fair chance that only a selective group will benefit,making it important to study IoT from a digital inequality perspective. The current study focused on health, home, and security related IoT by conducting a survey among a representative sample of the Dutch population. The study was guided by resources and appropriation theory. IoT attitudes and material access as well as educational and income differences play an important role. Those with higher education and those with higher incomes have more positive attitudes and are the first to actually buy IoT. This also means that they are the first to develop the required skills and to engage in a diverse IoT use. The results suggest that to make the IoT attractive for larger parts of the population, clear terms of use and user-friendly IoT should be an important objective. Stimulating positive attitudes towards IoT will increase the likelihood of IoT ownership, development of IoT skills, and, eventually, a wider diversity of IoT use. Policies should aim to stress the potential outcomes IoT has to offer and should promote transparency and disclosure of how personal data is used as well as better privacy, security practices and regulation.

AB  - Race-related legislative advances have been made over the years to the advantage of non-Whites. However, this reality is yet to alter mainstream discourses of racism, which have portrayed Whites as having monopoly over the perpetration of racism, arguably because they have systemic/institutional advantage and power to be racist toward non-Whites. This paper argues that racism can be non-institutional, that there is power in non-institutional racism, that non-Whites can utilize non-institutional racism to their advantage, and that racism is not race-specific. With a primary focus on how non-Whites might utilize non-institutional racism, this paper draws on media reports of events of the 2016 presidential election campaigns to demonstrate that the perpetration of racism is no longer a White prerogative, and that the victimization experiences of racism is no longer specific to non-Whites. The paper concludes with a call for these important dynamics of racism to be made salient in academic and public debates.

AB  - Introduction Deliberate self-harm (DSH) is common in clinical populations. Childhood maltreatment (CM) and attitudes both towards oneself and towards DSH may be of importance for the development of DSH. This study aimed to test whether patients with DSH report more CM, more negative attitudes towards oneself and more positive attitudes towards DSH than a clinical and a healthy comparison group, and whether the effects of CM are mediated by negative attitudes towards oneself. Method Females with DSH and psychiatric disorders (n = 34), females without DSH but with psychiatric disorders (n = 31) and healthy female individuals (n = 29) were compared regarding DSH, CM, attitudes towards the self and attitudes towards self-harm. Results Females with DSH reported more emotional abuse and more self-hatred as compared to both comparison groups. The effect of emotional abuse was mediated by self-hatred. The DSH-group had significantly more positive attitudes towards DSH than the healthy comparison group. Conclusion Self-hatred and CM in the form of emotional abuse may be distinguishing characteristics of female patients with DSH in psychiatric settings. The present results are compatible with the hypothesis that emotional abuse leads to DSH via self-hatred, but the cross-sectional nature of the study precludes any causal conclusions. The clinical utility of the results is discussed.
