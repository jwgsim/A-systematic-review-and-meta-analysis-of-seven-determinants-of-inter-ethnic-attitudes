AB  - Widespread political polarization on issues related to environmental conservation may be partially explained by the chronic framing of persuasive messages in ideological and moral terms that hold greater appeal for liberals and egalitarians. A series of three experiments examined the extent to which variations in the moral framing of pro-environmental messaging affect liberals' vs. conservatives' conservation intentions, climate change attitudes, and donations to an environmental organization. While liberals did not generally differ across conditions, conservatives shifted substantially in the pro-environmental direction after exposure to a binding moral frame, in which protecting the natural environment was portrayed as a matter of obeying authority, defending the purity of nature, and demonstrating one's patriotism to the United States. This shift was pronounced when conservatives perceived the congruent appeal to be a stronger argument. Evidence of mediated moderation is also presented, in which the attitudinal and behavioral shifts for conservatives were a function of the degree to which the values present in the pro-environmental appeal were perceived as coming from the ingroup. Discussion focuses on future directions for more precisely specifying moral framing effects, and on considering the pros and cons of targeted messaging for the sustainability of environmental attitude change.

AB  - We extend investigations of the impact of the content of video contact with an individual with schizophrenia on stigma reduction. We examine whether differential impacts persist over a 2-week period and the extent to which they are mediated by perceived similarity and feelings of empathy and/or sympathy.
   We used a randomized control trial wherein participants were exposed to a video in which an individual described his recovery from schizophrenia, or the same person described acute symptoms of schizophrenia, or a no-video control condition. Outcomes included impressions of and preferred social distance to the person in the video and people in general with schizophrenia and well as perceptions of similarity and feelings of sympathy and empathy. We also measured an overt behaviour, seating distance, at 2-week follow-up.
   The recovery-focused material was generally more effective in improving impressions and reducing preferred level of social distance. Although the symptom-focused video resulted in great sympathy for the person, this did not translate into positive impressions or reduced social distance. Mediational analyses yielded findings consistent with the benefits of the recovery video being mediated by increased perceptions of similarity and lower feelings of sympathy. Exposure to the recovery-focused video resulted in less anxiety in anticipation of meeting the person in the video relative to the control condition.
   Video contact emphasizing potential for recovery from schizophrenia was more effective in reducing stigmatizing responses than contact highlighting acute symptoms. Increased sympathy does not necessarily translate into reductions in stigma.

AB  - This study is linked to research into narrative persuasion and the techniques used to reduce rejection of stigmatized groups. Upper-secondary school students were assigned to one of two conditions: viewing a film that arouses empathy toward immigrants or seeing a film that underscores positive intergroup contact. One month before viewing the films the participants completed the Modern Racism Scale. After they viewed the films, researchers measured their identification with ingroup and outgroup characters and their attitudes toward immigration. Results showed that viewing the empathyarousing film caused greater identification with the outgroup characters, which in turn induced more positive attitudes toward immigration, but only when previous prejudice was low or moderate. We discuss findings in the context of narrative persuasion research.

AB  - Objectives. Evidence suggests that ostracism exerts an immediate and painful threat to an individual's primary needs for belonging, meaningful existence, control, and self-esteem. Individuals with schizophrenia are particularly likely to experience the effects of ostracism, being amongst the most stigmatized of all the mental illnesses. The aims of the present study were therefore to assess the immediate and delayed effects of ostracism in these individuals, and to explore associations between any observed effects and indices of negative affect and clinical symptoms.
   Methods. Individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and non-clinical controls engaged in a virtual ball-toss game with two fictitious others. All participants played the game on two separate occasions, participating in both an inclusion and an ostracism condition. Measures of primary needs were obtained after each game.
   Results. Findings suggest that the negative impact of social exclusion lasts longer in individuals with schizophrenia, compared with non-clinical controls. Further, clinical participants who reported lower primary needs after a delay were more likely to exhibit higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress.
   Conclusions. Future studies should examine the use of regulatory strategies and personal responses to stigma as potential mediators in the maintenance of the negative effects of social exclusion. These lines of research may offer insight into interventions that may assist individuals to better cope with this experience.

KW  - trends
AB  - Public attitudes toward immigrants in the UK, especially prejudice against them, form a strong theme in retrospective media postmortems emphasizing the uniqueness of Brexit, yet similarly hostile public opinion on immigrants forms a recurrent theme in populist politics in many European Union nations. Indeed, if UK residents are not uniquely hostile, then the UK's exit from the EU may be only the first symptom of proliferating conflicts over immigration that will plague EU nations in future years. A well-established symptom (or consequence) of prejudice-aversion to outgroups as a neighbors-shows that prejudice against immigrants, other races, Muslims, Hindus, Jews, and Gypsies are all relatively low in the UK. This is as expected from the general decline of prejudice and social distance with socioeconomic development, demonstrated here in broad perspective across many countries. Indeed, UK residents are about as prejudiced against each of these ethno-religious outgroups as are their peers in other advanced EU and English-speaking nations, and much less prejudiced than their peers in less prosperous countries. Confirmatory factor analysis supports the view that a single latent ethno-religious prejudice generates all these specific prejudices, so it is not specific experiences with any one of these groups, nor their specific attributes, that are the wellspring of this deep-seated underlying prejudice. Replication using other measures of prejudice and another cross-national dataset confirms these findings. Data are from the pooled World and European Values Surveys (over 450,000 individuals, 300 surveys, and 100 nations for this analysis) and from the well-known European Quality of Life surveys. Analysis is by descriptive, multilevel (random intercept, fixed effects), and structural equation methods.

AB  - Migration has become increasingly discussed as intangible and uncontrollable and hence as a risk to receiving societies. In the past years, strong public concern and negative attitudes toward immigration have been seen across European countries. The mass media are oftentimes suggested to contribute to such concerns. But mediated risks of immigration do not affect all citizens to an equal extent. This study considers the relationship between information about migration as found in mass media and immigration attitudes as a function of individuals' risk propensity. Our results suggest that tangible risk frames have an effect on immigration attitudes, while abstract risks do not. Tangible risks are statistically not likely to be personally experienced by most people. Yet, they are often framed as having the potential to negatively impact a person's community or wellbeing. Risk propensity played no role in moderating such effects.

AB  - Background Radiographs are an essential part of most clinical dental examinations and diagnoses. The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge and attitudes of parents towards dental radiographs for their children. Methods A 21-item questionnaire, covering parental level of radiation knowledge and socio-demographics was applied. Sliding scales were used to assess attitude towards dental radiographs. Results There were 1467 questionnaires distributed between five primary schools in the Perth (Western Australia) metropolitan area, with 309 surveys (21%) returned for collection. Most parents displayed a low level of knowledge, but had a positive attitude towards dental radiographs. Parents with children who have previously had dental radiographs perceived dental radiographs as good', useful' and pleasant'. A higher level of education and parents with children who have previously had radiographs were significantly associated with a higher level of knowledge about dental radiography. Parents who had higher scores on questions assessing radiation knowledge were more likely to perceive dental radiographs as safe' and beneficial'. Conclusions Most parents have a positive attitude towards dental radiographs on their children. However, the majority of parents lack knowledge regarding dental radiography, especially regarding the risks involved.

AB  - Explicit negative attitudes and blameful beliefs (e.g. poor diet, laziness) towards obese individuals are well documented and are pervasive even among health professionals. Here we sought to determine whether obesity stigma is reflected in a fundamental feature of intersubjectivity namely the automatic neural resonance with others' affective experiences. During fMRI, normal-weight female participants observed short clips depicting normal-weight (NW) and obese (Ob) models experiencing pain. Importantly, participants believed that half of the Ob were overweight due to a hormonal disorder (HormOb) and ignored the cause of obesity of the remaining models (Unknown obese models; UnkOb). Analyses of hemodynamic responses showed reduced activity to the pain of Ob compared to that of NW in areas associated with pain processing and early visual processing. The comparison between the two Ob conditions revealed a further decrease of activity to HormOb's pain compared to UnkOb's (and NW) pain in the right inferior frontal gyrus, an area associated with emotional resonance. Our study demonstrates that stigma for obese individuals can be observed at implicit levels, and that it is modulated by knowledge concerning the etiology of obesity, with the seemingly surprising result that obesity due to disease may result in greater stigmatization. Moreover, the perceived similarity with the models and the ambivalent emotion of pity may index biased brain responses to obese individuals' pain. The study highlights a possibly important neural link between resonance with the pain of others and obesity stigma. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this study was to investigate the various innovative support strategies rendered by academic libraries in support of e-learning in Zimbabwean universities. This was necessitated by the change in nature of learning and services provision in universities as a result of COVID-19. Despite the crisis caused by the pandemic, users of libraries still expect services to answer their information needs.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A quantitative study was done to unpack the role of digital library services in supporting e-learning in universities in Zimbabwe. An online questionnaire was developed using survey monkey and distributed to 50 professional librarians in both private and state universities in Zimbabwe. A total of 34 librarians responded to the questionnaire and the data was analysed and presented thematically. Data were presented using descriptive statistics in the form of figures.
   Findings
   The findings revealed that academic libraries play an important role in supporting e-learning in higher education institutions by providing electronic information resources, which are key in research, learning and teaching. The libraries provide a one-stop shop for accessing electronic resources through the digital library. Patrons have benefitted by accessing and using digital library services during the COVID-19 lockdown period. It was also discovered that libraries should ensure that they are prepared to always offer their services despite the closure of physical buildings because of the pandemic.
   Research limitations/implications
   The study used an online questionnaire only as the data collection instrument, as it was the most suitable one to get data from librarians working from home and also because of the COVID-19 health guidance such as maintaining social distance. The other methods were not used because of financial constraints.
   Practical implications
   This research showed the importance of digital services in e-learning environments, especially in developing countries. The work revealed how university librarians in Zimbabwe are coming up with practical solutions in supporting e-learning in times of crisis. The research therefore becomes handy for higher education institutions and authorities in crafting e-learning frameworks and positioning academic libraries at the centre of teaching, learning and research activities.
   Social implications
   This paper provides useful insights into how libraries can support learning especially during a pandemic. The paper details how libraries support communities by offering correct and reliable information from scholarly information sources. It also chronicles how libraries play an important part in the support of researchers in higher institutions in the fight against COVID-19.
   Originality/value
   To the best of authors' knowledge, this research is one of the first done in Zimbabwe on strategies that libraries are using in the COVID-19 era to support e-learning. The findings presented in this study are helpful for higher and tertiary education authorities and other policymakers in improving e-learning and digital libraries.

AB  - We study partisan differences in Americans' response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Political leaders and media outlets on the right and left have sent divergent messages about the severity of the crisis, which could impact the extent to which Republicans and Democrats engage in social distancing and other efforts to reduce disease transmission. We develop a simple model of a pandemic response with heterogeneous agents that clarifies the causes and consequences of heterogeneous responses. We use location data froma large sample of smartphones to showthat areaswithmore Republicans engaged in less social distancing, controlling for other factors including public policies, population density, and local COVID cases and deaths. We then present new survey evidence of significant gaps at the individual level between Republicans and Democrats in self-reported social distancing, beliefs about personal COVID risk, and beliefs about the future severity of the pandemic.

AB  - This study explores to what extent selective exposure to political messages can produce political (in)tolerance among authoritarians and non-authoritarians. Drawing on a selection-exposure experiment embedded within an online survey conducted in the United States (N = 1978) and Canada (N = 1673), we explore how authoritarians and non-authoritarians react to framing around civil liberties controversies. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a message about a controversial group. In the forced-choice condition, participants were randomly assigned a political or non-political message. In a second condition, participants were given a choice of which message to read more about. The results show that authoritarians who are politically knowledgeable generally avoid messages that promote free speech by consuming non-political information. While messages about the dangers of free speech have the potential to produce more intolerance among authoritarians, we found that this effect was limited to those who are the least likely to consume them when given a choice. By contrast, we found that messages about the risk posed by free speech produced intolerance among non-authoritarians for whom threat-related cognitions were already chronically accessible. The effects of pro-civil liberties messages were limited to unthreatened non-authoritarians. Hence, we conclude that in the contemporary information environment selective exposure can increase polarization around a civil liberties controversy by producing attitude change but this occurs mainly among non-authoritarians.

   Happiness has been the most important goal for humans throughout history and is a significant issue among university lecturers facing a rapid digital technology change. It is usually described as a well-being state, feeling satisfied and contented, consisting of positive happenings in an individual's life concerning the social, spiritual, economic, psychological, and physiological spheres. This research examines the relationship between happiness, attitudes toward technology, and lecturers' job performance in higher education. Design and Methodology
   This research design was a cross-sectional design that asked the respondents from lecturers of Institut Teknologi Bandung, one of the best universities with technology-based education in Indonesia, to complete a group of well-validated questionnaires. The questionnaires mentioned earlier include the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire and three other newly constructed questionnaires, made to measure attitude toward digital technology, job satisfaction, and job performance. Findings
   This research confirmed that happiness fully mediated the relationship between attitude toward digital technology and job performance. Additionally, this research also confirmed that happiness partially mediated the relationship between job satisfaction and job performance. These results implied that a positive attitude toward digital technology and higher job satisfaction would lead to happier lecturers who increase their job performance. Originality
   This study suggests that a positive attitude toward technology has a higher impact than job satisfaction as determinant factors of happiness and its association with lecturers' job performance such as universities, especially Institut Teknologi Bandung as a technologically advanced workplace environment. Additionally, the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire framework, frequently used in studies of other countries, is now being used in the context of an Indonesian case study, precisely to measure happiness among lecturers in Indonesian higher education.

AB  - Aims: Several states in the U.S. have legalized cannabis for recreational or medical uses. In this context, cannabis edibles have drawn considerable attention after adverse effects were reported. This paper investigates Twitter users' perceptions concerning edibles and evaluates the association edibles-related tweeting activity and local cannabis legislation.
   Methods: Tweets were collected between May 1 and July 31, 2015, using Twitter API and filtered through the eDrugTrends/Twitris platform. A random sample of geolocated tweets was manually coded to evaluate Twitter users' perceptions regarding edibles. Raw state proportions of Twitter users mentioning edibles were ajusted relative to the total number of Twitter users per state. Differences in adjusted proportions of Twitter users mentioning edibles between states with different cannabis legislation status were assesed via a permutation test.
   Results: We collected 100,182 tweets mentioning cannabis edibles with 26.9% (n = 26,975) containing state-level geolocation. Adjusted percentages of geolocated Twitter users posting about edibles were significantly greater in states that allow recreational and/or medical use of cannabis. The differences were statistically significant. Overall, cannabis edibles were generally positively perceived among Twitter users despite some negative tweets expressing the unreliability of edible consumption linked to variability in effect intensity and duration.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that Twitter data analysis is an important tool for epidemiological monitoring of emerging drug use practices and trends. Results tend to indicate greater tweeting activity about cannabis edibles in states where medical THC and/or recreational use are legal. Although the majority of tweets conveyed positive attitudes about cannabis edibles, analysis of experiences expressed in negative tweets confirms the potential adverse effects of edibles and calls for educating edibles-naive users, improving edibles labeling, and testing their THC content.

TI  - Knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices towards COVID-19 and associated factors among adult hospital visitors in South Gondar Zone Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia
T2  - PLOS ONE

KW  - UNIVERSITY
AB  - Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently the critical health problem of the globe, including Ethiopia. Visitors of healthcare facilities are the high-risk groups due to the presence of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the healthcare setting. Increasing the knowledge, attitude, and practices towards COVID-19 prevention among hospital visitors are very important to prevent transmissions of the pandemic despite the lack of evidence remains a challenge in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the status of knowledge, attitude, and preventive practice towards COVID-19 and associated factors among hospital visitors in South Gondar Zone Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia.
   Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study design was employed during August 1 to 30, 2020 from randomly selected 404 adult hospital visitors in South Gondar Zone Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia. The data was collected using interviewer-administered questionnaire. The outcome of this study was good or poor knowledge, positive or negative attitude and good or poor preventive practice towards COVID-19. Three different binary logistic regression models with 95% CI (Confidence interval) was used for data analysis. For each mode, bivariable analysis (crude odds ratio [COR]) and multivariable analysis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]) was used during data analysis. From the bivariable analysis, variables with a p-value <0.25 were retained into the multivariable logistic regression analysis. From the multivariable logistic regression analysis, variables with a significance level of p-value <0.05 were taken as factors independently associated with knowledge, attitude and preventive practices towards COVID-19.
   Main findings About 69.3% of the respondents had good knowledge, 62.6% had a positive attitude, and 49.3% had good preventive practice towards the prevention of COVID-19. We found that factors significantly associated with good knowledge about COVID-19 were educational status who can read and write (AOR = 2.78; 95%CI: 1.18-6.56) and college and above (AOR = 6.15; 95%CI: 2.18-17.40), and use of social media (AOR = 2.96; 95%CI: 1.46-6.01). Furthermore, factors significantly associated with a positive attitude towards COVID-19 includes the presence of chronic illnesses (AOR = 5.00; 95%CI; 1.71-14.67), training on COVID-19 (AOR = 3.91; 95%CI: 1.96-7.70), and peer/family as a source of information (AOR = 2.45; 95%CI: 1.06-5.63). Being a student (AOR = 7.70; 95%CI: 1.15-15.86) and participants who had a good knowledge on COVID-19 (AOR = 4.49; 95%CI: 2.41-8.39) were factors significantly associated with good practice towards COVID-19.
   Conclusion We found that knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices towards prevention of COVID-19 among adult hospital visitors were low. Therefore, we recommended that different intervention strategies for knowledge, attitude and preventive practices are urgently needed to control the transmission of COVID-19 among adult hospital visitors. Health education of those who could not read and write about COVID-19 knowledge issues and advocating use of social media that transmit messages about COVID-19 are highly encouraged to increase the good knowledge status of adult hospital visitors. Furthermore, providing training about COVID-19 prevention methods and using various sources of information about COVID-19 will help for improving positive attitude towards COVID-19 prevention, whereas for increasing the status of good preventive practices towards COVID-19, improving the good knowledge about COVID-19 of adult hospital visitors are essential.

AB  - The treatment of Australia's Aboriginal people by the nuclear industry (broadly defined as private- and public-sector agencies pursuing uranium and nuclear projects) is a poorly researched topic. That is not merely a gap in the academic research on related topics (the history of the nuclear industry in Australia; the history of race relations in Australia; etc.), but it has real world consequences. Put simply, the paucity of information about the mistreatment of Aboriginal people makes it easier for nuclear interests to repeat past practices; and conversely, proper documentation and publication of past (and current) practices detrimental to Aboriginal people can make it more difficult for nuclear interests to repeat those practices. Over the past decade Friends of the Earth Australia (FoE) has sought to partially remedy the information deficit in the context of its work with Aboriginal communities involved in debates regarding uranium mining and proposed radioactive waste repositories (the author works for FoE). One thread of that work is the growing body of multimedia work (and a Master's thesis) by FoE member Jessie Boylan covering the legacy of the atomic bomb tests, uranium mining and waste repository proposals (see <www.jessieboylan.com>). Another thread of the project is detailed written documentation of past and present incidents of mistreatment of Aboriginal people by nuclear interests (as well as multimedia presentations of this material - see, for example, <www.australianmap.net>). This article builds on that research and focuses on attempts to impose radioactive waste repositories on the land of unwilling Aboriginal communities in South Australia.

AB  - The US prison boom has resulted in the mass incarceration of parents in the United States. We review recent scholarship on the relationship between parental incarceration and child inequality and social exclusion over the life course. We develop a multilevel social exclusion framework to stimulate future research on the effects of paternal and maternal incarceration. This framework is intergenerational in its focus on incarcerated parents and their children, interinstitutional in its attention to state and school regimes, and intersectional in its consideration of the role of gender and race and ethnic contingencies. It is also systemic in its focus on multiple chosen and overlapping institutional policy domains of exclusion. We address both mediators and moderators of the effects of parental incarceration on child outcomes. We emphasize the underresearched importance of meso-level (e.g., school) and macro-level (e.g., state and cross-national) exclusionary and inclusionary regimes in understanding the effects of parental incarceration. We propose hypotheses to synthesize current research on the impact of maternal and paternal incarceration on children.

AB  - In the present study, we examined the associations between self-perceptions of attractiveness, contingencies of self-worth and the attitude toward the use of physical attractiveness as an influence strategy (adonization) among young women. Five hundred and eighty-seven women aged 18-35 years assessed their self-perceptions of attractiveness, contingencies of self-worth, and the attitude toward adonization. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that self-perceptions of physical and social attractiveness predicted a positive attitude toward adonization. External contingencies of self-worth predicted less positive perceptions of attractiveness, while internal contingencies of self-esteem predicted more positive self-perceptions of physical attractiveness. Additionally, external contingencies of self-worth predicted a positive attitude toward adonization. Self-perceptions of physical and social attractiveness mediated between external contingencies of self-esteem and attitude toward adonization.

AB  - Background: Malnutrition is a debilitating and highly prevalent condition in acute hospital settings especially in older person; however international literature revealed negative attitudes in providing nutritional care among nurses and health professionals. Few studies have investigated attitudes towards nutritional care among nursing students, there are no data regarding the Italian context.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore nursing students' attitudes towards nutritional care in older people.
   Design: A multicentre cross-sectional survey incorporating a pre post design.
   Setting and participants: A convenience sample of nursing students of the bachelor's degree in Nursing in the three hospitals were recruited.
   Methods: Nursing students completed "The Staff Attitudes to Nutritional Nursing Care Geriatric Scale (Italian version) (SANN_G(ITA) scale)"; first year students completed the scale before (TO) and after (T1) lectures about nutrition and nutritional care.
   Results: 245 students were enrolled (response rate 88.4%). The overall score of sample attitudes was Median (Me) = 66 (IQR = [60; 72]); at the variation of the year the neutral attitudes are prevalent with a significant tendency to increase the positive attitudes (p < .003) and there is a statistically significant difference (p < .05) in all dimensions except the "habits" dimension "(P = .1126). After two months from the end of the lessons regarding nutritional care there is an increase in subjects with neutral attitudes and a decrease in those with negative attitudes (P = .05).
   Conclusions: This study revealed a progressive improvement of the attitudes during the three-year course, underling the importance of nutritional contents provided; understanding the most critical aspects about nutritional care can be helpful in understanding in which areas university education should be improved, in order to train nurses able to assess and face with each patients' assistance need.

AB  - Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are omnipresent and define the interactions in society. Within society, there are vulnerable groups of people for whom ICT use is more challenging. Disabled people are the most vulnerable ICT users. To identify the digital divides of access and impact of ICT on disabled users, an exploratory qualitative study was conducted. Relying on a French national association for disability that grants unique access to disabled ICT users, two focus groups and 10 in-depth interviews were carried. The study proposes a model of ICT use and its effects for disabled people, integrating several types of disabilities. The results show that ICT appropriation by disabled users depends on their perceived self-efficacy in ICT. ICT use can lead to negative effects, including social exclusion and low perceived normalcy. To address societal interests and develop the literature, a research agenda is proposed.

AB  - Objectives: To examine racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19-like illness (CLI) during March - August 2020 in New York City, and to test effect modification by age, nativity, and working from home vs outside the home, and mediation via social distancing behavior.
   Design: Analysis of the monthly Community Health Survey datasets.
   Setting: New York City.
   Participants: 5,305 adults living in New York City.
   Methods: Prevalence of having CLI was compared among racial and ethnic groups using multivariable log-linear regression. Stratified and causal mediation analyses were conducted to test effect modification and mediation, respectively.
   Main Outcome Measures: A binary indicator of having new onset of CLI in the past 30 days.
   Results: Overall percentage of CLI decreased from 25% during March-May to 14% during June-August. In both periods, there was no increased prevalence of CLI among Black or Latino New Yorkers compared with White New Yorkers. However, in stratified analyses, Latino vs White New Yorkers had 2.05 times (95%CI=1.09, 3.83) higher prevalence of CLI among adults working outside the home. Mediation via social distancing was not statistically significant.
   Conclusions: I xcess burden of CLI among Latino adults working outside the home underscores inequitable impacts of COVID-19 in New York City.

AB  - This study examines nonsmokers' responses to antismoking messages. Informed by construal-level theory (CLT), it investigates whether and how evidence type (narrative vs. non-narrative) and social distance might interact to influence nonsmokers' attitudes toward others' quitting smoking and intentions to persuade others to quit smoking. Results of a controlled experiment (N=281) revealed an approximately significant two-way interaction pertaining to attitudes. Simple effects analyses revealed that narratives produced less-favorable attitudes toward others' quitting smoking than nonnarratives when participants thought about their best friend. Yet, there was no difference in attitudes between narratives and nonnarratives when participants thought about socially distant others. The results also indicated that nonnarratives overpowered narratives to influence participants' attitudes toward others' quitting smoking. Moreover, social distance had a consistent impact on their risk beliefs, such that they perceive fewer health risks of their close friends than an average college student. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.

AB  - Presence of gay men in mainstream media may have a positive impact on viewers' attitude change. However, gay male characters are often stereotypically portrayed as feminine, and no research has yet explored audiences' reactions to counter-stereotypical gay characters. Heterosexual Italian men (N = 158) were exposed to a clip portraying (i) a stereotypical feminine gay male character, (ii) a counter-stereotypical masculine gay male character, or (iii) a nature documentary. Compared to the other conditions, exposure to the counter-stereotypical gay character increased discrimination toward gay men, in the form of anti-gay jokes, the higher the level of participants' prejudice against gay men. Results further demonstrated that this effect was explained by reduced perceived stereotypicality of the character. Findings are in line with the social identity theory prediction that when gay men (outgroup) are perceived as too similar, and potentially threaten the group identity, heterosexual men would attempt to restore ingroup distinctiveness.

AB  - Partisan effects on media consumption have been widely documented, with considerable attention given to partisan influences on selective exposure. Although researchers have debated the degree to which selective exposure drives media consumption in general and partisan consumption of the news in particular, one of the hypothesized mechanisms linked to this phenomenon seems inherently plausible: Exposure to disliked news coverage can generate psychological discomfort. The physiological effects of this hypothesized discomfort were examined by determining how political partisanship influences release of the stress hormone, cortisol, following exposure to news coverage of a presidential election. The study was conducted in the week following the 2008 election. Participants were students at a large, mostly conservative state university who read news coverage about the election victory of Barack Obama or a set of control news stories. Results indicated that conservative political identification was associated with more negative and less positive emotional responses and with a spike in salivary cortisol levels. Contrary to predictions, however, the cortisol spikes appeared to operate independent of self-reported emotional distress. The implications of these results are considered as they relate to selective exposure and the physical health of partisans who follow political news.

KW  - SCHIZOPHRENIA
AB  - Advocates and social marketers have used substantial resources to develop public service announcements (PSAs) as a lead strategy in public education and awareness campaigns meant to eliminate stigma associated with mental illness. Evaluations of PSAs are needed to determine whether this is a good investment. The author notes that very few studies have been reported in the peer-reviewed medical and psychological research literature addressing this question. Reports of government contractors suggest that PSAs have some effect as measured by population penetration, but such data provide no meaningful evidence about the impact of PSAs such as real-world change in prejudicial attitudes and discriminatory behaviors. The author considers reasons for the limited impact of PSAs and proposes that social marketing campaigns could enhance their impact by targeting local groups. (Psychiatric Services 63:79-82,2012)

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals were advised to adhere to social distancing guidelines limiting physical interpersonal contact. Humans have a suite of adaptations to satisfy belonging needs while avoiding diseased conspecifics. Competition between motivational systems may explain adherence and resistance to social distancing guidelines and how technologically mediated interactions further shape these decisions. This study is a preregistered analysis of data in a representative sample collected during the pandemic investigating how individual differences in affiliative and pathogen-avoidant motives predict interest in physical interactions (N = 2409). Germ aversion predicted disinterest in physical interactions and need to belong predicted interest. Additional analyses revealed technology use satisfied belonging motives that unexpectedly heightened interest in physical contact. Exploratory analyses further indicate that internet speed was similarly associated with greater interest in physical interactions. We frame these results through a competing fundamental social motives framework and discuss how to address future pandemics effectively.

AB  - Frontline employees must believe in corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs if they are to achieve their goals. In light of this, the current study explores which organizational capabilities and factors foster employees' positive attitudes toward CSR. Past research shows that organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) positively influences CSR effectiveness. We hypothesize that the organizational capabilities of frugality and polychronicity and the organizational factors of servant leadership and job satisfaction facilitate OCB. To test the proposed model, we collected data from a sample of 246 frontline employees across different industries. We rely on structural equation modeling to test our hypotheses. Findings suggest that firms should develop organizational values and managerial processes oriented to cautiously administer resources, practice corporate frugality, and develop polychronicity as core factors to cultivate OCB. These practices support positive attitudes toward CSR programs among frontline employees. The proposed moderating effects of managers' servant leadership and employees' job satisfaction receive support from the analysis. When managers inspire employees to serve internal and external customers, the positive relationship between OCB and CSR becomes stronger. Furthermore, when frontline employees feel satisfied with their jobs, the relationship between OCB and CSR strengthens. Post-hoc analysis from the proposed model suggests that OCB mediates the relationship between polychronicity and CSR.

AB  - PurposeThis study examines endocrine therapy (ET) non-initiation, non-adherence, and duration by age, race, temporal trend for South Carolina Medicaid-enrolled women diagnosed with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer between 2000 and 2014 (N=3830).MethodsAge, race, relative risk, and median duration of ET use were compared. Temporal trends in ET non-initiation, non-adherence, and duration were observed using linear and logistic regression models, controlling for age and race.ResultsFifty-three percent of women in the sample did not initiate ET, with highest non-initiation rates among African Americans and survivors under age 50. Of those who did initiate ET, 42% were non-adherent with a median ET usage duration of 37months. Twenty-one percent of initiators continued taking ET for 5 years or more. There was no change in the odds of ET non-initiation from 2000 to 2004 (OR 1.02, p=0.67). The odds of ET non-initiation decreased from 2005 to 2009 (OR 0.81, p<0.001) but then increased from 2010 to 2014 (OR 1.08, p=0.002). There was no change in the odds of ET non-adherence from 2000 to 2006 (OR 1.02, p=0.53), but from 2007 to 2012, the odds of ET non-adherence decreased each year (OR 0.93, p=0.02). The average ET usage duration was increasing from 2000 to 2006 (=2.74, p<0.001) but decreasing from 2006 to 2012 (=-1.46, p<0.001).ConclusionsThis study provides a realistic picture of the challenges associated with ET usage among South Carolina Medicaid breast cancer patients. It particularly highlights small improvements over time in ET usage rates, indicating more opportunities for improvement in ET initiation, adherence, and duration among younger women of lower socio-economic status.

AB  - In this paper, we reflect on 'scientific' governmental and media responses to Covid-19 in the UK, illuminating their negative impacts on complex and emergent touch forms/practices and people's related emotions. The scientisation of the pandemic led to the government initially placing the country in lockdown and enforcing social distancing. It thereby regulated and proscribed routine and normative touch practices in order to save lives. However, such strategies were not accompanied by an awareness that increased touch deprivation could be emotionally harmful, that lockdown could exacerbate abusive touch in the privatised familial domestic sphere, and that paid care-giver touch in other contexts, such as care homes for the elderly, could also be potentially lethal. These negative consequences are important for social workers to understand and appropriately respond to, as they disproportionately impact vulnerable and marginalised groups and are heightened for service users, who are frequently members of many disadvantaged groups simultaneously.

AB  - While extensive efforts have been made to harness benefit of computing technologies in education, little attention focuses on how such efforts lead to students' positive attitudes toward science and technology. Building on the technology acceptance model and motivation literature, the current study proposed that hands-on experiences with computing devices allow students to perceive their technology use as being useful and enjoyable, which in turn leads to positive attitudes toward science and technology in general. Data collected from a pedagogical intervention support our predictions regarding the role of utility perception and enjoyment. Furthermore, it is suggested that students' prior attitudes toward science and technology and the type of device used in the intervention influence perceived usefulness and enjoyment of classroom computing. When using education-specific devices, students' prior attitudes were positively associated with postintervention attitudes as well as with utility perception and enjoyment. When using general-purpose devices, however, students' prior attitudes were not related to those outcomes. These results imply that distribution of technologies to schools may improve attitudes toward science and technology, particularly in populations that have been underrepresented in the fields of science and technology thus far.

AB  - Because rats are commensal organisms that depend on human activities for food, shifts in human behavior will have pronounced effects on local rat populations. In the spring of 2020, social distancing measures were implemented globally to curtail the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This presented a unique opportunity to obtain information regarding the immediate effects of shifts in human behavior on rat populations in a variety of countries. In response to increased sightings of rats in the USA that were reported in American media, we analyzed the changes in the number of public service calls in Tokyo, Japan. We found that the number of calls increased after the implementation of social distancing measures, suggesting that rat sightings had also increased in Tokyo. We then surveyed the changes in the business activities of pest management professionals in the USA, Canada, and Tokyo. We found that the activities were increased in 50 to 60% of the respondents from the USA and Canada. In contrast, 60 to 70% of the respondents from Tokyo answered that their activities were not changed. These results implied that, following the implementation of social distancing measures, rat infestations increased in North America, but not in Tokyo. The survey also suggested that roof rats were considered to be the predominant rodent species in Tokyo. This may account for the limited infestations in Tokyo because roof rats are more sedentary than brown rats. Taken together, our findings suggest that social distancing measures differentially affected rat populations in North America and Tokyo.

AB  - Sponsorship of sporting teams and events has become an increasingly popular form of corporate and brand communication. Despite the continued growth of sponsorship spending, the corresponding literature base is highly fragmented and little agreement exists related to the psychological mechanisms underlying response. This paper integrates several prominent sponsorship research streams in promoting a resource-matching perspective of cognitive elaboration and attitude change. This research holds that in the absence of clear functional fit between sponsor and event, identifying a basis for sponsorevent fit is likely to require some degree of cognitive effort. The results indicate stronger social identification with the sponsored event influences the favorability they attribute to sponsor motives and promotes stronger perceptions of fit between the sponsor and the sponsored activity. Further, the results indicate fit perceptions mediate the relationship between attribution and sponsorship response. Consistent with ELM theory, when cognitive resources are insufficient for the complexity of the fit-matching task, social identification may still act as a peripheral cue in driving a positive affective response to sponsorship information.

AB  - Social network sites (SNSs) provide new avenues for self-expression and connectivity, and they have considerable potential to strengthen social capital and psychological well-being. SNSs have consequently become deeply rooted in people's daily lives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, e-learning has become a dominant learning modality to maintain social distancing. Because of the excellent connectivity provided by Internet platforms, SNSs can be leveraged as collaborative learning tools to enhance learning performance. However, conflicts may emerge when extending the socializing function to learning; thus, this topic merits in-depth investigation. One potential reason for the conflicts is the various types of overload caused by the system features, information, communication, and social aspects that users experience, leading to negative emotional responses, such as social network fatigue. Although SNS overloads have been extensively studied, most of these studies were conducted from the perspective of SNSs as platforms for socializing, and the overloads were treated as linear and independent. We apply multi-criteria decision-making tools to bridge the research gaps. Specifically, we recruited 15 active Facebook learning community members as an expert panel under the saturation principle. After extensive pairwise comparisons between the primary constructs and further matrix calculations, our significant research findings include antecedents to social network fatigue and their causal effects, representing a valuable complement to conventional structural equation modeling-approaches. We also discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the study.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to explore knowledge sharing (KS) attitudes and intention of healthcare professionals in India through the use of information and communication technology platforms such as Web 2.0. The research specifically focuses on individual motivators such as the face, reputation and reciprocity, which, to an extent, are influenced by indigenous culture. Design/methodology/approach The study uses a cross-sectional survey design to collect data. A sample of 207 was obtained from professionals working in healthcare in India. The data were analyzed using the partial least square-structural equation modeling. Findings The results confirmed that attitude toward KS leads to the intention to share knowledge. Attitude toward KS using Web 2.0 was found to be positively related to self-efficacy and reciprocity. Furthermore, face and reputation were found to moderate the relationship between attitude and intention to share knowledge while the moderating effect of rewards was found to be insignificant. Research limitations/implications This study was limited to healthcare professionals in India. Knowledge workers in other industries can be considered for further studies. Practical implications This study provides useful insights into KS practices using Web 2.0 among knowledge workers. Particularly it emphasizes the individual motivators, which can be manipulated by Web 2.0 designers to nurture a positive attitude toward KS and to encourage user's participation. Originality/value The study investigates, using an integrated theoretical framework, how certain factors act as a motivator or a barrier for sharing knowledge using Web 2.0. in the specific cultural context of healthcare professionals in India.

AB  - Research supports the effectiveness of a dissonance-based eating disorder prevention program wherein high-risk young women with body dissatisfaction critique the thin ideal, which reduces pursuit of this ideal, and the theory that dissonance induction contributes to these effects. Based on evidence that dissonance produces attitudinal change by altering neural representation of valuation, we tested whether completing the Body Project would reduce response of brain regions implicated in reward valuation to thin models. Young women with body dissatisfaction were randomized to this intervention or an educational control condition, completing assessments and fMRI scans while viewing images of thin versus average-weight female models at pre and post. Whole brain analyses indicated that, compared to controls, Body Project participants showed greater reductions in caudate response to images of thin versus average-weight models, though participants in the two conditions showed pretest differences in responsivity of other brain regions that might have contributed to this effect. Greater pre-post reductions in caudate and putamen response to thin models correlated with greater reductions in body dissatisfaction. The finding that the Body Project reduces caudate response to thin models provides novel preliminary evidence that this intervention reduces valuation of media images thought to contribute to body dissatisfaction and eating disorders, providing support for the intervention theory by documenting that this intervention alters an objective biological outcome.

AB  - The critical role of marketing in driving nonprofit performance has been recognized for decades. However, in practice, there has been a disturbingly weak acknowledgment and/or implementation of marketing practices across nonprofits to date. Marketing is often perceived as an avoidable and costly overhead. The issue is complicated by the fact that nonprofit performance is relatively difficult to measure and may often comprise multiple tangible and intangible outcomes with different (linear and nonlinear) functional forms. Furthermore, nonprofit performance outcomes often depend on behavioral and attitudinal changes of the target segment. The authors address these challenges by presenting a methodology to link marketing efforts to nonprofits' mission-based performance outcome(s). The authors apply their approach with data from a large nonprofit and find empirical support for the notion that marketing can play a pivotal and significant role in improving nonprofits' mission-based performance outcomes. The findings help present a strong case for nonprofit leaders and policy makers to fund and treat marketing as a critical investment to drive nonprofit entities' performance.

This study seeks to bring this resource into the remit of systematic analysis. Data are taken from screen measurements of portrayals of social actors in news programming produced by two national broadcasters, NHK in Japan and the BBC in the UK. Results for these two media outlets are compared and an attempt made to place the results in a meaningful cultural context. Analysis focuses on NHK's images and the less familiar Japanese media system.

AB  - Background: Reports of race-related triathlon fatalities have raised questions regarding athlete safety.
   Objective: To describe death and cardiac arrest among triathlon participants.
   Design: Case series.
   Setting: United States.
   Participants: Participants in U.S. triathlon races from 1985 to 2016.
   Measurements: Data on deaths and cardiac arrests were assembled from such sources as the U.S. National Registry of Sudden Death in Athletes (which uses news media, Internet searches, LexisNexis archival databases, and news clipping services) and USA Triathlon (USAT) records. Incidence of death or cardiac arrest in USAT-sanctioned races from 2006 to 2016 was calculated.
   Results: A total of 135 sudden deaths, resuscitated cardiac arrests, and trauma-related deaths were compiled; mean (+/- SE) age of victims was 46.7 +/- 12.4 years, and 85% were male. Most sudden deaths and cardiac arrests occurred in the swim segment (n = 90); the others occurred during bicycling (n = 7), running (n = 15), and postrace recovery (n = 8). Fifteen traumarelated deaths occurred during the bike segment. Incidence of death or cardiac arrest among USAT participants (n = 4 776 443) was 1.74 per 100 000 (2.40 in men and 0.74 in women per 100 000; P < 0.001). In men, risk increased substantially with age and was much greater for those aged 60 years and older (18.6 per 100 000 participants). Death or cardiac arrest risk was similar for short, intermediate, and long races (1.61 vs. 1.41 vs. 1.92 per 100 000 participants). At autopsy, 27 of 61 decedents (44%) had clinically relevant cardiovascular abnormalities, most frequently atherosclerotic coronary disease or cardiomyopathy.
   Limitations: Case identification may be incomplete and may underestimate events, particularly in the early study period. In addition, prerace medical history is unknown in most cases.
   Conclusion: Deaths and cardiac arrests during the triathlon are not rare; most have occurred in middle-aged and older men. Most sudden deaths in triathletes happened during the swim segment, and clinically silent cardiovascular disease was present in an unexpected proportion of decedents.

AB  - Cultivation research suggests that media use, particularly TV, is associated with a wide range of politically relevant views and attitudes, including perceptions of the world as a mean and dangerous place, authoritarianism, and perceived meritocracy. However, little attempt has been made to understand how these effects relate to one another and to broader models of political psychology. We present a new Cultivation-Political Psychology Interface Model, which uses Duckitt's Dual Process Model (2001) of political psychology as a lens to understand cultivation research. Many seemingly distinct cultivation effects related to political attitudes can thus be reduced to two overall dimensions: dangerous and competitive worldviews. We identify evidence gaps, particularly in terms of competitive-worldview effects and related political attitudes. Our model generates a landscape of attitudes and beliefs, whereby some attitudes are hypothesized to be more upstream than others, leading to testable hypotheses for future research.

AB  - This survey research study presents the findings on determinants of teachers' attitudes towards e-learning in Tanzanian higher learning institutions. The study involved 258 teachers from 4 higher learning institutions obtained through stratified, simple random sampling. Questionnaires and documentary review were used in data collection. Data were analysed using statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS). Chi-square was performed to examine the association of variables.
   It was found that teachers have positive attitudes towards e-learning where computer exposure played a statistically significant contribution to their attitudes. It is recommended that training in e-learning needs to be provided to teachers to widen their understanding of e-learning. There is also a need to strengthen factors associated with teachers' positive attitudes towards e-learning. Results from this study are of particular importance to both teachers and the education stakeholders in Tanzania.

AB  - Financial inclusion can be defined as the access to formal financial services at an affordable cost for all members of an economy, favoring mainly low-income groups. It has been recognized as a critical element in policies for poverty reduction and economic growth. Some successful experiences with financial inclusion reported in developing countries are associated with the use of information and communication technology (ICT)-based branchless banking. One of these experiences is the Brazilian correspondent model, an ICT-based network responsible for delivering financial services to tens of millions of poor Brazilians, most of them having no other way to access banking services. This article presents a case study of financial inclusion in Autazes, a county in the Amazon region not served by banks until 2002, when a correspondent started its operations there. Since then, Autazes has experienced economic and social changes, due in part to government social benefits and other banking services delivered at the local level. The results of our field study in Autazes suggest that financial inclusion through the correspondents' process positively contributes to local socio-economic development but, at the same time, presents clear negative signs such as low-income population over-indebtedness, reproduction of social exclusion practices and reinforcement of power asymmetries. We conclude that although access to financial resources is a fundamental way to promote local development to low-income population, such access should be accompanied by other inclusive mechanisms like financial education in order to be effective.

AB  - Purpose: This study examined mechanisms through which the truth campaign, a national mass media antismoking campaign, influences smoking-related attitudes, and progression of tobacco use over time in youth and young adults.
   Methods: Structural equation modeling tested causal pathways derived from formative research and behavioral theory with a nationally representative longitudinal sample of 15-21-year-olds (n = 8747) over 24 months. Data were collected from 2014 to 2016, and analyses were conducted in 2017.
   Results: Greater ad awareness predicted strengthening of attitudes targeted by the campaign (i.e., feelings of independence from tobacco, antitobacco industry sentiment, decreasing acceptance of social smoking, and decreasing acceptance of smoking imagery), and attitude changes were significantly associated with greater support for an antitobacco social movement (e.g., agreement to the item "I would be part of a movement to end smoking"). Greater social movement support predicted a slower rate of progression on smoking intensity after two years of the campaign.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that engaging youth and young adults in a cause-based social movement for promoting health can be a powerful strategy to drive positive behavior change. Messages targeting attitudes that resonate with values important to this age group, including independence and connectedness, are particularly effective. Investments in national antitobacco public education campaigns are key policy interventions which continue to help prevent tobacco use among youth and young adults.

AB  - Citizens are now central to national security strategies, yet governments readily admit that little is known about public opinion on security. This article presents a unique and timely examination of public perceptions of security threats. By focusing on the breadth of security threats that citizens identify, their psychological origins, how they vary from personal to global levels, and the relationships between perceptions of threats and other political attitudes and behaviours, the article makes several new contributions to the literature. These include extending the levels at which threats are perceived from the national versus personal dichotomy to a continuum spanning the individual, family, community, nation and globe, and showing the extent to which perceptions of threat at each level have different causes, as well as different effects on political attitudes and behaviour. These findings are also relevant to policy communities' understanding of what it means for a public to feel secure.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to describe the demographic, behavioral, and psychosocial characteristics of adolescent and caregiver lay health advisers (LHAs) participating in an intervention designed to reduce risk behaviors among rural African-American adolescents. Teach One, Reach One integrates constructs from the Theory of Planned Behavior and Social Cognitive Theory. It acknowledges that changing the sexual behaviors of African-American adolescents requires changing one's knowledge, attitudes, normative beliefs about the behavior of peers, and self-efficacy regarding adolescent sexual behavior, parent-teen communication about sex, and healthy dating relations among adolescents. Study participants completed baseline questionnaires assessing demographics and psychosocial determinants (knowledge, attitudes, perceived social norms, and self-efficacy) of sexual behaviors. Sixty-two adolescent and caregiver dyads participated. Caregivers included biological parents, legal guardians, or other parental figures. Strengths and areas in need of improvement were determined using median splits. Few adolescents had initiated sex. Their strengths included high levels of open parent-teen communication; positive attitudes and normative beliefs regarding both sex communication and healthy dating relationships; and high knowledge and self-efficacy for healthy dating behaviors. Areas needing improvement included low knowledge, unfavorable attitudes, poor normative beliefs, and low self-efficacy regarding condom use. Caregiver strengths included positive attitudes, normative beliefs, and self-efficacy for sex communication; positive attitudes and self-efficacy for condom use; and low acceptance of couple violence. Areas needing improvement included low levels of actual communication about sex and low knowledge about effective communication strategies and condom use. The current study highlights the value of assessing baseline characteristics of LHAs prior to intervention implementation, as it enables a better understanding of the key characteristics necessary for planning and implementing interventions, as well as engaging in targeted training activities.

AB  - This study aims to test the third-person effect (TPE) in the perception of Internet privacy risks. Support was found for a TPE model suggesting that users report greater perceived Internet privacy risks on others than on themselves, based on a sample (N = 613) from Amazon MTurk. In particular, the differential perception of Internet privacy risks between self and others increased people's willingness to recommend protective measures to others but decreased their willingness to adopt protective measures themselves. Moreover, social distance, perceived Internet privacy knowledge, negative online privacy experiences, and Internet use activities emerged as significant predictors of TPE perceptions about Internet privacy risks. Study findings indicated that third-person perception is one of the major barriers inhibiting the adoption of privacy protection measures. The antecedents of TPE perceptions detected here provide valuable implications about how to enable Internet users to protect their privacy security.

AB  - This article sheds light on how adults in Barcelona (ES), Groningen (NL), and Milan (IT) utilized WhatsApp to compensate for the lack of face-to-face interactions and to fight social isolation during the first 2 months of the COVID- I 9 lockdown. We argue that practices of WhatsApp usage have multiplied and diversified experiences of co-presence at distance and made group socialities even more important than before. Building on the concepts of "scalable socialities" and "polymedia," the article formulates the concept of "scalable co-presence" to account for ways in which WhatsApp has enabled multiple experiences of proximity to others across different scales of sociality, from one-to-one to large groups interactions. In this article, we also argue that the concept of "scalable co-presence" is relevant to bring the study of mediated co-presence out of media and migration studies into the broader field of media and cultural studies. With reduction in mobility, increased social distancing, and ubiquitous connectivity, the role of communication technologies in mediating proximity at distance has become crucial for many more people around the world outside the context of transnational migration. The concept is also relevant to acknowledge the increased importance of mediated group interactions and communications in (post)-pandemic digital societies.

AB  - This paper addresses the question why tourist attitude towards the interactions with residents are more positive in some urban settings than others, by comparing three different urban settings within Hong Kong: the city centre (Central), a suburban shopping/entertainment centre (Sha Tin) and a new urban tourism area (Mong Kok). Two competing hypotheses can explain the variation in tourist attitudes. The first is causation; some settings provide more intensive and better interactions which lead to more positive attitudes. The second is selection; some settings attract different types of tourists with different attitudes. Mediation analysis provides weak support for causation and strong support for selection. Sha Tin attracts more repeat tourists, holidaymakers and shopping tourists, which have more positive attitudes. Managing growth of tourism is more effective if sub-centres are developed as product-market combinations that distract these tourists from the overcrowded city-centre.

AB  - Background and Aims Telemedicine is the delivery of healthcare services from distance using information and communication technology. It helps in overcoming the geographical physical barrier, increasing access to the healthcare services. Telemedicine has been growing in Nepal, with several hospitals and medical organizations providing services since 2006. COVID-19 pandemic ignited significant interests in it, which previously remained unnoticed, realizing its importance for the present and future. The objective of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and attitude toward telemedicine among medical students in Nepal. Methods An observational study among medical students in 19 medical colleges in Nepal was performed from May to June using Google forms. The survey consisted of 27 questions including information on demography and telemedicine exposure, its status in Nepal, interest, and plans for its future utilization. Results Of 146 total surveyed students, 77.4% (n = 113) provided their views regarding telemedicine. Among students with knowledge of telemedicine, only 8.8% (n = 10) had attended some training. Only 6% (n = 4) of those who had previously consulted through telemedicine labeled their experience as poor. Exactly 88.5% (n = 100) were not satisfied with present telemedicine practices and coverage and 43.4% (n = 49) were optimistic about using telemedicine in future. Irrespective of location of medical colleges (Kathmandu Valley or outside) or levels of study (preclinical or clinical), students had similar knowledge and attitude regarding telemedicine. Conclusion The participants have good knowledge regarding the importance of telemedicine but only few of them are educated regarding its usage. Despite limited exposure to telemedicine, participants advocate for expansion and wide use of telemedicine due to economy, technological advancement, and topographic diversities. Internet, sense of reliability, privacy issue, and lack of proper curriculum seem to have raised question on their positive attitude. Formal and structured education may enable optimistic aspirants to integrate telemedicine skills with medical care delivery with ease.

AB  - Mainstream and alternative media often frame key political events in divergent ways. The present research examined how mainstream and alternative media consumption was linked to public support for Bersih, a pro-democracy movement in Malaysia. We conducted a two-wave panel study before and after the Bersih 5 protests demanding electoral reform (N = 422), and another two-wave panel study before and after the 14th General Elections which were historic in unseating the ruling government (N = 386). Against mounting corruption, the two events were important to Malaysia's democratic transition. Across both studies, alternative media consumption was linked to more positive attitudes toward the Bersih movement, especially among people who were strong supporters of the previous ruling government. Mainstream media did not play a consistent role in shaping attitudes toward the movement, nor was there evidence of backlash among government supporters. Thus, alternative media may have legitimized the cause for social change.

AB  - Lockdowns, social distancing, and COVID safe hygiene practices have rendered the usual face-to-face course delivery options all but impossible for many higher education institutions worldwide. A forced transition to online learning has been the only viable option for preventing a wholesale closure of many institutions. The aim of this study is to identify the role of educational technologies in the transition from face-to-face to online teaching and learning activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper identified five challenges to transitioning to online education experienced by higher education institutions: synchronous/asynchronous learning tool integration, access to technology, faculty and student online competence, academic dishonesty, and privacy and confidentiality. From the studies examined in this literature review, strategies for successful online implementation were also noted. These included: providing e-learning training support for faculty and students, fostering online learning communities, and expanding traditional face-to-face course delivery to incorporate more elements of blended learning. A Technology Enhanced Learning Hub that encapsulates the learning process within a modality-neutral learning space is presented as a suggested framework for delivering higher education programs in this challenging environment.

AB  - Using data from a national sample of parent and family educators in the US (n = 697), this comparative study examines professionals' practices and technology-related attitudes, skill and workplace conditions. Overall, professionals report positive attitudes about the value of using technology in practice and view themselves as proficient. They most frequently use technologies like the email and document preparation software, and less frequently social media and even virtual reality. Workplace resources vary significantly, educators are not motivated by employer expectations and most report self-training as more valuable than formal sources. Mean comparisons by family educator type validate differences by context. Parenting educators, occasional family educators (e.g., teachers, counselors) and Family Life Educators vary from those in Higher Education/Administration. Those in Higher Education/Administration have more technology resources, report more positive attitudes, are more confident about their skills, and view formal technology training as useful. Conclusions suggest the need for the field of parent and family education to join other educational professions (e.g., licensed classroom teachers) to embrace technology use as a critical competency and advocate for the necessary resources in the preparation and ongoing service training of professionals.

AB  - Employee contributions are indispensable to the success of corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices; however, surprisingly little research has focused on how positive attitudes toward CSR-oriented management can be facilitated among employees. Applying a relational demography approach and related theories, this study examines employees' emotional identification and behavioral engagement with CSR-oriented mission activities. Data from a Fortune Global 500 company in Japan show the direct effect of position and the asymmetric effects of position dissimilarity. Lower-positioned employees tend to report enhanced positive attitudes toward CSR-oriented mission activities when working with a greater number of higher-positioned colleagues. Furthermore, perceived mission-based support mediates the effect of the interaction between position dissimilarity and position on employees' attitudes toward CSR-oriented activities. On the basis of these findings, it is argued that companies should recognize the importance of managerial members as role models and provide employees with sufficient support to facilitate positive attitudes toward CSR practices.

AB  - Concerns about the diversification of Britain, and its impact on social capital and health are widely debated. The literature has however produced a fuzzy discourse, full of assumptions and claims that are rarely tested. We attempt to disentangle some of these assumptions by providing empirical evidence on the mediating and moderating influence of inter-ethnic conflict and contact, and examine whether they underlie the erosion of health among minorities and white British respondents residing in diverse local areas. Analyses were conducted using multilevel models that relied on geocoded data from a random stratified sample of adults 16-75 years collected in the 2009-2011 Citizenship Survey merged to small area aggregated statistics from the 2011 UK census. The final sample comprised of minorities (n = 13,236) and white British (n = 15,021) residing in England. We find that local area deprivation matters much more for the health of minorities and whites than diversity. Yet, residing in diverse areas can be problematic for whites if it is accompanied by high levels of social distance measured by negative attitudes towards immigrants. Greater contact among minorities and whites, residing in more diverse areas appears to have no significant effect on health. Overall, the findings supported our hypothesis that residing in areas of greater diversity has a differential impact on minorities when compared to whites. In particular, diversity appear to be more beneficial for minorities, especially newly arriving migrants. The effect of contact as measured by social capital is dwarfed in comparison to the effect of deprivation, underlying the importance for policy makers to tackle structural inequalities.

AB  - This article argues that Malthusianism as a series of discursive regimes, developed in the Victorian-era, serves in times of austerity to reproduce an elite understanding of social exclusion in which those in a state of poverty are to blame for their own situation. It highlights that Malthusianism is present in the public discourse, becoming an underlining feature in news coverage of the so-called underclass'. Our findings broadly contradict the normative claim that journalism speaks truth to power', and suggest instead that overall as a political practice, journalism tends to reproduce and reinforce hegemonic discourses of power. The piece is based on critical discourse analysis, which has been applied to a significant sample of news articles published by tabloid newspapers in Britain which focussed on the concept of the underclass'. By looking at the evidence, the authors argue that the underclass' is a concept used by some journalists to cast people living in poverty as undeserving' of public and state support. In so doing, these journalists help create a narrative which supports cuts in welfare provisions and additional punitive measures against some of the most vulnerable members of society.

AB  - Declining political involvement of adolescents in western society has caused widespread concerns about the health of democracy in the future. This study investigates the role of the media in the formation of political attitudes and political mobilization of adolescents. Based on a secondary data analysis of the European Social Survey (N = 5657), the influence of exposure to news and entertainment content on political trust, signing petitions and consumer politics is assessed in a multi-level regression analysis. Additionally, the impact of the political and educational system on political attitude formation and civic engagement of adolescents is investigated. The results show a higher level of engagement in countries with a well-functioning democracy. At the individual level, news media exposure is positively related to engagement in consumer politics, whereas exposure to entertainment is negatively related to mobilization.

AB  - Beginning in the early to mid 1980s, Hip Hop culture appeared on Canadian stages and in homes, even as it was limited in supply on commercial radio and television. Unlike their American counterparts, mainstream Canadian emcees (many of whom were racialized as Black and identified with the city of Toronto) were notably dependent upon personal finances, under-resourced independent record labels, distribution deals, and state and not-for-profit grant monies to subsidize the conceptualization, production, and promotion of their art. Labelled "urban music" in an attempt to spatialize and covertly reference Blackness, Hip Hop in Canada, from the outset, was mapped against, in conflict with, and outside of the national imaginary. While building local scenes, an independent label system, and a cross-Canada college radio, television, and live music infrastructure and audience, Hip Hop artists developed spaces of resistance, circumvented industry-generated obstacles, and defined success on their own terms - all of which suggested that they were not solely at the will of the dominant white music industry. And yet artists simultaneously encountered anti-Black practices that constrained the creation and sustenance of a nationwide Hip Hop infrastructure and denoted an inequitable structuring of support for the arts in Canada. By examining the interface of Blackness, art, and the racial economy of Canada's creative industries, this article will outline instances of Canada's anti-Black racism as well as the challenges Hip Hop artists and industry professionals have faced in the areas of recording and label relations, music sales, broadcasting regulations, and the accolade system. These social relations - many of which are rooted in longer histories of race relations and anti-Blackness in Canada - resulted in industry-wide policies, practices, norms, and ideologies that unfairly disadvantaged Black artists and undermined the realization and marketplace potential of a Hip Hop infrastructure within and beyond Canada.

AB  - During the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, over 1.5 billion students worldwide have been deprived of access to traditional learning. This situation has necessitated the use of social distancing-based educational methods; consequently, a tremendous shift towards e-learning has been observed. This study assesses medical students' social anxiety levels in e-learning environments. The study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, the original Turkish Social Anxiety Scale for E-Learning Environments (SASE) was adapted in English and tested for validity and reliability. This instrument has two subscales: social anxiety in learner-learner interaction and in learner-instructor interaction. In the second stage, we explored the associations of gender, age, and perceived academic performance with medical students' social anxiety levels in e-learning environments. A total of 325 responses were analysed. Consistent with the original version, the adapted scale is a reliable and valid measure of social anxiety in e-learning. Social anxiety in e-learning was related to gender (p = 0.008) and age (p = 0.013). Social anxiety levels were higher in students with lower perceived performance during e-learning compared to students with enhanced performance, but the difference was not significant. The SASE is a useful instrument for evaluating social anxiety in e-learning environments across English educational frameworks. Considering the shift in social interaction environments, efforts are required to reduce medical students' social anxiety levels and enhance learning.

AB  - This study explores the potential of promoting college students' positive psychological development using popular online social networks. Online social networks have dramatically changed the ways college students manage their social relationships. Social network activities, such as checking Facebook posts dominates students' Internet time and has the potential to assist students' positive development. Positive psychology is a scientific study of how ordinary individuals can apply their strength effectively when facing objective difficulties and how this capability can be cultivated with certain approaches. A positive message delivery approach was designed for a group of new college entrants. A series of positive messages was edited by university counselors and delivered by students to their Facebook social groups. Responses from each posted positive messages were collected and analyzed by researchers. The responses indicated that: (1) relationships of individual engagement and social influence in this study can partially explain the observed student behavior; (2) using class-based social groups can promote a positive atmosphere to enhance strong-tie relationships in both the physical and virtual environments, and (3) promoting student's positive attitudes can substantially impact adolescents' future developments, and many positive attitudes can be cultivated by emotional events and social influence.

AB  - This paper presents a FLIR/INS/RA integrated landing guidance method to provide information of aircraft states and carrier dynamics for fixed-wing aircraft landing on the aircraft carrier in low-visibility weather and high sea states. The method utilizes the Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) system, the Inertial Navigation System (INS), and the Radio Altimeter (RA) as sensors, to track infrared cooperated targets on the aircraft carrier. Several algorithms like the Newton iterative algorithm, the Kalman Filter (KF), and the Wavelet Transform (WT) are employed to compute real-time and high-precision estimates of the aircraft states (runway-related position, attitude, and velocity) and the carrier dynamics (pitch, roll, and heave). A simulation experiment is conducted and shows satisfactory results for the aircraft carrier landing guidance.

AB  - This study, using survey data (N = 529), examined perceived immigration "threat," subjective knowledge, support for punitive and assimilative immigration policies, and opinions about media coverage effects. Perceived threat was not related to a third-person effect; however, perceived threat of immigrants was related to support for punitive immigration policies, and a strong "hostile media perception" was confirmed. There was a significant belief among respondents that others would view immigration negatively, if only media were not biased in favor of immigration. Internet use, age, race, and education predicted threat perception; perceived threat, perceived favorableness of coverage, and daily newspaper reading predicted presumed influence of news coverage.

AB  - Cycling-inclusive urban planning is attracting attention worldwide because of the environmental, health, economic, and transport benefits inherent to cycling from the individual and the societal perspectives. The Czech Republic is one of the emerging cycling countries that are trying to promote and support cycling, but cycling mode shares are low because of the poor quality of the scarce infrastructure and the psychological barrier of the perceived lack of safety when cycling in mixed traffic. This study takes a multimodal approach based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour and focuses on the factors underlying the willingness to share the road from the perspective of cyclists and drivers: positive attitudes toward cycling, positive attitudes toward cyclists' behavior, social norms toward cycling and anxiety to share the road. A web-based questionnaire was tailor-designed and administered in the Czech Republic via social networks, web forums, and the Civinet network, and a hybrid bivariate-ordered model tested the behavioral framework. Results show that the willingness to share the road as a cyclist or as a driver relates positively to positive attitudes towards cycling and cyclists' behavior, and negatively to the anxiety of sharing the road. Moreover, mediator effects are observed and a clear relation emerges between the experience on the road as both a cyclist and a driver on the willingness to share the road as a cyclist. Lastly, results show that the factors underlying road sharing intentions are related significantly to gender, travel habits, and perceived personal and infrastructure-related barriers to cycling.

AB  - Ethnic stereotypes are cognitive markers that are formed and modified because of intercultural contact with a new cultural group. There is now much empirical evidence that explicates how stereotypes of ethnic groups can impact individuals' acculturation experiences. However, what is unknown is how previously nonexistent ethnic beliefs are formed as a result of contact with the local culture. One hundred and seventy-four (N = 174) overseas Chinese construction workers were contacted through the Chinese Consulate in Montenegro and agreed to participate in the present study. The online questionnaire asked workers to describe Montenegrin majority members in terms of five characteristics. These traits formed the stereotype markers that were classified as positive, neutral, or negative. Sojourners also answered questions that measured perceived cultural distance, social exclusion, knowledge of Montenegrin culture, feelings of social exclusion, and their sociocultural adaptation. Results show that both positive and negative stereotypes are correlated with less social exclusion and better socio-cultural adaptation. Perceived cultural distance, knowledge of host culture and length of stay was mediated by stereotypes on adaptation outcomes. Interestingly longer sojourn did not lessen the type of stereotype, nor did it reduce cultural distance. Contribution to the stereotype literature and practical understanding of how Chinese sojourners see majority members will be discussed.

AB  - In recent years, activists have increasingly organized to protest large-scale energy projects, and research has found that such activism affects project approval. Despite its increasing relevance, little is known about who participates in energy activism. This paper builds a profile of energy activists by drawing on existing literature to derive and test general expectations on resources, political attitudes, media exposure, trust, risk, climate concern, and local factors. We analyze an original survey from a nationally representative sample of the U.S. public to identify the individual-level determinants of energy activism and compare these factors with a more traditional model of political activism. We find that energy activists are distinct from political activists. Energy activists tend to be younger and more demographically diverse, more concerned about local environmental conditions, and, heterogeneous in their political attitudes. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the results, implications for energy producers, and suggestions for future research.

AB  - Authors suggest that in liberal contexts, groups considered as lacking autonomy, such as people with schizophrenia, can face stigma. Following Social Dominance theory, we hypothesized that perceived autonomy of people with schizophrenia mediates the relation between SDO and stigmatizing attitudes. Participants from the general population (N = 255; 76.5% women, Mage = 25.33, SD = 12.3) responded to our questionnaire assessing one's SDO, perceived autonomy and stigmatizing attitudes towards schizophrenia (i.e., dangerousness and desired social distance). Analysis of direct paths from SDO to perceived autonomy (b = -.45, p < .001) and from the latter to perceived dangerousness (b = -.33, p < .001) and to social distance (b = -.46, p < .001), as well as analysis of indirect paths (b = .15, p < .01) for perceived dangerousness (b = .25, p < .001 for social distance), confirmed our hypotheses, and our model showed a good data fit. Our results provide evidence for the stigmatizing role of the autonomy ideal for people with disabilities and invite further development regarding anti-stigma efforts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2013, the United States Preventive Services Taskforce instituted recommendations for annual lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose chest CT imaging for high-risk individuals. LCS reduces lung cancer mortality, with greater reduction observed in Black participants in clinical trials. Although racial disparities in lung cancer mortality have been well documented, less is known about disparities in LCS participation and adherence to follow-up in clinical practice.
   RESEARCH QUESTIONS: What is the association between race and adherence to LCS follow-up?
   STUDY DESIGN METHODS: A systematic review was conducted through a search of published studies in MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Database from database inception through October 2020. We included studies that examined rates of adherence to LCS follow-up and compared rates by race. Studies were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.
   RESULTS: We screened 18,300 titles and abstracts, and 229 studies were selected for full-text review. Nine studies met inclusion criteria; seven were included in the meta-analysis. Median adherent follow-up rate was 37% (range, 16%-82%). Notable differences among the studies included the proportion of the Black population (range, 4%-47%) and the structure of the LCS programs. The meta-analyses showed lower adherence to LCS follow-up in the Black population (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55-0.80). This disparity persisted across all malignancy risk levels determined by initial screening results.
   INTERPRETATION: Lower adherence to LCS follow-up in Black compared with White patients occurs despite the higher potential lung cancer mortality benefit. Literature specifically addressing race-related barriers to LCS adherence remains limited. To ensure equity in LCS benefits, greater outreach to eligible Black patients should be implemented through increased physician education and use of screening program coordinators to focus on this patient population.

AB  - Although media representations of trans women are becoming increasingly common, many trans women still face discrimination in their daily lives, in part due to prejudices and stereotypes that are perpetuated by media. In two studies, we investigated group differences in baseline transphobia linked to gender, sexual orientation, religiosity, and political ideology; we then measured whether different representations of trans women in media led to attitude change. After providing information about their baseline attitudes, participants were randomly assigned to positive, negative, or control film-viewing conditions, with a problematic condition (i.e., sympathetic portrayal of a trans woman by a cisgender male actor) added in study 2. In each condition, participants viewed two depictions of trans women from film or television shows. After watching the clips, participants' attitudes toward trans individuals were re-assessed. Heterosexuals, Christians, conservatives, and men (study 2 only) showed greater transphobia at pretest than LGB individuals, atheists, liberals, and women, respectively. Attitudes of participants who viewed negative film depictions of trans women became more negative after viewing the clips. We discuss implications of these findings in relation to recent media interest in representing trans women.

AB  - Members of a minority population are expected to evaluate political authorities through a different spectrum than majority members. Still, only a few studies have explored the role of local conditions as determinants for political attitudes among a linguistic minority population. This study focuses on the role of linguistic homogeneity, local economic conditions and community size as determinants for corruption perceptions and political trust at the individual level among members of a linguistic minority population: the Swedish-speaking Finns. Moreover, this study differs empirically between evaluations of the local and national authorities. Combining data from a panel survey collected by Barometern (2019-21) with varying contextual-level factors in a multilevel model, we show that evaluations of local authorities are related to local contextual factors, in particular municipal unemployment rates and median incomes, while national evaluations are largely unrelated to local conditions. In contrast to theoretical expectations for an in-group bias among minority members, however, we find no effect for linguistic homogeneity on corruption perceptions and political trust after controlling for economic conditions. The results make an important contribution to our understanding about the role of local conditions for political attitudes among a well-assimilated minority population.

AB  - The persuasiveness and popularity of narratives in commercial advertising has gained much attention but its application in inculcating responsible behaviour is severely limited. Domestic violence against women is a global issue and there is a dire need for effective bystander intervention campaigns. This two-part study delved into how narratives could be employed to elicit favourable ad attitudes and encourage bystanders to report instances of domestic abuse in their neighbourhood. Study 1 focused on testing the effectiveness of narratives in two culturally diverse countries - India and the United States. In general, findings showed that narratives (vs. non-narratives) were more persuasive in both countries. As the next step, using culture (interdependence vs. independence) and social distance (parents vs. neighbours), Study 2 found narratives with a socially proximal entity (parents) to be more persuasive in India while no differences between countries were observed for the socially distant entity (neighbours). Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.

AB  - Across 12 studies (N= 31,581), we examined how concerns about the rise of automation may be associated with attitudes toward immigrants. Studies 1a to 1g used archival data ranging from 1986 to 2017 across both the United States and Europe to demonstrate a robust association between concerns about automation and more negative attitudes toward immigrants. Studies 2a, 2b, 2c, and 3 employed both correlational and experimental methods to demonstrate that people's concerns about automation are linked to increased support for restrictive immigration policies. These studies show this association to be mediated by perceptions of both realistic and symbolic intergroup threat. Finally, Study 4 experimentally demonstrated that automation may lead to more discriminatory behavior toward immigrants in the context of layoffs. Together, these results suggest that concerns about automation correspond to perceptions of threat and competition with immigrants as well as consequent anti-immigration sentiment.

AB  - This paper intends to analyze the main technological aspects of the smart city as a solution to the problem of social exclusion that has been observed with the implementation of the New Information and Communication Technologies (NICT). To this end, it is questioned: How can the social dimension of sustainability - understood as access to basic Human Rights - be implemented by smart cities, especially to foster the right to democratic participation? Aiming at this, the research treats, as specific objectives, the conceptualization of the smart city and the analysis of new technologies that provide its operation; characterize the new data-driven urbanism and, study the Human Right to social participation. It is concluded that the new forms of social participation, such as e-democracy and e-participation, aim at the reaffirmation of democratic principles discredited by a disengaged citizenship. To this end, it was observed that the smart city is capable of promoting citizen engagement, since NICT provide low cost and the capacity to be defended as a free and egalitarian social sphere above individual interests. Methodology: Bibliographic review technique, dialectical procedure method and qualitative approach.

AB  - Technology adoption is a process that is affected by many variables. To achieve innovative teaching and learning, mClassRecord, an Android-based class record application, was developed and tested. This paper is aimed at predicting the level of adoption of mClassRecord as experienced by the respondents using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology Model. Specifically, this article presents the qualitative analysis of mClassRecord adoption among the respondents in terms of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, attitudes toward using mClassRecord, social influence, facilitating conditions, self-efficacy, anxiety, and behavioral intention to use mClassRecord. The respondents of the study are the 17 teacher educators in higher education institutions in Central Visayas, Philippines. A semi-structured questionnaire was used, which was adapted from the model. Results show that mClassRecord is useful in the classroom. The interaction of teachers with mClassRecord is found to be clear and understandable. The positive comments from the respondents imply that the app is a good idea for teachers. Findings reveal that there is no clear indication that there is a direct influence or support from the school administration. It shows also that the teachers acquire dissimilar skills and even different levels of the same skills. The results indicate that majority of the teachers do not have fear and apprehension in using mClassRecord. Likewise, it implies that there is positive attitude and high degree of intention to use mClassRecord. The study concludes that adoption of mClassRecord is predicted at different stages. There is strong evidence that mClassRecord offers effective and efficient class recording and management. There is promising indication that the teaching tool offers an innovative contribution to teaching.

AB  - Objectives. This study examined the impact of sheltering in place and social distancing among adults aged 60 and older during the 2020 outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States.
   Methods. Using convenience sampling respondents were asked to complete a web-administered survey to explore impact of social distancing on loneliness, stress, and behavioral changes. The analytic sample consisted of 833 responses of persons aged 60 and older.
   Results. A large portion reported being stressed (36%), and/or being lonely (42.5%). Nearly 1/3 stated that their sense of loneliness increased during the time of social distancing. Respondents reported engaging in more solitary activity (and fewer in-person activities), using email and text messages more than usual, and spending more time on computers/tablet than usual. Approximately 2/3 reported using more social media than usual. These differed significantly by younger (age 60-70) and older (71+) respondents. Additionally, changes in physical activity, drinking, recreational drug use and sleeping pattern changes differed by age.
   Conclusions. Social distancing has significant consequences on loneliness and health behaviors among adults in the United States, many of which differ by age group. Results have implications for continued shelter in place practices, but also for any older adult that may be homebound for other reasons.

AB  - Despite the lingering conflict between the government of Vietnam and the Vietnamese diaspora in the United States, issues of remittance and relationship relaxation between the refugees and Vietnamese government happened both in the 1990s. Recent years have seen the attitude-change of the returning diaspora and their shifting strategies of working in Vietnam. This paper describes the first step toward rapprochement between Vietnam and its diaspora in the United States, by analysing the attempts of Vietnam to approach its diaspora in the United States and the reactions of the diasporic community members. On the other hand, it also describes the efforts of Vietnamese Americans to empower Vietnamese people through philanthropic and civic engagement activities. The rapprochement via media and civic engagement reveals a shift from hard, intense ideological conflict to soft tactics in the transnational relation between Vietnam and the Vietnamese diaspora in the United States. This paper concludes that the process to rapprochement is still challenged by the significant differences in political views between the two sides. It suggests that the process of negotiation and conflict resolution be conducted with openness, honesty and acceptance of differences.

AB  - YouTube, the most popular present-day online video platform, is also considered one of today's leading advertising media. There is an ongoing argument that YouTube measures and shares its own ad effectiveness. However, the consumer research results contradict with their measurements. The difficulty of measuring the performance of video ads on YouTube without YouTube's built-in data increases the debate about its effectiveness as an advertising environment and therefore makes it more important to collect data from consumers through empirical research. This study was carried out with YouTube viewers located in Turkey, whose population is among the most online video watching Internet users in the world, to uncover the determining attitudes and the factors affecting them in the effectiveness of bumper ads, which YouTube introduced in 2016 as 6-seconds unskippable ad videos. The acquired data were tested by correlation and regression analysis under a predicted model that could explain the attitudes towards the ad. According to findings; it has been shown that the attitudes towards bumper advertisements are significantly related to the factors such as entertainment, informativeness, credibility, irritation, frequency of exposure and advertising value. However, it was found that the participants did not develop a positive attitude towards these factors, and the bumper advertisements, along with them.

AB  - Despite the unequivocal incidence and burden that mental illnesses place on the world, those with mental illness remain not only neglected but also deeply stigmatized across societies. The stigma that surrounds mental illness serves as a barrier to treatment and recovery, leading to serious negative consequences such as school failure, job loss, and suicide. Whilemany large-scale socialmarketing efforts have found some success in reducing stigma, we contend that the recommended approaches, which utilize the input of people with mental illness and those close to them, are inadequate and that a deeper understanding of those who stigmatize is needed. This research first provides a comprehensive examination of the components that comprise stigmaand then uses these components to segment the general population. The authors then present recommendations based on differences in the endorsement of stigma among these segments to inform policy and advocacy groups in developing more varied and potentially more effective social marketing campaigns.

AB  - Children in foster care are at high risk for poor psychosocial outcomes, including school failure, alcohol and other substance abuse, and criminal behaviors. Promoting healthy development by increasing broad-impact positive skills may help reduce some of the risk factors for longer-term negative outcomes. School readiness has been linked to a number of positive outcomes across childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, and may also boost intermediary positive skills such as self-competence. This paper presents findings from a longitudinal study involving 192 children in foster care who were 5 years old at the start of the study. They participated in a randomized controlled trial of a school readiness program to prepare them for kindergarten. Outcomes were assessed at third grade (9 years old) on variables associated with risk for later involvement in substance use and delinquency. These included positive attitudes towards alcohol use, positive attitudes towards antisocial behaviors, and involvement with deviant peers. Results showed that the intervention decreased positive attitudes towards alcohol use and antisocial behaviors. Further, the mediating role of children's self-competence was tested. The intervention positively influenced children's third-grade self-competence, which in turn, decreased their involvement with deviant peers. Findings suggest that promoting school readiness in children in foster care can have far-reaching, positive effects and that increased self-competence may be a mechanism for reducing risk.

AB  - Background: Ear health and hearing loss (HL) among infants has devastating outcomes. With most HL being deemed preventable, the assessment of one's knowledge and attitude regarding this impairment is important. In Saudi Arabia, the state of the general population's knowledge on infant HL remains unknown. Objectives: To determine and further elucidate the general population's knowledge and attitude with regard to HL in Saudi Arabia. Methods: This is a cross-sectional survey-based study conducted on the general population of Saudi Arabia. A predetermined questionnaire was translated into Arabic. This was distributed among the targeted participants in several provinces of Saudi Arabia (central, northern, eastern, western, and southern) by using an online survey via social media. The data were collected and analyzed via the SPSS program. Results: The knowledge with moderate, poor, and good was determined among 60.9%, 29.6%, and 9.4% of the participants, respectively. The participants with positive and negative attitudes were detected among 92.6% and 7.4% of respondents, respectively. Increasing age was associated with better attitude, while increased knowledge was directly related to higher educational attainment. Those who have a child with HL had nearly twice as poor knowledge as those who do not have a child with HL (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Although most of the respondents possessed a positive attitude toward infant HL, their knowledge about it seems to be lacking. Thus, there is a need to address these knowledge gaps regarding infant HL.

AB  - The use of Facebook in everyday life has become widespread all around the world regardless of countries and cultures. The largest group of Facebook users consists of young people, particularly university students. This study investigated the attitudes of university students toward Facebook, their major reasons for using this social media application in everyday life, and the factors affecting the types of desired relationships with Facebook friends. A survey consisting of 63 items about demographics of participants and their preferences for the use of Facebook was administered to collect data. The sample of the study included 924 undergraduate students from a large public university in North Cyprus. A number of descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were employed to analyze data in relation to the research questions. Results suggested that the students generally had positive attitudes toward Facebook, although there were certain differences in terms of demographics. The primary reason for using Facebook was interpersonal communications with close friends. The most powerful factor affecting the types of relationships in Facebook was perceived quality of communication and/or socialization. Along with the other findings, implications of the results for future research were discussed.

AB  - Background: Information and communication sources in the healthcare sector are replaced with new eHealth technologies. This has led to problems arising from the lack of awareness of the importance of end-user involvement in eHealth development and of the difficulties caused by using traditional summative evaluation methods. The Constructive eHealth evaluation method (CeHEM) provides a solution to these problems by offering an evaluation framework for supporting and facilitating end-user involvement during all phases of eHealth development. The aim of this paper is to support this process by sharing experiences of the eHealth evaluation method used in the introduction of electronic health records (EHR) in the North Denmark Region of Denmark. It is the first time the fully developed method and the experiences on using the CeHEM in all five phases of a full lifecycle framework is presented.
   Methods: A case study evaluation of the EHR development process in the North Denmark Region was conducted from 2004 to 2010. The population consisted of clinicians, IT professionals, administrators, and vendors. The study involved 4 hospitals in the region. Data were collected using questionnaires, observations, interviews, and insight gathered from relevant documents.
   Results: The evaluation showed a need for a) Early involvement of clinicians, b) The best possible representation of clinicians, and c) Workload reduction for those involved. The consequences of not providing this were a lack of ownership of decisions and negative attitudes towards the clinical benefits related to these decisions. Further, the result disclosed that by following the above recommendations, and by providing feedback to the 4 actor groups, the physicians' involvement was improved. As a result they took ownership of decisions and gained a positive attitude to the clinical benefits.
   Conclusions: The CeHEM has proven successful in formative evaluation of EHR development and can point at important issues that need to be taken care of by management. The method provides a framework that takes care of feedback and learning during eHealth development. It can thus support successful eHealth development in a broader context while building on a well-known success factor: end-user involvement in eHealth development.

AB  - Background: A minority of all with alcohol use disorders seek treatment. In Denmark, a media campaign, "RESPEKT," has been broadcast nationwide since 2015. The campaign is unique from an international perspective and aims to increase treatment-seeking. Similar interventions have, up until now, not been scientifically evaluated. Aim: To investigate campaign awareness, understanding, attitudes, and information-seeking pre- and post the campaign period. Also, associations to demographic factors and year of campaign will be investigated. Method: Study design: Repeated cross-sectional study Participants: Adults aged 30-70 years, in total n = 9169. Data: Pre- and post the campaign period between 2017 and 2020, an online questionnaire was administered by a market research company. The questionnaire covered demographic data, campaign awareness, understanding, attitudes, and information-seeking about treatment for alcohol use disorders. In addition, complete-case logistic regression was performed to model dichotomous outcomes, and odds ratios were calculated. Results: Campaign awareness varied between 8 and 40% over the different years. Understanding of the main message was high and received higher endorsements over the study period. A majority expressed positive attitudes toward the campaign and support for the main message regarding free treatment. However, very few self-reported seeking information about AUD treatment. Female sex was associated with higher awareness of the campaign, higher understanding and more positive attitudes toward the campaign. Conclusion: The campaign evoked positive attitudes and had an impact on increasing knowledge and changing attitudes. However, no effect on self-reported information seeking about treatment was found.

AB  - In our media landscape, consumers view a plethora of messages with visual assertions, created through postproduction photo manipulation, which communicate meaning at-a-glance. These visual assertions are processed initially and directly and greatly influence how consumers think, feel, and behave. Yet the impact of visuals, which likely color all processing, is not incorporated in persuasive message processing models. Using dual processing models from multiple disciplines as a theoretical foundation, this study demonstrates through two experiments that the effects of photo manipulation, as visual assertions, in food advertising increased consumers' perceptions of healthfulness, positive attitudes, and purchase intentions. Dual processing models for persuasive messages should be extended to account for the initial, influential visual processing of implied assertions, often manipulated during postproduction.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the satisfaction consequences in repurchase situations.
   Design/methodology/approach - Online travel services are chosen because customers in these types of services had direct contact with firms. A conceptual model of CS-RPI link is developed and used to test proposed hypotheses. A total of 514 respondents are used to test the proposed model.
   Findings - The empirical findings indicate that psychological mediators are useful when repurchase situations are considered. The study provides the roles of positive attitude in the formation of CS-RPI link. Also, three factors: adjusted expectations, trust, and positive attitude, are found to have a significant mediating influence on the link of CS-RPI.
   Research limitations/implications - Future researchers attempting to replicate and extend these findings may wish to collaborate with companies marketing products and services online and track customers' actual behaviors. This would be an excellent way to validate the current model relationships, particularly those involving repurchase intentions and customer satisfaction.
   Practical implications - The results can be used by web site designers to tailor their sites' features and marketing analysts to monitor the changes of click-through rates as a parameter of the CS-RPI. The discovery of significant interrelationships between satisfaction and trust, such as adjusted expectation, positive attitude and repurchase intention, reinforces the importance of the psychological state when repurchasing behavior is considered. For instance, it was observed that the three mediators result in lower levels of the indirect effect, but this is not limited in the whole process of the CS-RPI.
   Originality/value - The conceptual framework is tested in an understudied e-service context that is characterized by consumer-focused competition. This context is noteworthy because no research has investigated determinants between the two parties. Research suggests that companies should understand how to capture determinants on post-satisfaction, since competing businesses are only a mouse-click away in e-commerce settings.

AB  - Infant feeding education forms a key element in undergraduate midwifery education in the UK. Students must be prepared to provide women with support and information to make appropriate health choices for themselves and their infants. However, student midwives may already have developed opinions about infant feeding prior to commencing a midwifery education programme. The education literature suggests that existing attitudes may present a barrier to learning for some students. This particularly applies to learning in relation to sensitive or emotionally laden subjects. A review of the literature was undertaken to identify potential teaching approaches which might help students to overcome barriers to learning. Following this the evidence was utilised at a UK university to develop activities which prepare student midwives for effective learning around infant feeding. Students enrolled in the midwifery education programme were introduced to a number of activities aimed at encouraging them to accommodate unfamiliar ideas or 'alien knowledge'. These included placing students in situations which challenged their ideas, as well as engaging in group discussions and reflective exercises. The impact of these educational interventions was identified through formative and summative assessment, and through evaluation of the teaching strategy at the end of the programme. This demonstrated that, amongst those students with previously negative attitudes towards infant feeding, there was a move towards more positive attitudes and a greater confidence in providing evidence based information to parents.

AB  - Donald Trump frequently attacks foreign countries such as Germany (e.g., via Twitter). Drawing from social identity theory and intergroup threat theory, I theorized that exposure to news about Trump's anti-German utterances indirectly increases anti-Americanism in Germany. First, I theorized that Trump's utterances result in negative attitudes toward Trump and, in turn, increase anti-Americanism (spillover effect). Second, I theorized that Trump's anti-German utterances indirectly affect anti-Americanism via increased European Union (EU) popularity. Furthermore, I assumed that effects would be stronger for individuals low in political interest. A quota-based online experiment (N= 428) revealed that Trump's anti-German utterances increased EU's popularity. This effect was moderated by political interest. EU's popularity was increased for moderately interested individuals and individuals low in political interest. No effects were detected for highly interested individuals. EU popularity, in turn, increased anti-Americanism. Therefore, Trump's anti-German utterances indirectly increased anti-Americanism burdening relations between Germany and the United States. Implications for journalistic news coverage are discussed.

AB  - Informed by the educational conditions shaped by the novel coronavirus pandemic and an increased reliance upon online learning solutions and technologies, this article examines the role of personality traits and online academic self-efficacy in acceptance, actual use and achievement in Moodle on a socially distanced asynchronous university course in Japan. With a sample of 149 students the study adopts SEM path-analysis model testing procedures and shows that agreeableness and conscientious have positive direct effects on online academic self-efficacy in addition to positive indirect effects on the acceptance of Moodle. Moreover agreeableness and conscientious had an indirect effect on course achievement while none of the five-factor model personality traits had an influence on actual Moodle use. An improved respecified model further affirmed the importance of agreeableness and conscientious and their role in online academic self-efficacy, the acceptance and actual use of Moodle and course achievement outcomes. Fourteen percent of the observed variance in course achievement was explainable through the respecified model. The discussion highlights the implications to be drawn from the data in relation to the current educational landscape from the perspective of the educator.

AB  - This study takes a first step toward examining the relationship between organizational characteristics and the perceived attitude toward health promotion in companies from the perspective of chief executive officers (CEOs). Data for the cross-sectional study were collected through telephone interviews with one CEO from randomly selected companies within the German information and communication technology (ICT) sector. Multivariate logistic regression analysis (LRA) was performed, and further LRA was conducted after stratifying on company size. LRA of data from a total of n = 522 interviews found significant associations between the attitude toward health promotion and the company's market position, its number of hierarchical levels, the percentage of permanent positions and the percentage of employees with an academic education. After stratification on company size, the association between the attitude toward health promotion and both market position and the percentage of employees with an academic education was still present in small companies. There were no significant relationships between the attitude toward health promotion and the structural characteristics of medium-sized and large companies. The preliminary results of the study indicate that a perceived attitude toward health promotion in companies can be explained, to a certain degree, by the intraorganizational characteristics analyzed.
   Our key findings highlight that efforts toward establishing a positive attitude toward health promotion should focus on small companies with a lower market position and a greater number of employees with a lower education level.

AB  - Constantly searching for increased efficiency and effectiveness, corporations, as well as small and medium enterprises (SME) look for a way to gain and maintain competitive advantage in the market. The development of intellectual capital, know-what, know-how and know-why and understanding the importance of this knowledge becomes the key to achieving the desired effects. The ability of organizations to educate and train employees while at workplace is utterly valuable. E-learning is one way that enables employees to obtain and renew the knowledge necessary to perform their tasks. This paper focuses on the application of e-learning in organizations. Innovations in information and communication technologies, as well as the current development of e-learning, conditions create new forms of learning, attractive to small and medium-sized organizations for overcoming traditional barriers such as lack of financial resources, lime, expertise and facilities. The paper presents the corporation needs to learn. The purpose of this paper is to explore existing and potential role of e-learning in small and medium organizations as a means of developing skills of employees. The results show that respondents have a positive attitude towards the use of e-learning for personal training and development. However, this kind of training in surveyed corporations was not used. It is also notable that ICT is not used frequently enough, and it is necessary to train, motivate and encourage employees to use it.

AB  - There is lack of studies that describe the experience of studying a health promotion course using an interactive approach and students' perceptions about this method of teaching. The purpose of this study is to describe students' experiences and perceptions about health promotion course using an interactive learning approach. A descriptive qualitative design was used among 16 undergraduate university students at a governmental university. Four main themes emerged from the data analysis including: (1) fruitfulness and satisfying experience of interactive learning, (2) interactive learning versus traditional learning, (3) barriers to interactive learning, and (4) suggestions to enhance interactive learning. Students reflected positive attitudes toward interactive learning. Interactive learning helped students to be engaged in learning process physically and cognitively. Students mentioned several advantages of learning health promotion course using interactive learning, including, enhancing understanding, sharing ideas and opinions, promoting self-esteem and self-confidence, keeping their minds active and attentive, and improving interpersonal communication. Updated and contemporary learning strategies and methods should be introduced for enhancing interactive learning courses.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of applying two types of authentic technology, the immersion-based augmented reality (AR) and animation simulation (AS), on college students' achievement, study approach, and attitude to learning concepts of natural science. The attention-relevance-confidence-satisfaction (ARCS) model was adopted as a learning framework, and a pretest-posttest quasiexperimental design was employed. In total, 122 college freshmen from three classes participated in the 6-week experimental instruction. The Revised Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire and an attitude questionnaire were used during the experiment to obtain learners' perceptions and manner of use of these technologies. The results revealed that (a) both types of technology improved knowledge, but the AR group significantly outperformed the AS group; (b) the study approach of the AR group changed from being balanced to being in favor of deep motivation and surface strategy, whereas that of the AS group changed from being balanced to biased toward deep strategy; (c) the AR group had a more positive attitude toward multimedia features and interaction functions, whereas the AS group exhibited a more positive attitude toward teaching materials, interface design, and practicality.

AB  - Purpose Brand transgressions, characterized by service failure, are a frequent theme for marketing scholars. Their impact on satisfaction, trust and brand loyalty is of high interest. However, in assessing the influence of those events on third-party consumers, the literature is still lacking. The purpose of this paper is to explore how social distance explains the reactions of close and distant third-party consumers toward other consumers during a brand transgression event. Anger is analyzed as a driver of this process.
   Design/methodology/approach Two experiments were conducted. Both studies presented a 3 (social distance: victim vs close third party vs distant third party) by 2 (severity: low vs high) between-subjects design. Respondents were asked to read a transgression scenario in a mobile phone service (study 1) and in a restaurant (study 2) and then completed scales that measured their affective reactions and evaluations of the relationship - satisfaction, trust, and loyalty intention - with the transgressing brand.
   Findings The results showed that transgression severity intensifies the effect of the brand transgression on consumer's anger. Victims and close third parties demonstrated higher levels of anger compared to distant third-party consumers. In the case of severe transgressions, an experience of anger contagion between victims and close third-party consumers was responsible for the negative effect on the relationship evaluation of the transgressing brand compared to distant third-party consumers.
   Originality/value This study extends previous research about how social distance influences consumer-brand relationships and demonstrates the mediating role played by affective anger contagion.

AB  - One of the direct effect of current COVID-19 pandemic' social distancing on an unspecified period of time urges us to compensate our lack of physical connection with our readiness in the online environments, especially social media platforms. Present research investigates to which extent the internet content awareness construct, difficulties in emotional regulation and online duality have an impact on predicting future helping attitudes of bystanders. In order to investigate the eligibility of this prediction model, our team has advanced the Erasmus+ funded project Hate's Journey. In 2019, our research team has designed a multiple specific sections online questionnaire addressing 206 youth from Latvia, Turkey, Spain and Romania. We have used a multiple linear regression analysis. The obtained results validate our hypothesis, confirming that if an individual is characterized by a decreased internet content awareness, a high level of difficulties in emotional regulation and increased online duality, then there is a 37% probability that the youth bystanders will develop a lack of helping attitudes towards the victims when facing a digital hate speech context. Conclusions and implications regarding to the current pandemic social distancing and digital closeness effects over the prosocial behaviour are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine a hierarchical model of consumer innovativeness in the context of 3D fashion products. In particular, this study explored how different traits, such as personal values and innate innovativeness, predict a positive attitude towards 3D fashion products through domain-specific variables such as fashion innovativeness and fashion leadership. Using a convenience sample (n = 250), the data were collected through a self-administrated online survey. The results of this study identified personal values as an antecedent of innate innovativeness and found that fashion leadership played a critical mediating role between innate innovativeness and domain-specific innovativeness, in turn developing a positive attitude towards 3D fashion products which led to intention to use. Although the effect of innate innovativeness on domain-specific innovativeness (i.e., fashion innovativeness) was partially supported and no direct effects of personal values on domain-specific innovativeness was found, findings of this study contribute to existing literature on the Technology Acceptance Model and Consumer Innovativeness by examining additional predictors. The significant mediating role of fashion leadership was valuable as the result supported the key role of innovators as opinion leaders as discussed in the previous literature.

AB  - There has recently been a call for the use of more diverse images by the media to promote body satisfaction. This experimental study evaluated the impact of body diversity images and whether these could act as a buffer against thin-ideal norms. Female participants (n = 106, aged 16-30 years) completed measures of body compassion, body and face satisfaction before and after random allocation to images reflecting one of three interventions: control, body diversity and thin-ideal. Attitudes towards thin-ideal images were also assessed. The results showed significant differences between groups for overall body compassion, the body compassion subtype of body kindness, body satisfaction and face satisfaction with those viewing the body diversity images reporting higher scores after exposure compared to the other two groups. Those in the body diversity group also displayed more negative attitudes towards thin-ideal images compared to controls. No between groups differences were found for body compassion subtypes relating to common humanity, motivated action and body criticism or positive attitudes to the thin-ideal images. In sum, exposure to body diversity images had a positive impact on body kindness and overall body compassion and body satisfaction providing experimental support for the use of diversity images as a buffer against thin-deals.

AB  - In the last two decades, numerous scholars and professionals have argued that people need more assistance than provided by conventional reporting. Hopes have been placed on a new genre, most commonly known as explanatory reporting. This type of reporting provides context by answering "how" and "why" questions, going beyond conventional reporting's focus on "who/what/when/where", novelty and immediacy. Its proponents have argued that explanatory reporting makes it easier for audiences to understand an issue, develop well-informed opinions and attitudes, and arrive at accurate attributions of responsibility. Yet, whether this is truly the case has barely been investigated. This study addresses this gap in knowledge. The 46 qualitative interviews reported here suggest that explanatory reporting fulfils the hopes placed on this new genre. Interviewees viewing an explanatory report (1) understood the issue at hand better than those who watched conventional news instead and (2) reported more nuanced attributions of responsibility. Furthermore, contrary to most studies to date, explanatory reporting (3) elicited an emotional response, discrediting the notion that backgrounders are dull. Potential variations relating to (4) attitude change were inconclusive, perhaps because the topic of the videos used as conversation starters-organ donation-induced social desirability.

AB  - Contemporary mobile technologies offer tablets and smartphones that elicit young children's active participation in various educational apps, dramatically transforming playing, learning, and communication. Even the most knowledgeable users face difficulties in deciding about the value and appropriateness of the so-called educational apps because of many factors that should be considered. Their importance for children's attitudes is affected by the perceived positive and negative aspects, which vary across a multiplicity of criteria. Filling the gap in the relevant literature, a new instrument, named PEAU-p (Perceptions about Educational Apps Use-parents), was developed and validated in the present study designed to measure parents' perception of educational apps for kindergarten pupils. Data (N = 435) were collected via online procedures, and the psychometric properties of PEAU-p were studied via exploratory and confirmatory methods. Principal Components Analysis extracted six factors, namely Usability, Enjoyment, Involvement, Learning, Worries, and Values, which explained 72.42% of the total variance. Subsequently, by implementing Latent Class Analysis based on the above factors, four Clusters (i.e., parents' Profiles) were extracted corresponding to their perceptions and attitudes towards the educational apps used for kindergarten pupils. Those were named as 'mild attitude', 'negative attitude', 'positive attitude', and 'indifferent attitude'. This categorization, besides the statistical support, is fully interpretable, and the profiles were associated with certain covariates, such as age, the number of children, knowledge on new technologies, or distal outcomes, e.g., the frequency of using apps, the general position towards apps or their intention to recommend apps use. The findings are discussed within the current research field, investigating the influential role parents play in young children's media selection and use.

AB  - By differentiating between five specific forms of cybervictimization (denigration, betrayal, social exclusion, cyberstalking, happy slapping), the present study examined the multifaceted structure of cybervictimization and specific relationships o these five forms of cybervictimization with students' self-esteem and social relationships. Moreover, mediating effects of self-esteem were explored. Factor analyses supported the five-factor structure. Self-esteem and social relationships were negatively related to almost all five forms of cybervictimization. However, hierarchical regression analysis showed that only student-student relationships were negatively predictive of social exclusion, while only teacher-student relationships were negatively predictive of denigration, betrayal, and cyberstalking. Further, selfesteem appeared to be a negative predictor and mediator of denigration and social exclusion. Girls experienced more betrayal than boys. Older students reported lower social exclusion but more cyberstalking than younger students.

AB  - The study aims at ascertaining the most appropriate communication media to be used to bringing about improvement in nutritional knowledge, attitudinal change in children for sustainable development. 300 school going children (13-15 years), 300 boys were selected randomly from Vijayawada (Andhra Pradesh) and Chennai (Tamilnadu) further grouped as normal weight, over weight and underweight based on BMI for age percentile. Questionnaire as the tool framed to collect data from respondents. Communication media comprising of power point presentation was used. Pre and post tests were conducted to assess the gain in knowledge. The result reveals that the awareness toward nutrition was positive before presentation and showed more than 10% of improvement in gaining knowledge in nutritional awareness, physical activity and lifestyle, whereas only 2% to 3% progress was observed in the parameters of Food group, Nutrients, Deficiency disorders and healthy habits. Over all boys and girls interest to introduce high-nutrient foods and variety their diet increased significantly. 100% of improvement was shown by boys and girls towards adopting healthy habits. Thus imparting nutrition education improved the knowledge score of all the respondent in all the parameters. Which if continued in future, can have long lasting effect on improvement of nutritional status and healthy lifestyle.

AB  - Phubbing (phone snubbing) has become a commonplace behavior. The more we are phubbed the more likely we are to phub others. The extraordinary attention-grabbing ability of the smartphone would only be an interesting story if not for its impact on social media use and, ultimately, stress and depression. In Study 1 (n = 258, M-age = 20), we develop a parsimonious and valid measure of phubbing. Extant "phubbing" measures all lack important qualities needed to be able to assess phubbing with a brief and valid scale that can be replicated and used in a variety of research settings. In Study 2 (n = 157, M-age = 39), we test and extend the David and Roberts (2017) phubbing model, while further validating our perceived phubbing measure. We use Social Exchange Theory and Kardefelt-Winther's (2014) model of compensatory internet use as theoretical support for our expected findings. Results find that phubbed individuals experience a sense of social exclusion that, paradoxically, is associated with an increased use of social media. This increased use of social media is associated with higher reported levels of anxiety and depression. Future research directions and study limitations are discussed.

Furthermore, this study explored the differences in M-Menu perceptions among clusters by applying the Technology Readiness Index (TRI) to divide restaurant consumers into different clusters. A questionnaire survey was conducted on consumers at low-cost restaurants in Taipei City. The findings showed that the consumers upheld a positive attitude towards M-Menu and were willing to use them. This study also divided consumers into four clusters: 1) technology explorers; 2) technology recipients; 3) technology optimists; 4) technology laggards. The attitude and behavioural intention to use M-Menu differed among these clusters.

TI  - Asynchrony Between Individual and Government Actions Accounts for Disproportionate Impact of COVID-19 on Vulnerable Communities
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
LA  - English
AB  - Introduction: Previously estimated effects of social distancing do not account for changes in individual behavior before the implementation of stay-at-home policies or model this behavior in relation to the burden of disease. This study aims to assess the asynchrony between individual behavior and government stay-at-home orders, quantify the true impact of social distancing using mobility data, and explore the sociodemographic variables linked to variation in social distancing practices.
   Methods: This study was a retrospective investigation that leveraged mobility data to quantify the time to behavioral change in relation to the initial presence of COVID-19 and the implementation of government stay-at-home orders. The impact of social distancing that accounts for both individual behavior and testing data was calculated using generalized mixed models. The role of sociodemographics in accounting for variation in social distancing behavior was modeled using a 10-fold cross-validated elastic net (linear machine learning model). Analysis was conducted in April.July 2020.
   Results: Across all the 1,124 counties included in this analysis, individuals began to socially distance at a median of 5 days (IQR=3-8) after 10 cumulative cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in their state, with state governments taking a median of 15 days (IQR=12-19) to enact stay-at-home orders. Overall, people began social distancing at a median of 12 days (IQR=8-17) before their state enacted stay-at-home orders. Of the 16 studies included in the review, 13 exclusively used government dates as a proxy for social distancing behavior, and none accounted for both testing and mobility. Using government stay-at-home dates as a proxy for social distancing (10.2% decrease in the number of daily cases) accounted for only 55% of the true impact of the intervention when compared with estimates using mobility (18.6% reduction). Using 10-fold cross-validation, 23 of 43 sociodemographic variables were significantly and independently predictive of variation in individual social distancing, with delays corresponding to an increase in a county's proportion of people without a high school diploma and proportion of racial and ethnic minorities.
   Conclusions: This retrospective analysis of mobility patterns found that social distancing behavior occurred well before the onset of government stay-at-home dates. This asynchrony leads to the underestimation of the impact of social distancing. Sociodemographic characteristics associated with delays in social distancing can help explain the disproportionate case burden and mortality among vulnerable communities.

We conducted an online survey with 1369 US adults randomly drawn from the national panel of Qualtrics. The results show that perceived contingency plays a crucial role in predicting the adoption of AI-powered news platforms, showing a significant direct effect and an indirect effect mediated by enhanced user engagement experience and positive attitude. Furthermore, the TAM variables are still important in predicting adoption behavior.

AB  - As part of a multisectoral response to gender-based violence (GBV), Nepal is testing the feasibility of having female community health volunteers (FCHVs) play a formal role in identifying GBV survivors and referring them to specialised services at health facilities. This study followed 116 FHCVs in Mangalsen municipality who attended a one-day orientation on GBV. Over the following year, data were collected from knowledge and attitude assessments of FCHVs, focus group discussions with FCHVs, and members of Mothers' Groups for Health. Most Significant Change stories were collected from FCHVs, in-depth interviews with stakeholders, and service statistics. Results show that the FCHVs' knowledge increased, attitudes changed, and confidence in addressing GBV grew. During the study period, FCHVs identified 1,253 GBV survivors and referred 221 of them to health facilities. In addition to assisting GBV survivors, FCHVs worked to prevent GBV by mediating conflicts and curbing harmful practices such as menstrual isolation. Stakeholders viewed FCHVs as a sustainable resource for identifying and referring GBV survivors to services, while women trusted them and looked to them for help. Results show that, with proper training and safety mechanisms, FCHVs can raise community awareness about GBV, facilitate support for survivors, and potentially help prevent harmful practices.

AB  - This data article describes the attitudes of German and Chinese respondents to some measures taken against the COVID-19 pandemic such as social distancing and face masks wearing, as well as their trust in government actions. The data were collected through six online surveys conducted between March 23 to September 15 2020 from 865 participants in Germany, 135 in China and 169 participants with Chinese roots in Germany. The data were partly used in related research papers in which the theoretical background, analysis of the survey variables and the interpretation of the findings are presented in detail [1,2]. These survey data can be used in future studies of individual perception of the measures taken in the fight against the pandemic. The data cover topics which include, in particular, worries about the pandemic, estimations and expectations concerning the further development of the pandemic, perception of government responses and media coverage, attitudes towards social distancing and other countermeasures, and COVID-19-related conspiracy theories. Differences between Chinese and German respondents on some of these issues can also be studied with this dataset. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: The QUALMAT (Quality of Maternal and Prenatal Care: Bridging the Know-do Gap) project has introduced an electronic clinical decision support system (CDSS) for pre-natal and maternal care services in rural primary health facilities in Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Tanzania.
   Objective: To report an assessment of health providers' computer knowledge, experience, and attitudes prior to the implementation of the QUALMAT electronic CDSS.
   Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted with providers in 24 QUALMAT project sites. Information was collected using structured questionnaires. Chi-squared tests and one-way ANOVA describe the association between computer knowledge, attitudes, and other factors. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted to gain further insights.
   Results: A total of 108 providers responded, 63% were from Tanzania and 37% from Ghana. The mean age was 37.6 years, and 79% were female. Only 40% had ever used computers, and 29% had prior computer training. About 80% were computer illiterate or beginners. Educational level, age, and years of work experience were significantly associated with computer knowledge (p<0.01). Most (95.3%) had positive attitudes towards computers - average score (+/- SD) of 37.2 (+/- 4.9). Females had significantly lower scores than males. Interviews and group discussions showed that although most were lacking computer knowledge and experience, they were optimistic about overcoming challenges associated with the introduction of computers in their workplace.
   Conclusions: Given the low levels of computer knowledge among rural health workers in Africa, it is important to provide adequate training and support to ensure the successful uptake of electronic CDSSs in these settings. The positive attitudes to computers found in this study underscore that also rural care providers are ready to use such technology.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) has been widely applied in medical health areas and the entertainment and tourism industries, in which elderly people are a primary target. However, most studies on VR have focused on how people respond to this new technology and its effects on younger generations. Our study explored the differences in VR experience and acceptance between elderly adults and college students. A mixed method approach including both experiments and in-depth interviews was applied in this study. Our results show that elderly adults reported a higher level of telepresence and stronger emotional responses than young adults in VR viewing regardless of the VR device. The ways in which elderly people processed and evaluated VR content and devices were different from those of young people. Elderly people reported more positive attitudes toward the video they watched than young people, but this did not necessarily lead to more positive attitudes toward the viewing experience.

AB  - The author intends to investigate the role of social distancing laws in the new normal as well as the effectiveness of forced shift to media online learning. This research indicates that student involvement had a moderating influence during the epidemic. This study is based on social learning theory (SLT), which endeavors to emulate the behavior, perceptions, and emotions of other individuals. The data were obtained from various Chinese universities. We gathered data utilizing the stratified sample approach as well as Google Form. A total of 256 students enrolled in a variety of programs at Chinese universities completed a questionnaire for this investigation. The direct, mediating, and moderating effects of the variables were evaluated using partial least square structural equation modeling in this study (PLS-SEM), using the Smart-PLS software 3.0. According to the findings, forced shift to media online learning acts as a mediator between the lack of social interaction, perceived harm, perception of maintaining social distancing, and the law, and the effectiveness of media online learning has a significant effect on the effectiveness of media online learning. In addition, student engagement appears to be a moderator between the forced shift to media online learning and its effectiveness. A future study might concentrate on gaining a deeper understanding of the numerous online engagement-promoting behaviors. Teachers must go above and above to provide themes that enable pupils to connect while learning. Instructors and educational institutions will benefit from the research since it will allow them to define methods for boosting social interaction in online learning and analyze methods for enhancing the efficacy of media in online learning.

TI  - Results of a national mass media campaign in India to warn against the dangers of smokeless tobacco consumption
T2  - TOBACCO CONTROL
LA  - English
AB  - Objective Smokeless tobacco consumption in India is a significant source of morbidity and mortality. In order to educate smokeless tobacco users about the health harms of smokeless tobacco and to denormalise tobacco usage and encourage quitting, a national television and radio mass media campaign targeted at smokeless tobacco users was aired for 6 weeks during November and December 2009.
   Methods The campaign was evaluated with a nationally representative household survey of smokeless tobacco users (n = 2898). The effect of campaign awareness was assessed with logistic regression analysis.
   Results The campaign affected smokeless tobacco users as intended: 63% of smokeless-only users and 72% of dual users (ie, those who consumed both smoking and smokeless forms) recalled the campaign advertisement, primarily through television delivery. The vast majority (over 70%) of those aware of the campaign said that it made them stop and think, was relevant to their lives and provided new information. 75% of smokeless-only users and 77% of dual users said that it made them feel concerned about their habit. Campaign awareness was associated with better knowledge, more negative attitudes towards smokeless tobacco and greater cessation-oriented intentions and behaviours among smokeless tobacco users.
   Conclusions Social marketing campaigns that utilise mass media are feasible and efficacious interventions for tobacco control in India. Implications for future mass media tobacco control programming in India are discussed.

AB  - Objective: Attitude toward aging is an important indicator for measuring the wellbeing of older people, and a vital part of active and healthy aging. We aimed to assess the relationship between volunteer service and attitudes toward aging held by older people and to determine the mediating role of health.
   Method: We analyzed the data of 10,792 Chinese people over age 60 from the 2014 Chinese Longitudinal Aging Social Survey. We used multiple linear regression models and the two-stage least-squares model to explore the correlation between volunteer service and attitudes toward aging. Furthermore, we applied structural equation modeling to test for mediation effects of different aspects of health.
   Results: We found that volunteer service was significantly associated with attitudes toward aging (p = 0.335, p < 0.001), while self-assessed health, physical health, and mental health played a mediating role between volunteer service and attitudes toward aging held by older adults.
   Conclusions: In exploring ways to cope with the challenges brought about by the aging of the population, we found that participating in volunteer services not only improves older people's self-assessed physical, and mental health, but also improves their positive attitudes toward aging. Therefore, under the framework of active and healthy aging, volunteer service and participation in social activities can enhance social vitality and welfare, reduce social burden, and improve quality of life.

AB  - Objectives Radiologists' perception is likely to influence the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical practice. We investigated knowledge and attitude towards AI by radiologists and residents in Europe and beyond. Methods Between April and July 2019, a survey on fear of replacement, knowledge, and attitude towards AI was accessible to radiologists and residents. The survey was distributed through several radiological societies, author networks, and social media. Independent predictors of fear of replacement and a positive attitude towards AI were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results The survey was completed by 1,041 respondents from 54 mostly European countries. Most respondents were male (n = 670, 65%), median age was 38 (24-74) years, n = 142 (35%) residents, and n = 471 (45%) worked in an academic center. Basic AI-specific knowledge was associated with fear (adjusted OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.10-2.21, p = 0.01), while intermediate AI-specific knowledge (adjusted OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.20-0.80, p = 0.01) or advanced AI-specific knowledge (adjusted OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.90, p = 0.03) was inversely associated with fear. A positive attitude towards AI was observed in 48% (n = 501) and was associated with only having heard of AI, intermediate (adjusted OR 11.65, 95% CI 4.25-31.92, p < 0.001), or advanced AI-specific knowledge (adjusted OR 17.65, 95% CI 6.16-50.54, p < 0.001). Conclusions Limited AI-specific knowledge levels among radiology residents and radiologists are associated with fear, while intermediate to advanced AI-specific knowledge levels are associated with a positive attitude towards AI. Additional training may therefore improve clinical adoption.

AB  - Prior to the COVID 19 pandemic, discussions about online learning referred to the use of e-learning platforms and social networks as auxiliary tools in the educational process. Due to the pandemic, universities were forced to adopt an exclusive online teaching process and most universities today use platforms dedicated to online learning such as Moodle platforms. In this context, we were interested in analyzing the attitude of students regarding the way social networks could be integrated into the educational process, and if the positive attitude of students towards social networks and their use for academic purposes, proven in previous studies, remains positive under the conditions generated by the pandemic. In this regard, the present study aimed at identifying the attitude of Romanian students towards the use of Facebook and Instagram as educational tools and the circumstances in which students believe these platforms could be used by them and their teachers. An online survey was conducted on 872 students from public higher education institutions in Romania. Based on the exploratory factor analysis and the parametric test, the empirical results show that students have a slightly positive attitude towards using Facebook in the educational process, but they have a more reticent, less positive attitude towards using Instagram. Thus, the most appropriate contexts in which these platforms could be used are represented by extracurricular activities. A higher preference for the use of Facebook rather than Instagram, was identified among master and PhD students. No major differences were revealed in student subgroups sorted by gender or study domain.

AB  - To understand why bereaved people who are highly distressed significantly underutilize grief counseling and therapy, we surveyed adults (N = 156) to investigate community attitudes toward grief counseling. Overall attitude was positive and women reported a significantly more positive attitude than men; there were no associations between attitude and age, country of birth, previous counseling, or bereavement experience. After controlling for gender, beliefs and affects explained attitudes toward grief counseling; behavioral responses did not. Targeting beliefs about grief counseling may promote positive attitudes so that people most likely to benefit from intervention will be more likely to seek it.

AB  - We tested a cross-race friendship picture book intervention under two conditions that aimed to facilitate the reduction of racial prejudice that children of two age groups ascribe to adults reading the book (communicators) and their own prejudice. White majority children, 113 kindergarteners (M = 5.97 years) and 103 second graders (M = 7.93 years) were randomly assigned to an ingroup (White) or outgroup (Black) communicator and skill training. They were pretested on racial attitudes they ascribed to their photographed communicator and then trained in reconciliation or classification. They heard four cross-race friend stories; then were retested on communicator attitudes, own attitudes and cognitive elaboration. Results indicated only second graders, and those able to reconcile differences in perspectives, predicted on the basis of their photo alone that outgroup communicators would hold positive attitudes toward Blacks. After communicators read the stories and explicitly stated their antibias attitude, reports changed among second graders who now rated both communicators as holding more positive Black attitudes. Second graders also held more positive Black attitudes themselves. Kindergarteners consistently assumed both ingroup and outgroup communicators were pro-White. Children elaborated more about the Black story characters when read to by an outgroup (Black) communicator. In conclusion, cross-race friend storybooks are a promising way to expose children to other racial groups and to antibias attitudes, under certain conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Race-related health disparities have been well documented in the United States. In some settings, Black patients have better outcomes in hospitals that serve high proportions of Black patients. We hypothesized that Black trauma patients would have lower mortality in high Black-serving (H-BS) hospitals.
   METHODS: We identified all adult patients with Black or White race and with an Injury Severity Score of >= 4 from the 2017 National Inpatient Sample. We collected hospital identifier, mechanism, age, sex, comorbidities, urban-rural location, insurance, zip code income quartile, and injury severity calculated from International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes. We used a previously published method to group hospitals by proportion of Black patients served: HB-S (top 5%), medium Black serving (5-25%), and low Black serving (L-BS; bottom 75%). Adjusted logistic regression using an interaction variable between race and hospital service rank (reference: White patients in H-BS) was used to identify factors associated with mortality.
   RESULTS: We analyzed 184,080 trauma patients (median age, 72 years [interquartile range, 55-84 years]; Injury Severity Score, 9 [4-10]), of whom 11.7% were Black. Overall mortality was 4%. Of 2,376 hospitals, 126 (5.3%) were H-BS and 469 (19.7%) were medium Black serving. Furthermore, 29.8% of Black and 3.6% of White patients were treated at H-BS hospitals, while 71.7% of White and 23.6% of Black patients were treated at L-BS hospitals (p < 0.001). Black patients had the lowest mortality at H-BS hospitals (odds ratio [OR], 0.76 [0.64-0.92]) and the highest mortality (OR, 1.43 [1.13-1.80]) at L-BS hospitals. White patients had the lowest mortality at L-BS hospitals (OR, 0.76 [0.64-0.92]).
   CONCLUSION: After adjusting for patient and hospital factors, disparities exist such that Black and White patients have the best outcomes in hospitals that treat those patients most frequently, suggesting potential for racial bias at the institutional level. Further efforts must be made to promote equitable treatment at all hospitals and reduce these disparities. Copyright (C) 2022 American Association for the Surgery of Trauma.

AB  - Smart cities need technologies that can be really applied to raise the quality of life and environment. Among all the possible solutions, Internet of Things (IoT)-based Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have the potentialities to satisfy multiple needs, such as offering real-time plans for emergency management (due to accidental events or inadequate asset maintenance) and managing crowds and their spatiotemporal distribution in highly populated areas (e.g., cities or parks) to face biological risks (e.g., from a virus) by using strategies such as social distancing and movement restrictions. Consequently, the objective of this study is to present an IoT system, based on an IoT-WSN and on algorithms (Neural Network, NN, and Shortest Path Finding) that are able to recognize alarms, available exits, assembly points, safest and shortest paths, and overcrowding from real-time data gathered by sensors and cameras exploiting computer vision. Subsequently, this information is sent to mobile devices using a web platform and the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. The results refer to two different case studies (i.e., emergency and monitoring) and show that the system is able to provide customized strategies and to face different situations, and that this is also applies in the case of a connectivity shutdown.

AB  - In 2020, the World Health Organization has characterized COVID-19, a disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as a pandemic. Although a few vaccines and drugs have been approved to, respectively, prevent or treat the disease, several clinical trials are still ongoing to test new vaccines or drugs to mitigate the burden of the pandemic. Few studies have shown the role of host genetics in disease prognosis and drug response highlighting the importance of diverse participation in COVID-19 clinical trials. The goal of this study is to assess public attitudes in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan toward participating in COVID-19 clinical trials and to identify the factors that may influence their attitude. An online questionnaire was developed and distributed among the target group through social media platforms. The number of responses was 1,576. Three quarters (74.9%) of participants heard about clinical trials before, 57.6% of them had a positive attitude toward participation in COVID-19 clinical trials. The conduct of clinical trials in accordance with the scientific, research, and ethical guidelines was a strong predictor of willingness to participate in clinical trials. Other positive factors also included protection of family from COVID-19 and contributing to the return to normal community life as well as receiving additional healthcare benefit was the fourth significant predictor. On the other hand, the thought that clinical trials can have a negative impact on the health of participants strongly predicted the unwillingness of individuals to participate in such trials. This was followed by having limited information about the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 and the lack of trust in physicians and hospitals. In general, Arab citizens are accepting the concept and have a positive attitude toward COVID-19 clinical trials. Increasing awareness of COVID-19 and clinical trials, enforcing the concept of altruism, and placing clear policies in conducting clinical trials are needed to increase participation in clinical trials among Arabs.

AB  - As a consequence of increasing human-wildlife encounters, the associated potential for human-wildlife conflict rises. The dependency of conservation management actions on the acceptance or even the participation of people requires modern conservation strategies that take the human dimension of wildlife management into account. In the first place, conservationists therefore need to understand how people perceive wildlife. In the present study, we examined how wildlife perception varies with people's socio-demographic backgrounds in terms of age, gender, and education as well as the settlement structure of people's living environment and their general life satisfaction, using the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) as a model species. We used an interview-based survey of 2,646 participants, representative for the German population, for investigating their knowledge about, risk perception of, and attitude toward red foxes. We found a negative correlation between age and the risks perceived regarding foxes. Moreover, men held a more positive attitude and perceived less risk than women. Higher education was also associated with lower risk perception and a more positive attitude. The results further indicated that people who live in rural areas perceived higher risks regarding foxes and showed a less positive attitude than people in urban or suburban areas. Finally, people who perceived higher risks and held a less positive attitude supported lethal population management actions more often. However, we also found that perceived risks decreased with participants' general life satisfaction. Hence, wildlife perception is affected by various factors. Understanding the factors affecting wildlife perception is crucial for environmental communication and for fostering acceptance of conservation measures to improve conservation strategies.

AB  - The research phenomenologically explored the experience of facilitating virtual video groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research questions addressed relational processes in virtual video groups, including emotional presence, interpersonal communication, and intimacy. Specifically, we asked how facilitators can intervene effectively to promote these processes in the virtual space, within the context of social distancing. Semi-structured group interviews were held with 26 female group facilitators from various professional backgrounds during the first wave of COVID-19 in Israel in May 2020. Phenomenological analysis yielded five main themes addressing dialectical tensions that operate simultaneously in the virtual space, both enabling and hindering relational processes in virtual video groups: intimacy and intrusion in the domestic space; sharp transitions from presence to absence; fragmented processing despite abundant information; sterility and clarity in group communication; and the hyper-aware self - being a participant and an observer at the same time. Moving groups into a virtual sphere challenged the traditional role of facilitators, who struggled to create a safe space in an unstable virtual setting where the boundaries between personal and professional lives were reduced. Findings also point to the potential of the domestic space to promote closeness and intimacy and suggest the virtual space requires facilitators to embrace multiplicity as a state of mind when intervening. Facilitators must work with permeable boundaries between inner and outer group spaces, accept discontinuity as a basic property of the virtual, and acknowledge the limitations caused by multiple stimuli.

AB  - In the past few years the Western world has witnessed a rise in the popularity of right-wing political discourse promoting nationalistic and exclusionary world views. While in many countries such rhetoric has surfaced in mainstream politics only recently, in Israel, right-wing ideology has been popular for almost two decades. Explanations for this phenomenon focus on Israeli citizens' attitudinal change in the face of exposure to terrorism but largely do not account for why such ideas remain popular over the long term, even after violence subsides. In this study I examine whether the long-lasting prominence of right-wing nationalistic politics in Israel is linked to the perpetuation of right-wing ideology in popular media. Analyzing the content of more than 70,000 published books, I find that content related to the political right has increased in Israeli books after periods of terrorism, a change that has become more pronounced over the years.

AB  - This paper introduces a new perspective into the literature on judicial legitimacy by examining the incentives for courts to cater to a popular majority and offering a novel model of legitimacy that has consequences for judicial responsiveness. The account integrates into the literature classic research on how strategic social groups shape public opinion. I theorize that citizens use their perceptions of the judiciary's support for various social groups as a means to assess the institution overall. From this insight, I derive specific expectations about the conditions under which the Supreme Court's protection of minority groups like gays and immigrants can damage its legitimacy. Using national survey data, I demonstrate that dislike for the beneficiaries of recent Court rulings systematically diminishes the institution's legitimacy. The influence of these group-based considerations shapes individual-level attitude change and can be observed at various points in time.

AB  - In recent years, the price of small agricultural products has both plummeted and skyrocketed, which has a great impact on people's lives. Studying the factors affecting the price fluctuation of small agricultural products is of great significance for stabilizing their price. With the development and application of social media, farmers and consumers are more greatly influenced by online public opinion, resulting in irrational planting behavior or purchasing behavior, which has a complex impact on the price of small agricultural products. Taking garlic as an example, we crawled through network public opinions about garlic price from January 2015 to December 2020 using web crawler technology. Then, the network public opinions were quantified using a natural language processing and time-varying parameter vector autoregression (NLP-TVP-VAR) model to empirically analyze their dynamic influence on garlic price fluctuation. It was found that both public attitude and public attention have a short-term influence on garlic price fluctuation, and the influences of each differ according to direction, intensity and timing. The influence of public attitude on garlic price fluctuation is positive, while the influence of public attention on garlic price fluctuation is largely negative. The influence intensity of public attitude is stronger than of public attention on garlic price fluctuation. The influence of public attitude on garlic price fluctuation shows a trend of intensifying, while that of public attention has been weaker than in previous years. In addition, based on the results of our study, we present some recommendations for improving the comprehensive information platform and price fluctuation early warning system for the whole industry chain of small agricultural products.

AB  - Due to the increase of the retirement age and better healthcare systems, it has become common for employees to work with young and old coworkers. However, age differences can cause misunderstandings, conflicts, and discrimination in the workplace. To improve the management of age differences, it is essential to investigate age dissimilarity (i.e., an employee's age difference relative to her or his coworkers) and its effects on employees' well-being. Past age dissimilarity research mostly predicted dysfunctional age dissimilarity effects on employee outcomes, but it often could not confirm its predictions. Prior research also neglected to investigate age dissimilarity effects on employees' well-being. To address these research gaps and to improve the management of age differences in the workplace, we draw on social identity theory and investigate the mediating role of social exclusion for the relationship between age dissimilarity (relative to coworkers) and employees' emotional exhaustion. We further expect that cognitive dissimilarity (relative to coworkers) plays a moderating role to determine the direction of age dissimilarity effects. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a three-phase survey study with 462 employees. The results show that social exclusion only mediates the indirect relationship between age dissimilarity and emotional exhaustion when an employee perceives cognitive dissimilarity relative to coworkers.

AB  - This study examines the social and professional distance characterizing the source-reporter relationship and provides an opportunity to develop a theoretical and methodological model integrating coorientation measures with third-person perceptions. A web survey of 206 public relations practitioners and journalists in South Korea showed both false dissensus and social distance among each professional group as enacted through the source-reporter relationship. Public relations professionals and journalists disagreed with each other and inaccurately predicted responses of the other. Their inaccurate projection of the views of the other profession was greater than their disagreement on two dimensions of conflict and strategy. This study illuminates dimensions of the third-person perception of public relations professionals and journalists, insofar as both journalists and public relations professionals suggested social distance from the other profession similar to the distance they perceived from the general public.

AB  - Social media interactions in the form of likes and comments have become a prevalent and expected form of feedback among consumers. However, as these forms of feedback represent social acceptance, content that fails to garner sufficient community reactions may have important implications for consumer behavior, a conjecture supported by an evolutionary psychology account. Three studies demonstrate that consumers use social media cues such as the number of likes that a post receives to shape their attitudes and intentions regarding the subject of that post, and this relationship is mediated by perceptions of social exclusion. Further, the presence of comments can help to attenuate the negative impact of too few likes on perceptions of social exclusion, enhancing consumers' attitudes and intentions toward the subject of the post.

AB  - Recently, the concept of e-learning has spread widely in many universities around the world under the current circumstances (the Corona pandemic), which made e-learning in many countries' compulsory for all its students in universities in order not to stop the educational process. In light of the great improvement that some countries are witnessing in information and communications technology (ICT) sector and e-learning platforms, it has become very important to pay attention to the electronic assessment (e-assessment) side, which appeared side by side with e-learning systems. This kind of assessment is overcome some of the limitations in the paper-based assessment. One of the advantages of an electronic assessment (e-assessment) is the ability to provide feedback to the student immediately. Most of the universities around the world were providing e-learning to their students as a development option for the education process, on condition that they attend to take the exam in the universities in attendance. But in the Corona crisis, this thing was not possible, especially in subjects that have very large number of students, so (e-assessment) has become a basic option for most universities in order to achieve the principle of social distancing. Therefore, this paper examines the factors that affect academic acceptance of (e-assessment) system.

AB  - This study expands the consequences of agenda-setting theory beyond political attitudes, arguing its significance as a mediator between media use and political participation. The results suggest that citizens learn from the media about the efficacy and integrity of political institutions, and their performance on key issues. Consequently, the information acquired through news media becomes an important factor for trust formation and participation in different forms of political actions, which are not limited to electoral activities. The implications of these results for democracy building are discussed.

AB  - In Germany, the Internet is gaining increasing importance for laypeople as a source of health information, including information about vaccination. While previous research has focused on the characteristics of online information about vaccination, this study investigated the influence of relevant user-specific cognitive factors on users' search behavior for online information about vaccination. Additionally, it examined how searching online for information about vaccination influences users' attitudes toward vaccination. We conducted an experimental study with 56 undergraduate students from a German university that consisted of a survey and eye-tracking while browsing the Internet, followed by a content analysis of the eye-tracking data. The results show that the users exposed themselves to balanced and diverse online information about vaccination. However, none of the examined cognitive factors (attitude toward vaccination, attitude salience, prior knowledge about vaccination, need for cognition, and cognitive involvement) influenced the amount of time users spent searching the Internet for information about vaccination. Our study was not able to document any effects of attitude-consistent selective exposure to online information about vaccination. In addition, we found no effect on attitude change after having searched the Internet for vaccine-related information. Thus, users' search behavior regarding vaccination seems to be relatively stable.

KW  - IMPACT
AB  - A politics of resentment has shaped a low-dialogue political environment in the United States, feeding into populism, and characterized by perceived distributive injustice, detachment between politicians and "the people", and political polarization. In this political environment, independent of editorial lines, news can spread based on populist content features and drive the political divide even further. However, we still do not understand well, how the forces of political disconnect as well as potentially unifying elements such as political knowledge and the willingness to connect with the other (political) side predict audience interest in populist news featuring people-centrism, anti-elitism, restoring popular sovereignty, and the exclusion of others. To better understand what drives (dis-)interest in populist news features, we combined self-report data from a non-student US sample (N = 440) on political attitudes with unobtrusively measured data on their selective exposure to populist news. We analyzed the data using zero-inflated negative binomial regression models, in which we simultaneously modeled selective exposure to and avoidance of populist news. The findings indicate that especially the will to connect with others explained exposure to news about anti-elitism, especially among Democrats, while Republicans' news avoidance seems to be specifically geared toward people-centrism. Populist communication features promoting "us" vs. "them" dichotomies seem to not automatically resonate with the views of resentful voters and their motivated reasoning.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic has forced Ukraine, like other countries, to move to distance education. The study aims to analyze the distance learning experience of Ukrainian philology students, to find out the pros and cons of distance education, those things that motivate students, and the challenges they face while studying online. The survey consisted of a questionnaire and embraced 105 respondents. The survey goal was to collect data that would allow concluding about the effectiveness of distance education for Ukrainian philology students at the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine, particularly for the study of foreign languages. The significant results of the survey include: obtaining reliable data on the effectiveness of distance learning of Ukrainian philology students through their feedback in questionnaires, online testing, a variety of writing assignments, and assessment in the online classroom, finding out the most effective distance learning tools, the main features of teacher - students interactions in a distance-learning environment. The research proves that Ukrainian philology students overall positively evaluate their distance learning experience. It does not negatively impact students' foreign language learning motivation. Despite a positive attitude to distance learning, Ukrainian philology students face particular challenges connected with access to devices, lack of information and communications technology skills, Internet connection, and lack of communication with their peers. The finding reveals, whatever are the benefits of distance education, it cannot entirely replace face-to-face learning.

AB  - Objective: To assess the knowledge and attitude toward coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) among healthcare workers at District 2 Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed between January 2020 and February 2020 at District 2 Hospital. A systematic random sampling strategy was carried out and the data was collected through a self-administered questionnaire of the knowledge and attitude of healthcare workers regarding COVID-19. Descriptive analysis was reported to describe the demographic, mean knowledge and attitude score of healthcare workers. Inferential statistics including t-test, ANOVA and Spearman's correlation were used to evaluate the relationship between study variables. Results: A total of 327 eligible healthcare workers had a mean score of knowledge and attitude of 8.17 +/- 1.3 (range 4-10) and 1.86 +/- 0.43 (range 1-5), respectively. They showed good knowledge and a positive attitude. However, approximately two thirds of the participants knew the mode of transmission, the isolation period and treatment (67.0%, 65.8%, and 58.4%, respectively), and 82.3% and 79.8%, respectively, held positive attitude regarding the risk of personal and family members getting illness. There was a negative correlation between knowledge scores and attitude scores (r=-0.21, P<0.001). Additionally, healthcare workerspredominately used social media to inform themselves about COVID-19 (91.1%). Conclusions: The majority of healthcare workers had good knowledge and positive attitude toward COVID-19. However, the level of some knowledge and attitude lower than that expected for their position level towards the virus. Additional education interventions and campaigns are required for healthcare workers.

AB  - Background: Monitoring and surveillance are a fundamental part of the workplace environment, with employee performance and productivity as the main objects of scrutiny. However, many questions surround the ethical nature of managements' ability to employ advanced digital technologies to monitor employee behaviour and performance while in the workplace. If unaddressed, these concerns have the potential to significantly impact the relationship between the employee and the employer, impacting trust in management resulting in negative attitudes and counterproductive behaviours. Objectives: The goal of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of workplace surveillance whilst outlining some of the emerging issues relating to the use of employee monitoring technologies in the workplace. Methods/Approach: A detailed review of the literature was conducted in order to identify the major issues relating to workplace surveillance. In addition, a number of practitioner-based studies were examined to extract and identify emerging trends and concerns at an industry level. Results: Workplace surveillance is on the rise; however, empirical studies are in short supply. Conclusions: The issue of workplace surveillance is an under-researched area, which requires much attention. There is a distinct need for clear measures and structures that govern the effective and fair use of communication technologies in the workplace.

AB  - Mental health parity legislation can improve mental health outcomes. U.S. state legislators determine whether state parity laws are adopted, making it critical to assess factors affecting policy support. This study examines the prevalence and demographic correlates of legislators' support for state parity laws for four mental illnesses- major depression disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, and anorexia/bulimia. Using a 2017 cross-sectional survey of 475 U.S. legislators, we conducted bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression. Support for parity was highest for schizophrenia (57%), PTSD (55%), and major depression (53%) and lowest for anorexia/bulimia (40%). Support for parity was generally higher among females, more liberal legislators, legislators in the Northeast region of the country, and those who had previously sought treatment for mental illness. These findings highlight the importance of better disseminating evidence about anorexia/bulimia and can inform dissemination efforts about mental health parity laws to state legislators.

AB  - We consider how social and psychological connections among CEOs explain the propensity for corporate leaders to distance themselves socially from journalists who engage in negative reporting about firm leadership at other companies, and we examine the consequences for the valence of journalists' subsequent coverage. Our theoretical framework suggests that journalists who have engaged in negative coverage of a firm's leadership and strategy are especially likely to experience distancing from other leaders who (a) have friendship ties to the firm's CEO, (b) are demographically similar to the CEO on salient dimensions, or (c) are socially identified with the CEO as a fellow member of the corporate elite. Our theory and findings ultimately suggest that, due to the multiple sources of social identification between CEOs, journalists who engage in negative coverage of firm leadership tend to experience social distancing from multiple CEOs, and that such distancing has a powerful influence on the valence of journalists' subsequent reporting about firm leadership and strategy across all the firms they cover. We also extend our theoretical framework to suggest how the effect of social distancing on the valence of journalists' coverage is moderated by the early and late stages of the journalists' career.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that individuals with a history of childhood emotional neglect show impaired empathy. However, accurately identifying emotions in others is an essential aspect of empathic functioning. The current study aimed to investigate the influence of childhood emotional neglect on empathic accuracy. A total of 92 participants were recruited from a local university. Forty-six participants were randomly assigned to the social exclusion context (SE), and the other 46 were assigned to the social inclusion context (SI). The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was used to measure childhood emotional neglect. Participants observed real interpersonal communications in which their in-group members were either socially included or excluded and evaluated the extent of the emotion they felt for their in-group members. Results found participants empathized with a high level of positive emotion in the SI context (t = 8.13, p < .001) and negative emotion in the SE context (t = 10.76, p < .001) in general. Moreover, childhood emotional neglect decreased the empathic accuracy in both contexts (SI context: beta = -0.42, SE = 0.04, p = .004; SE context: beta = -0.38, SE = 0.04, p = .009). These results contribute to the current understanding of social functioning of childhood emotional neglect in specific contexts.

AB  - Objective: To investigate attitudes towards schizophrenia and people with schizophrenia presented in YouTube videos.
   Methods: We searched YouTube using the search terms "schizophrenia" and "psychosis" in Finnish and Greek language on April 3rd, 2013. The first 20 videos from each search (N = 80) were retrieved. Deductive content analysis was first applied for coding and data interpretation and it was followed by descriptive statistical analysis.
   Results: A total of 52 videos were analyzed (65%). The majority of the videos were in the "Music" category (50%, n = 26). Most of the videos (83%, n = 43) tended to present schizophrenia in a negative way, while less than a fifth (17%, n = 9) presented schizophrenia in a positive or neutral way. Specifically, the most common negative attitude towards schizophrenia was dangerousness (29%, n = 15), while the most often identified positive attitude was objective, medically appropriate beliefs (21%, n = 11). All attitudes identified were similarly present in the Finnish and Greek videos, without any statistically significant difference.
   Conclusions: Negative presentations of schizophrenia are most likely to be accessed when searching YouTube for schizophrenia in Finnish and Greek language. More research is needed to investigate to what extent, if any, YouTube viewers' attitudes are affected by the videos they watch.

AB  - Sharks are often depicted in the media as violent killers that actively seek out opportunities to harm humans. This framing may impact human tolerance and support of shark conservation, underscoring the need to identify strategies that counteract these negative representations. Social media, given its widespread use, could be an effective platform for shaping public tolerance for sharks and other wildlife species. In this experimental study, we conducted an online pre-post survey in Spring 2020 to determine how viewing shark-related YouTube videos impacted tolerance for sharks among residents (n = 335) in the coastal state of North Carolina (NC), USA and neighboring states. The study employed framing theory, which suggests that the ways in which information is presented influence how it is processed and the actions that result from it. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two video treatments where sharks were framed positively or negatively. Each video treatment impacted tolerance for sharks in the direction of their framing: positive framing influenced positive changes in tolerance (70% more positive attitudes toward sharks, a 130% increase in acceptance of sharks and a 46% increase in intended shark conservation behaviors), and negative framing influenced negative changes (25% more negative attitudes toward sharks, a 18% decrease in acceptance of sharks and a 3% decrease in intended shark conservation behaviors). These findings suggest positive messages about sharks on social media promote tolerance of sharks and can be more impactful than negative messages. At least one form of social media, YouTube, appears to be a valuable tool for encouraging tolerance for sharks.

AB  - Following the global economic and financial crisis of 2009-2012, the issue of poverty has returned to the attention of public policy makers at international, European and national level. To combat the effects of the economic crisis, the European Union has launched the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable, inclusive growth. One of the objectives of this strategy was to reduce by 20 million the number of people threatened by poverty or social exclusion. Many EU member states have made significant progress in combating the poverty and social exclusion reflected in official statistics, while other countries have stagnated even though the macroeconomic situation has improved until the onset of the pandemic crisis. This study proposes the analysis of poverty at EU-28 level, using a set of relevant socio-economic indicators (relative poverty rate, income inequality index, relative median deficit, GINI coefficient, AROPE indicator, in-work poverty rate) provided by Eurostat and national institutes of statistics. Descriptive, geospatial (grouping analysis) and multivariate (Principal Components Analyses) statistical analyses were applied to highlight the typologies of poverty within the EU. The study also looks at whether the income inequality index and the GINI coefficient influence the relative poverty rate in EU member states. The typology of poverty at EU-28 level will be represented by visualization techniques (graphs and maps) to highlight the characteristics of countries that have made progress versus regress in combating poverty. This study is also important from the perspective of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which proposes the fight against poverty as its first objective, the EU asserting itself since the adoption of this document as a global leader in implementing the sustainable development goals.

Design/methodology/approach Using the data collected from two US 4-year public universities, this study employed structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the impacts of the key variables, direct-negative and indirect-negative contact experience, on the students' attitudes toward the police. This study also tests whether indirect negative contact with the police is a stronger factor than direct negative contacts among racial/ethnic minority people. Findings Results show that both direct-negative and indirect-negative contacts are stronger predictors of the dependent variable. In particular, the indirect-negative contact has significant direct and indirect effects through social distance on the dependent variable in racial minorities. The study also shows that indirect contact more strongly affects racial minorities than direct-negative contact experiences do. Originality/value This study is the first sophisticatedly to examine students' negative contact experiences into two variables: direct-negative and indirect-negative contacts with the police.

AB  - Objective To understand if attitudes to aging mediate the reciprocal effects of health anxiety and physical functioning among older adults with medical conditions. We examined: (1) if these effects are reciprocal; (2) if attitudes to aging (psychological loss, psychological growth, physical change) play a mediating role in these effects. Design A sample of 226 community-dwelling older adults (T1 age range = 65-94, mean age = 73.59, SD = 6.29) reporting at least one chronic medical condition completed two phone interviews across six months. Main outcome measures Background measures, health anxiety, physical functioning, and attitudes to aging at T1 and T2. Results T2 attitudes to aging served as a mediator controlling for T1 attitudes. There was a direct effect of worse physical functioning at T1 on increased health anxieties at T2. Negative (but not positive) attitudes to aging mediated that effect. The reversed temporal sequencing (T1 health anxiety leading to T2 physical functioning) was significant only when mediated by negative attitudes to aging. Conclusions Findings suggest that viewing aging as mostly a time of losses (but not as a time of gains) serves as an important mechanism through which health anxieties and physical functioning affect each other among older adults having chronic medical conditions.

AB  - Several cross-sectional studies have examined factors associated with support for tobacco control policies. The current study utilized a longitudinal design to test smoking status and attitude toward smoking measured in adolescence as prospective predictors of support for tobacco control policies measured in adulthood.
   Participants (N = 4,834) were from a longitudinal study of a Midwestern community-based sample. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses tested adolescent smoking status and attitude toward smoking as prospective predictors (after controlling for sociodemographic factors, adult smoking status, and adult attitude toward smoking) of support for regulation of smoking in public places, discussion of the dangers of smoking in public schools, prohibiting smoking in bars, eliminating smoking on television and in movies, prohibiting smoking in restaurants, and increasing taxes on cigarettes.
   Participants who smoked during adolescence demonstrated more support for discussion of the dangers of smoking in public schools and less support for increasing taxes on cigarettes but only among those who smoked as adults. Those with more positive attitudes toward smoking during adolescence demonstrated less support as adults for prohibiting smoking in bars and eliminating smoking on television and in movies. Moreover, a significant interaction indicated that those with more positive attitudes toward smoking as adolescents demonstrated less support as adults for prohibiting smoking in restaurants, but only if they became parents as adults.
   This study's findings suggest that interventions designed to deter adolescent smoking may have future benefits in increasing support for tobacco control policies.

AB  - Given the relevance of AIDS as a public health problem in the Italian context and of the role of mass media in the social construction of the phenomenon, the aim of the present study is twofold: (1) to explore the main AIDS-related themes in the Italian popular press; (2) to analyse the temporal trends of AIDS representations over the last decades. For the research, we decided to consult Italian newspaper articles produced between 1985 and 1990 and between 2005 and 2010 using the archives of the main two national newspapers (La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera), resulting in an overall sample of 446 newspaper articles. A computer-aided content analysis allowed the detection of five different thematic domains (clusters), respectively focused on: Medical care (7.47%), Family support (37.03%), Science and religion debate (27%), Social exclusion (17.6%) and Healthcare policies (10.9%). These thematic domains are conceived along two main latent dimensions (factors) which explain 72.47% of the data variance which respectively deal with: (1) Attitudes towards people with AIDS (care versus avoidance) and (2) Social mandate on AIDS (powerlessness versus control). The study results also reveal the potential evolution of representations of people with AIDS over time: from stigmatised subjects who represent a risk for the entire society within a climate of social control to people progressively symbolised as frail subjects that need to be taken care of.

   This study aims to examine the influence of homophily in an online community and the effect of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) consensus on young consumers' attitudes.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study implemented an experimental research design using a two (low/high homophily) x two (low/high eWOM consensus) mixed factorial design. This study explores young consumers' changes in brand attitude after encountering negative eWOM.
   Findings
   The results indicate that a high consensus of negative eWOM among online community members leads to significant changes in attitude, while a low consensus of negative eWOM does not produce such an effect. Negative eWOM from either high or low homophilous sources produces significant changes in attitude. There are significant attitude changes when a strong consensus of negative eWOM is received from a source with a high level of homophily.
   Research limitations/implications - Service failures in offline service settings lead to the dissemination of negative eWOM on social media. To handle and prevent social media crises, researchers should understand online crises antecedents relating to information characteristics i.e. eWOM consensus and characteristics of online community members to evaluate the crises impact. Brands should monitor tone and dialogue of online community member on social media to remedy and diminish any damage done to their brand image fromnegative eWOM.
   Originality/value
   This study contributes to the application of social network theory by understanding the role of nodes on negative eWOM effect in social media.

AB  - Focusing on exposure level and attitudes of the Israeli public, in the context of gender differences, we look at the #MeToo campaign in social media. To identify whether attitudes toward #MeToo mirror attitudes toward media as a channel of social norms, data were gathered from a survey distributed to 617 participants: 253 (40.9%) men and 364 (59.1%) women, with an average age of 34.5, SD 10.83. More than 90% of the participants were familiar with the #MeToo campaign. Most participants supported the campaign and its objectives, while positive attitudes toward the media were significantly related to positive attitudes toward the #MeToo campaign. Significant gender differences were found in attitudes toward the ability of the media to influence social norms and toward the #MeToo campaign. Women have more positive associations with #MeToo than men; hence, the #MeToo campaign is representative of women taking a positive stance toward media and social change. This research offers a new multiple model for predicting attitudes toward media campaigns, revealing that attitudes toward the #MeToo campaign are influenced by perception of the media.

AB  - Consumer research has demonstrated that emotions play an important role in the decision-making process. Individuals may use consumption or purchasing as a way to manage their emotions. This research develops a model to help explain the process by which individuals engage in consumption to manage their emotions, and examines the efficacy of an advertisement for a hedonic product that uses affect-laden language to stimulate such a process. Results suggest that favourable emotional responses from an advertisement can lead to positive attitudes towards the advertisement, prefactual thinking in the form of hedonic rationalisations and greater behavioural intentions. Additionally, guilt from consuming and purchasing these hedonic products can be mitigated, which is also associated with greater behavioural intentions. Findings have implications for marketers and advertisers of hedonic products.

AB  - This paper reports the findings of a research study on the attitude of Indian teacher educators towards technology-enabled learning (TEL); if any age, gender, teaching position, and mode of teaching differences existed in their attitude; and their attitude to TEL post-pandemic when the imposed remote teaching may cease to exist. An online survey was conducted on 20 teacher education institutions, to which 112 educators responded. The results indicated that teacher educators had positive attitude towards TEL generally; that age, gender and teaching position did not influence their attitude to TEL, though open and distance learning (ODL) teacher educators showed more positive attitude than their campus-based counterparts. Their attitude towards use of TEL, post-Covid, focused more on the parameters of open educational resources (OER), institutional repository, multimedia-based teaching, and faculty capacity building. The results have been discussed in relation to previous research studies, the existing teacher education policy, and institutional contexts of teacher education.

AB  - Research is an essential tool for the creation and advancement of knowledge for socio-economic development. Whilst individuals pursue different kinds of education in order to match international standards, employers are keen to recruit employees with needed skills for a competitive edge. Due to the newly existing educational technologies, individuals have been left with insatiable desire to learn more skills, yet, with limited resources. The advent of Open Education (OE) has led to mass retention, use/re-use, redistribution, revision, and remix of open educational resources (OERs) thereby transforming the learning and research landscape in higher learning institutions. This paper analysed the contribution of OERs and social justice (SJ) on research productivity in higher education institutions. A scoping review was adopted for this study to gather extant literature from relevant available databases with the aim of obtaining as much evidence as possible to make a clearer and succinct conclusion. Existing literature provides evidence that OER and SJ principles positively influence production of research outputs in higher education institutions. The main challenges hindering universality of OERs include economic, technical, legal, social, and infrastructural requirements needed for availing OERs to the beneficiaries including learners, educators, learning institutions and governments. Currently, there are many open and free-to-use resources and websites existing on the internet. There is however, need for attitudinal change towards OERs among students, academics, and scholars among other stakeholders if its optimum uptake is to be realized.

AB  - As broadband Internet access and virtual reality technology rapidly expand, virtual worlds and three-dimensional avatars will become more pervasive and widely adopted. In virtual worlds, people assume an identity as an avatar and interact with each other. The objective of this study is to theorize how users form attitudes and intentions regarding avatars in realistic, task-focused virtual world settings. To investigate these effects, this study proposes a conceptual framework based on dual-congruity perspectives (self-congruity and functional congruity). The results show that the more closely an avatar resembles its user, the more the user is likely to have positive attitudes (e.g., affection, connection, and passion) toward the avatar, and the better able to evaluate the quality and performance of apparel products. In the end, these positive attitudes toward an avatar and its usefulness positively affect users' intentions to use the avatar. Based on this study, we propose that avatars representing users' actual appearance may be helpful in experiencing and evaluating some business areas related to users' lives in the real world (e.g., virtual apparel shopping, matchmaking, plastic surgery, fitness clubs, etc.); utilization of such avatars may be a new business opportunity likely to thrive in virtual worlds.

AB  - Making the work of security organizations known to school children is a means of mitigating feelings of insecurity provoked by the diffusion of information on terrorist attacks in communications media and through social media. Whilst there is a longer tradition of projects to educate school children on the police and the armed forces, no comparable projects have been found on the intelligence services. With the objective of filling this gap, the authors designed and produced two animated educational videos for Spanish school children on the Spanish intelligence service: The National Intelligence Center (CNI). In this paper, the impact of the videos is measured in relation to the knowledge, the stereotypes, and the attitudes of school children towards the CNI. To do so, two questionnaires were administered to 1,092 school children aged 8 and 12, before and after viewing the videos. The results of the questionnaire prior to screening the videos showed that the school children held no knowledge of the intelligence services, and expressed highly developed stereotypes, and moderately negative attitudes towards them. Student-t tests for related samples were used to confirm the responses, on the basis of which it was found that the videos modified both knowledge and stereotyping, as well as attitudes towards the CNI. Specifically, following the screenings the knowledge of the school children improved, stereotyping diminished, and positive attitudes increased.

AB  - This study focused on identifying customers & acute; real-life experiences, perceptions and feelings about travelling in different autonomous vehicles and in various operating conditions in Finland in 2018. Quantitative convenience sample (n = 141) were collected from passengers travelling on an autonomous shuttle bus in Helsinki. Qualitative data (n = 70) were gathered by interviewing passengers of a driverless shuttle bus in Helsinki and passengers of an autonomous car in winter conditions in Lapland. This research was first one which included passengers' real-life experiences after using autonomous vehicles in winter conditions. We applied the Theory of Planned Behaviour. The research questions were (a) What beliefs about outcomes and evaluation of outcomes do passengers have and carry out when they travel in an autonomous vehicle, irrespective of vehicle type or operating conditions? (b) What key factors influence people's positive or negative attitudes towards autonomous vehicles? (c) What key factors could induce people to use autonomous vehicles? The quantitative data were analysed by nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H test and qualitative data by inductive content analysis. According to the results, trust, safety and security were the main factors influencing people's positive attitudes towards using autonomous vehicles. Results from passengers travelling in heavy winter conditions indicate that winter conditions do not significantly influence passengers' attitudes towards using autonomous vehicles. There were no significant differences between gender regarding passengers' perceptions of traffic safety, personal security and emergency management. However, younger passengers felt their personal security on board to be significantly better than older and students their possibilities to act in a case of emergency significantly better than employed people.

AB  - We examined the associations between intimate partner violence (IPV) before and during pregnancy, negative attitudes toward pregnancy, and mother-to-fetus bonding. Participants were 636 pregnant women in the third trimester, who completed the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale, Violence Against Women Screen, and ad hoc questions (for IPV before pregnancy, negative attitudes, and demographics). We found association between IPV during pregnancy and mother-to-fetus bonding failure was mediated by negative attitudes toward pregnancy in the third trimester. IPV before pregnancy was associated with negative attitudes at the beginning of pregnancy, which predicted negative attitudes in the third trimester and mother-to-fetus bonding failure. Careful assessments and psychological interventions are needed to reduce negative attitudes toward pregnancy among abused women in antenatal health settings to prevent mother-to-fetus bonding failure.

AB  - Background: Quality assurance has become an important issue. Many societies are adopting quality assurance programs in order to monitor and improve quality of care. Aim: To assess the opinion of gastroenterologists towards quality assurance on the endoscopy department.
   Methods: A survey was sent to all gastroenterologists (n = 319)in the Netherlands. It assessed their opinion on a quality assurance program for endoscopy units, including its design, logistics, and content.
   Results: 200 gastroenterologists (63%) completed the questionnaire. 95% had a positive opinion towards quality assurance and 67% supposed an increase in quality. 28% assumed a negative impact on the time available for patient contact by introducing a quality assurance program and 35% that the capacity would decrease. A negative attitude towards disclosure of results to insurance companies (23%) and media (53%) was reported. Female gastroenterologists were less positive to share the results with other stakeholders (p < 0.05).
   Most important quality measurements were assessment of complications (97%), standardised reporting (96%), and adequate patient information (95%).
   Conclusion: Gastroenterologists have a positive attitude towards quality assurance. However, concerns do exist about time investment and disclosure of results to others. Information provision and procedure characteristics were considered the most important aspects of quality assurance. (C) 2010 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background:HIV-related stigma is associated with increased risk-taking behavior, reduced uptake of HIV testing, and decreased adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Although ART scale-up may reduce HIV-related stigma, the extent to which levels of stigma in the general population have changed during the era of ART scale-up in sub-Saharan Africa is unknown.Methods:Social distance and anticipated stigma were operationalized using standard HIV-related stigma questions contained in the Demographic and Health Surveys and AIDS Indicator Surveys of 31 African countries between 2003 and 2013. We fitted multivariable linear regression models with cluster-correlated robust standard errors and country fixed effects, specifying social distance or anticipated stigma as the dependent variable and year as the primary explanatory variable of interest.Results:We estimated a statistically significant negative association between year and desires for social distance (b = -0.020; P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval: -0.026 to -0.015) but a statistically significant positive association between year and anticipated stigma (b = 0.023; P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval: 0.018 to 0.027). In analyses stratified by HIV prevalence above or below the sample median, declines in social distancing over time were more pronounced among countries with a higher HIV prevalence.Conclusions:Concomitant with ART scale-up in sub-Saharan Africa, anticipated stigma in the general population increased despite a decrease in social distancing toward people living with HIV. Although ART scale-up may help reduce social distancing toward people living with HIV, particularly in high-prevalence countries, other interventions targeting symbolic or instrumental concerns about HIV may be needed.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) continues to have serious effects causing high mortality and morbidity worldwide with developments of several new strains.
   OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine and adherence to precautionary measures among the Majmaah community.
   Methodology: A Cross-Sectional study was conducted among Majmaah population using a self-administered online questionnaire, collected during 7th of February to 5th of March 2021. The questionnaire collected socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitude, use of precautionary measures and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Individuals residing in the city of Majmaah aging 18 years old or more of both sexes were involved in the study. Data analysis was performed by SPSS, version 24.
   Results: Of the 457 participants surveyed, majority of the participants were female (69.6%) as compared to the males (30.4%,). About half of the participants (48.8%) had good knowledge. In addition, 55.1% showed low positive attitude toward COVID-19. There was significant association of COVID-19 attitude with participants' socio-demographics according to gender (p<0.05). The use of precautionary measures identified in the study were high (46.4%) and 67.8% of participants were willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
   Conclusion: The study concluded that majority of the participants in the study were female who had a low positive attitude towards COVID-19. The application of precautionary measures varied with age and the level of education. Two third of participants showed acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Those who had good knowledge, moderate positive attitude, and high positive application of precautionary measures towards COVID-19 were willing to get the vaccine. More education programs to the community of Majmaah city about COVID-19 precautionary measures and efficacy of vaccine are recommended.

AB  - Online gambling, encompassing a wide variety of activities and around-the-clock access, can be a potential risk factor for gamblers who tend to gamble excessively. Yet, the advent of online gambling has enabled responsible gambling (RG) features that may help individuals to limit their gambling behaviour. One of these features is RG tools that track gamblers' behaviour, performs risk assessments and provides advice to gamblers. This study investigated users' views and experiences of the RG tool Playscan from a qualitative perspective using a semi-structured interview. The tool performs a risk assessment on a three-step scale (low, medium and high risk). Users from every risk category were included. Twenty interviews were carried out and analysed using thematic analysis. Two main themes with associated sub-themes were identified: "Usage of Playscan and the gambling site" and "Experiences of Playscan". Important experiences in the sub-themes were lack of feedback from the tool and confusion when signing up to use Playscan. These experiences counteracted positive attitudes that should have promoted usage of the tool. Providing more feedback directly to users is a suggested solution to increase usage of the RG tool.

AB  - The role of science popularization remains relatively under-explored in research on contemporary public acceptance of evolution. In this study, we analyse national survey data to interrogate the role Britain's best-known celebrity scientists David Attenborough, Brian Cox, Richard Dawkins and Stephen Hawking may have played in changing public views of evolution, as well as the role of two creationists: Ken Ham and Harun Yahya. We investigate how well known these public figures are, what their views of religion are perceived to be and, drawing on social identity theory, whether they exert different effects on attitudinal change to evolution among different religious and non-religious publics. Binary logistic regression analysis shows that among Muslim and Pentecostal Christian publics, those familiar with Dawkins as both a scientist and as someone who holds negative views of religion are more likely to have become less accepting of evolution. Conversely, among non-religious publics, Dawkins was the only celebrity scientist associated with higher odds of becoming more accepting of evolution. We suggest that engaging certain religious audiences with the science of evolutionary biology may be more effective when their religious identities are not threatened.

AB  - Many animals are currently facing extinction. Conservation education which highlights the impacts of our behaviour on other species survival is crucial. This study provides evidence for the use of visual media to increase knowledge, attitudes and conservation behaviours regarding the highly endangered orangutan. University students (n = 126) were shown two styles of educational presentation (knowledge-based, emotive), representative of material widely available through the internet. Participants were randomly assigned to groups, with presentation order counterbalanced. A repeated measures between groups ANCOVA revealed significant increases in knowledge about orangutans over time (p < 0.001), with a significant main effect of group condition (p < 0.001). An interaction between time and condition was also observed (p < 0.001). For participant attitudes toward orangutans, only a significant main effect of time was detected (p = 0.001). Regardless of presentation order, maximum increases occurred with the cumulative effect of both presentations. Behavioural data suggests knowledge and attitude changes translated into actual, at least short term, behaviour change, with 84.8% of participants who returned a behaviour diary (36.5% return rate) reporting changing their behaviour in the week following the study. The potential wide-ranging application of such forms of media to spread environmental messages and foster more sustainable behaviour is discussed.

AB  - Adolescent mental health has become a growing concern. One unique challenge to adolescents' willingness to seek professional mental health support is the concern of confidentiality breach by their parents. This concern may carry more weight in collectivistic cultures, such as China. The current study utilized a large parent sample (N = 460) recruited from six high schools and attempted to integrate cultural self-construal and parenting styles in the context of parental attitudes toward mental health professionals and desires to breach confidentiality. Parental independent self-construal was related to more positive attitudes toward mental health professionals through higher authoritative parenting and negatively associated with authoritarian parenting. On the other hand, interdependent self-construal was related to less positive attitudes toward mental health professionals via higher authoritarian parenting and lower authoritative parenting. More positive attitudes toward mental health professionals, in turn, were related to lower desire to breach confidentiality. Permissive parenting did not play a significant role in this process. The present study illustrates the importance of understanding culturally specific factors and parental influences in therapeutic practices.

AB  - Since the 1980s, debates on security have expanded and security has become a catchphrase in virtually every area of life. In Finland, the government elected in 2003 began its four-year period in power by launching a special Internal Security Programme (ISP) that stressed the threat of social exclusion. Altogether four ISPs have been launched in Finland since 2004. They all repeat the menace of social exclusion. In this article, we examine how these speech acts materialised on the level of legislation. Our study suggests that in Finland, the securitization of exclusion was only accepted in the media. Overall it 'failed', as on the level of law, internal security and exclusion were not, in the main, connected when security measures were justified. On the other hand, we contend that by introducing more monitoring and less privacy - especially among youth - the legislation effectively opened novel avenues for 'security nothings'.

AB  - Illegal immigration is a contentious issue on the American policy agenda. To understand the sources of public attitudes toward immigration, social scientists have focused attention on political factors such as party identification; they have also drawn on theories of intergroup contact to argue that contact with immigrants shapes immigration attitudes. Absent direct measures, contextual measures such as respondents' ethnic milieu or proximity to salient geographic features (such as borders) have been used as proxies of contact. Such a research strategy still leaves the question unanswered - is it contact or context that really matters? Further, which context, and for whom? This article evaluates the effects of party identification, personal contact with undocumented immigrants, and contextual measures (county Hispanic population and proximity to the US-Mexico border) on American attitudes toward illegal immigration. It finds that contextual factors moderate the effects of political party identification on attitudes toward illegal immigration; personal contact has no effect. These findings challenge the assumption that contextual measures act as proxies for interpersonal contact.

AB  - We explored whether the existence of gender bias causes gender gaps in STEM engagement. In Experiment 1 (n=322), U.S. women projected less sense of belonging, positivity toward, and aspirations to participate in STEM than did men when exposed to the reality of STEM gender bias. These gender differences disappeared when participants were told that STEM exhibits gender equality, suggesting that gender bias produces STEM gender gaps. Experiment 2 (n=429) explored whether results generalized to a specific STEM department, and whether organizational efforts to mitigate gender bias might shrink gender gaps. U.S. women exposed to a biased chemistry department anticipated more discrimination and projected less sense of belonging, positive attitudes and trust and comfort than did men. These gender differences vanished when participants read about an unbiased department, again suggesting that gender bias promotes STEM gender gaps. Further, moderated mediation analyses suggested that in the presence of gender bias (but not gender equality), women projected less positive attitudes and trust and comfort than did men because they experienced less sense of belonging and anticipated more discrimination. Results were largely unaffected by whether departments completed a diversity training, suggesting that knowledge of diversity initiatives alone cannot close STEM gender gaps.

AB  - Imagined intergroup contactthe mental simulation of a (positive) interaction with a member of another groupis a recently developed, low-risk, prejudice-reducing intervention. However, regulatory focus can moderate of the effects of prejudice-reducing interventions: a prevention focus (as opposed to a promotion focus) can lead to more negative outcomes. In two experiments we found that a prevention focus altered imagined contact's effects, causing the intervention to backfire. In Experiment 1, participants who reported a strong prevention-focus during imagined contact subsequently reported higher intergroup anxiety and (indirectly) less positive attitudes toward Asians. We found similar moderating effects in Experiment 2, using a different outgroup (gay men) and a subtle regulatory focus manipulation. Theoretical and practical implications for imagined contact are discussed.

AB  - This study attempt to examine the risk reduction mechanism of the COVID-19 outbreak in Pakistan. World Health Organization (WHO) declared the emergency and provided guidelines to reduce the risk of a pandemic. Thus, people tried to adopt multiple health safety measures to reduce the risk of a pandemic outbreak. Therefore, this study was designed to conduct an online survey technique to collect information from 1264 individuals in Pakistan. The rationale to select the technique was based on the pandemic situations in the country i.e. COVID-19. Moreover, it was used to main social distancing and following the health safety measures. Thus, a well-structured questionnaire was administered based on an attitudinal scale and google form was used. The inclusion criteria were defined on the questionnaire such as an independent age bracket (18-60), resident of Pakistan, using social media, and literate. The response was stopped after reaching the sample at 1264 participants. The study findings reveal that social isolation, social distancing, and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) had a significant positive impact on risk reduction of COVID-19 among individuals. Moreover, hand and respiratory hygienic along with the risk of infection also significantly contributing to minimizing the pandemic outbreak.

AB  - This study examines the influence of authentic leadership on employees from public organizations analyzed through self-determination theory. Over the years, researchers analyzed different particularities of authentic leadership and its importance in nowadays' society. However, fewer researchers were interested in analyzing the influence of authentic leadership on employees through self-determination theory, especially in the perception of public ethical behavior. The theoretical model of this study proposes that authentic leadership is negatively correlated with public employees' positive attitude toward unethical behavior, namely corrupt acts. Also, authentic leadership and job satisfaction are positively related with public employees' work motivation. This positive relationship contributes to the decrease level of public employees' positive attitude toward corruption acts. The study was realized in different public organizations from Republic of Moldova. The total sample is composed by 98 participants. The hypotheses were tested through Multiple Hierarchical Regression. The study results showed that authentic leadership has a positive impact on work motivation. However, job satisfaction does not have any influence on public employees' perception of corruption acts. By contrast, authentic leadership behavior does have a positive impact on public employees' perception of corruption acts, but only when they perceive these acts as less serious.

AB  - In the run-up to the elections to the European Parliament in 2014, EU citizens had the unprecedented opportunity to watch televised debates between the candidates running for president of the European Commission. The most important debate was the so-called "Eurovision debate", which was broadcasted in almost all EU member states. In this study we explore the responses of a sample of 110 young German voters, who watched this debate, to the candidates' messages and whether exposure to the debate caused a shift in the respondents' attitudes towards the EU. Combining data from a quasi-experiment, real-time response data, and data from a content analysis of the debate, we find that respondents' reactions to the candidates' statements were-on average-positive and that some respondents displayed attitudinal changes resulting in more favorable views towards the EU. Although the direct connection between real-time responses and post-debate attitudes is not as strong as expected, most of the measured effects indicate that a positive evaluation of the candidates' messages usually results in more pro-European attitudes. Furthermore, we find no strong evidence that political knowledge moderates debate effects. In general, differences between political 'novices' and political 'experts' tend to be rare.

AB  - Background: Individuals with addiction are shown to suffer from stigmatization by health professionals.While medical students in general have been shown to express negative attitudes towards individuals with addiction, little is known about mental health students' attitudes towards this population.
   Method: Undergraduate and graduate students (N-265), currently studying mental health professions (psychology, social work, criminology) or non-mental health professions, filled out questionnaires assessing their levels of negative implicit attitudes towards individuals with addiction, social rejection and addiction-specific stereotypes.
   Results: Mental health students expressed less negative attitudes towards individuals with addiction compared to non-mental health students. Undergraduate psychology students expressed more negative attitudes compared to graduate psychology students and graduate criminology students expressed more social rejection compared to undergraduate criminology students.
   Conclusions: Social contact focused interventions, targeting addiction-related social rejection, should be integrated into mental health academic programs.

AB  - When making a difficult choice, people often justify the choice by increasing their liking for the chosen object and decreasing their liking for the rejected object. To uncover the neural signatures of choice justification, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to monitor neural activity when subjects rated their preference for chosen and rejected musical CDs before and after they made their choices. We observed that the trial-by-trial attitude change (i.e., increase of preference for chosen items and decrease of preference for rejected items) was predicted by post-choice activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), right temporal-parietal junction, anterior insula, and bilateral cerebellum. Furthermore, individual difference in choice justification (i.e., increased preference for chosen items minus decreased preference for rejected items) was predicted by post-choice neural activity in the dorsal MPFC, left lateral prefrontal cortex, and right precentral cortex positively. In addition, interdependent self-construal was correlated with decreased activity in the ventral MPFC in the post-choice than pre-choice sessions. These findings suggest that both negative arousal/regulation and self-reflection are associated with choice justification. This provides evidence for the self-threat theory of choice justification.

AB  - Background Vaccine hesitancy presents an obstacle to the campaign to control COVID-19. It has previously been found to be associated with youth, female gender, low income, low education, low medical trust, minority ethnic group membership, low perceived risk from COVID-19, use of certain social media platforms and conspiracy beliefs. However, it is unclear which of these predictors might explain variance associated with others. Methods An online survey was conducted with a representative sample of 4343 UK residents, aged 18-75, between 21 November and 21 December 2020. Predictors of vaccine hesitancy were assessed using linear rank-order models. Results Coronavirus vaccine hesitancy is associated with youth, female gender, low income, low education, high informational reliance on social media, low informational reliance on print and broadcast media, membership of other than white ethnic groups, low perceived risk from COVID-19 and low trust in scientists and medics, as well as (to a much lesser extent) low trust in government. Coronavirus conspiracy suspicions and general vaccine attitudes appear uniquely predictive, jointly explaining 35% of variance. Following controls for these variables, effects associated with trust, ethnicity and social media reliance largely or completely disappear, whereas the effect associated with education is reversed. Conclusions Strengthening positive attitudes to vaccination and reducing conspiracy suspicions with regards to the coronavirus may have a positive effect on vaccine uptake, especially among ethnic groups with heightened vaccine hesitancy. However, vaccine hesitancy associated with age and gender does not appear to be explained by other predictor variables tested here.

AB  - This quasi-experimental study examined a guided learning approach towards the use of mobile devices and investigated the performance of language learners who were guided in the usage. A total of 419 students from two faculties were invited to participate in this 8-week intervention, 155 participants in the control group and 264 in the experimental group. In the experimental group, the researchers incorporated guided activities Module Intervention Model (MIM) using mobile devices into the ESL lessons whereas the control group lessons were without guided activities. Participants from both groups were asked to record their daily mobile device use for activities related to English language learning using an online form. These data were compared to the results of the tests conducted pre- and post-treatment. At the end of the study, students who received guided language activities utilizing the mobile devices had significantly higher levels of language performance than control group students. However, treatment group students who spent more time using mobile devices to learn the language did not display better performance compared to those who spent minimal time. This finding re-established the importance of guided activities as intervention to facilitate students' learning and points to the need for curricular modernization and faculty development in the instructional use of technology. Due to the increased need for online instruction precipitated by "social distancing and isolation' required to overcome the coronavirus pandemic, the need for faculty to acquire skills in guided use of mobile devices for school-related learning is anticipated to be greater than ever.

AB  - It has been suggested that pets provide the opportunity for humans to develop more positive attitudes and relationships toward a wider range of animal types-including toward non-pet animals-this is called the "pets as ambassadors" hypothesis. In this study, we build both on research conducted on human-animal relations and in social psychology to investigate the hypothesis, as well as two likely mechanisms involved in this effect: inter- group anxiety (toward animals) and inclusion of animals in the self. An online questionnaire was completed by 238 Canadian participants (M = 28.6 years old, SD = 8.53; 102 women). Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we tested a model whereby contact with pets predicted greater inclusion of ani- mals in the self and lower intergroup anxiety toward animals in general. In turn, these two psychological processes predicted more positive attitudes toward a broad range of animal types (e.g., wild/pest animals, animals used for human purposes) and animals in general. Finally, these positive attitudes toward animals predicted more pro-social behavioral intentions toward animals. The hypothesized model showed a good fit. Bootstrapping analyses further con- firmed the mediating roles of inclusion of animals in the self and intergroup anxiety toward animals in the associations between contact with pets and attitudes toward animals in general. The hypothesized model also presented a more satisfactory fit compared with an alternative model. Altogether, these findings underline the importance of contact with pets in fostering more positive human-animal relations and promoting animal welfare. These results also support the applicability of social psychological theories and principles in the realm of human-animal relations.

AB  - This study proposed a new perspective to look at the consequences of the formation of immigrant communities in globalized societies, by investigating the impact of two forms of group indispensability on majority attitudes towards immigrants. Specifically, it explored whether perceived indispensability of different immigrant groups to the national identity and their contributions to the functioning of the host society are related to the development of more positive attitudes towards them. We also explored whether such effects would be mediated by the inclusion of immigrants within the national common identity and whether these effects would be stronger among host country members with a stronger civic than ethnic conception of national citizenship. Results supported these predictions among a sample of native Portuguese citizens (N=118). As predicted, these effects were driven by perceptions of different types of indispensability for three immigrant groups in Portugal, who differed in their historical relations with the host society.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Among surgeons, professional use of social media (SM) is varied, and attitudes are ambiguous. We sought to characterize surgeons' professional use and perceptions of SM.
   DESIGN: Surgical faculty and trainees received institutional review board-approved e-mail surveys assessing SM usage and attitudes. Regression analyses identified predictors of SM attitudes and preference for professional contact.
   SETTING: Surveys were administered to surgical faculty, fellows, and residents at 4 academic medical centers between January and April 2016.
   PARTICIPANTS: Of 1037 surgeons, clinical fellows, and residents e-mailed, 208 (20%) responded, including 132 faculty and 76 trainees.
   RESULTS: Among 208 respondents, 46 (22%) indicated they preferred some form of SM as their preferred networking and communication modality. A total of 145 (70%) indicated they believe SM benefits professional development. The position of clinical resident predicted preference to maintain professional contact via SM (p = 0.03). Age <55 predicted positive attitude (p = 0.02) and rank of associate professor predicted negative attitude toward SM (p = 0.03). Lack of time as well as personal and patient privacy concerns were cited most commonly as reasons for not using SM.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most of surgeons responding to our survey used some form of SM for professional purposes. Perceived barriers include lack of value, time constraints, and personal and patient privacy concerns. Generational differences in surgeon attitudes suggest usage of SM among surgeons will expand over time. (C) 2017 Association of Program Directors in Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Cross-National Focus Group Response to Autonomous Vehicles
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA  - English
AB  - The development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is advancing quickly in some enclaves around the world. Consequently, AVs exist in the public consciousness, featuring regularly in mainstream media. As the form and function of AVs emerge, the attitudes of potential users become more important. The extent to which the public trusts AV technology and anticipates benefits, will drive consumer willingness to use AVs. Broadly, public attitudes will determine whether AVs can attract public investment in infrastructure and become a feature of the future transport mix or fail to realize the potential their developers assert. As part of UK Autodrive, a program trialing the introduction of AVs in the United Kingdom, researchers conducted focus groups in five UK cities, and a comparison focus group in San Francisco (December 2017 to September 2018) using representative samples (total n = 137). Focus group facilitators guided discussions in three areas considered central to usage decisions: trust in the technology, ownership models, and community benefit. This paper describes findings from a quasi-quantitative study supported with qualitative insights. This research provides three key takeaways centering on trust in the technology and in delivering benefit. First, some participants gain trust through experience and others through evidence. Second, participants had difficulty discriminating between AV developers, indicating a need for industry cooperation. Third, partnerships were found to demonstrate trust, highlighting the need for more and deeper partnerships moving forward. Generally, participants had positive attitudes toward AVs and expect AVs to provide benefits. However, these attitudes and expectations could change as AV development progresses.

AB  - Fictional brands are brands that exist only in the world of fiction and not the real physical world. Reverse product placement consists of transforming these fictional brands into products and services in the real physical world. This paper posits that consumers, despite having no preexisting experience of fictional brands in the real world, may develop positive attitudes towards fictional brands; hence the fundamental managerial question is to ascertain whether these positive attitudes can drive purchase intention to justify the investment into a real product or service based on the fictional brand. Using two fictional service brands, 'MacLaren's Pub' and 'Central Perk', featured respectively in How I Met Your Mother and Friends, this study confirms the existence of protobrands, and shows that attitudes towards a fictional brand are driven by perceived service quality, identification with the brand and attitudes towards the television programme. The study goes on to provide evidence that attitudes towards the fictional brand can influence purchase intention of a future defictionalised brand in the real world. The paper contributes to product placement and branding literature in a new emerging area.

AB  - The growth of the Sport for Development and Peace (SDP) movement has provoked considerable scholarly interrogation of the claimed social benefits of sport. However, little is known of public attitudes to the topic. This article reports research carried out in Northern Ireland regarding sport as a means of bringing divided communities together. Respondents viewed sport as effective in breaking down barriers, yet the demographic reach in terms of the participants in sports-based projects was shown to be limited. Qualitative research revealed diverse experiences of the impact of sport. The conclusion highlights the significance of a public attitudes perspective on SDP-it can reveal (a) the degree of public receptivity to SDP, (b) the participating constituencies, and (c) sociopolitical barriers to SDP and wider sporting inclusivity.

AB  - Background The causes of idiopathic ileocolic intussusception are unknown, with infection as the most likely culprit. Recently, social distancing measures were implemented during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to decrease transmissible infectious diseases, creating an opportune setting to study the role of infection on the pathogenesis of intussusception on a population level. Objective To investigate the impact of social distancing on intussusception. Materials and methods We retrospectively reviewed air contrast enemas and pylorus ultrasounds performed between March 2010 and March 2021 to identify cases of ileocolic intussusception and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS), using the latter as a negative control. The study time frame was divided into two periods: pre-pandemic (March 2010-February 2020) and pandemic (April 2020-March 2021). The number of cases that occurred in these two time periods were compared using the Poisson regression model. Results Of the 407 cases of idiopathic ileocolic intussusception identified, 396 occurred in the pre-pandemic time period (mean = 39.6 per 12-month period) and 11 occurred in the 12-month pandemic time period. The mean monthly number of intussusceptions showed a decline of 72% (95% confidence interval [CI] 49-85%) between the pre-pandemic and pandemic time periods (3.3 vs. 0.9 monthly cases; P < 0.001). In contrast, the mean monthly number of HPS did not differ significantly (P = 0.19). Conclusion Social distancing-imposed to curb the spread of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic-resulted in a significant decline in ileocolic intussusception, lending strong support to the theory that infection is the dominant cause of intussusception.

AB  - I examined the different effects that source cues (in-group vs. out-group membership) and message approaches (rational vs. emotional appeals) have on the attitudes of consumers with individualistic and collectivistic cultural orientations toward charity advertising and donation intention. Participants (105 and 99 college students from Korea and the US, respectively) viewed a charity donation appeal advertisement, then rated their attitude toward the advertisement and donation intention. Results showed that compared with the individualistic U.S. students, collectivistic Korean students had a more positive attitude toward the advertisement and a higher donation intention when the in-group source cue and emotional message approach were used. In contrast, rational message appeals were more effective for U.S. students, and no significant differences were observed among this group regarding the in-group and out-group source cue types. My findings implied that charity advertising campaigners may need to use different approaches in terms of group membership and message approaches depending on cultural orientation, thereby motivating people to have a positive attitude toward charity advertising and donation intention.

AB  - Scholarship on newborn screening, dried bloodspot retention, and large population biobanking call consistently for improved public engagement. Communication with participants likely occurs only in the context of collection, consent, or notification, if at all. We ran an 11-week advertising campaign to inform Michigan Facebook users unlikely to know that their or their children's dried bloodspots (DBSs) were stored in a state biobank. We investigated the pattern and content of comments posted during the campaign, focusing on users' questions, attitudes and concerns, and the role the moderator played in addressing them. We used Facebook data to quantitatively assess engagement and employed conventional content analysis to investigate themes, attitudes, and social dynamics among user and moderator comments. Five ad sets elicited comments during campaign weeks 4-8, reaching similar to 800,000 Facebook users ($6000). Gravitating around broad, underlying ethical, legal, and social issues, 180 posts from 129 unique users related to newborn screening or biobanking. Thirty six conveyed negative attitudes and 33 conveyed positive attitudes; 53 posed questions. The most prevalent themes identified were consent, privacy, bloodspot use, identifiability, inclusion criteria, research benefits, (mis)-trust, genetics, DBS destruction, awareness, and the role of government. The moderator's 81 posts were responsive-answering questions, correcting or clarifying information, or providing information about opting out. Facebook ad campaigns can improve engagement by pushing out relevant content and creating dynamic, responsive, visible forums for discussion. Reduced control over messaging may be worth the trade-off for creating accessible, transparent, people-centered engagement on public health issues that are sensitive and complex.

TI  - Differential methylation and expression patterns of microRNAs in relation to breast cancer subtypes among American women of African and European ancestry
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Aggressive high-grade, estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer is more common among American women of African ancestry (AA) than those of European ancestry (EA). Epigenetic mechanisms, particularly DNA methylation and altered microRNA (miRNA) expression, may contribute to racial differences in breast cancer. However, few studies have specifically characterized genome-wide DNA methylation-based modifications at the miRNA level in relation to ER+ and ER- subtype, and their functional role in the regulation of miRNA expression, especially among high risk AA women. In this study, we evaluated DNA methylation patterns of miRNA encoding genes and their effect on expression in breast tumors from both AA and EA women. The genome-wide methylation screen identified a total of 7,191 unique CpGs mapped to 1,292 miRNA genes, corresponding to 2,035 unique mature miRNAs. We identified differentially methylated loci (DMLs: (|delta beta|)>0.10, FDR<0.05) between ER- and ER+ tumor subtypes, including 290 DMLs shared in both races, 317 and 136 were specific to AA and EA women, respectively. Integrated analysis identified certain DMLs whose methylation levels were significantly correlated with the expression of relevant miRNAs, such as multiple CpGs within miR-190b and miR-135b highly negatively correlated with their expression. These results were then validated in the TCGA dataset. Target prediction and pathway analysis showed that these DNA methylation-dysregulated miRNAs are involved in multiple cancer-related pathways, including cell cycle G1-S growth factor regulation, cytoskeleton remodeling, angiogenesis, EMT, and ESR1-mediated signaling pathways. In summary, our results suggest that DNA methylation changes within miRNA genes are associated with altered miRNA expression, which may contribute to the network of subtype- and race-related tumor biological differences in breast cancer. These findings support the involvement of epigenetic regulation of miRNA expression and provide insights into the relations of clinical-relevant miRNAs to their target genes, which may serve as potential preventative and therapeutic targets.

AB  - Approaching issues through the lens of nonnegotiable values increases the perceived intractability of debate (Baron & Spranca in Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 70, 1-16, 1997), while focusing on the concrete consequences of policies instead results in the moderation of extreme opinions (Fernbach, Rogers, Fox, & Sloman in Psychological Science, 24, 939-946, 2013) and a greater likelihood of conflict resolution (Baron & Leshner in Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 6, 183-194, 2000). Using comments on the popular social media platform Reddit from January 2006 until September 2017, we showed how changes in the framing of same-sex marriage in public discourse relate to changes in public opinion. We used a topic model to show that the contributions of certain protected-values-based topics to the debate (religious arguments and freedom of opinion) increased prior to the emergence of a public consensus in support of same-sex marriage (Gallup, 2017), and declined afterward. In contrast, the discussion of certain consequentialist topics (the impact of politicians' stance and same-sex marriage as a matter of policy) showed the opposite pattern. Our results reinforce the meaningfulness of protected values and consequentialism as relevant dimensions for describing public discourse and highlight the usefulness of unsupervised machine-learning methods in tackling questions about social attitude change.

AB  - This study aims to develop the Cyberostracism Scale (CS) to assess university students' perceptions of virtual social exclusion. Validity and reliability studies were carried out with 3 different groups (N = 692; %69 women). In the developing process of the scale, EFA, CFA, Item Response Theory (IRT), and criterion-related validity and reliability (Cronbach's alpha, McDonald's omega, and test-retest) analyses were used. EFA results indicated that the CS has a 3-dimensional structure (Direct Excluded, Indirect Excluded, Ignored) which explains 55.74% of the total variance. The CFA results showed that the 3-factor structure of the scale had an acceptable level of fit indices and had a measurement invariance across gender. IRT analysis showed that all items of the scale were coherent and fit with the model. The results indicated that the scale had satisfactory reliability coefficients. The cyberostracism was found to be associated with the ostracism. Results of the study show that the CS is a valid and reliable measurement tool.

AB  - Faced with the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, many nations have mandated sets of requirements, such as social-distancing measures. However, compliance with such measures is likely to be shaped by a range of factors. Here, we proposed and tested a mediation model in which rejection of COVID-19 conspiracy theories and/or theorists mediates the relationship between rational thinking style and compliance with mandated requirements. An online, nationally representative sample of the adult population in the United Kingdom (N = 520) completed a previously validated measure of rational thinking style, as well as novel measures of rejection of COVID-19 conspiracy theories/theorists and compliance with mandated requirements. Intercorrelations between scores on all three measures were significant and positive. Mediation analysis indicated that rational thinking style and rejection of COVID-19 conspiracy theories/theorists, respectively, were directly associated with compliance, and that the mediated association was also significant. These results may have implications for practical policy aimed at promoting greater compliance with mandated requirements, including social distancing.

AB  - On HIV blogs, people living with HIV share their intimate thoughts and experiences with the world in the form of personal online diaries. While previous research investigated the reasons why patients engage in blogging activities, the effects of such diaries on nondiseased recipients are largely unexplored. Following an experimental design, this study (n = 261) tested whether a one-time exposure to a personal HIV blog has greater persuasive effects on its readers than an institutional HIV website providing the same content. Results showed that although source credibility was perceived as higher when reading the HIV website from an official institution, blog readers had more positive attitudes and a higher self-efficacy toward condom use than website readers. Implications for health message design are discussed.

TI  - The Effect of Background Music in Shark Documentaries on Viewers' Perceptions of Sharks
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Despite the ongoing need for shark conservation and management, prevailing negative sentiments marginalize these animals and legitimize permissive exploitation. These negative attitudes arise from an instinctive, yet exaggerated fear, which is validated and reinforced by disproportionate and sensationalistic news coverage of shark 'attacks' and by highlighting shark-on-human violence in popular movies and documentaries. In this study, we investigate another subtler, yet powerful factor that contributes to this fear: the ominous background music that often accompanies shark footage in documentaries. Using three experiments, we show that participants rated sharks more negatively and less positively after viewing a 60-second video clip of swimming sharks set to ominous background music, compared to participants who watched the same video clip set to uplifting background music, or silence. This finding was not an artifact of soundtrack alone because attitudes toward sharks did not differ among participants assigned to audio-only control treatments. This is the first study to demonstrate empirically that the connotative attributes of background music accompanying shark footage affect viewers' attitudes toward sharks. Given that nature documentaries are often regarded as objective and authoritative sources of information, it is critical that documentary filmmakers and viewers are aware of how the soundtrack can affect the interpretation of the educational content.

AB  - All systems must adapt in order to survive, this is as true for a business organisation as any other system. A business exists in a turbulent environment and in order to maintain its relationship with its environment its managers have to adapt it to the circumstances. The effect of the present pandemic is an example with some staff working from home, active blended learning in the education sector and social distancing have all created an urgency to accommodate the unprecedented consequence of the situation. To effect the necessary changes that these circumstances have generated means exercising some form of power to change operating procedures. Change creates uncertainty, the threat of the reallocation of resources, delegated power, redundancies and a change in group relationships. This produces a feeling of insecurity in those within the organisation often resulting in resistance to the proposals in an attempt to maintain the status quo. They are faced with adapting or resisting to these changes. Whilst systems models of organisational behavior provide ideas about organizing and managing an enterprise these are of limited value because of the unpredictability of change. The ubiquity of communication technologies and the rise of virtual methods of working add to the pressure for change creating a climate of anxiety. Organisational power can no longer be framed by the measures once taken for granted. To this end I adopt a soft systems perspective to explore the impact of change upon an organisation and how those within react as they attempt to cope with its impact.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of social distancing resulting from COVID-19 in hospitalizations for infections of the upper airways (URTI), such as acute laryngitis, tracheitis, and otitis media in children aged 0 to 9 years in Brazil, considering that they share the same forms of transmission. Methods: Data on hospitalizations for acute airway changes and their complications in children <9 years old were obtained from the Database of the Brazilian Department of Public Health Informatics for the period 2015 to 2020. These data were also analyzed by macroregions of Brazil (North, Northeast, Southeast, South, and Midwest). The effect of the social distancing strategy on the increase of acute laryngitis, tracheitis, otitis media, and mastitis, as absolute and relative reductions, was calculated by analyzing the annual calculation of 2015-2019 vs 2020. Results: All the hospitalizations compared in the Unified Health System (SUS) for laryngitis and acute tracheitis and otitis media decreased, considering all states of Brazil. The largest reduction in hospitalization reduction was in the North, with - 94% in 2015-2019 vs 2020 in cases of laryngitis and acute tracheitis, and in the Midwest, with - 85% in 2015-2019 vs 2020 in cases of otitis media. Conclusion: Hospitalizations for laryngitis, acute tracheitis, and acute otitis media in children <9 years old decreased between March and July 2020 in Brazil, when social distancing measures were adopted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Social distancing compliance: A video observational analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
KW  - COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY
KW  - PATIENT COMPLIANCE
AB  - Purpose
   Virus epidemics may be mitigated if people comply with directives to stay at home and keep their distance from strangers in public. As such, there is a public health interest in social distancing compliance. The available evidence on distancing practices in public space is limited, however, by the lack of observational data. Here, we apply video observation as a method to examine to what extent members of the public comply with social distancing directives.
   Data
   Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage of interactions in public was collected in inner-city Amsterdam, the Netherlands. From the footage, we observed instances of people violating the 1.5-meter distance directives in the weeks before, during, and after these directives were introduced to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Results
   We find that people complied with the 1.5-meter distance directives when these directives were first introduced, but that the level of compliance started to decline soon after. We also find that violation of the 1.5-meter distance directives is strongly associated with the number of people observed on the street and with non-compliance to stay-at-home directives, operationalized with large-scale aggregated location data from cell phones. All three measures correlate to a varying extent with temporal patterns in the transmission of the COVID-19 virus, temperature, COVID-19 related Google search queries, and media attention to the topic.
   Conclusion
   Compliance with 1.5 meter distance directives is short-lived and coincides with the number of people on the street and with compliance to stay-at-home directives. Potential implications of these findings are that keep- distance directives may work best in combination with stay-at-home directives and place-specific crowd-control strategies, and that the number of people on the street and community-wide mobility as captured with cell phone data offer easily measurable proxies for the extent to which people keep sufficient physical distance from others at specific times and locations.

AB  - In Singapore, many middle-class families employ foreign domestic workers (FDWs) to take on care and domestic work. In this setup, female FDWs need to be a part of the family and feel at home to better perform and render intimate labor, but they are structurally displaced and prevented from being fully integrated in both their employer's homes and in the host country. Ilo Ilo (2013), a debut film by a Singaporean director Anthony Chen, has poignantly portrayed this paradoxical relationship by showing a young boy's growing affection to his Filipina maid, and how this brief yet enduring bond demonstrates migration's effects on both the foreign helpers and the middle-class families employing them. This Singaporean family melodrama depicts the affective nature of migration by demonstrating how FDWs are positioned as an intimate yet excluded figure inside the employer's homes. The contradiction between intimacy and social exclusion seen in the film also simultaneously describes and prescribes the FDW's place in the host country. The film illustrates the paradox of intimacy and exclusion in the host-guest worker relationship of employers and their maids within the private domains of household and the public discourse on FDWs' claims in Singapore.

AB  - Humans have large social networks, with hundreds of interacting individuals. How does the brain represent the complex connectivity structure of these networks? Here we used social media (Facebook) data to objectively map participants' real-life social networks. We then used representational similarity analysis (RSA) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity patterns to investigate the neural coding of these social networks as participants reflected on each individual. We found coding of social network distances in the default-mode network (medial prefrontal, medial parietal, and lateral parietal cortices). When using partial correlation RSA to control for other factors that can be correlated to social distance (personal affiliation, personality traits. and visual appearance, as subjectively rated by the participants), we found that social network distance information was uniquely coded in the retrosplenial complex, a region involved in spatial processing. In contrast, information on individuals' personal affiliation to the participants and personality traits was found in the medial parietal and prefrontal cortices, respectively. These findings demonstrate a cortical division between representations of non-self-referenced (allocentric) social network structure, self-referenced (egocentric) social distance, and trait-based social knowledge.

AB  - Rationale: Low-VT ventilation lowers mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but is underused. Little is known about clinician attitudes toward and perceived barriers to low-VT ventilation use and their association with actual low-VT ventilation use.
   Objectives: The objectives of this study were to assess clinicians' attitudes toward and perceived barriers to low-VT ventilation (VT,6.5 ml/kg predicted body weight) in patients with ARDS, to identify differences in attitudes and perceived barriers among clinician types, and to compare attitudes toward and perceived barriers to actual low-VT ventilation use in patients with ARDS.
   Methods: We conducted a survey of critical care physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists at four non-ARDS Network hospitals in the Chicago region. We compared survey responses with performance in a cohort of 362 patients with ARDS.
   Results: Survey responses included clinician attitudes toward and perceived barriers to low-VT ventilation use. We also measured low-VT ventilation initiation by these clinicians in 347 patients with ARDS initiated after ARDS onset as well as correlation with clinician attitudes and perceived barriers. Of 674 clinicians surveyed, 467 (69.3%) responded. Clinicians had positive attitudes toward and perceived few process barriers toARDS diagnosis or initiation of low-VT ventilation. Physicians had more positive attitudes and perceived fewer barriers than nurses or respiratory therapists. However, use of low-VT ventilation by all three clinician groups was low. For example, whereas physicians believed that 92.5% of their patients with ARDS warranted treatmentwith low-VT ventilation, they initiated low-VT ventilationfor a median (interquartile range) of 7.4% ( 0 to 14.3%) of their eligible patients with ARDS. Clinician attitudes and perceived barriers were not correlated with low-VT ventilation initiation.
   Conclusions: Clinicians had positive attitudes toward low-VT ventilation and perceived few barriers to using it, but attitudes and perceived process barriers were not correlated with actual low-VT ventilation use, which was low. Implementation strategies should be focused on examining other issues, such as ARDS recognition and process solutions, to improve low-VT ventilation use.

AB  - During unusual times involving discontinued face to face sessions in formal education settings, mobile learning (m-learning) involving social networking sites has become a popular alternative since students are always in possession of handheld electronic devices. When connection through technology was the only option due to social distancing in current pandemic, students who were already active extensive users of social networks found online learning as a new way of getting formal education. The objective of this study was to explore how the state of student's behavioral intention for social media based online learning is driven by external factors like subjective norm and self-efficacy. To fulfill this aim, this study uses a quantitative approach to study the factors that mediate the decision behavior of students towards social media employed as a learning platform and use of m-learning involving social networks. A sample of management science students (n= 255) from four universities participated in the research. Analysis of data suggested that subjective norm and self-efficacy were significant predictors for student participation in e-learning initiatives involving social media and networks. The proposed serial mediation model revealed that self-efficacy and perceived usefulness in that order were playing a positive significant role in student use of social networking for learning. No significant differences were observed between either gender when self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, and use of social media in education were considered.

AB  - Political polarization has dominated news coverage of Americans' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this research note, we report findings from two experimental studies, in which we present respondents with news stories about COVID-19 mitigation measures that emphasize partisan difference or accord. The stories present the same numeric facts about public opinion, but highlight either the partisan gap that existed at the time of the study, or the fact that large majorities of both Republicans and Democrats supported the measures at the time. Results from our first study, conducted late April 2020, show that a media frame drawing attention to shared concern across party lines produced a less polarized response to social-distancing restrictions than a frame that drew attention to partisan difference. Our findings suggest that the extensive media coverage about the red-blue divide in COVID-19 opinions reinforced partisan polarization. These results, however, did not replicate in a second study conducted much later in the pandemic. Qualitative data collected across the two studies demonstrate the degree to which polarization had rapidly become a dominant narrative in Americans' thinking about COVID-19.

AB  - Postnatal depression and bonding failure after childbirth are major mental health issues. We investigated 99 pregnant women on three occasions (late in pregnancy and 5 days and 1 month postnatally). Anxiety during pregnancy predicted postnatal depression and bonding failure, whereas negative attitudes towards pregnancy predicted bonding failure. The effect of negative attitudes towards pregnancy on postnatal depression was possibly mediated by bonding failure. Postnatal depression and bonding failure are correlated with different risk factors and run rather independently over the course of the puerperium. Postnatal depression may be predicted by bonding failure.

AB  - The financial crisis has brought about dramatic consequences for economies and societies. Questions emerge about responsibility for the crisis and, implicitly or explicitly irresponsibility; the obligations to take responsibility for the costs and other adverse effects of the recession; and the nature of responsibility for social welfare and business probity in future national and global governance. This paper explores how UK financial and ethical media construct i) the financial sector's social ir/responsibility in the context of the financial crisis and resultant recession, and ii) the motivation and means of the sector and other actors to respond to their adverse social impacts. Four discourses emerge from our analysis providing insights into distinct types of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and their relationship with corporate social irresponsibility (CSI), attitudinal change and expectations of the change required to ensure a more responsible financial sector. Findings reveal tension in the discourses concerning the sector's ability to "heal itself'. Questions of accountability and of the capacity and reliability of CSR are common to all discourses. The discourses identified provide clear insights into distinctive diagnoses and prescriptions for ir/responsibility in the financial sector. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Morality is an abstract consideration, and language is an important regulator of abstract thought. In instances of moral ambiguity (e.g., ethically ambiguous business practices), individuals may pay particular attention to matters of interactional justice (i.e., how consumers are treated with politeness and dignity by the brand in question). Politeness in language has been linked to greater perceptions of social distance, which we contend is instrumental in regulating attitudes toward a brand. We posit that politeness in a brand's advertising will impact consumers who are attuned to violations of interactional justice [i.e., those with low belief in a just world (BJW)]. In three studies, we demonstrate that the politeness used in advertising as well as consumers' individual differences in BJW affect judgments and attitudes toward brands. Specifically, individuals with a low just world belief are more likely to harbor negative attitudes towards a brand with ethically ambiguous business practices if the language used in advertising is impersonal (politer) than when the language used in advertising is personal (less polite). Importantly, for individuals with a low BJW, lowered trust due to the advertisement's language mediated the relationship between politeness and attitudes toward the brand. Theoretical and managerial implications of this research are discussed.

TI  - Misinformation on COVID-19 origin and its relationship with perception and knowledge about social distancing: A cross-sectional study
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Despite the vast scientific evidence obtained from the genomic sequencing of COVID-19, controversy regarding its origin has been created in the mass media. This could potentially have a long-term influence on the behavior among individuals, such as failure to comply with proposed social distancing measures, leading to a consequent rise in the morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19 infection. Several studies have collected information about knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding COVID-19; however, very little is known about the relationship of the perceptions of the individuals regarding the origin of the virus with the knowledge and perception about social distancing. This study aimed at ascertaining this relationship. For such purpose, a web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample population from five provinces of the Dominican Republic from June to July of 2020. The data collection instrument exploited in the study was a self-designed questionnaire distributed throughout different social media platforms. A purposive sampling strategy was implemented and a total of 1195 respondents completed the questionnaire. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS. Descriptive statistics, stepwise multiple linear regression, and one-way multivariate analysis were implemented to test the hypotheses. The level of education was significantly associated (P = .017) with individuals' perception about the origin of COVID-19, whilst only age (P = .032) and education level (P < .001) statistically significantly predicted 'knowledge about social distancing'. Perception of COVID-19 origin was statistically significant associated (P = < .001) with the measures of the dependent variables (knowledge and perception on social distancing). The present study has established a possible link between the 'perception of COVID-19 origin' and 'the perception and knowledge about social distancing'.

AB  - This study is among the first to cross-culturally compare the associations between social media use and emerging adults' drinking behavior in an accepting (Belgium) and comparatively restricted (USA) Western drinking culture. A cross-sectional survey was administered among 770 college students (n(USA) = 253, 24% male; n(Belgium) = 487, 34% male) aged 18-20 years. Structural equation modeling was used and demonstrated that the association between exposure to others' alcohol-related content on social media and drinking intentions operated similarly via more positive descriptive and injunctive norms for both populations, whereas the association between self-sharing and drinking intentions operated similarly via more positive attitudes. However, only among Belgian students was sharing alcohol references also related to drinking intentions through descriptive norms. Overall, this study points to the generalizability of attitudes and social norms as mechanisms of alcohol-related social media (self-)effects among emerging adult college students across Western drinking cultures.

AB  - Purpose - Notwithstanding a significant amount of literature on the technology acceptance model (TAM), past research has overlooked the role consumers' technology readiness (TR) plays in adoption of self-service technologies (SSTs). This study aims to fill this research gap by developing and testing a model that integrates the role of TR into the TAM.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study proposes a research framework to suggest the direct and moderating roles of TR in the TAM. Extant research from various research streams is reviewed, resulting in 13 hypotheses. Data collected from customers with SST experiences are examined through structural equation modeling (SEM) and hierarchical moderated regression analysis.
   Findings - Results indicate that customer TR enhances perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude toward use, and intention to use. Results also show that TR attenuates the positive relationship between perceived ease of use and attitude toward using SSTs.
   Research limitations/implications - This research represents an early attempt to explain the role of TR in the TAM in the context of SSTs. Future research directions are discussed, with emphasis on incorporating customer differences and situational factors to better understand this model in various service settings.
   Practical implications - Findings show that TR influences perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude toward using SSTs, and behavioral intentions. Therefore, to achieve better SST service outcomes firms implementing SSTs should give increased attention to customer TR. Firms should stimulate the use of technological services by strengthening positive TR drivers (the optimism and innovativeness dimensions) to encourage use of technological services and positive attitudes toward technology, while also reducing TR inhibitors (the discomfort and insecurity dimensions) to lower reluctance to use technology.
   Originality/value - This study is the first to integrate the role of TR into the TAM in the context of SSTs.

AB  - . The spatial interaction between rural and urban areas is intense in the Global South. While research into how this interaction influences livelihood opportunities is extensive, longitudinal identification and analysis of rural people's long-distance mobility is rudimentary. This is problematic given the possible repercussions of a greater flow of people for transport system management (congestion, emissions, investments, social exclusion, etc.). Based on longitudinal survey data from 1990 to 2008/2009, this article addresses this gap by exploring how the long-distance mobility behaviour of households and individuals has changed over a period of intensified ruralurban interaction in a rural Philippine area. The article furthermore addresses the individuals' mobility desires and restrictions related to long-distance travel. The results indicate that both accessibility effects and effects related to information and communication technology (ICT), concentration of activities and opportunities towards major cities, age, labour market, and economic situation. Over time, particularly since improved accessibility conditions have enabled much faster travelling, more people have come to travel more frequently (although a suppressed demand is still present and inequalities are considerable) to more distant destinations, major cities in particular, for mainly social motives. A recent countertrend is evident, partly arising from mobile phones replacing physical movement. The increase in private vehicle ownership has so far been slow, so modal choice is still highly sustainable. Overall, the findings support core ideas derived from the new economic geography, but also notes, with earlier studies in transport geography, that travel time is a prime consideration.

AB  - Using a survey of more than 5,000 American consumers, this study examines connections between attitudes toward same-sex marriage and media consumption. A positive attitude is predicted by being liberal and less religious, supporting gender and racial equality, willing to try anything once, considering television the primary form of entertainment, watching political talk shows, and reading blogs. The theoretical and methodological contributions and real-world implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Aim. This article's goal is to present the discourse concerning paid maternity leaves in the USA in major American media outlets between the years 2014 and 2018. It is an attempt to answer the question whether maternity, caregiving work or family values are contradictory to American work ethic and regulations of the labour market.
   Methodology. The work is devoted to content analysis of the four most popular American online media, both liberal and conservative. Their content search engines are used to find information and articles on paid maternity leaves and to group them into different categories.
   Results. Three main categories are distinguished in terms of the content of 302 articles, namely articles with a positive attitude towards paid maternity leaves (248 articles - 82.10%), articles with a negative attitude (20 articles - 6.60%), and neutral articles (34 - 11.30%). In general, Americans see the long-term benefits of paid maternity leaves, but they differ when it comes to the methods of their introduction.
   Conclusions. There is a conflict between maternity, family values, American work culture, and regulations of the labour market. In American society, individualism, competition, and masculinity of the business culture do not support the values of nurturing and caregiving.
   Originality. Except for the USA, there is no other country among OECD states which does not provide paid parental leaves for working mothers. Because of the fact that the United States is known to be one of the most developed countries in the world, this information may be considered worth-studying.

AB  - The coronavirus pandemic that struck the world in late 2019 continues to break records of new cases and deaths from the disease. Guidelines for clinical management of infected patients and prevention of new cases focus on measures to control symptoms, hygiene habits, social distancing, and decrease in human crowding. This forced a change in the way health services provide care, generating the incorporation of new health technologies. The Essay thus aims to compile and analyze experiences in the use of digital health technologies to minimize the impacts of COVID- 19. The authors identified the development of technological solutions for clinical management of patients, imaging diagnosis, use of artificial intelligence for risk analysis, geolocation apps, data analysis and reports, self-diagnosis, and even orientation for decision-making. The great majority of the initiatives listed here prove effective in minimizing the impacts of COVID-19 on health systems and aim to decrease human crowding and thus facilitate access to services, besides contributing to the incorporation of new health practices and modes of care.

AB  - Smoking is one of the more common preventable threats to public health, and it remains a serious cause of death around the world. Remarkably, the mean age of the onset of cigarette smoking is decreasing. Therefore, it is necessary to increase our knowledge concerning the attitude among high school students towards cigarette smoking. The present study sought to examine the associations among social anxiety, emotional intelligence, and attitudes towards cigarette smoking, and to examine emotional intelligence as a mediator between social anxiety and attitude towards cigarette smoking. The participants comprised 950 high school students who completed the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, Assessing Emotions Scale, and Attitudes Towards Cigarette Smoking Scale. Structural equation modelling analyses indicated that high levels of emotional intelligence are negatively associated with positive attitude towards cigarette smoking and social anxiety is associated with a positive attitude towards cigarette smoking in high school students. Emotional intelligence partially mediated the relationship between social anxiety and attitude towards cigarette smoking. These relationships varied as a function of gender.

AB  - Motivated by the growing practice of using social network data in credit scoring, we analyze the impact of using network -based measures on customer score accuracy and on tie formation among customers. We develop a series of models to compare the accuracy of customer scores obtained with and without network data. We also investigate how the accuracy of social network -based scores changes when consumers can strategically construct their social networks to attain higher scores. We find that those who are motivated to improve their scores may form fewer ties and focus more on similar partners. The impact of such endogenous tie formation on the accuracy of consumer scores is ambiguous. Scores can become more accurate as a result of modifications in social networks, but this accuracy improvement may come with greater network fragmentation. The threat of social exclusion in such endogenously formed networks provides incentives to low-type members to exert effort that improves everyone's creditworthiness. We discuss implications for managers and public policy.

AB  - Background: News media coverage is a powerful influence on public attitude and government action. The digitization of news media covering the current opioid epidemic has changed the landscape of coverage and may have implications for how to effectively respond to the opioid crisis.
   Objective: This study aims to characterize the relationship between volume of online opioid news reporting and opioid-related deaths in the United States and how these measures differ across geographic and socioeconomic county-level factors.
   Methods: Online news reports from February 2018 to April 2019 on opioid-related events in the United States were extracted from Google News. News data were aggregated at the county level and compared against opioid-related death counts. Ordinary least squares regression was used to model opioid-related death rate and opioid news coverage with the inclusion of socioeconomic and geographic explanatory variables.
   Results: A total of 35,758 relevant news reports were collected representing 1789 counties. Regression analysis revealed that opioid-related death rate was positively associated with news reporting. However, opioid-related death rate and news reporting volume showed opposite correlations with educational attainment and rurality. When controlling for variation in death rate, counties in the Northeast were overrepresented by news coverage.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that regional variation in the volume of opioid-related news reporting does not reflect regional variation in opioid-related death rate. Differences in the amount of media attention may influence perceptions of the severity of opioid epidemic. Future studies should investigate the influence of media reporting on public support and action on opioid issues.

AB  - Political participation is a prerequisite for democracy. Therefore, political sociologists have advised to socialize people by encouraging political participation from a young age onward. Parents are one of the most important political socialization agents, especially at a young age. Although the intergenerational transmission of political attitudes has been studied quite intensively, the transmission of the political participation intention has been neglected. This study explores the effect of both mothers' and fathers' political activity on their offspring's intention to participate. Using a data set from 2085 Belgian parent child triads, we tested the direct and indirect transmission of political participation intention. We found that although there is a direct transmission of political participation intention, after controlling for political discussion, political interest and socio-economic status, this effect is completely mediated. Therefore, we conclude that intergenerational transmission is an indirect process, supported by a high socio-economic status, more political interest and a more politicized family environment in which politics is clearly perceived as salient.

Therefore, this study used mobile technology, namely Ubiquitous Geometry (UG), to merge authentic contexts into learning activities and investigate the influence of authentic contextual learning (ACL) on students' and parents' perceptions. This is because parents inevitably have an effect on students' learning at home, which has not been clearly addressed in past studies. This study investigated students' and parents' perceptions in terms of technological and pedagogical aspects of the implementation of ACL supported by UG while learning at home. We conducted one experiment on 20 fifth-grade students and their parents. In the students' acceptance model, the results indicated that students' ease of use and usefulness significantly influenced their positive attitude toward ACL supported by UG, and the positive attitude also significantly influenced intention to continue using our proposed system in both the technological and pedagogical aspects. In the mutual influence between students' and parents' acceptance model, it was found that parents significantly influenced their children's perceptions of ACL at home. In the mediation analysis, we found parents' ease of use and intention to use could mediate the relation between students' positive attitude and intention to use in the pedagogical aspect. From the interview, we found that parents thought that the learning activity in authentic contexts was useful and encouraged their children to do more engagement. However, in the technological aspect of the mutual influence between students' and parents' acceptance model, no mediation existed. This might be because parents worried their children were overusing mobile devices.

AB  - Nativism is one of the defining phenomena of the contemporary era. Yet, we know little about how malleable citizen attitudes associated with nativism and nationalism are to priming effects when media frames which deal with key issues such as immigration are introduced. In this article, we present the findings from a survey experiment fielded to a nationally representative sample of voters in Australia in May 2019. In it, we explore whether the attitudes of voters for different political parties can be primed by introducing two contrasting media frames to measure these effects. We find positive and negative frames have no effect on the attitudes of voters for Australia's populist radical right party, but that the former has an effect on centre-right voters in Australia. Such findings have important implications for our understanding of political communication and the malleability of political attitudes.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries implemented social distancing measures to contain virus transmission. However, these vital safety measures have the potential to impair mental health or wellbeing, for instance, from increased perceived loneliness. Playing social video games may offer a way to continue to socialize while adhering to social distancing measures. To examine this issue further, the present online survey investigated social gaming during the pandemic and its association to perceived loneliness within a German-speaking sample. Results indicated a small positive correlation between general gaming frequency and perceived loneliness. Detailed analysis revealed a negative association between perceived loneliness and increased social forms of video gaming. Specifically, gamers with a higher social motive for gaming perceived less loneliness, but gamers with a dominant escape motive demonstrated a positive link to perceived loneliness. The use of social gaming in times of social distancing seems to play a small but significant factor in perceived loneliness compared to other demographical data. The findings are discussed with respect to methodological limitations, effect sizes, and sample characteristics. The results enrich the current knowledge on video gaming and its link to social wellbeing and provide a more nuanced picture than simplistic investigations of screen time.

AB  - Empirical insights on the attitudinal correlates of direct democracy are inconclusive. On the one hand, direct democracy bears a conceptual resemblance with populist ideas. On the other hand, participatory democrats advocate the use of direct democracy precisely on grounds that it promises to educate citizens. This paper complements tests of arguments positing an educative potential of direct democracy with tests of its populist potential. We make use of original survey data collected in the German Bundeslander, which present a relatively underappreciated, yet interesting and representative case for studying direct democracy. Multilevel models indicate that political attitudes are neither more populist nor more supportive of the political system among citizens in direct democratic contexts. The story is more complicated though as the relationship between direct democracy and populist attitudes is conditional on the ideological orientation of a citizen.

AB  - This qualitative study investigates the contemporary landscape of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) politics and activism, specifically the concept and identities of "straight allies." Through in-depth interviews with 13 individuals who identify as straight allies, we explore how these heterosexuals engage in LGBT politics and activist cultures. We take a grounded theory approach to data analysis, through which the concept of "passive" and "active" activism emerges as a framework to understand these allies' meaning-making practices, as well as how they negotiate the emotional, interpersonal, life-historical, and mass-mediated complexities of being straight allies when interacting with LGBT communities and engaging in pro-LGBT politics. We draw upon Thompson's (2005) theory of ontological choreography to posit "identity choreography" as way to describe and make sense of the heterogeneous knowledges and experiences our participants use to constitute their straight ally identities and to evaluate others' ally identities and activisms. Implications for future research on LGBT politics and straight allies, particularly in terms of education, attitude change, and activism, are discussed.

AB  - Objectives To investigate the knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes towards pediatric dental radiography and its associated factors among Turkish parents seeking dental care for their children. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 483 parents of children aged 6-15 years. Data were collected using the questionnaire including socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes based on The Health Belief Model and planned behavior theory. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate statistics were performed. Results More than half of parents had correct knowledge on their rights to access health information, the radiation risk and exposure from dental X-rays, children's vulnerability to radiation, and using lead apron. Most parents (70.4%) perceived dental X-rays as valuable. They had limited knowledge regarding the permanent damage and negative attitudes regarding its safety and goodness. There were positive correlations between knowledge-attitudes, knowledge-perceived benefits, and attitudes-perceived benefits (all p values < 0.01). Having a previous dental X-ray (p = 0.014) and not having parents' information needs (p = 0.007) were associated with higher attitudes. Increasing education levels, having a educational need and higher perceived benefit were found to be predictors of higher parental knowledge. Conclusion Turkish parents had some knowledge and positive attitudes towards pediatric dental X-rays but not at optimum levels. Parents' education levels, information needs, and beliefs were the most important factors affecting parental knowledge. Attitudes towards radiation safety and goodness should be improved.

AB  - The Covid-19 outbreak was declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization in January 2020. As a consequence, several protective measures were urged by national governments in order to limit the spread of the pandemic. Drawing on the literature on health behaviours, in the present study, we investigated the psychological factors (i.e., attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioural control, intentions, and risk perception) that were associated with two highly recommended behaviours: frequent hand washing and social distancing (i.e., staying at home except for essential reasons). The study employed a correlational design with a follow-up. A questionnaire including measures of psychological predictors was administered via social media to a sample of 403 adults residing in Italy during the lockdown. Self-reported behaviours were assessed one week later. Findings showed that attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioural control were significantly related to hand washing and social distancing through intentions. Risk perception was a significant predictor of social distancing but not of hand washing. These findings suggest that intervention and communication strategies aimed at encouraging preventive measures during the Covid-19 pandemic should be organized taking into account multiple factors which partially differ depending on the type of behaviour considered.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has become a major public health challenge globally with countries of the world adopting unprecedented infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to urgently curtail the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of the people toward COVID-19 is critical to understanding the epidemiological dynamics of the disease and the effectiveness, compliance and success of IPC measures adopted in a country. This study sought to determine the levels of KAP toward COVID-19 among residents of north-central Nigeria. A cross-sectional online survey with a semi-structured questionnaire using a Snowball sampling technique was conducted during the national lockdown. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson's correlation and regression tests. From a total of 589 responses received, 80.6, 59.6, 90.4 and 56.2% were from respondents between ages 18-39 years, males, had a college (Bachelor) degree or above and reside in urban areas respectively. Respondents had good knowledge (99.5%) of COVID-19, gained mainly through the internet/social media (55.7%) and Television (27.5%). The majority of the respondents (79.5%) had positive attitudes toward the adherence of government IPC measures with 92.7, 96.4 and 82.3% practicing social distancing/self-isolation, improved personal hygiene and using face mask respectively. However, 52.1% of the respondents perceived that the government is not doing enough to curtail COVID-19 in Nigeria. Pearson's correlation showed significant relationship between knowledge of COVID-19 and attitude towards preventive measures (r = 0.177, p = 0.004, r = 0.137, p = 0.001). Although 61.8% of the respondents have no confidence in the present intervention by Chinese doctors, only 29.0% would accept COVID-19 vaccines when available. This study recorded good knowledge and attitudes among participants, however, community-based health campaigns are necessary to hold optimistic attitudes and practice appropriate intervention measures devoid of misconceptions.

AB  - In English language teaching settings, the type of lecture is important since students should be exposed to instantly recognisable linguistic features in the target language through interaction. This quasi-experimental study was designed to compare the effectiveness of PowerPoint presentations (PPP) and conventional lecture/discussion sessions on the pedagogical content knowledge of the student-teachers of English. PPP were used in the experimental group and conventional lecture/discussion sessions were employed in the control group (CG). The findings revealed that the treatment process was effective on both groups, but the CG achieved better in the post-test. Following the treatment process, the efficiency of the applications was also tested by means of a questionnaire. The CG reflected more positive attitudes towards the conventional lecture/discussion in terms of the quality of instructional strategies, academic language use, professional development, professional perception and problem-solving.

AB  - Human capital theory presumes that skill-accredited immigrant professionals can access positions in the labour market to match their skills and qualifications. It implies that employers have little power to influence the labour market outcomes of immigrant professionals. Using social identity theory, we examine the influence of similarity effect in recruitment decision-making involving immigrant information technology (IT) professionals in New South Wales, Australia. We assess how decision makers (N=331) hiring IT professionals need to associate and identify with people that resemble themselves in some way more than those that do not, can influence their perception of the immigrant candidate's fit into their organisation. Particularly, we examine how the level of exposure to diversity, the decision maker's origin and the diversity of clientele can moderate the assessment of the candidate's fit to the organisation. We also assess how attire, name, accent and any overtly expressed religious affiliations influence employer perceptions. The findings indicate decision makers with lower levels of exposure to diversity or working in organisations with mostly Anglo clients tend to be more concerned of the fit regarding the Indians, South-east Asians and the Chinese. They were also more likely to be negatively influenced by the non-Anglo personal attributes.

AB  - Background: The legalization of medical and recreational cannabis is a topic of continued debate in countries around the world. It has been suggested that medical cannabis legalization influences cannabis legalization for recreational purposes through increased media attention toward the positive health effects of cannabis. However, the nature of media coverage is likely to vary across mass media and online sources (internet and social media). In addition, effects of information engagement on attitudes may vary depending on whether information was actively sought or obtained incidentally during patterns of regular media use (scanned).
   Methods: This study uses data from an online survey of Israeli adults (N = 554) to test the association between information seeking and scanning about medical cannabis (from mass media and online sources) and attitudes toward medical cannabis. Furthermore, we test indirect effects of media engagement on attitudes toward cannabis legalization through medical cannabis attitudes.
   Results: Seeking and scanning for information about medical cannabis from online sources, but not from mass media sources, were associated with positive attitudes toward medical cannabis. Engagement with medical cannabis information from online sources was also indirectly associated with greater support for cannabis legalization, through positive attitudes related to medical cannabis.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that one mechanism through which medical cannabis legalization is associated with cannabis legalization for all purposes is public engagement with information about medical cannabis in the media, particularly from the internet and social media channels. As increasingly more jurisdictions are expected to legalize medical cannabis, with resulting increase in media attention, support for recreational cannabis legalization may be expected to grow.

AB  - Objectives To answer four questions: What are attitudes, knowledge and social norms around sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs)? What are current levels of trust in messages on SSBs? What is current support for, and perceived effectiveness of, the UK soft drinks industry levy (SDIL)? What is the association between attitudes, knowledge, social norms, trust, SSB consumption and sociodemographic factors; and support for, and perceived effectiveness of, the SDIL?
   Design Cross-sectional online survey.
   Setting UK.
   Participants UK respondents to the 2017 International Food Policy Study aged 18-64 years who provided information on all variables of interest (n=3104).
   Outcome measures Self-reported perceived effectiveness of, and support for, the SDIL.
   Results Most participants supported the SDIL (70%), believed it would be effective (71%), had a positive attitude to SSBs (62%), had knowledge of the link between SSBs and obesity (90%), and trusted messages from health experts (61%), but not those from the food and beverage industry (73%). Nearly half (46%) had negative social norms about drinking SSBs. In adjusted models, older age, non-consumption of SSBs, social norms to not drinks SSBs, knowledge of the link between SSBs and obesity and trust in health expert messages were associated with greater support for the SDIL, whereas having dependent children and trusting messages from the food and beverage industry were associated with less support. In adjusted models, older age was associated with lower perceived effectiveness of the SDIL, whereas social norms to not drink SSBs, negative attitudes to SSBs and trusting messages from health experts and the food and beverage industry were associated with greater perceived effectiveness.
   Conclusions There was strong support for the SDIL and belief that it would be effective. Those with more 'public health' orientated norms and trust were generally more likely to support the SDIL or believe that it would be effective.

AB  - Background HIV stigma has well-documented negative impacts on HIV testing, transmission risk behavior, initiation of and adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and retention in care. We sought to assess the extent to which anticipated HIV stigma is based on misperceptions of normative attitudes toward persons with HIV, and to determine whether persons with HIV have stronger misperceptions compared with HIV-negative persons or persons of unknown serostatus. We also sought to estimate the association between normative attitudes about persons with HIV and personal attitudes about persons with HIV, and to determine the extent to which anticipated stigma mediates this association.
   Methods We conducted a whole-population survey of 1776 persons living in 8 rural villages in southwestern Uganda. Negative attitudes toward persons with HIV, and anticipated stigma, were measured using a newly validated 15-item scale measuring multiple dimensions of HIV stigma, including social distance, blaming attitudes, and concerns about reciprocity. We used multivariable regression to estimate the association between normative attitudes about persons with HIV and personal attitudes toward persons with HIV, and to determine the extent to which perceptions of normative attitudes (anticipated stigma) mediated this association.
   Results Study participants believed that negative attitudes toward persons with HIV were more pervasive than they actually are. Perceptions of the extent to which these negative attitudes are normative mediated more than one-third of the association between normative attitudes and their personal attitudes. In contrast to what we originally hypothesized, persons with HIV were less likely to misperceive these norms and perceived normative attitudes to be less stigmatizing than did others in the general population.
   Conclusions Interventions designed to accurately describe normative attitudes toward persons with HIV may reduce HIV stigma without directly focusing on the educational components that are typically embedded in anti-stigma interventions.

AB  - The current study tested the extent to which intergroup contact reduces social dominance orientation (SDO), producing secondary transfer effects. Participants were first-year undergraduate students randomly assigned to live with either a same-race roommate or a roommate of a different race in university housing. Participants completed a feeling thermometer and a measure of SDO at the beginning and end of the fall semester. Participants in interracial rooms reported lower levels of SDO and more positive attitudes toward secondary groups (i.e., racial/ethnic groups other than their roommates' group) than participants in same-race rooms at the end of the semester. Those in interracial rooms exhibited a significant change in SDO levels and attitudes across time, whereas those in same-race rooms exhibited no change. Furthermore, SDO fully mediated the effect of intergroup contact on attitudes toward secondary groups. These findings provide causal evidence of secondary transfer effects and indicate SDO as an underlying mechanism.

TI  - Attitude of Students in Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Toward Donation After Cardiac Death
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS
LA  - English
AB  - Background. This study aimed to investigate the attitude of students at Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine toward organ transplantation and donation after cardiac death (DCD).
   Material and Methods. A questionnaire including 16 single-choice questions about organ transplantation and donation was designed, and a survey was conducted using this questionnaire on 300 randomly selected respondents at Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.
   Results. The ratio of male to female was 1:2.4. Of the participants, 98.1% had heard of organ transplantation, and 68.2% had received the information through network news. Only 10.6% expressed a positive attitude toward organ transplantation in China. Further, 39.8% of the participants were willing to donate their organs after death, while 51.9% of the participants hesitated because of perceived opacity in how donated organs were used. Even among those who did not share this concern, only 46.2% considered it. However, 80.7% were in favor of organ donation between relatives. Separately, 67.4% and 60.2% of the participants were interested in participating in activities and publicity related to organ donation, respectively.
   Conclusions. A majority of the participants had an understanding of organ transplantation and had obtained this information through media. Most showed a positive attitude toward donation between relatives, but only some of them indicated willingness to donate their organs. Generally, acceptance and awareness of organ transplantation need to be improved. Media outreach and education might have a profound influence.

AB  - This study was conducted to conceptualise advertising value and consumer attitudes towards advertisements. The research was developed to reveal the effect of the source of advertisements on credibility perception through the theoretical framework of Ducoffe's (1995) advertising value model. The research objective is to identify source derogation in terms of credibility to create advertising value and a positive attitude towards advertisements launched through the Facebook social network. In this regard, the study used three distinct sources to generate and introduce product promotional messages: an associative reference group, an aspirational reference group and marketers themselves. This research revealed significant differences in developing advertisement value and forming a favourable attitude towards advertisements when the product-related message was developed by these three distinct groups, who have different source derogations.

AB  - Introduction: We assessed the knowledge of and attitudes toward HIV/AIDS and antiretroviral therapy (ART) in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA).
   Methodology: A descriptive, cross-sectional study design was employed. A structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was administered to consecutive, consenting PLWHA who had been receiving treatment for a minimum of three months. The level of ART adherence was calculated manually for each respondent.
   Results: In total 318 PLWHA completed the questionnaire. The mean and median time on ART was 17.8 months and 19 months respectively. The mean age of the respondents was 39.1 +/- 9.6 years. The majority of these respondents (76.9%) had completed secondary education. Over 80% of the respondents reported knowing that HIV can be transmitted through blood transfusions and unprotected sexual intercourse. Seventy-six per cent of the respondents reported knowing that ART suppresses HIV activity. However, 33% of the respondents denied being HIV positive, while 22.6% reported that they felt that taking ART was shameful. Over 32% of the respondents reported that good adherence to ART would raise suspicions about their HIV status, and 66.7% had not yet disclosed their HIV status to anyone. Most (77.7%) respondents had good knowledge of HIV/AIDS while 75.2% had good knowledge of ART. Also 78.9% had positive attitude to HIV/AIDS while 73.9%) had positive attitude to ART. Respondents with good knowledge about HIV/AIDS and a positive attitude about the disease tended to be more adherent to ART (p<0.01).
   Conclusions: The majority of respondents had good knowledge of and a positive attitude toward HIV/AIDS and ART adherence.

AB  - Examinations of the relationship between attitudes about police and news media have regularly been undertaken since the Rodney King incident in 1991. Although cultivation theory, which argues greater news consumption will result in adoption of views of policing provided in the news, offers an appropriate theoretical framework for media studies of this kind, this body of research has largely lacked theoretical grounding. This study tests underlying premises of cultivation regarding the roles of overall news consumption, consumption of different types of news mediums, and exposure to negative news coverage in determining public perceptions of common policing outcomes. It also tests the mostly neglected area of how audiences perceive news they are consuming by considering how fair they deem the news portrayal of police to be. Using a sample of residents from a mid-sized city in California, results indicate consumption of Internet news is related to negative attitudes about police and exposure to negative news about police impacts perceptions, but only if the coverage is seen as fair. Implications for future research and advancement of cultivation as a theoretical framework in this area are discussed.

AB  - Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) contribute to increased length of hospital stay, higher mortality and higher health-care costs. Prevention and control of HAIs is a critical public health concern. This study assessed the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of standard infection control precautions among health-care workers (HCWs) in Qassim, Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional online survey among HCWs was conducted using a structured questionnaire. Predictors of KAP were investigated using multivariate logistic regression analyses and independent sample t-tests. A total of 213 HCWs participated in the survey. The prevalence of good (& GE;80% correct response) knowledge, attitude, and practice were 67.6%, 61.5%, and 73.2%, respectively. The predictors of good knowledge included the age of the HCWs (> 34 years) (adjusted odds ratio: 30.5, p < 0.001), and training (13.3, p < 0.001). More than 6 years of work experience was a significant predictor of having a positive attitude (5.5, p < 0.001). While the predictors of good practice were having > 6 years of experience (2.9, p < 0.01), previous exposure to HAIs (2.5, p < 0.05), and training (3.5, p < 0.01). However, being female (0.22, p < 0.001) and older (> 34 years) (0.34, p < 0.01) were negatively associated with knowledge. Results indicate that arranging training for HCWs might be useful in improving their knowledge of standard infection control precautions and is also expected to facilitate positive attitude and practice.

AB  - Intention to facilitate individual voluntary product recommendation in online social networking communities has attracted increased attention. However, it is not obvious why individuals recommend products in a community composed of non-transactional users. What are the critical factors influencing such a behavior? To attempt to provide insights into the product recommendation behavior in online social networking communities, we develop a model to investigate the effects of community atmospheric cues on affective social distance and subsequent product recommendations based on the stimulus-organism-response paradigm. By analyzing the results of a survey using a questionnaire, we found that community reciprocity and community receptivity have a direct influence on product recommendation, while community atmospheric cues have an indirect influence through affective social distance. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.

AB  - This research provides a new perspective to understand user participation in social media by focusing on the user-platform relationship. By drawing on the theory of psychological ownership, this study argues that the key to promoting user participation is to create feelings of ownership toward social media, as this signifies a strong psychological bond between users and the platform. The model was tested using a web-based survey with respondents that were recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Structural equation modeling analyses demonstrated that self-investment and perceived control positively influenced users' psychological ownership toward social media, which in turn increased user participation. However, unlike previous literature on psychological ownership, this study found a negative association between intimate knowledge, that is, the degree of acquaintance as well as the number of experiences with social media, and users' psychological ownership. The results further showed that the paths toward achieving a sense of psychological ownership varied according to the extent to which users interact with others whom they perceive to be psychologically close to themselves, which is referred to as social distance. The theoretical and managerial implications for social media practitioners are also discussed.

AB  - This study examines the dynamic, real-time interplay between the emotional content of political television ads and individuals' political attitudes during ad processing based upon the Dynamic Motivational Activation (DMA) theoretical framework. Time-series cross-sectional models were developed to test the effects of three motivational inputs of emotional ads (arousing content, positivity, and negativity) and viewers' evaluation of the featured candidates on four psychophysiological responses (heart rate, skin conductance level, corrugator electromyography, and zygomatic electromyography). As predicted by the DMA, physiological responses during ad viewing were affected by their own first- and second-order dynamic system feedback effects. These results not only support the predicted dynamic nature of the physiological system but also help disentangle message effects from the moderating and accumulating effects of the physiological system itself. Also as predicted, message motivational inputs interacted with viewers' political attitudes to determine psychophysiological responses to the ads. Supporters of opposing political candidates showed cardiac-somatic response patterns indicative of disparate attention to the advertised information. Attentional selectivity can be a critical component in determining how information processing influences campaign message reception and effects.

AB  - Grounded in construal-level theory (CLT), this experiment examines how messages with different temporal frames (i.e., present- vs. future-framed) influence individuals' perceptions of, and reactions to, water conservation. One hundred ninety-three participants, 99 from China and 94 from the United States, participated in this study. Results indicated that a present-framed message results in more positive attitudes toward water conservation than the future-framed message. Participants who scored higher on individual future-time orientation show stronger behavioral intention to conserve water than participants who scored lower. A significant interaction between temporal message framing and country emerged such that the future-framed message resulted in greater behavioral intention for Chinese participants than their U.S. counterparts whereas the present-framed message did not differentially influence Chinese and U.S. participants. Implications of findings for theory-building and application are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: Because of shortage of personnel for the Danish mammography screening programme, the aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes of radiologists and radiographers towards a future implementation of radiographers reading screening mammograms.
   Materials and methods: Seven combined phenomenological and hermeneutical interviews with radiographers and radiologists were performed. Stratified selection was used for sampling of informants. The interviews were analysed against theory about quality, organization and profession.
   Results: Quality related possibilities: radiographers do routinely measure the performance quality, radiographers obtain sufficient reading qualifications, and skill mix improves quality. Quality related obstacles: radiologists do not routinely measure performance quality. Organization related possibilities: shortage of radiologists, positive attitudes of managers, and improved working relations. Organization related obstacles: shortage of radiographers and negative attitudes of managers. Professional related possibilities: positive experience with skill mix. Professional related obstacles: worries about negative consequences for the training of radiologists, and resistance against handing over tasks to another profession.
   Conclusion: Attitudes towards radiographers reading screening mammograms are attached to either quality-, organisational or professional perspectives. Radiographers are capable of learning to read mammograms at sufficient performance level but routine measurement of performance quality is essential. Resistance against skill mix may be caused by an emotionally conditioned fear of losing demarcations. The main motive for skill mix is improvement of the utilization of resources. No evidence was found regarding the organisational and financial consequences of skill mix. Despite of this all radiologists and radiographers experienced with skill mix were strong advocates for reading radiographers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Public awareness is crucial for successful deployment of tidal energy, a renewable energy source that can provide clean electricity to remote islands. However, considering public attitudes on tidal energy are not well known, especially in developing countries, a barrier exists in implementing public engagement strategies. This study aims to contribute by identifying strategies for information provision-the initial step in public engagement-and estimate how these can be engaged to enhance support for tidal energy among the local public in a remote area of a developing country, in this case, Flores Timur Regency, Indonesia, considering their socio-cultural background. Methods In this paper, we employ statistical analyses using multinomial probit modelling to identify the key variables that shape information flow. The aptness of the variables is then verified using post-estimation techniques for their use as input parameters for the simulation of the information flow in the field study area. Agent-based simulation (ABS) is employed to replicate the actual conditions in Flores Timur Regency, Indonesia, and simulate the flow of information through the local community. Results According to the multinomial probit estimations, the people belonging to the top hierarchical group show a higher probability to support tidal energy compared to the members belonging to the lower groups. Understandably, around twice as many information flow cycles are needed to disseminate information to the members of the lowest hierarchical group, compared to the members of the top hierarchical group. The results also show that increasing the amount of available information has a positive impact on information dissemination. Conclusions This study demonstrated that information provision is highly effective with propagation of information that specifically highlights the individual benefits, rather than the community benefits of tidal energy. Additionally, savings in terms of costs, time, and efforts can be realized if the most influential members of the local community are targeted initially before including all other stakeholders. The study also indicated that locals absorb more information and increase their support for tidal energy when additional data is made available. Finally, as long-term strategy, information provision becomes most effective when the local population gains higher educational capabilities.

T2  - NPJ SCIENCE OF FOOD
LA  - English
AB  - sThis paper analyzes the awareness and attitudes of the Chinese public toward genetically modified (GM) foods with different types of labeling and evaluates the impact of public confidence in the government management of GM food labeling has on their attitude. From 2015 to 2016, we conducted a series of surveys to collect data from 1730 respondents, which included consumers, farmers, media, and local agricultural officials in agricultural departments. The results show similar to 60% of the Chinese public do not know that they usually consume or purchase GM products or products containing GM ingredients. Nearly 80% of the Chinese public are accepting foods labeled as not containing GM ingredients, 57% are accepting foods without labeling, and similar to 40% are accepting GM-labeled foods. The respondents with a lack of confidence in the government are less likely to embrace GM foods. Those that are more aware of GM products are more likely to accept GM labeled foods. The group having the most positive attitude toward GM-labeled foods is the media, followed by agricultural officials, while the group having the most negative attitude toward GM labeled foods is farmers. Our findings provide an empirical basis to inform GM food labeling policy discussions and possible revisions, which may promote the development of GM foods in China.

AB  - This paper offers a social phenomenological reading of the globally binding practice of 'social distancing' in light of the precautionary measures against the spreading of the Covid-19 virus. Amid speculation about the far-reaching effects of temporarily applicable measures and foresights about the advent of an ethos that has been heralded by the media as the 'new normal', the ubiquitous phenomenon of social distancing calls for a fundamental ontological elucidation. The purported hermeneutic that is situated in the broader place branding and experiential marketing literatures places Covid-19 in the shoes of Being, and, therefore, imagines how Being would behave ontologically if it were a virus. By arguing that the virus does operate like Being, five theses are put forward as experiential interpretive categories with regard to the ontological status of Covid-19. The adopted approach makes the following contributions to the extant literature: First, it addresses a wholly new phenomenon in place branding, namely a pre-branded place whose meaning is non-negotiable, globally applicable and seemingly equivalent to pure void. Second, it advances the application of phenomenological research in place branding and experiential consumption by highlighting the aptness of the so far peripheral (in the marketing discipline) strand of Heideggerian fundamental ontology. Third, it extends the meaning of place in the place branding literature, by showing how spatialization is the outcome of temporalization, in line with the adopted phenomenological perspective.

AB  - Despite evidence that stigma of disability is frequently reflected through stereotyping and often results in mental distress, very limited literature demonstrates the pathways through which stereotyping has an impact on mental health. Drawing from a large sample of 1449 participants interviewed between December 2012 and September 2013 from an Afghan community-based rehabilitation program, we examined the structure of stigma associated with disability in Afghanistan. Labeling and negative stereotypes, associated with a specific cause of disability, result in social exclusion that in turn impacts mental health. Using structural equation modeling with latent variables, we examined the mediation effect of stereotypes associated with disability on mental distress and anxiety. We found a mediating role of social exclusion between stereotypes and mental distress but only in the case of persons with disabilities from birth. Comparing the total effect of 'disabled at birth' and mental distress 0.195 (95% CI: 0.018-0.367) the effect size of this mediation effect was 0.293 (95% CI: 0.173-0.415). There was no significant direct effect between 'disabled at birth' and mental distress once mediation effect was accounted for in our model. These findings suggest that a multipronged policy approach that recognizes the driving forces of stigma and promotes social participation directly alongside psychosocial interventions on mental distress of persons with disabilities is necessary to achieve wellbeing for a group that has been historically and systematically excluded from development interventions.

AB  - Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often experience social marginalisation. This study uses a vignette-based design to clarify whether diagnostic disclosure affects social marginalisation in workplace contexts. It investigates two potential mediators of this relationship: affective response to and theory of mind for people with ASD. Participants (n = 170) read a description of a hypothetical co-worker with ASD traits, whose diagnosis was either disclosed or concealed. Providing a diagnostic label significantly reduced participants' desire to socially distance themselves from the target. This effect was mediated by positive affective responses. Diagnostic disclosure did not influence theory of mind for people with ASD but did increase tendencies to attribute primary emotions to the target; however, this did not relate to social distance outcomes.

AB  - COVID-19 had a major impact on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and it produced a crisis in Goal 4, which is aimed at ensuring quality education, among others. In this work, a university experience that aims to solve the challenges in this complicated context by means of BIM technology is presented. On the one hand, this study focuses on the development of teaching by means of active methodologies based on real projects through BIM models, using the latest information and communication technologies, and on the other hand, it focuses on the management of the education center by means of a virtual BIM building. This allowed for, among other things, tackling the sustainable management of the measures required to prevent contagion. These BIM models made it possible, for example, to optimize spaces while maintaining social distances between occupants, to simulate the best options for classroom ventilation, and to optimize special cleaning and disinfection resources. Students who developed their learning through these BIM virtual models were not restricted in receiving online classes; they learned to collaborate from anywhere in the world, acquiring skills that allow them to effectively face real situations that are as complicated as COVID-19.

AB  - This article systematically investigates the relationship between internet use and protests in authoritarian states and democracies. It argues that unlike in democracies, internet use has facilitated the occurrence of protests in authoritarian regimes, developing a theoretical rationale for this claim and substantiating it with robust empirical evidence. The article argues that whereas information could already flow relatively freely in democracies, the use of the internet has increased access to information in authoritarian regimes despite authoritarian attempts to control cyberspace. The article suggests this increased access to information positively affects protesting in authoritarian states via four complementary causal pathways: (1) by reducing the communication costs for oppositional movements; (2) by instigating attitudinal change; (3) decreasing the informational uncertainty for potential protesters; and (4) through the mobilizing effect of the spread of dramatic videos and images. These causal pathways are illustrated using anecdotal evidence from the Tunisian revolution (2010-2011). The general claim that internet use has facilitated the occurrence of protests under authoritarian rule is systematically tested in a global quantitative study using country-year data from 1990 to 2013. Internet use increases the expected number of protests in authoritarian states as hypothesized. This effect remains robust across a number of model specifications.

AB  - Objectives The aims of the present studies were to investigate the effect of interconnectedness in reducing stigmatization of people with mental illness and the ways compassion mediates the effect of interconnectedness on stigma. Methods Two studies were conducted using college students as participants. In study 1, path analysis was employed to investigate the associations between interconnectedness, compassion, and stigma among people with mental illness. In study 2, an experiment with three conditions (i.e., interconnectedness, compassion, and active control conditions) was conducted to investigate the effect of interconnectedness on stigma reduction. This study also attempted to investigate causally the mediating role of compassion on the effect of interconnectedness on stigma. Results Study 1 (n = 135) found that compassion significantly mediated the relationship between interconnectedness and social distance [beta = 0.09, 95% CI (0.03 to 0.24), p < 0.001] and interconnectedness and personal advocacy [beta = 0.14, 95% CI (0.10 to 0.35), p < 0.001]. Results of repeated measures ANOVA in study 2 (n = 157) found that induction of interconnectedness led to significantly lower social distance but no significant increase in personal advocacy for people with mental illness. No significant effect was found in the compassion condition. Results of path analysis showed that the interconnectedness condition resulted in a higher post-experimental compassion score, which in turn predicted a higher follow-up personal advocacy score 2 weeks later. The compassion condition, however, could not predict a higher post-experimental interconnectedness score. The mediation effect of compassion was supported. Conclusions The present study suggests that interconnectedness might reduce stigmatization of people with mental illness directly or through compassion.

AB  - Purpose Online social media has become an important marketing communication tool for entrepreneurs and their customers because of its ability to simplify various constraints in the communication process. Online social media allows entrepreneurs to access customers, suppliers, partners and other necessary resources that were not easily reachable before at significantly lower costs. Therefore, the current study aims to examine entrepreneurs' motivations, expected benefits and intentions to use online social media in an emerging market.
   Design/methodology/approach This study used a quantitative approach to investigate the entrepreneurs' online social media use behaviors. Data are collected from n = 368 entrepreneurial organizations using structured questionnaires and personal interviews. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) along with structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the hypothesized relationships in the conceptual model.
   Findings Results from the data analyses show that entrepreneurs' perceptions about efforts needed, performance expectations and various social influences helped explain a significant proportion of the variation in entrepreneurs' intentions to use online social media. All hypotheses tested in the study were confirmed.
   Research limitations/implications Efforts need to be spent on developing positive entrepreneurial attitudes toward online social media usage. As social media becomes more integrated with personal and business life, entrepreneurs need to use social networking sites to build relationships with existing customers or to reach new customers. A larger and more representative sample would have improved generalizability of the findings about entrepreneurial use of online social media. Future research studies should consider using additional independent measures to validate the study results.
   Practical implications This study contributes to the entrepreneurial literature by providing empirical evidence for the link between entrepreneurs' perceptions and attitudes about social media and their intentions to use it in an emerging market. Additionally, entrepreneurs need to expend more effort in understanding and effectively using social media and should develop positive attitudes toward online social media. Entrepreneurs' feelings, perceptions and efforts need to be nurtured through support from online social media providers, educational institutions and local chapters of business organizations (i.e. SBA, Chamber of Commerce) alike.
   Originality/value This research is one of the few studies that has attempted to examine the effects of various antecedent factors in the context of entrepreneurs' intentions to use online social media for business purposes in an emerging market. This study contributes to the entrepreneurial literature by providing empirical evidence for the link between entrepreneurs' perceptions and attitudes about social media and their intentions to use it in an emerging market. Additionally, this study contributes to our understanding about the role of social influences, effort and performance expectancies on the formation of entrepreneurial intentions to use social media.

AB  - Embracing sustainability in the 21st century entails developing environmental identity, so that attitudes towards energy sustainability result from the core values of one's individual and social identity. This study aims to explore the shift in the formation of environmental identity and attitudes towards energy sustainability throughout the course of the two-year study period (2018-2020). A dataset of 8,677,961 tweets, Facebook posts and comments and 325,228 news articles was collected to carry out quantitative analysis of the distribution of the posts, likes, and comments. A correlation with media coverage of energy and green topics was sought to establish the impact of the media on public debate. A qualitative analysis of posts and tweets was carried out to establish dominant themes. The findings of the study reveal that both positive attitudes towards energy sustainability and environmental identity have been consolidated throughout the two-year study period. Social media users are not only increasingly interested in green issues but also produce more reactions towards posts related to sustainability topics. The results also suggest that sustainable values and green behavior are independent from the media coverage of current events and the perceived threat to one's health from COVID-19. Social networking sites provide a context in which users not only reinforce their beliefs and values, but also mimic the behavior of other users, which leads to the formation of a social media identity bubble that reinforces shared identity-in this case, environmental identity. This study offers a multidisciplinary perspective on sustainable development that will be able to drive equitable energy security and environmental security.

AB  - Human beings have a strong fundamental need to form and maintain relationships. Social exclusion therefore evokes social pain in excluded individuals, whereas social inclusion evokes pleasure in those individuals who are included. The present study used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to investigate whether individual differences in personality, specifically differences in behavioral inhibition and activation system (BIS and BAS) functioning, affect the experiences of social pleasure and pain. Thirty-seven undergraduates participated in an MRS session that involved both social rejection and inclusion during an online ball-tossing game. People with greater BIS sensitivity experienced more social pain during social exclusion, while people with greater BAS sensitivity reported more social pleasure during social inclusion. BIS sensitivity was negatively correlated with ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) activity during social exclusion. Finally, VLPFC activity partially mediated the relationship between BIS sensitivity and social pain experienced during social exclusion. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecolabels are regarded as an exceptional marketing and advertising tool that informs contemporary consumers about the green traits of a product. They provide information that motivates consumers to exhibit a positive attitude and actual behavior towards a green product purchase. Despite the growing interest in the relationship between green attitude and the corresponding green purchase behavior, studies that investigate the influence of ecolabel features on this relationship are rather scarce. In the present study, a survey carried out in Greece with a sample of 571 participants, examined the direct and indirect effects of ecolabel credibility and ecolabel involvement on attitude and actual behavior about green product purchase. A multiple mediation model about green purchase behavior was developed. Results highlighted the crucial role of ecolabel credibility that positively influences attitude towards green product purchase as well as ecolabel involvement. Moreover, emphasis was given on the concepts of attitude towards green product purchase and ecolabel involvement that proved to be significant mediators of this model. Findings can provide useful guidance to green marketers so that they can generate effective strategies based of ecolabels and favor a positive attitude towards green product purchase that ultimately will enhance green product purchase behavior.

AB  - The study aims at establishing the benefits of actively utilizing the intangible resources of solid waste management customers in designing and implementing solid waste collection services, using the social media platforms. While Ghana generates high volumes of solid waste on a daily basis, less than half of it is effectively collected and disposed of. This calls for the adoption of innovative strategies to better connect and serve customers. Adopting a marketing approach to solid waste management has not been given much needed attention in Ghana and Africa, and this research sought to contribute in that direction. There is high usage of mobile telephony services in Ghana which a waste firm can explore to change negative attitude to waste disposal by the populace. Online co-creation is seen as a modern marketing approach leading to behavioral change in consumers. In this regard, the study looked at customer online co-creation in the solid waste collection sector in Ghana. The study adopted the survey strategy using structured questionnaire as the measure instrument, and data analyzed using both the structural equation model (SEM) and hierarchical multiple regression. The key findings are that customer intangible resources (online experience and skills) can be tapped by waste firms to co-create services that would generate positive attitude towards sanitation issues and the willingness to advocate the services and programs of the firm. Similarly, waste firms must invest in well-functioning and information rich digital platforms, and to devise innovative strategies to direct traffic to these platforms for effective customer participation.

AB  - Background: Research about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), its epidemiology and socio-economic impact on populations worldwide has gained attention. However, there is dearth of empirical knowledge in low-and middle income settings about the pandemic's impact on survivors, particularly the tension of their everyday life arising from the experiences and consequences of stigma, discrimination and social exclusion, and how they cope with these behavioral adversities. Methods: Realist qualitative approach drawing data from people clinically diagnosed positive of COVID-19, admitted into therapy in a designated treatment facility, and subsequently recovered and discharged for or without follow-up domiciliary care. In-depth interviews were conducted by maintaining a code book for identifying and documenting thematic categories in a progression leading to thematic saturation with 45 participants. Data were transcribed and coded deductively for broad themes at the start before systematically nesting emerging themes into the broad ones with the aid of NVivo 12 software. Results: Everyday lived experiences of the participants were disrupted with acts of indirect stigmatization (against relatives and family members), direct stigmatization (labeling, prejudices and stereotyping), barriers to realizing full social life and discriminatory behaviors across socio-ecological structures (workplace, community, family, and social institutions). These behavioral adversities were associated with self-reported poor health, anxiety and psychological disorders, and frustrations among others. Consequently, supplicatory prayers, societal and organizational withdrawal, aggressive behaviors, supportive counseling, and self-assertive behaviors were adopted to cope and modify the adverse behaviors driven by misinformation and fearful perceptions of the COVID-19 and its contagious proportions. Conclusion: In the face of the analysis, social campaigns and dissemination of toolkits that can trigger behavior change and responsible behaviors toward COVID-19 survivors are proposed to be implemented by health stakeholders, policy and decision makers in partnership with social influencers, the media, and telecoms.

AB  - Public attitude surveys are the prime method used to assess public attitudes to science and technology, but can also be very problematic-as evidenced in the number of different polls that come up with different findings. Toward better understanding of what drives public attitudes, it has become more relevant to find out "Why" people think what they do about science and technology than to know "What" they think. Recent research into how values drive attitudes has been very important to our increased understanding. However, in a post-truth, post-trust, post-expert world-where notions of truth, trust, and expertise are now commonly contested-we need to also better understand the social and media environments we are now living in, and how they affect attitudes to new technologies.

AB  - BackgroundThe patient perspective on the use of screening for high risks of adverse health outcomes in Emergency Department (ED) care is underexposed, although it is an important perspective influencing implementation in routine care. This study explores the experiences with, and attitudes towards geriatric screening in routine ED care among older people who visited the ED.MethodsThis was a qualitative study using individual face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Interviews were conducted in older patients (>= 70years) who completed the 'Acutely Presenting Older Patient' screener while visiting the ED of a Dutch academic hospital. Purposive convenience sampling was used to select a heterogeneous sample of participants regarding age, disease severity and the result from screening. Transcripts were analyzed inductively using thematic analysis.ResultsAfter 13 interviews (7 women, median age 82years), data saturation was reached. The participants had noticed little of the screening administration during triage and screening was considered as a normal part of ED care. Most participants believed that geriatric screening contributes to assessing older patients holistically, recognizing geriatric problems early and comforting patients with communication and attention. None of the participants had a negative attitude towards screening or thought that screening is discrimination on age. Care providers should communicate respectfully with frail older patients and involve them in decision-making.ConclusionsOlder patients experienced geriatric screening as a normal part of ED care and had predominantly positive attitudes towards its use in the ED. This qualitative study advocates for continuing the implementation of geriatric screening in routine ED practice.

AB  - Background. There has been an increase in the number of patients waiting for organ transplantation.
   Methods. A questionnaire on knowledge and attitude toward organ donation was completed by 434 allied health students.
   Results. Overall knowledge about the various aspects of organ donation was adequate and was higher among women and clinical students. Although the majority were willing to be living donors for their families, very few students supported deceased organ donation, and even fewer of them had thought about an organ donation card. Despite the good knowledge, an overall positive attitude toward deceased donation was held by only 44% of the students. In contrast, the attitude toward directed living organ donation to family members was favorable in 83.1% of the respondents, which seems to be influenced by cultural and sociodemographic factors. Our findings indicate that the most frequent cause of refusal to donate organs among students with negative attitudes was the mistrust of medical staff regarding brain death diagnosis (49.9%), followed by bodily concerns (18.1%) and religion (9.9%). Quite a few of our respondents supported commercial donation, which was attributed to the less knowledgeable groups. Respondents who were willing to donate organs indicated that the reason was for helping others and sympathy. This study identified that the main source of information about organ donation for the respondents was television, followed by relatives/friends and the internet.
   Conclusions. The misconception of the students toward deceased donation needs to be improved by integrating the concepts of brain death within the curriculum of allied health students.

We investigated relations among health anxiety, fear of missing out (FOMO) on rewarding social experiences from social distancing, and consequential levels of problematic smartphone use (PSU) and gaming disorder (GD). We surveyed a broad sample of 812 U.S. and Canadian participants during the pandemic, in late-May 2020, using the Short Health Anxiety Inventory, FOMO Scale, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and GD test. Significant bivariate relationships were found among health anxiety, FOMO, PSU, and GD severity. Using structural equation modeling, FOMO mediated relations between health anxiety and both PSU and GD severity. We discuss FOMO as an important variable explaining problematic digital technology use to compensate for unmet social needs from social distancing. We discuss these findings within the context of the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution theoretical model of problematic internet use. Results offer novel insight into the role of health anxiety on FOMO from unmet social needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, and consequential problematic internet use.

AB  - Background: HIV infection is a significant independent risk factor for both severe COVID-19 presentation at hospital admission and in-hospital mortality. Available information has suggested that people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) could benefit from COVID-19 vaccination. However, there is a dearth of evidence on willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination among PLWHA.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination among a national sample of PLWHA in China.
   Methods: This cross-sectional online survey investigated factors associated with willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination among PLWHA aged 18 to 65 years living in eight conveniently selected Chinese metropolitan cities between January and February 2021. Eight community-based organizations (CBOs) providing services to PLWHA facilitated the recruitment. Eligible PLWHA completed an online survey developed using a widely used encrypted web-based survey platform in China We fitted a single logistic regression model to obtain adjusted odds ratios (aORs), which involved one of the independent variables of interest and all significant background variables. Path analysis was also used in the data analysis.
   Results: Out of 10,845 PLWHA approached by the CBOs, 2740 completed the survey, and 170 had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. This analysis was performed among 2570 participants who had never received COVID-19 vaccination. Over half of the participants reported willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination (1470/2570, 57.2%). Perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination were significantly associated with willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination, including positive attitudes (aOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.09-1.12; P<.001), negative attitudes (aOR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.97; P<.001), perceived support from significant others (perceived subjective norm; aOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.46-1.61; P<.001), and perceived behavioral control (aOR 1.13, 95% CI 1.11-1.14; P<.001). At the interpersonal level, receiving advice supportive of COVID-19 vaccination from doctors (aOR 1.99, 95% CI 1.65-2.40; P<.001), CBO staff (aOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.51-2.36; P<.001), friends and/or family members (aOR 3.22, 95% CI 1.93-5.35; P<.001), and PLWHA peers (aOR 2.38, 95% CI 1.85-3.08; P<.001) was associated with higher willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination. The overall opinion supporting COVID-19 vaccination for PLWHA on the internet or social media was also positively associated with willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination (aOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.31-1.94; P<.001). Path analysis indicated that interpersonal-level variables were indirectly associated with willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination through perceptions ((3=.43, 95% CI .37-.51; P<.001).
   Conclusions: As compared to PLWHA in other countries and the general population in most parts of the world, PLWHA in China reported a relatively low willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination. The internet and social media as well as interpersonal communications may be major sources of influence on PLWHA's perceptions and willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination.

AB  - Studies have been conducted on university students' continuous intention to learn online from the perspectives of learning motivation and capability, perceptions or attitudes, and online learning experiences. However, few have examined how the above factors will relate to each other and contribute to students' online learning intention. This research explored 94 university students' online learning attitudes and experiences in a blended course. The researchers investigated the changes in the participants' attitudes toward online learning and the relationships between their self-regulated learning capability, online interactions, attitudes, and online learning intention. These students participated in a pre- and post-survey at the beginning and end of the course. They also completed six weekly reports commenting on their learning activities of the week. At the end of the course, interviews were administered to eight participants to gather detailed information about their online learning experiences. It was found that (a) the participants' online learning attitudes were generally positive and increased when completing the course; and (b) the participants' continuous intention to learn online was significantly predicted by four self-regulatory factors and attitudes, mediated through perceived online social interactions. The analysis of the interviewees' further comments provided more insights about the potential factors contributing to their online learning attitude changes. The strategies for future online course design with a view of improving students' self-regulated learning skills are discussed in this paper.

AB  - In this article, promotion is an institutionally mediated effort to bolster or redirect a person's health, strength, and other assets to build resilience. We analyse a Swedish version of the Life in Action promotion programme used in secondary schools in three municipalities. Focusing on types of alienation as framed in the programme, we argue that Life in Action's treatment of the psyche as an object in need of conscious monitoring, nurturing, and enhancement of qualities such as positive attitude and self-discipline signals the teenage participants' required alienation. Concluding the article, we discuss how this type of alienation may already be present in participating students, and also how it may be necessary for young people about to enter work-life in the era of late capitalism.

AB  - Aim/Purpose This paper investigates the influence of university student multitasking on their learning success, defined as students' learning satisfaction and performance.
   Background Most research on student multitasking finds student multitasking problematic. However, this research is generally from 2010. Yet, today's students are known to be digital natives and they have a different, more positive, relationship with mobile technologies. Based on the old findings, most instructors ban mobile technology use during instruction, and design their online courses without regard for the mobile technology use that happens regardless of their ban. This study investigates whether today's instructors and learning management system interface designers should take into account multitasking with mobile technologies.
   Methodology A quasi-experimental design was used in this study. Data were collected from 117 students across two sections of an introductory Management Information Systems class taught by the first author. We took multiple approaches and steps to control for confounding factors and to increase the internal validity of the study. We used a control group as a comparison group, we used a pre-test, we controlled for selection bias, and we tested for demographic differences between groups.
   Contribution With this paper, we explicated the relationship between multitasking and learning success. We defined learning success as learning performance and learning satisfaction. Contrary to the literature, we found that multitasking involving IT texting does not decrease students' learning performance. An explanation of this change is the change in the student population, and the digital nativeness between 2010s and 2020 and beyond.
   Findings Our study showed that multitasking involving IT texting does not decrease students' performance in class compared to not multitasking. Secondly, our study showed that, overall, multitasking reduced the students' learning satisfaction despite the literature suggesting otherwise. We found that attitude towards multitasking moderated the relationship between multitasking and learning satisfaction as follows. Individuals who had a positive attitude towards multitasking had high learning satisfaction with multitasking. However, individuals who had positive attitude toward multitasking did not necessarily have higher learning performance.
   Recommendations for Practitioners We would recommend both instructors and the designers of learning management systems to take mobile multitasking into consideration while designing courses and course interfaces, rather than banning multitasking, and assuming that the students do not do it. Furthermore, we recommend including multi-tasking into relevant courses such as Management Information Systems courses to make students aware of their own multitasking behavior and their results.
   Recommendations for Researchers We recommend that future studies investigate multitasking with different instruction methods, especially studies that make students aware of their multitasking behavior and its outcomes will be useful for next generations.
   Impact on Society This paper investigates the role of mobile multitasking on learning performance. Since mobile technologies are ubiquitous and their use in multitasking is common, their use in multitasking affects societal performance.
   Future Research Studies that replicate our research with larger and more diverse samples are needed. Future research could explore research-based experiential teaching methods, similar to this study.

AB  - Mounting reports in the media suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified prejudice and discrimination against racial/ethnic minorities, especially Asians. Existing research has focused on discrimination against Asians and is primarily based on self-reported incidents or nonrepresentative samples. We investigate the extent to which COVID-19 has fueled prejudice and discrimination against multiple racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States by examining nationally representative survey data with an embedded vignette experiment about roommate selection (collected in August 2020; n = 5,000). We find that priming COVID-19 salience has an immediate, statistically significant impact: compared to the control group, respondents in the treatment group exhibited increased prejudice and discriminatory intent against East Asian, South Asian, and Hispanic hypothetical room-seekers. The treatment effect is more pronounced in increasing extreme negative attitudes toward the three minority groups than decreasing extreme positive attitudes toward them. This is partly due to the treatment increasing the proportion of respondents who perceive these minority groups as extremely culturally incompatible (Asians and Hispanics) and extremely irresponsible (Asians). Sociopolitical factors did not moderate the treatment effects on attitudes toward Asians, but prior social contact with Hispanics mitigated prejudices against them. These findings suggest that COVID-19-fueled prejudice and discrimination have not been limited to East Asians but are part of a broader phenomenon that has affected Asians generally and Hispanics as well.

AB  - Despite extensive efforts to support teachers with the integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) into their classroom practice, current research reports that teachers face immense challenges when integrating ICT into their teaching. This issue has become even more relevant with the rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus, forcing schools around the world to close for an indefinite period of time and thus to offer remote digital learning solutions. Against this background, this study focused on examining the predictors of pre-service teachers' prospective ICT use and investigated the heterogeneous results of previous research related to ICT use and gender. Following the 'will, skill, tool' framework, the study examined relevant factors of pre-service teachers' (N = 103) prospective ICT use for teaching and learning processes by means of multiple regression analyses. The analyses included pre-service teachers' background characteristics, ICT profiles (attitudes and self-efficacy), digital competencies and use of digital tools in order to explore their role in future in-class use of ICT. They also show that there are no gender differences in pre-service teachers' prospective ICT integration. However, male pre-service teachers hold more positive attitudes towards ICT use than their female counterparts. Additionally, the findings reveal that the two strongest predictors of pre-service teachers' future ICT use are their attitudes and perceived competency to teach and implement technology in their teaching practices. Finally, the results provide important information about teachers' training needs. Implications of the results and further research are discussed.

AB  - Objective To examine perceptions, behaviors, and impacts surrounding COVID-19 early in the pandemic response. Materials and methods A cross-sectional survey of 1,030 U.S. adults was administered on March 31st, 2020. This survey examined attitudes toward media, government, and community responses to COVID-19 by political ideology and sociodemographic factors. Knowledge, anxieties, and impacts of COVID-19 were also assessed. Results Conservatives were more likely to report that COVID-19 was receiving too much media coverage and people were generally overreacting; liberals were more likely to report the government had not done enough in response to the pandemic. Females and those with lower income experienced more COVID-19 related economic anxieties. Those working and with children at home reported higher social, home, and work disruption. Social distancing behaviors were more common among liberals and were associated with increases in depressive symptoms. General knowledge about COVID-19 was widely exhibited across the sample, however, Black and Hispanic respondents were less likely to correctly answer questions about the availability of a vaccine and modes of transmission. Conclusions Public health experts should consider the political climate in crafting messaging that appeals to the values of those across the political spectrum. Research on the COVID-19 pandemic should continue to monitor the effects of social distancing on mental health and among vulnerable populations.

KW  - panel data
AB  - Over the last decade, issues related to immigration have become increasingly salient across Western democracies. This increasing salience has made it more important to understand people's attitudes toward immigration, including the effects of media use on those attitudes. Differentiating between attitudes toward different types of immigration, attitudes toward immigration from different parts of the world, and perceptions of immigration's impact, this article investigates the effects of media use on attitudes toward and perceptions of immigration in Sweden. Based on a three-year, three-wave panel study, it investigates the effects of media use on the individual level. Among other things, results show that there are limited effects of using traditional news media but more substantial effects on people's immigration attitudes of using anti-immigration, right-wing alternative media and pro-immigration, left-wing alternative media. These findings imply that it is highly relevant to account for media use, especially alternative media use, when studying public attitudes toward immigration. Further, we find that variations in people's immigration attitudes, to a high degree, depend on the type of immigration and on where migrants are coming from. This finding underlines the importance of measuring both of these aspects when the aim is understanding general attitudes toward immigration and/or key predictors behind immigration attitudes.

AB  - The study aimed to measure Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) and fear level towards COVID-19 and explore its cross-cultural variances in knowledge by sociodemographic factors among the general population of 8 different countries over 5 continents. It was a cross-sectional online survey. This survey was conducted in April 2020 among 1296 participants using the "Google Form" platform. Considering the social distancing formula and pandemic situation, we collect data using popular social media networks. Univariate and bivariate analyses were used to explore the collected data on KAP, fear, and sociodemographic factors. Overall knowledge score was 9.7 +/- 1.7 (out of 12), and gender differences (female vs male: 9.8 +/- 1.6 vs 9.5 +/- 1.9) were significant (p = 0.008) in the bivariate analysis. Knowledge score variances were found significant in some regions by gender, marital status, and education qualification. The highest and lowest mean knowledge scores were recorded in the Middle East (10.0 +/- 1.7) and Europe (9.3 +/- 2.0). Despite having a high fear score (22.5 +/- 5.6 out of 35), 78.35% of respondents were positively and 81.7% in a good practice level. Fear score rankings: Middle East (1st; 23.8 +/- 5.5), Europe (2nd; 23.2 +/- 5.8), Africa (3rd; 22.7 +/- 5.0), South Asia (4th; 22.1 +/- 5.7), Oceania (5th; 21.9 +/- 5.8), and North America (6th; 21.7 +/- 5.5). Fear and knowledge were not correlated. KAP and fear variation exist among geographical regions. Gender, marital status, and education qualification are factors in knowledge variances for some regions. KAP and fear measures can help health education programs consider some sociodemographic factors and regions during an outbreak of highly contagious disease and uplift a positive attitude and good practice.

AB  - During the COVID-19 emergency, people must face the invisible threat of uncertain death and comply with social distancing and other related protective measures. But social networking sites (SNSs) like WeChat have emerged as alternative contexts where people can maintain self and obtain gratification, despite the disclosure of self to others often being a challenging issue. To examine the effect of personality factors on people's self-disclosure on SNSs, we develop a model based on the time perspective theory and the socioemotional selectivity theory. We suggest that people's narcissism traits and two types of time perspective (i.e. future and present-hedonistic) have positive effects on their self-disclosure. In addition, we propose that virtual presence and hedonic gratification mediate the effects of both future time perspective and present-hedonistic time perspective. We obtain a sample of 516 WeChat users in China and take ex-ante and post-hoc measures to deal with common method variance. By means of partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) methods, we validate both our measurement model and the structural model, so we confirm all the hypothesized causal paths in the proposed model. Our study broadens the boundaries of the time perspective theory and the socioemotional selectivity theory, and offers new insights for addressing some of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Due to COVID-19, we have witnessed an accelerated digitalisation process in shopping activities as consumers embrace a variety of digital technologies that facilitate their 'in-home' or contactless shopping lifestyle. This study aims to investigate the emerging phenomenon of technology-dependent shopping under social distancing. Exploratory factory analysis and structural equation modeling are employed for data analysis. Anchored on the push-pull-mooring framework, our findings suggest that consumers' health concerns (push factors), technology needs (pull factors), task-technology fit considerations (mediators) and pandemic-induced psychological states (mooring factors) are all critical contributors to the adoption of technology-dependent shopping with varied explanatory powers. The findings also provide guidelines for retailing operators to direct consumers towards the contactless shopping channel as a responsive strategy to the pandemic.

AB  - In this study, we built upon prejudice reduction interventions research (primarily in social psychology) and ally development investigations (primarily in applied psychology). We aimed to develop an intervention to foster knowledge and attitude change identified in both areas as central to reducing prejudice and increasing intentions to promote racial justice. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether online imaginal and psychoeducational interventions could contribute to White people's needed understandings to engage in racial justice work. Additionally. if some interventions were successful, we aimed to determine which components were most effective. We used three intervention components, two of which were created for this study: imaginal contact with a person of color, learning and reflecting about racism and its impact on people of color, and increasing awareness of White privilege and positionality. We randomized participants to different combinations of the intervention components and control components to not only evaluate combined components but also dismantle the intervention, determining whether specific aspects of the intervention were more effective. Participants completed outcome measures about their attitudes and understandings prior to the intervention, immediately postintervention, and 3 weeks after completing the intervention. Findings demonstrated that the intervention and its components positively impacted outcomes of interest, with increasingly complicated learning requiring more comprehensive intervention to change.

AB  - Background: Policy makers promote the use of eHealth to widen access to health care services and to improve the quality and safety of care. Nevertheless, the enthusiasm among policy makers for eHealth does not match its uptake and use. eHealth is defined in this study as "health services delivered or enhanced through the Internet and related information and communication technologies."
   Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate (1) the current use of eHealth in the Netherlands by general practitioners (GPs) and health care users, (2) the future plans of GPs to provide eHealth and the willingness of health care users to use eHealth services, and (3) the perceived positive effects and barriers from the perspective of GPs and health care users.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey of a sample of Dutch GPs and members of the Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel was conducted in April 2014. A pre-structured questionnaire was completed by 171 GPs (12% response) and by 754 health care users (50% response). In addition, two focus groups were conducted in June 2014: one group with GPs (8 participants) and one with health care users (10 participants).
   Results: Three-quarters of Dutch GPs that responded to the questionnaire (67.3%, 115/171) offered patients the possibility of requesting a prescription via the Internet, and half of them offered patients the possibility of asking a question via the Internet (49.1%, 84/171). In general, they did intend to provide future eHealth services. Nonetheless, many of the GPs perceived barriers, especially concerning its innovation (eg, insufficient reliable, secure systems) and the sociopolitical context (eg, lack of financial compensation for the time spent on implementation). By contrast, health care users were generally not aware of existing eHealth services offered by their GPs. Nevertheless, half of them were willing to use eHealth services when offered by their GP. In general, health care users have positive attitudes regarding eHealth. One in five (20.6%, 148/718) health care users perceived barriers to the use of eHealth. These included concerns about the safety of health information obtained via the Internet (66.7%, 96/144) and privacy aspects (55.6%, 80/144).
   Conclusions: GPs and health care users have generally positive attitudes towards eHealth, which is a prerequisite for the uptake of eHealth. But, general practitioners in particular perceive barriers to using eHealth and consider the implementation of eHealth to be complex. This study shows that there is room for improving awareness of eHealth services in primary care. It will take some time before these issues are resolved and eHealth can be fully adopted.

AB  - With the development of marine science, the dynamic underwater acoustic network composed of many underwater and surface nodes has become an active research field of information science. The network in this study mainly involves the underwater gliders integrating underwater acoustic transducers and the wave glider carrying an ultra-short baseline positioning system. The attitude change of the underwater glider during zigzag profiling changes the beam pointing of the underwater acoustic transducer, which may lead to communication failure in the network. To deal with this problem, a motion platform for integrating an underwater acoustic transducer is proposed to be installed on the underwater glider. This work first integrates an underwater glider and a wave glider into a multi-body model by taking underwater acoustic signals as the media to illustrate the kinematics of the proposed motion platform. According to screw theory, the motion platform needs at least two rotational degrees of freedom to follow the ultra-short baseline positioning system. According to the bend of the sound ray, the motion angles of the motion platform are modified, and the motion platform controller is designed. The simulation results show that the controller can keep the underwater acoustic transducer tracking and pointing to the ultra-short baseline positioning system during communication when the underwater glider and wave glider move freely.

AB  - Background: Arab countries account for almost 6% of the global population, yet they make up only 5% of the total cases and less than 3% of the global death toll attributed to COVID-19. COVID-19 has put the health systems in the various Arab Countries and their ability to deliver healthcare services under tremendous strain. The capacity and stability of any health system is important in any type of response to the pandemic, in order to ensure an effective and efficient delivery of care to the public through COVID-19 and beyond. The objective of this study is to identify the various response of health systems in Arab Countries to COVID-19, and highlight the legal and health challenges faced during the pandemic. The study identified both gaps and good practices that may be utilized in order to guide the efforts in response to COVID-19 and the recovery efforts once the pandemic is over.
   Methods: To determine why the response of some health systems in Arab Countries responses are more effective than others, a three-step framework is adopted which includes, detection, containment, and treatment stages. In order to identify which countries are excelling at detection, containment, and treatment stages, several indicators were selected for each stage. To be able to understand the legal and health challenges of response to the COVID-19 pandemic, an analysis of the health systems, the resources in terms of quality and access, health workforce, and finance was conducted. Secondary data published by the Global Burden of Disease Study, and the Global Change Data Lab of the University of Oxford was used to study identified gaps and good practices to guide the responses to COVID-19 and recovery efforts once the pandemic is over.
   Results: The epidemiologic record demonstrates that that certain Arab countries are managing to control the pandemic, through a combination of mitigation strategies, suppression strategy and elimination strategy. There are several barriers and challenges in Arab health systems which have been amplified due to COVID-19 and if ignored may pose a further significant challenge in the future. Health systems in Arab countries are not sufficiently equipped to handle all healthcare needs related to COVID-19, in particular issues relating to administration, equity, finances, the supply side of healthcare, and usage of information technology.
   Conclusion: In Arab counties, the standard response to COVID-19 was enforced by new health laws, which consist of a combination of the traditional disease control measures (testing, contact-tracing, social distancing), population-based physical distancing (including stay-at-home orders, school and business closures, and social gathering bans), travel limits (including travel bans, and border closures), and economic support measures. Acceptable healthcare quality and access, sufficient health workforce, and sufficient funds are the most imperative needs in the health system in Arab counties to provide a sustainable response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - It is seen that media access influences the opinion formation of an individual, affecting their decision making ability in bringing an attitudinal change leading to a social transformation. In India, the technologically driven media has reached rural parts of the country and seems to be greatly influencing the indigenous culture of Lachhmangarh Village of Shekhawati Region, Rajasthan. To understand the extent of cultural transformation, various factors of culture, i.e., food, lifestyle, art and architecture, costume, music, dance, language and festivals are studied. The study attempts to identify the penetration of media and subsequent positive and negative influence on cultural transformation. It also attempts to analyse efforts undertaken by media and government to preserve the culture. The researcher conducted ethnographic study validating it through method triangulation. 200 respondents' filled questionnaires formed the quantitative data while qualitative data was collected through observation method, in-depth interviews and focused group discussion with 50 respondents each.

AB  - Electoral systems are assumed to enhance political efficacy and encourage participation through party mobilisation because they create incentives for parties (or candidates) to mobilise voters. This paper makes use of survey data collected after elections in more than 30 countries, spanning a variety of party systems in both established and new democracies, to examine how party mobilisation varies across context and what difference it makes. The results demonstrate that political efficacy and behaviour are enhanced when parties mobilise voters. This is most likely to occur in systems where parties compete in a narrow issue space. In contrast, citizens are less likely to come into contact with parties in polarised systems. This has consequences for both political attitudes and engagement.

Objective: In a cross-sectional study, to compare fasting and postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particle (TRLP) concentrations and size in black compared with white pre- and postmenopausal women and determine the relationship between TRLP subfractions and whole-body insulin sensitivity, hepatic and visceral fat, and SCD-1 levels. Methods and Results: In 122 federally employed women without diabetes mellitus, 73 black (58 African American and 15 African immigrant) and 49 white; age, 44 +/- 10 (mean +/- SD) years; body mass index, 30.0 +/- 5.6 kg/m(2), we measured lipoprotein subfractions using nuclear magnetic resonance. Hepatic fat was measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, insulin sensitivity index calculated by minimal modeling from a frequently sampled intravenous glucose test, and red blood cell fatty acid profiles were measured by gas chromatography and were used to estimate SCD-1 indices. Hepatic fat, insulin sensitivity index, and SCD-1 were similar in black women and lower than in whites, regardless of menopausal status. Fasting and postprandial large, medium, and small TRLPs, but not very small TRLPs, were lower in black women. Fasting large, medium, and very small TRLPs negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity index and positively correlated with visceral and hepatic fat and SCD-1 activity in both groups. In multivariate models, visceral fat and SCD-1 were associated with total fasting TRLP concentrations (adjR2, 0.39; P=0.001). Black women had smaller postprandial changes in large (P=0.005) and medium TRLPs (P=0.007). Conclusions: Lower visceral fat and SCD-1 activity may contribute to the paradoxical association of lower fasting and postprandial TRLP subfractions despite insulin resistance in black compared with white pre- and postmenopausal women. Similar concentrations of very small TRLPs are related to insulin resistance and could be important mediators of cardiometabolic disease risk in women.

AB  - The results of research linking age and sexual risk among men who have sex with men have been inconsistent. This study assessed the relationship between age and sexual risk among 193 Black men who have sex with men in Pretoria. Older men who have sex with men reported engaging in more frequent unprotected insertive anal intercourse. We examined whether components of Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model mediated this relationship. Results showed that (1) older age predicts less positive attitudes toward condoms, (2) less positive attitudes predict more frequent unprotected insertive anal intercourse, and (3) attitudes mediate the relationship between age and frequency of unprotected insertive anal intercourse. We consider two possible explanations for these findings: a developmental trajectory and a cohort effect.

AB  - Introduction: The aim was to investigate the adequacy of preventive measures, awareness, and attitudes of pharmacy university students in the Punjab province, Pakistan, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional survey was designed at a private university in Faisalabad, Pakistan. The questionnaire was developed on Google forms and distributed to students of five universities in the Punjab province via WhatsApp groups. Results: The comparison of COVID-19 knowledge for specific questions showed that non-pharmacy students (NPS) had significantly better knowledge about the source of the virus (p<0.001), while pharmacy students (PS) had better knowledge regarding COVID-19 treatment (p=0.01). The PS's perception of the dangerousness and risk of contracting COVID-19 infection was better than NPS's perception (p=0.026; p=0.019, respectively). The regression analysis revealed that the knowledge score was negatively associated with the female gender, and females were less likely to have a positive attitude. Conclusion: The authors' results suggest that PS had good knowledge, positive attitude, and preparedness towards COVID-19. However, there are still misconceptions and confusion about the disease.

AB  - This study examined the mediating effect of perceived causal attribution of crisis on the relationship between perceived violation of social missions and public attitude, in addition to examining the moderating effects of both the medium and framing of online articles on the relationship between perceived violation of social missions and public attitude and that between perceived causal attribution and public attitude. The study conducted a quantitative content analysis of 511 comments obtained from 16 online articles for analysing a social enterprise crisis. The results supported that perceived causal attribution mediated the effect of perceived violation of social missions on public attitude. In addition, episodically framed articles enhanced the effect of perceived violation of social missions on public attitude, whereas Facebook articles enhanced the effect of perceived causal attribution on public attitude. Implications for public relations practitioners and journalists are discussed in this article.

AB  - ObjectiveWe examined the effects of control motivation on in-group positivity. Past research suggests that people compensate for low personal control by increasing support for social in-groups. We predicted that the effect of personal control on in-group positivity would depend on the type of in-group positivity. Low personal control should increase compensatory, narcissistic in-group positivity, whereas high personal control should increase secure, non-narcissistic in-group positivity.
   MethodThese hypotheses were tested in a cross-sectional survey (Study 1 N=1,083, 54% female, M-age=47.68), two experiments (Study 2 N=105, 50% female, M-age=32.05; Study 3 N=154, 40% female, M-age=29.93), and a longitudinal survey (Study 4 N=398, 51% female, M-age=32.05).
   ResultsIn all studies, personal control was negatively associated with narcissistic in-group positivity but positively associated with non-narcissistic in-group positivity. The longitudinal survey additionally showed that the positive relationship between personal control and non-narcissistic in-group positivity was reciprocal. Moreover, both types of in-group positivity differentially mediated between personal control and out-group attitudes: Narcissistic in-group positivity predicted negative attitudes, and non-narcissistic positivity predicted positive attitudes.
   ConclusionsThese findings highlight the role of individual motivation in fostering different types of in-group positivity and intergroup outcomes.

AB  - Background: Although eHealth technology makes it possible to improve the management of complex health care systems and follow up on chronic patients, it is not without challenges, thus requiring the development of efficient programs and graphic user interface (GUI) features. Similar information technology tools are crucial, as health care populations are going to have to endure social distancing measures in the forthcoming months and years.
   Objective: This study aims to provide adequate and personalized support to complex health care populations by developing a specific web-based mobile app. The app is designed around the patient and adapted to specific groups, for example, people with complex or rare diseases, autism, or disabilities (especially among children) as well as Alzheimer or senile dementia. The app's core features include the collection, labeling, analysis, and sorting of clinical data. Furthermore, it authorizes a network of people around the patient to securely access the data contained in his or her electronic health record.
   Methods: The application was designed according to the paradigms of patient-centered care and user-centered design (UCD). It considers the patient as the main empowered and motivating factor in the management of his or her well-being. Implementation was informed through a family needs and technology perception assessment. We used 3 interdisciplinary focus groups and 2 assessment surveys to study the contexts of app use, subpopulation management, and preferred functions. Finally, we developed an observational study involving 116 enrolled patients and 253 system users, followed by 2 feedback surveys to evaluate the performance and impact of the app.
   Results: In the validated general GUI, we developed 10 user profiles with different privacy settings. We tested 81 functions and studied a modular structure based on disease or medical area. This allowed us to identify replicable methods to be applied to module design. The observational study not only showed good family and community engagement but also revealed some limitations that need to be addressed. In total, 42 of 51 (82%) patients described themselves as satisfied or very satisfied. Health care providers reported facilitated communication with colleagues and the need to support data quality.
   Conclusions: The experimented solution addressed some of the health system challenges mentioned by the World Health Organization: usability appears to be significantly improved when the GUI is designed according to patients' UCD mental models and when new media and medical literacy are promoted. This makes it possible to maximize the impact of eHealth products, thereby overcoming some crucial gaps reported in the literature. Two main features seemed to have potential benefit compared with other eHealth products: the modeling, within the app, of both the formal and informal health care support networks and the modular structure allowing for comorbidity management, both of which require further implementation.

AB  - Widespread agreement that training can play a key role in addressing workplace sexual harassment (SH) has led to a dramatic increase in employer-provided SH training around the world. However, summaries of published research have been qualitative in nature and have yielded inconsistent assessments of SH training's effectiveness in fulfilling that role. The study helps address those uncertain and sometimes conflicting assessments by providing the first meta-analytic investigation of the relationships between SH training and changes in trainees. We found that the largest SH training effect was on declarative knowledge learning (delta = 1.06), followed by attitude change (delta = 0.41), procedural knowledge-skills learning (delta = 0.39), and transfer outcomes (delta = 0.14). Significant moderating effects were found for scope of training, instructional method, and gender of trainees; however, the results varied by training outcome. The effect of SH training did not vary significantly as a function of the training delivery media, training duration, or training setting. Theoretical implications, directions for future research, and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Following the shooting of Mark Duggan by police on 4 August 2011, there were riots in many large cities in the UK. As the rioting was widely perceived to be perpetrated by the urban poor, links were quickly made with Britain's welfare policies. In this paper, we examine whether the riots, and the subsequent media coverage, influenced attitudes toward welfare recipients. Using the British Social Attitudes survey, we use multivariate difference-in-differences regression models to compare attitudes toward welfare recipients among those interviewed before (pre-intervention: i.e. prior to 6 August) and after (post-intervention: 10 August-10 September) the riots occurred (N53,311). We use variation in exposure to the media coverage to test theories of media persuasion in the context of attitudes toward welfare recipients. Before the riots, there were no significant differences between newspaper readers and non-readers in their attitudes towards welfare recipients. However, after the riots, attitudes diverged. Newspaper readers became more likely than non-readers to believe that those on welfare did not really deserve help, that the unemployed could find a job if they wanted to and that those on the dole were being dishonest in claiming benefits. Although the divergence was clearest between right-leaning newspaper and non-newspaper readers, we do not a find statistically significant difference between right-and left-leaning newspapers. These results suggest that media coverage of the riots influenced attitudes towards welfare recipients; specifically, newspaper coverage of the riots increased the likelihood that readers of the print media expressed negative attitudes towards welfare recipients when compared with the rest of the population.

AB  - Given evidence linking sugary drinks consumption to weight gain, public health proponents are increasingly interested in ways to reduce sugary drinks consumption. This study explored the use of media, specifically, anti-sugary drinks television ads, as a tool for addressing sugary drinks consumption. Ad-related discussion and social norm perceptions are important to media's effects, but to date, these two influences have not been examined separately. To better parse these effects, college students (N=109) viewed anti-sugary drinks ads either with or without the presence of a friend (a manipulation of social norm perceptions), and either discussed or did not discuss the ads after viewing them. Changes in baseline sugary drinks health knowledge, attitudes toward reducing sugary drinks consumption, and intentions to reduce sugary drinks consumption were examined at post-exposure and one-week follow-up. Consumption levels were also examined at baseline and follow-up. After viewing the ads, participants across conditions reported better sugary drinks health knowledge, more positive attitudes toward reducing sugary drinks consumption, greater intentions to reduce sugary drinks consumption, and lower sugary drinks consumption, although not all effects were maintained at follow-up. Friend presence and discussion did not have substantial effects on outcomes; however, participants that viewed the ads in the presence of a friend maintained positive attitudes toward reducing sugary drinks consumption at follow-up, while those without a friend did not. Results suggest anti-sugary drinks ads are a promising tool for addressing sugary drinks consumption, and that social norm perceptions likely play an important role in explaining media effects.

AB  - Extensive scholarly attention is devoted to citizens' preferences for alternative models of political decision-making. However, few efforts were made to identify who these citizens are and why they display a certain preference. To address this void in the literature, our article analyzes the determinants of preferences for citizens as decision-makers. It uses individual-level data from a 2014 survey on a probability representative sample in Germany and tests the effects of political attitudes toward institutions of representative democracy, interest in politics, and civic involvement. It controls for consumption of political news, education, and age.

AB  - Aims: Post-traumatic growth (PTG) refers to positive changes that result from coping with a major life crisis or a traumatic event. Factors influencing PTG in youth have not been well characterized but could have a great impact on overall maturation.
   Methods: Fourth to ninth graders (n = 3337) attending elementary or junior high schools located in a district severely damaged by the Great East Japan Earthquake completed a questionnaire, including the revised Posttraumatic Growth Inventory for Children (PTGI-C-R) along with the Post Traumatic Stress Symptoms for Children 15 items (PTSSC-15), 31 months after the event. Experience of the disaster, prior traumatic experiences, and attitudes toward memories of the disaster (rumination) were scored by their caregivers and teachers, and effects of these factors on PTG were evaluated.
   Results: There were no significant associations between PTGI-C-R and sex or experiences of the disaster. However, PTGI-C-R was negatively correlated with age (r = -0.132, P < 0.001). There was significant but very weak negative correlation between PTGI-C-R and PTSSC-15 among the children (r = -0.096, P < 0.001). PTGI-C-R was significantly associated with positive attitudes to memorial services (P < 0.001) and media coverage (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Positive attitudes to deliberate rumination may facilitate PTG in children following natural disasters.

AB  - Objectives: To examine how dementia is associated with COVID-19 risk and adherence to COVID-19 mitigation behaviors, and whether mitigation behaviors mediate the relationship between dementia and COVID-19 risk.
   Methods/Design: We analyzed 2019 and 2020 data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, a national prospective cohort study of United States older adults age 65+. Outcomes were COVID-19 diagnosis and adherence to COVID-19 mitigation behaviors (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing).
   Results: Among the 3257 older adults in this study, 485 (14.9%) had dementia in 2019 and 98 (3.1%) were COVID-19 positive in 2020. Dementia significantly increased the odds of COVID-19 by 129% (odds ratio [OR] = 2.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-3.97). and remained elevated after adjusting for sociodemographics and health (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 0.90-3.11). Dementia significantly decreased the odds of handwashing by 72% (OR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.17-0.44), which remained lower after adjusting for sociodemographics and health (OR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.23-1.21). Dementia was not significantly associated with mask-wearing and social distancing. The relationship between dementia and COVID-19 was primarily mediated by functional impairment, income, and residential setting.
   Conclusions: Dementia was associated with an increased COVID-19 risk and lower adherence to handwashing among U.S. older adults. Adherence to COVID-19 mitigation behaviors did not mediate COVID-19 risk by dementia status. For older adults with dementia, COVID-19 risk could be decreased by prioritizing health interventions.

AB  - Background: A diagnosis of epilepsy has a major effect on children; especially among schoolchildren. Studies have shown that a significant proportion of teachers and students have negative attitude and misunderstanding towards epilepsy making it difficult for a child with epilepsy. At the same time, there is a dearth is dearth of literature regarding interventions to bring about a change in the attitudes of children.
   Methodology: The aim of the present study was to study the outcome of a school-based health education program for epilepsy awareness among schoolchilcIren.The objectives were to assess the level of knowledge, attitude, and practices about epilepsy and relationship among these variables. A total of 70 children, from 8th-lOth grades were selected randomly for the study. For the study purpose, knowledge, attitude, and practices of epilepsy instrument were developed and face validated by experts.
   Results: Results show that the mean, median, and mode age of the respondents in the study were 1455 ( 1.33), 15, and 14 years, respectively. The gender distribution of the respondents was 54.9% boys and 45.1% girls. With regard to knowledge, attitude, and practices in epilepsy, knowledge strongly and positively correlated with attitude (p - 0.001, r - .423) and practice domains (p - 0.001, r - .486). Postattitude and (p - 0.001, r - .338) practice were positively correlated, which shows that positive attitude brings positive practice. Hence, it is
   concluded that a training program brings desirable change in the knowledge, attitude, and practice domains among children. Conclusion: Health education programs for schoolchildren arc very important to bring changes in their attitude, behavior, and practices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The female condom is effective in reducing unprotected sexual acts; however, it remains underutilized in the United States. This study examined whether a five-session HIV prevention intervention (Safer Sex Skills Building [SSB]), including presentation, discussion, and practice with female condoms, improved female condom skills and attitude among women in outpatient substance abuse treatment. Mixed-effects modeling was used to test the effect of SSB on skills and attitude over 3- and 6-month posttreatment among 515 randomized women. SSB was significantly associated with increases in skills and attitude, and the female condom demonstration session was primarily responsible for skills improvement. Attitude was a partial mediator of the intervention effect in reducing unprotected sex. Findings emphasize the utility of integrating female condom messages targeting proximal behavioral outcomes into HIV prevention. The study supports the use of female condom skill instruction via brief, hands-on exercises, as well as further research to enhance attitudinal change to reduce sexual risk.

AB  - Understanding patterns and motivations for social spacing greatly illuminates the structure and internal dynamics of given groups or social systems. The highly social, polygynous greater sac-winged bat, Saccopteryx bilineata, represents an excellent model for social spacing analysis, since the choice of individual roost-sites within a day-roost constitutes an enduring, often repeated decision about relative proximity to conspecifics. Day-roost colonies consist of one or multiple harem groups, each with several females and a single male. Additionally, non-harem males without females may be present. A social-distance-time-budget metric revealed that harem males, females, and non-harem males differed significantly in their respective spatial associations while roosting. Harem males and females were most closely associated, with harem males located at the center of harems instead of at the borders. Non-harem males associated significantly closer with one another than with harem females that they were trying to access. The signaling modality mediating social interactions depended on the respective social distances between communicating bats. Our results suggest a concentric social organization based around harem males, which may select roost sites in closest possible proximity to females to enhance courtship signal strength. This constitutes an interesting deviation from the normative form of harem maintenance, patrolling borders, in mammals.

AB  - The article substantiates the importance of forming the project competence of future specialists in information, library and archive services with the help of the project management information systems. The essence of project development in the library sphere is specified. The key features of the project activity of specialists in information, library and archive services under the conditions of digitalization, as well as the specifics of its informatization, are analyzed. The special features of project management as a component of library management are described. Some project management information systems are characterized. The structure of library workers' project competence (value-motivational (axiological), knowledge-content (cognitive), technological (activity-practical) components) is specified. The value-motivational component is determined by a set of stable motives (personal, cognitive, professional ones) and suggests a conscious positive attitude to the project activity automation, readiness for its implementation. The knowledge-content component assumes having knowledge of the project activity automation. The technological component includes the ability to perform the project activity automation, to feel free in the information environment, etc. The results of the experimental verification of the efficiency of pedagogical conditions in order to form the project competence of future specialists in information, library and archive services (illustrated by the implementation of the author's special course "Information Systems for Project Management in the Professional Activities of Information, Library and Archive Specialists") are presented. The implementation of the author's special course has visualized certain positive changes in the levels of the project competence development of students in experimental groups compared with those in control ones. The results of the obtained data analysis made it possible to ascertain the positive dynamics of changes in the quantitative indicators of the levels of the project competence development of future specialists in librarianship.

AB  - Prejudices against palliative care are a potential barrier to quality end-of-life care. There have been few large-scale community-wide interventions to distribute appropriate information about palliative care, and no studies have investigated their impact on cancer patients, their families, and the general public. Thus, we conducted a 3-year community intervention and evaluated the effects of distributing such information at the community level, and explored associations among levels of exposure, perceptions, knowledge, and the sense of security achieved.
   Over a period of 3 years, we provided flyers, booklets, posters, and public lectures about palliative care in four regions of Japan, and carried out pre- and post-intervention surveys with repeated cross-sectional samplings of cancer patients (pre 859, post 857), bereaved family members (1110, 1137), and the general public (3984, 1435). The levels of exposure to the provided information were measured by a multiple-choice questionnaire after intervention. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to estimate multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for perceptions of palliative care, knowledge about opioids, and sense of security among the exposure groups.
   Overall perceptions of palliative care, opioids, and receiving care at home improved significantly among the general public and families, but not among the patients at the community level. However, multiple regression revealed that patients of extensive exposure category had significantly more positive perceptions of palliative care to those of non-exposure category (p = 0.02). The sense of security regarding cancer care of all patients, family members, and the general public improved. Among others, the respondents who reported extensive exposure in the general public and family members scored significantly higher sense of security.
   Our findings indicate that providing palliative care information via small media and lectures in the community is effective in improving perceptions of palliative care and knowledge about opioids among the community dwellers, especially for caregivers of the patients. The acquisition of adequate knowledge about palliative care from various information sources may improve people's sense of security regarding cancer.

AB  - Emerging technologies are leading the travel industry to vital changes. The use of 360-degree videos in marketing plans allows destination marketers to give their customers a virtual adventure before their actual trip. By integrating the motivation theory and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), a research model was extended to investigate whether 360-degree videos are influential in producing a more positive attitude and shaping consumers' behavioral intentions towards a destination. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to test the relationships between the proposed constructs. Data was collected from European respondents (n = 598) via an online survey regarding Hong Kong as a tourist destination. The results revealed that both intrinsic and extrinsic motivators influence tourists' satisfaction with a 360-degree experience of the destination that indirectly affects their visit and electronic word of mouth (eWOM) intentions through behavioral involvement. Overall, the findings reflected that a 360-degree video is a beneficial tool in attracting consumers and shaping their attitudes and intentions. The theoretical and managerial implications of findings, as well as recommendations for future research, are addressed.

AB  - Introduction: : Depression is associated with difficulties in interpersonal relationships, of which communication is an integral part. Communication can not only be effected by verbal means, but also non-verbally by touch. Against this background, the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between depression, interpersonal problems and the attitude towards social touch.
   Methods: : 147 individuals (115 females; 21-71 years old) seeking treatment in a clinic for outpatient psychotherapy took part in the survey. Three questionnaires evaluating the level of depression (Beck Depression Questionnaire), the degree of interpersonal problems (Inventory of Interpersonal Problems) and the attitude towards social touch (Social Touch Questionnaire, were administered.
   Results: : Highly depressed individuals had a more negative attitude towards social touch than non-to lowly depressed individuals. Highly depressed individuals particularly reported to dislike physical touch by not well-known people, but not by close ones. Highly depressed individuals also reported more interpersonal problems, with the level of depression predicting the degree of interpersonal problems. This relationship was partially mediated by the attitude towards social touch in general and, to a greater extent, by the dislike of physical touch by people not well-known in particular.
   Discussion: : Given the role of social touch in the relationship between depression and interpersonal problems, the attitude towards touch may be taken into consideration in the therapy of depressed patients. We assume that a more positive attitude towards social touch can influence the ability to create and maintain interpersonal relationships.

AB  - Research has shown that citizens with populist attitudes evaluate the news media more negatively, and there is also suggestive evidence that they rely less on established news sources like the legacy press. However, due to data limitations, there is still no solid evidence whether populist citizens have skewed news diets in the contemporary high-choice digital media environment. In this paper, we rely on the selective exposure framework and investigate the relationship between populist attitudes and the consumption of various types of online news. To test our theoretical assumptions, we link 150 million Web site visits by 7,729 Internet users in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States to their responses in an online survey. This design allows us to measure media exposure more precisely than previous studies while linking these data to demographic attributes and political attitudes of participants. The results show that populist attitudes leave pronounced marks in people's news diets, but the evidence is heterogeneous and highly contingent on the supply side of a country's media system. Most importantly, citizens with populist attitudes visit less Web sites from the legacy press, while consuming more hyperpartisan news. Despite these tendencies, the Web tracking data show that populist citizens still primarily get their news from established sources. We discuss the implications of these results for the current state of public spheres in democracies.

AB  - Introduction: As Switzerland faced the "second wave" of COVID-19 incidences, a discussion of a potential vaccine against the virus emerged. While some individuals accept vaccines, others challenge or refuse to be vaccinated, a phenomena called vaccine hesitancy. Here, trust plays a vital role in vaccination intention. Embitterment not only goes along with the sense of being treated unjust but also innates a distrust in others. Thus, embitterment may influence individuals' vaccination intention against COVID-19. In the present study, we investigate how feelings of being socially excluded and the perceived negative impact of the pandemic are associated with embitterment and in turn, how embitterment is related to individuals' vaccination intention and the tendency to hold COVID-19-related conspiracy beliefs (CCBs). This is in regard of the perceived communication style by the government. Method: A convenience sample of 281 individuals completed an online survey developed on Qualtrics. In this cross-sectional, nonexperimental designed study, indirect effects of a moderated serial mediation were analyzed using Jamm (Jamovi, Version 0.9; 2019). Results: Results indicated that embitterment went along with increased feelings of social exclusion (beta = 0.45, p < 0.001). Further, individuals high in embitterment generally indicated a higher vaccination intention against COVID-19 (beta = 0.15, p < 0.01). However, embittered individuals holding CCBs had a decreased vaccination intention against COVID-19 (beta = -0.71, p < 0.001). Thus, whether or not embittered individuals develop CCBs might be a crucial determinant for their vaccination intention. Noteworthy, the relationship between embitterment and the tendency to hold CCBs was reinforced by the notion of an unsatisfactory style of communication by the government. Conclusion: Taken together, results suggest that embitterment not only plays a relevant role in vaccination intention against COVID-19 but also for the susceptibility to engage in conspiracy beliefs.

AB  - This study focuses on the effect of the sustainable marketing of three types of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives sponsorship, cause-related marketing, and philanthropy on consumer evaluations with the moderating effect of psychological distance (social distance and spatial distance). Four hundred and eighty subjects participated in a 3x2x2 between-subjects factorial design experiment. The results of the analyses were significant and in the direction hypothesized. Philanthropy was found to have a stronger effect on consumer evaluations, followed by sponsorship and cause-related marketing. However, the relationship between CSR initiatives and consumer evaluations was significantly stronger when consumers perceived the focal brand with low social distance as well as the cause with low spatial distance. The findings thus provide support for the importance of psychological distance in moderating CSR initiatives. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - The implementation of e-learning system in higher education institutions as an emerged technology will not guarantee its adoption by faculty members. In fact, the existence of technology alone is not enough in encouraging knowledge sharing behavior among users.
   The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between the perception of an e-learning experience as an emerged technology in higher education and the willingness to share this knowledge with staff members with their students. We characterized staff members' perceptions of an e-learning experience as a new technology by including an individual's psychological state of readiness and acceptance of technology; and to also practice this new experience with their students as an individual behavior. Technology Readiness Index and Technology Acceptance Model were integrated in order to explore staff members' perceptions of technology. The practice of staff members of this new e-learning experience with their students was characterized by the knowledge sharing behavior. We analyzed the responses of 400 participants from staff members in higher education using structural equation modeling. The correlated results showed that staff member's positive attitude on the perception of e-learning could increase the practice of this knowledge with students. A sense of insecurity towards this new technology also led to an undesirable effect on the staff member's perceptions of the ease of use of e-learning. Therefore, maintain a high degree of discomfort and insecurity towards an e-learning experience hinders enormously staff member's to share this knowledge with their students.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to explore the use of an appeal, belonging and commitment social marketing intervention to rescue a failing corporate "charity of the year" exercise that involved a mental disability charity. It describes the improvements experienced consequent to the introduction of volunteer "charity ambassadors" (CAs) appointed to champion the charity's cause. Design/methodology/approach The study revolved around company employees' responses to an open-ended question concerning their attitudes towards people with mental disabilities. A semi-automated qualitative research technique (structural topic modelling [STM]) was used to analyse the replies both pre- and post-intervention. Regression analyses were undertaken to explain whether employees' replies to the question fell in specific categories. Findings The intervention was successful. Employees' attitudes regarding mentally impaired people shifted substantially away from fear and towards feelings of benevolence and compassion. Employees' financial donations to the charity increased significantly consequent to the intervention. Levels of benevolence and compassion depended significantly on participants' prior exposure to people with mental disabilities, gender and degree of involvement in activities associated with the intervention.
   Originality/value The results highlight some of the problems attached to corporate sponsorship of unpopular causes. A relatively recently developed open-ended qualitative research technique, STM, was used to examine employees' attitudes. Classifications of findings emerged from the data and did not depend on a predetermined coding scheme.

AB  - Today most of the organizations are increasing their digital affiliation for marketing purposes. This study intends to develop a conceptual structure between caused-related marketing and social media marketing. Three principle objective to conduct this research are: (i) to test whether a change of perception happens in a viral cause related marketing effort (ii) to test the viability of cause related content floating on various social media sites (aim to create awareness through social media); (iii) to analyze the role of users' age. A survey was conducted with 382 social media users and their responses were recorded after they viewed an online cause related content about education supported by a NGO (Non-Government Organization). The research outcome points out that psychological behaviour will enhance positive attitude towards: cause related content (HI) and. cause based user alliance association (H3). Additionally, psychological behaviour also enhances positive attitude towards brand associated with cause related campaigns (H2). The intention to share cause-related campaigns will increase when psychological behaviour exists for: the content (H4), the brand associated(H5) and user alliance association(H6).

LA  - English
AB  - South-North and North-North migration patterns have received significant interest in the literature, and recently, studies have begun to investigate South-South migration. However, as yet, very few studies have addressed North-South migration or investigated the psychological facilitators and barriers that drive this growing migration pattern. With a sample from a representative group of Hong Kong adults, we evaluated the role of positive attitude in shaping the intention to migrate from Hong Kong, a more-developed economy (a metropolitan area), to the Greater Bay Area (GBA) cities in Mainland China, considered a less-developed economy (with less metropolitan areas). We found positive attitude toward GBA cities in Mainland China promoted migration intention both directly and indirectly, as mediated by situational concerns and experience of visiting Mainland GBA cities. The impact of a positive attitude on a field visit was found to be weaker among wealthier adults relative to their economically disadvantaged counterparts. The effect of a field visit on migration intention was found to be stronger among wealthier adults relative to their economically disadvantaged counterparts. The findings suggest that an understanding of social psychology has implications for policy makers through highlighting the different approaches and entry points that could be adopted to encourage migration by people of varying economic status.

T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Pharmaceutical care (PC) practice is still limited in the United Arab Emirates. It is crucial to understand pharmacy students' attitudes and their perceived barriers towards PC provision, to evaluate the effectiveness of theoretical and practical curricula in creating positive attitudes toward PC. This study aims to assess attitudes of final year undergraduate pharmacy students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the barriers perceived by them to practice PC. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted in February and March, 2020, involving colleges in UAE offering undergraduate pharmacy programs and having students in their final year. Participants filled a questionnaire covering attitudes' items, based on the Pharmaceutical Care Attitudes Survey (PCAS), and several perceived barriers. A stratified sample of 193 students participated from six universities, 85% were females, 92.2% and 64.8% completed or engaged in community and hospital pharmacy training respectively, at the time of the study. Attitudes' items receiving the highest agreement were PC will improve patient health (95.3%), all pharmacists should perform PC (93.3%) and PC would benefit pharmacists (92.7%). However, 44.6% agreed PC is not worth the additional workload. Females showed higher attitudes' total scores, median (IQR): 55 (51-58) and 52 (49-55.5) for females and males respectively, P = 0.032. Having incomplete courses was also associated with lower scores, median (IQR): 55 (51-58) and 52 (48.5-55.5) for "No" and "Yes" respectively, P = 0.048. Poor image of the pharmacist's role and lack of private counseling area or inappropriate pharmacy layout were the most perceived barriers, with around 78% agreement. In conclusion, final year undergraduate pharmacy students in the UAE have positive attitudes towards pharmaceutical care. The current curricula may be satisfactory in fostering positive attitudes among students. Poor image of the pharmacist's role and lack of counseling area or inappropriate pharmacy layout were the main barriers identified, among other barriers.

AB  - In three studies we tested whether concern for personal reputation varies as a function of the entitativity of the community or group to which individuals belong. The first correlational study (N = 135) showed that perceived group entitativity was positively correlated with concern for personal reputation expressed by its members. The second 2 x 2 factorial design experiment (N = 104) confirmed that, regardless of the kind of group, the level of manipulated entitativity enhances individuals' concern for reputation. Finally, the third 2 x 2 factorial design experiment (N = 98) indicated that this link is fully mediated by the fear of social exclusion. This research contributes to defining conditions influencing reputation management processes.

AB  - Objective: The study aimed to test knowledge and attitudes of physical educators in Palestine toward epi-lepsy and students with epilepsy. The study also aimed to identify the variables that were associated with adequate knowledge and positive attitudes toward epilepsy and students with epilepsy. Methods: This study was done in a cross-sectional design among physical educators in Palestinian schools. The questionnaire tested knowledge and attitudes of physical educators using 18-item and 12-statement tests, respectively. Results: Complete questionnaires were returned by 226 physical educators (response rate = 75.3%). The median knowledge score of the physical educators on the 18-item knowledge test was 50% [33.0%, 61.0] and the median attitudes score of the physical educators on the 12-statemtns was 50.0% [42.0, 58.0]. Higher knowledge scores were associated with age, teaching experience, educational level, having known/interacted with people with epilepsy, and receiving education about epilepsy. Higher attitude scores were associated with gender, age, educational level, place of residence, type of school, having known/interacted with people with epilepsy, and receiving education about epilepsy. Conclusion: Knowledge gaps and negative attitudes toward epilepsy and students with epilepsy were identified among physical educators in Palestine. Appropriately designed interventions are still needed to improve knowledge and correct attitudes of physical educators about epilepsy and students with epilepsy. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Clinical management of breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP) is still not satisfactory despite the availability of effective pharmacological agents. This is in part linked to the lack of clarity regarding certain essential aspects of BTcP, including terminology, definition, epidemiology and assessment. Other barriers to effective management include a widespread prejudice among doctors and patients concerning the use of opioids, and inadequate assessment of pain severity, resulting in the prescription of ineffective drugs or doses. This review presents an overview of the appropriate and inappropriate actions to take in the diagnosis and treatment of BTcP, as determined by a panel of experts in the field. The ultimate aim is to provide a practical contribution to the unresolved issues in the management of BTcP. Five 'things to do' and five 'things not to do' in the diagnosis and treatment of BTcP are proposed, and evidence supporting said recommendations are described. It is the duty of all healthcare workers involved in managing cancer patients to be mindful of the possibility of BTcP occurrence and not to underestimate its severity. It is vital that all the necessary steps are carried out to establish an accurate and timely diagnosis, principally by establishing effective communication with the patient, the main information source. It is crucial that BTcP is treated with an effective pharmacological regimen and drug(s), dose and administration route prescribed are designed to suit the particular type of pain and importantly the individual needs of the patient.

AB  - Background and objectives
   Practice-based research (PBR) is of pivotal importance for hospital pharmacists which not only up-grades the profession but also improves the patient care. This study aimed to evaluate the attitude, perception, willingness, motivation and barriers to PBR among hospital pharmacists in Pakistan.
   Methods
   A descriptive, cross sectional study design was employed. Data were collected between 1st December, 2017 and 1st March, 2018 from 130 hospital pharmacists employed in 41 hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan. A survey instrument comprising of six sections was designed to determine the attitude, perception, willingness, motivation and barriers to PBR. Data were analyzed by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 21.0, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). The normality of the data was determined through Shapiro-Wilks and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Independent Samples Mann-Whitney U Test and Independent Samples Kruskal-Wallis Test were carried out to test if there were differences among the characteristics of the hospital pharmacists. Logistic regression analysis was used to figure out the factors associated with attitude, perceptions, willingness and motivation towards PBR. A p-value <0.05 was used for statistical significance of differences.
   Results
   A total of 141 pharmacists were approached. Among them, 130 responded to the survey (response rate 92%). Out of a maximum score i.e., 5 (100%) the respondents obtained a median score of 4 (IQR = 0) for attitude, perception and motivation towards PBR; whereas, a median score of 4 (IQR = 1) was obtained for willingness thus demonstrating fair positive attitude, good perceptions, increased motivation and willingness towards PBR. The most common barrier limiting the pharmacists' participation in PBR was lack of time (23.8%) followed by lack of incentives (16.2%) and lack of support (14.6%). Results of the logistic regression analysis revealed that hospital pharmacists practicing in the inpatient settings had 4.56 times more positive attitude towards PBR (OR = 4.56, 95% CI = 1.07 - 19.42, p-value = 0.040) as compared to those practicing in the outpatient settings. The male hospital pharmacists (OR = 8.86, 95% CI = 1.15-53.74, p-value = 0.017), those practicing in the outpatient (OR = 23.51, 95% CI = 2.04-271.53, p-value = 0.011) and inpatient settings had increased motivation towards PBR (OR = 12.24, 95% CI = 1.61-94.66, p-value = 0.016).
   Conclusion
   Despite the presence of several barriers, the respondents had fair positive attitude, good perceptions, increased motivation and willingness towards PBR which is a promising finding.

AB  - Covid-19 has been causing severe loss to the human race. Considering the mode of spread and severity, it is essential to make it a habit to follow various safety precautions such as using sanitizers and masks and maintaining social distancing to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Individuals are widely educated about the safety measures against the disease through various modes such as announcements through online or physical awareness campaigns, advertisements in the media, and so on. The younger generations today spend considerably more time on mobile phones and games. However, there are very few applications or games aimed to help in practicing safety measures against a pandemic, which is much lesser in the case of Covid-19. Hence, we propose a 2D survival-based game, SurviveCovid-19, aimed to educate people about safety precautions to be taken for Covid-19 outside their homes by incorporating social distancing and usage of masks and sanitizers in the game. SurviveCovid-19 has been designed as an Android-based mobile game, along with a desktop (browser) version and has been evaluated through a remote quantitative user survey, with 30 volunteers using the questionnaire based on the MEEGA+ model. The survey results are promising, with all the survey questions having a mean value greater than 3.5. The game's quality factor was 69.3, indicating that the game could be classified as excellent quality, according to the MEEGA+ model.

AB  - Information and communication technology (ICT)-based reading interventions have potential to help children with reading difficulties, especially those in resource-constrained environments who otherwise might not have access to support. This pilot study aimed to describe the impact of an online, partner-supported reading intervention designed for South African children with reading difficulties. Objectives were to qualitatively describe participants' experience of the intervention, and quantitatively evaluate changes in reading accuracy, rate, comprehension and receptive vocabulary after intervention. Two studies were conducted: (1) A retrospective analysis using data from intervention in mainstream Cape Town schools with peers as reading partners; (2) A prospective study in a Cape Town school with special needs educational provision where speech-language therapists served as reading partners. Both studies used matched participant, pre/post intervention designs. A total of 40 children in grades 3 to 6 participated. In each study the intervention group (n = 20) received intervention 3 times per week (30 minutes per session) for 10 weeks, while the control group (n = 20) continued with regular school activities. Participants enjoyed the ICT-based intervention, valued the role of the reading partners, believed they had made literacy gains, and reported positive attitudinal and behavioural changes related to reading. Retrospective analysis revealed no statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups. The prospective study found a statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups' gains on one measure of reading rate, but no significant difference in reading accuracy, vocabulary or reading comprehension gains. The study provides a preliminary description of one ICT-based reading intervention. Although an intervention effect could not be demonstrated, the changes noted in reading rate together with qualitative findings suggest a need for further research.

AB  - Focusing on electrical circuits as the topic for a STEM project, this research aims to develop virtual reality media for student learning. Using virtual reality media to perform STEM electrical circuit activities, data was collected and analyzed. The virtual reality media was then evaluated by five experts who used the Index of Item-Objective Congruence (IOC) to assess its effectiveness, where the IOC for each criteria was 0.8 or higher. Moreover, after evaluating it with the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI), the arithmetic mean of its effectiveness on the diffusion of innovation was 4.32, with a 0.48 standard deviation. This demonstrates that the use of virtual reality media was a beneficial innovation at a high level. Afterwards, the developed virtual reality media was evaluated by a sample of 30 subjects in the areas of VR features, us-ability, learning experience, and VR measurement outcomes. The findings show that its arithmetic mean was 4.67 with a 0.47 standard deviation, meaning the developed virtual reality media was an effective for electrical circuit learning at the highest level. Furthermore, after evaluating its effectiveness in the area of information technology acceptance, it was found that, for these criteria, the arithmetic mean was 4.64 with a standard deviation of 0.48. This indicates that the subjects generally accepted the use of virtual reality media for use in learning STEM activities at the highest level. It can be said that the development of the virtual reality media for learning STEM activities with a focus on electrical circuits enhances the learning process of the learners who confirmed such statements at the highest level, with an increase in subject understanding of the learning activity and self-satisfaction, while at the same time reducing the prejudice learners have towards the study of electrical circuit installation.

AB  - Physical Education (PE) in school aims to help pupils experience the joy of movement through various forms of physical activity and to acquire a positive attitude to physical activity and exercise. The teacher's task is to mediate the joy of movement and instil a positive attitude to exercise in the pupils. Drawing on the methodology of van Manen [(2002). Writing in the dark: Phenomenological studies in interpretic inquiry. London: The Althouse Press], this article takes a closer look at mediating the joy of movement and conveying attitudes through legitimate, expert and referent power [French, J. R. P., & Raven, B. (1959). The bases of social power. In D. Cartwright (Ed.), Studies in social power (pp. 150-167). Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan] as narrated by an experienced Norwegian PE teacher. The teacher's narrative is interpreted within a framework where these typologies of power refer to the teacher's formal position in PE classes and the teacher's athletic skills and teaching qualities. The teacher's narrative indicates that legitimate, expert and referent power influence pupils' views on PE, attitudes and effort in class. Referent power provides the potential to instil attitudes in the pupils, even to the point of getting them to enjoy taking exercise to the limit. It even embraces teachers' potential to influence pupils by displaying their own active lifestyle, which goes beyond teaching itself. However, some problematic and unresolved issues are pointed out within this approach. A didactic approach, where the teachers use their own lifestyle as a pedagogical tool, may prompt a negative rather than a positive reaction from pupils, because they may be (mis) construed as being too eager and physically active to the extreme. Referent power depends on establishing credibility with the pupils, and conveying attitudes through referent power implies a didactic instability. On the other hand, the approach may be a good strategy for achieving what teachers should be trying to achieve, which is to convey and instil the joy of movement and a positive attitude to physical exercise in the pupils.

AB  - Background: Attrition, or nonuse of the intervention, is a significant problem in e-health. However, the reasons for this phenomenon are poorly understood. Building on Eysenbach's "Law of Attrition", this study aimed to explore the usage behavior of users of e-health services. We used two theoretical models, Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Service Utilization and Venkatesh's Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, to explore the factors associated with uptake and use of an internet-mediated intervention for caregivers taking care of a family member with dementia.
   Methods: A multiphase, longitudinal design was used to follow a convenience sample of 46 family caregivers who received an e-health intervention. Applying the two theories, usage behavior was conceptualized to form four stages: consideration, initiation, utilization (attrition or continuation), and outcome. The variables and measurement scales were selected based on these theories to measure the sociodemographic context, technology aptitudes, and clinical needs of the caregivers.
   Results: In the Consideration Stage, caregivers who felt that the information communication technology (ICT)-mediated service was easy to use were more likely to consider participating in the study (p = 0.04). In the Initiation Stage, caregivers who showed greater technology acceptance were more likely to initiate service earlier (p = 0.02). In the Utilization Stage, the frequent users were those who had a more positive attitude toward technology (p = 0.04) and a lower perceived caregiver competence (p = 0.04) compared with nonusers. In the Outcome Stage, frequent users experienced a decline in perceived burden compared with an escalation of perceived burden by nonusers (p = 0.02).
   Conclusions: We illustrate a methodological framework describing how to develop and expand a theory on attrition. The proposed framework highlighted the importance of conceptualizing e-health "use" and "adoption" as dynamic, continuous, longitudinal processes occurring in different stages, influenced by different factors to predict advancement to the next stage. Although usage behavior was influenced mainly by technological factors in the initial stages, both clinical and technological factors were equally important in the later stages. Frequency of use was associated with positive clinical outcomes. A plausible explanation was that intervention benefits motivated the caregivers to continue the service and regular use led to more positive clinical outcome.

AB  - Objective: Young children experience a significant amount of preoperative anxiety prior to surgical procedures and the induction of the general anaesthesia. Reducing preoperative anxiety is often performed by means of premedication. The use of medication has several side effects which could have a negative effect in children. The development and use of a non-pharmacological method for anxiety reduction prior to anaesthesia is subject of several recent studies. In this research paper the development of HospiAvontuur, a game for a smartphone or a mobile device, is described. The objective of the game is to inform young children (age group 4-7 years old) and their parents about an upcoming hospital admission for elective surgery.
   Materials and Methods: The game was developed and tested during different stages. In the first phase, stakeholders (i.e. children and their parents), were consulted about their views on preoperative preparation. In the second phase the essential game components were defined, followed by the game development. During the third phase the prototype version and the beta version of the game were tested with children of the age group.
   Results: Stakeholders showed a positive attitude towards a game for preoperative preparation for young children. Results from the testing of the game showed a positive result on the overall fun, characters appreciation and specific game elements appreciation. Children scored high on the knowledge questions.
   Conclusion: The final version of HospiAvontuur is a game to inform children and their parents for an upcoming admission at the hospital for elective surgery. The game was tested and optimised according to stakeholders feedback.

AB  - This paper identifies and empirically analyses the relationship between various social media motivational factors influencing attitude of Indian consumers towards eco-friendly products and their willingness to pay a premium price for them. Data was collected from 536 respondents who not only uses various social media channels for purchases and gaining information but also prefers eco-friendly products across India. EFA and SEM techniques were used. The findings confer consumer's concern for the environment is being shaped by six main social media motivational factors namely word of mouth, interaction, entertainment, trendiness, dependency and trust. The concern of the consumers impacts their attitude and the positive attitude so formed has a significant and positive impact on willingness of consumers. This research takes a lead in analysing the construct willingness to pay a premium for green products because this has been comparably less explored in Indian context.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate undergraduate students' attitudes to using visual media tools in the chemistry laboratory. One hundred and fifteen undergraduates studying science education at Dokuz Eylul University, Turkey participated in the study. They video-recorded chemistry experiments with visual media tools and assessed them on a social website. A Likert scale consisting of 29 items was developed to obtain the students' views on using visual media tools in the chemistry laboratory. The scale has a four-factor structure. The Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient was 0.95. In conclusion, this study found that using visual media tools in the general chemistry laboratory provides a positive contribution to students' behaviours and skills, improves students' learning attitudes to chemistry laboratory courses and increases their interest in visual media tools. The students also showed positive attitudes to the applicability of such tools.

KW  - EXPLANATION
AB  - Background: Despite hundreds of studies, there is continuing debate about the extent to which violent video games increase aggression. Believers argue that playing violent video games increases aggression, but this stance is disputed by skeptics. The present study addressed believers' and skeptics' responses to summaries of scientific studies that do or do not present evidence for increased aggression after violent video game play. Methods/Principal
   Findings: Participants (N = 662) indicated whether they believed that violent video games increase aggression. Afterwards, they evaluated two opposing summaries of fictitious studies on the effects of violent video play. They also reported whether their initial belief had changed after reading the two summaries and indicated again whether they believed that violent video games increase aggression. Results showed that believers evaluated the study showing an effect more favorably than a study showing no effect, whereas the opposite was observed for skeptics. Moreover, both believers and skeptics reported to become more convinced of their initial view. In contrast, for actual attitude change, a depolarization effect was found.
   Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that biased assimilation of new information leads believers and skeptics to become more rather than less certain of their views. Hence, even when confronted with mixed and inconclusive evidence, the perceived gap between both sides of the argument increases.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of study was to assess the relation between attitudes towards gender roles and domestic violence of nursing and paramedic students in a country in the north east of our country.
   Methodology: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was used. The study population consisted of 205 nursing and paramedic students in 2014-2015 academic year. The sample consisted of 160 students. Data were collected with the "Demographic Information Form", "The Attitudes Towards Domestic Violence Scale (ATDV)", and "The Gender Roles Attitudes Scale (GRA)". Data were analysed using descriptive statistics such as number, percentage, mean, standard deviation, median, 25th quarter and 75th quarter, Spearman's correlation analysis, and Mann Whitney U test.
   Results: The students had equalitarian gender roles and positive attitudes towards domestic violence. Spearman's correlation analysis indicated a positive moderate relation between the attitudes towards gender roles and domestic violence of the students (r=0.670, p<0.05). Female students had more egalitarian attitudes towards gender roles and more positive attitudes towards domestic violence than male students (p<0.05).
   Discussion: In conclusion, there is the relation between attitudes towards gender roles and domestic violence of nursing and paramedic students. In order that students can have positive attitudes towards domestic violence, inclusion of gender equality course in the curriculum has been recommended.

AB  - Aims Based on findings from population surveys, we provide an overview of the public's emotional reactions to people with mental illness. Methods A literature search for populations studies using measures of emotional response to people with mental illness was carried out. In addition, data on the public's emotional reactions, originating from representative surveys conducted in Germany in the years 1990, 1993 and 2001, were analysed. Results Positive emotional reactions to people with mental illness are most prevalent, followed by fear and anger. This pattern appears relatively stable across different cultures. In recent years, the emotional response of the public remained unchanged or even deteriorated. The public seems to react quite differently to people with different mental disorders. Emotional reactions have a substantial effect on the desire for social distance. The association between familiarity with mental disorder and the desire for social distance is to a considerable extent mediated through emotions. Conclusions The public's emotional reactions to people with mental disorder are relatively under-researched. More research may help better understand the complexities of the stigma surrounding mental illness. Interventions aimed at reducing the stigma of mental illness may benefit from paying more attention to emotions.

AB  - Background: To assess the attitude to and perception of transvaginal sonography (TVS) among Nigerian women of mixed educational status in order to ascertain factors that may prevent them from submitting to TVS when recommended.
   Methods: A Cross-sectional survey was adopted for the study. In all, one missionary, one government and eight private hospitals were enlisted. The instruments for data collection were visual analogue scale (VAS), to ascertain patients' pain/discomfort experience, and a researcher-developed semi-structured questionnaire. The level of pain/discomfort on the VAS was categorized into four on a scale of 100. The categories were: 0-5 (no pain), 6-40 (mild pain), 41-74 (moderate pain), and 75-100 (severe pain).
   Results: Majority (50.6%) of the respondents who attained secondary education had positive attitude to TVS. Also majority of the respondents (63.1%) preferred female sonographers. Majority of the respondents (54.1%) perceived TVS as not embarrassing, 78% did not consider it stressful, 96.9% reported that the sonographers were professional, 46.7% felt that a chaperon was needed, 98.4% reported there were enough privacy and 84. 7% reported they needed prior information. Most of the respondents (82%) were willing to consent to TVS in future, 90.5% reported no pain, 8.6% reported mild pain/discomfort and 0.9% reported moderate pain.
   Conclusions: Majority of our respondents had positive attitude to TVS and were willing to consent to TVS in future, hence it was acceptable to them. It was however observed that acceptability increased with increasing academic status.

AB  - Guided by the appraisal-tendency framework and construal level theory, this study investigates how emotional appeals (guilt vs. shame) and social distance frames (distant vs. proximal) influence college students' attitude toward bystander action campaign and intention to intervene in sexual violence situations. The findings indicated a two-way interaction effect between these two message factors on campaign attitude and behavior intention. Additionally, self-efficacy was found to be the mediator that underlying the proposed match-based effects. The findings provide theoretical implications into persuasive communication in the context of campus sexual violence bystander intervention and offer practical insights to advertisers and social/health marketers.

AB  - Gambling disorder (GD) is often considered as a problem of trait-like risk preference. However, the symptoms of GD cannot be fully understood by this trait view. In the present study, we hypothesized that GD patients also had problem with a flexible control of risk attitude (state-dependent strategy optimization), and aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying abnormal risk-taking of GD. To address this issue, we tested GD patients without comorbidity (GD group: n = 21) and age-matched healthy control participants (HC group: n = 29) in a multi-step gambling task, in which participants needed to clear 'block quota' (required units to clear a block, 1000-7000 units) in 20 choices, and conducted a task-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. Behavioral analysis indeed revealed a less flexible risk-attitude change in the GD group; the GD group failed to avoid risky choice in a specific quota range (low-quota condition), in which risky strategy was not optimal to solve the quota. Accordingly, fMRI analysis highlighted diminished functioning of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), which has been heavily implicated in cognitive flexibility. To our knowledge, the present study provided the first empirical evidence of a deficit of state-dependent strategy optimization in GD. Focusing on flexible control of risk attitude under quota may contribute to a better understanding of the psychopathology of GDs.

AB  - Wilderness medicine (WM) education has traditionally been conducted as in-person training. The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced medical schools to cancel clerkships and clinical electives and pivot to remote education. With online media modalities, it is possible to conduct a WM student elective remotely. The use of recorded audio lectures, instructional videos, choice-based simulations, and video conferencing allows students access to nearly all necessary content under the guidance of instructors. Although hands-on practicums are still essential to WM education, the process outlined here enables a temporary alternative during the time of necessary social distancing.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to measure university student attitudes toward their LGBT peers across a range of demographic factors. We surveyed 416 undergraduates at a midsize Midwestern American public university to measure attitudes toward LGBT people. Results from a general Attitudes scale and two subscales, Morality and Friendship, were analyzed across gender, age, ethnicity, LGBT status, and years spent at the university. Results were also broken out into attitudes about LGB vs. transgender people, and attitudes about gay or bisexual men vs. lesbian or bisexual women. We found that female gender, LGBT identification, age, and number of years spent at the university were associated with more positive attitudes about LGBT people. We did not find any association between ethnicity and attitudes. We also found that attitudes toward gay or bisexual men were less positive than attitudes toward lesbian or bisexual women, and that attitudes toward transgender individuals were less positive than attitudes toward LGB people. These results suggest that anti-bias campus trainings may be most effective when tailored for males, younger students, and non-LGBT students. Trainings should also focus on transgender issues, as this is a population about which many students have negative attitudes.

AB  - There is increasing recognition in the field of natural resource management that transformative adaptation to climate and policy change requires cross industry learning and cooperation at the landscape scale. This can be supported by the development of systematic methodology on learning models for adaptive co-management between diverse and conflicting landscape managers. Our example of land-use change to hardwood plantation forestry in sub-tropical Australia illustrates an innovative implementation framework for a social learning process that helped build knowledge and community capacity for adaptive co-management of dynamic and shared landscapes. The action research methodology relied on deliberation over local knowledge, existing and emergent scientific findings, resulting in attitudinal change. Processes required facilitation and mediation by a bridging organisation, in this case a research institution, to support cross-scale communications. Reflections suggest that attention is required to manage risk and support stakeholder analysis, particularly in understanding contested values and overcoming power differentials between industry and self-interest groups. Resolving funding issues will require greater consideration by governments and industry groups of their social responsibilities to communities and the environment; particularly as this social learning model is posited for more broad-scale use in providing multi-level governance linkages and as a basis for targeting interventions to address policy gaps or failure.

AB  - Purpose: The present study aims to develop a valid and reliable scale that measures attitude towards using technology in music education and to investigate pre-school and primary school pre-service teachers' attitudes towards using technology in music education concerning their demographic variables and musical experiences.
   Research Methods: A total of 640 students studying in pre-school and primary education departments at a public university in Turkey participated in this research (N=640). Data were collected using a questionnaire for collecting the demographic information and the musical background of the respondents in addition to Attitude towards Using Technology in Music Education Scale, which was developed by the researchers in this study.
   Findings: Analyses resulted in an 8-item Attitude towards Using Technology in Music Education Scale with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.931. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated a statistically significant model fit to the data with six indices indicating a good fit and three indicating a substantial fit. Attitude towards using technology in music education did not show any significant difference concerning gender and musical background. However, primary school pre-service teachers had a more positive attitude than those of pre-school pre-service teachers. Finally, age correlated with the attitude towards using technology in music education.
   Implications for Research and Practice: Attitude towards Using Technology in Music Education Scale is a valid and reliable research instrument. Having more experience in using technology or perceiving that the future profession and instructional program at the universities necessitate the use of technology improves attitude towards using technology. Positive attitudes of pre-service teachers, who feel themselves inadequate about using their voice and instruments, and have inadequate musical experience, maybe due to their belief that they will be able to compensate for these deficiencies in music with the opportunities offered by technology.

AB  - The sense of being connected with others through Social Networking Sites (SNS) can counteract feelings of loneliness. We examined whether subtle reminders of Facebook, the largest SNS, mitigate people's responses to ostracism (i.e., being ignored and excluded), taking into account individual differences in collectivistic orientation. We examined two typical responses to ostracism: interest in social contact (Study 1) and the need to belong (Study 2). After being included or ostracized in Cyberball, a Facebook (vs. Word) icon was displayed on the margin of a computer screen while participants focused on a primary task. We found three-way interactions between icon presentation, ostracism, and participants' horizontal collectivism. In the Facebook-icon (vs. Word-icon) condition, ostracized (vs. included) participants with higher (vs. lower) collectivistic orientation exhibited less compensatory interest in social contact (Study 1) and a greater recovery of their need to belong (Study 2). A meta-analytical synthesis of the effect sizes from the two studies suggests a significant, medium-sized effect of the moderation by collectivistic orientation. The findings suggest that thoughts about being connected through SNS can help people cope with threats to belonging, especially those who cherish relationships with equal others.

AB  - Robots are starting to be developed for aged care populations and some of these have been made into commercial products that have been well received. However, little is known about the psychological factors that promote acceptance or rejection of robots by older people. Finding out more about these psychological determinants of robot uptake and acceptance is the primary focus of the study described in this paper. A healthcare robot feasibility study was conducted in a retirement village. Older people (n = 25) were invited to use a prototype robot with healthcare functions over a two week period. Questionnaires were completed before and after the period. It was found that residents who held significantly more positive attitudes towards robots, and perceived robot minds to have less agency (ability to do things) were more likely to use the robot. It was also found that attitudes towards robots improved over time in robot-users. Our results suggest that the cognitions older people hold about robots may influence their decisions to use robots. The study results also validate participants' subjective self-reports of attitudes towards robots and perceptions of robot mind, against the objective measure of robot use. Interventions to foster adaptive cognitions could be developed and applied in the design, deployment and marketing of robots to promote their use and acceptance.

AB  - Objectives: Investigate the knowledge and attitudes of family physicians towards coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Methods: Data were collected from family medicine residents at King Fahd Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, using an online questionnaire that assessed demographics, knowledge about COVID-19, and attitudes towards the disease. Data were analyzed using Stata software version 14. Results: A total of 179 participants (median age: 28 years) responded; 94 (52.5%) were female. Average knowledge score on a scale of 0-10 was 8.64 +/- 0.97. Knowledge scores were similar between males and females (mean deviation *MD+ = -0.14, p = 0.3). Fourth-year residents had higher knowledge scores compared to those in their first (MD = 1.2, p<.001), second (MD = 0.82, p = 0.001), or third (MD = 0.69, p = 0.02) years. Mean attitude score on a scale of 0-18 was 15.6 +/- 1.3. Females exhibited slightly higher positive attitude scores (MD = 0.44, p = 0.02). Conclusion: Residents demonstrated high knowledge and positive attitudes towards COVID-19. More experienced physicians exhibited higher knowledge scores; attitude scores were independent of experience.

AB  - This study examines whether interactive affordances of an anti-secondhand-smoking website can induce college students' behavioral and attitudinal changes. A single factor experiment (the interactive vs. control condition) with 239 non-smoking college students was conducted to investigate the mechanism by which modality interactivity enhances user attitudes toward the website and their intention to avoid second-hand smoke (SHS). Built upon previous interactivity and user interface literature, interface assessment and perceived contingency were hypothesized to mediate the effects of interactivity on persuasive outcomes. The results demonstrated the main effect of modality interactivity on attitudes towards the website and its indirect effect on SHS avoidance intention after controlling for issue involvement and self-efficacy in avoiding SHS. Both relationships were significantly and positively mediated by interface assessment but not by perceived contingency. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - A mathematical model of COVID-19 is presented where the decision to increase or decrease social distancing is modelled dynamically as a function of the measured active and total cases as well as the perceived cost of isolating. Along with the cost of isolation, we define an overburden healthcare cost and a total cost. We explore these costs by adjusting parameters that could change with policy decisions. We observe that two disease prevention practices, namely increasing isolation activity and increasing incentive to isolate do not always lead to optimal health outcomes. We demonstrate that this is due to the fatigue and cost of isolation. We further demonstrate that an increase in the number of lock-downs, each of shorter duration can lead to minimal costs. Our results are compared with case data in Ontario, Canada from March to August 2020 and details of expanding the results to other regions are presented.

AB  - There are complex relationships among individual, family, community, and social factors related to breastfeeding. Immigrant mothers, specifically, face several unique challenges to practicing breastfeeding while negotiating these factors within two cultural worlds. Grounded in the theory of planned behavior and the ecological perspective, our qualitative study findings unveil a part of the complex and dynamic process of breastfeeding decision-making among Korean immigrant mothers in the United States. To elicit mothers' underlying beliefs of attitude and intention toward breastfeeding as immigrants, we conducted in-person interviews with 13 pregnant and postpartum Korean immigrant mothers, ages ranging from 30 to 39. The findings revealed that Korean mothers held positive attitudes toward breastfeeding. However, translation of these positive attitudes toward breastfeeding into actual practice depended on the feasibility of actual breastfeeding by mothers. To overcome several barriers to breastfeeding, such as inadequate milk supply, health concerns, employment status, and the relationship with a firstborn child, many Korean mothers combined breastfeeding with formula feeding. The factors that shaped the development of beliefs and behavioral intentions toward breastfeeding among Korean immigrant mothers included the dynamic family interactions with their children, husbands, mothers, mothers-in-law, and sisters; support from friends and infant care experts; information available through various technology and media; and Korean-specific cultural traditions. Our findings suggest possible directions for future cross-cultural research on breastfeeding within diverse family contexts, and may inform the design of population specific intervention programs.

AB  - Previous findings demonstrate that believing in the value of diverse groups is related to positive attitudes toward immigrants. Based on these results, we hypothesized that pro-diversity beliefs are negatively related to discrimination of immigrants. In a representative multinational survey study (Study 1; N = 6,500), we demonstrate that diversity beliefs of nonimmigrant citizens from seven different European countries are negatively related to their discriminatory behavioral tendencies against immigrants. Moreover, it is revealed that this relationship is mediated by reduced realistic and symbolic threat. These findings are replicated in an experimental study (Study 2; N = 64), which confirms that diversity beliefs causally influence discriminatory behavioral tendencies. However, in the economic context of Study 2, the relationship is mediated by realistic but not by symbolic threat.

AB  - This study examines mediators of the relationship between news consumption and political participation in the contemporary news environment. We test the differential effects exerted by pro- and counter-attitudinal news compared with balanced news on intended participation. Our primary objective is to model three paths that may link news exposure and participation: cognitive (i.e., perceived issue understanding), affective (i.e., emotions evoked by a news story), and attitudinal (i.e., attitude strength). We compare these paths across four issues, testing which is strongest. Relying on a large survey-based experiment on a representative sample of the American population (N=2,300), we find that pro-attitudinal exposure increases intended participation relative to balanced news exposure, while the effects of counter-attitudinal news do not differ from those exerted by balanced news. Issue understanding, anger, positive emotions, and attitude strength all mediate the relationship between pro-attitudinal exposure and intended participation, with the route via attitude strength being strongest. These effects do not depend on whether exposure is self-selected or experimentally assigned.

AB  - Psychological intimate partner violence (IPV) is the most prevalent form of IPV and is often thought to precede physical IPV. However, psychological IPV often occurs independently of other forms of IPV, and it can often emerge during routine relationship interactions. Using data from imprisoned male offenders we investigate the effect of hostile and benevolent sexist attitudes on psychological IPV and the hypothesized mediating role of positive attitudes toward IPV and this effect when accounting for broader risk factors at the levels of community (social disorder), family-of-origin (conflictive climate in family of origin), and personality (antisocial personality traits) variables. The sample involved 196 male inmates of the Penitentiary Center of Villabona (Asturias, Spain). Structural equation models result showed significant total, direct and indirect effect of hostile sexism on psychological IPV, but not of benevolent sexism. When individual, family-of-origin, and community variables were considered, however, hostile sexism showed only an indirect effect on psychological IPV via positive attitudes toward abuse. These results are discussed in light of the debate of the role of sexist attitudes in the psychological IPV explanation when broader models are considered.

AB  - Shopping at low-cost supermarkets has been associated with higher obesity rates. This study examined whether attitudes toward healthy eating are independently associated with diet quality among shoppers at low-cost, medium-cost, and high-cost supermarkets. Data on socioeconomic status (SES), attitudes toward healthy eating, and supermarket choice were collected using a telephone survey of a representative sample of adult residents of King County, WA. Dietary intake data were based on a food frequency questionnaire. Thirteen supermarket chains were stratified into three categories: low, medium, and high cost, based on a market basket of 100 commonly eaten foods. Diet-quality measures were energy density, mean adequacy ratio, and total servings of fruits and vegetables. The analytical sample consisted of 963 adults. Multivariable regressions with robust standard error examined relations between diet quality, supermarket type, attitudes, and SES. Shopping at higher-cost supermarkets was associated with higher-quality diets. These associations persisted after adjusting for SES, but were eliminated after taking attitudinal measures into account. Supermarket shoppers with positive attitudes toward healthy eating had equally higher-quality diets, even if they shopped at low-, medium-, or high-cost supermarkets, independent of SES and other covariates. These findings imply that shopping at low-cost supermarkets does not prevent consumers from having high-quality diets, as long as they attach importance to good nutrition. Promoting nutrition-education strategies among supermarkets, particularly those catering to low-income groups, can help to improve diet quality.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of cognitive load and game involvement on consumers' affective responses while comparing single and multi-brand settings in advergames. An experiment was conducted to study the differences between single and multi-brand settings at different levels of cognitive load, with the interaction of game involvement. Results showed that although there was no significant attitude difference towards single and multi-brand settings in advergames, the players' attitude towards the main brand is more positive in a single brand setting. Second, different levels of cognitive load affect attitude towards the main brand both in single and multi-brand settings, but the attitude change is observed only in single brand setting at high cognitive load. The results of the third analysis yielded that game involvement along with high cognitive load affects all attitudes positively.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The middle clinoid process (MCP) is a bony projection that extends from the sphenoid bone near the lateral margin of the sella turcica. The varied prevalence and morphological features of the MCP in populations stratified by age, race, and sex are unknown; however, the knowledge of its anatomy and preoperative recognition on CT scans can aid greatly in complication avoidance and management. The aim of this study was to further illustrate the surgical anatomy of the parasellar region and to quantify the incidence of MCP and caroticoclinoid rings (CCRs) in dried preserved human anatomical specimens.
   METHODS The presence, dimensions, morphological classification (incomplete, contact, and CCR), and intracranial relations of the MCP were measured in 2726 dried skull specimens at the Hamann-Todd Osteological Collection at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. Specific morphometric data points were recorded from each of these hemiskulls, and categorized based on age, sex, and ethnicity. Linear and logistic regressions were used to determine associations between explanatory variables and MCP morphology. Computed tomography scans of the skull specimens were obtained to explore radiological landmarks for different types of MCPs. Illustrative intraoperative videos were also analyzed in the light of these crucial surgical landmarks.
   RESULTS The sample included 2250 specimens from males and 476 from females. Specimens were classified as either "white" (60.5%) or "black" (39.2%). An MCP was found in 42% of specimens, with 60% of those specimens presenting bilaterally. Fully ossified CCR comprised 27% of all MCPs, and contact (defined as contact without ossification between MCP and anterior clinoid process) comprised 4% of all MCPs. White race (relative to black race) and increasing age were significant predictors of MCP presence (p < 0.001). White race was significantly associated with greater average MCP height (p < 0.001). Among skulls with CCR, both male sex and older age (>70 years relative to < 50 years) were associated with increased CCR diameter (p < 0.001). No other significant predictors or associations were observed. The CT scans of skulls replicated and validated the authors' morphometric observations on incomplete, contact, and CCR patterns adequately. The surgical strategies of clinoid bone removal are validated, with appropriate video illustrations.
   CONCLUSIONS Variations in the patterns of bony MCPs can pose a significant risk for injury to the internal carotid artery during parasellar procedures, especially those involving clinoidectomy and optic strut drilling. Understanding parasellar anatomy, especially on skull-base CT imaging, may be integral to surgical planning and preoperative risk counseling in both transcranial and extended endonasal procedures, as well as to preparing for complications management perioperatively.

AB  - Purpose: Patient race has been shown to predict for differences in outcomes and has been attributed to socioeconomic factors such as social support and access to healthcare. In head and neck cancer (HNC), a disease without recommended screening, we sought to investigate the association between race, treatment delays and outcome.
   Methods: Records of 1802 patients with non-metastatic squamous cell HNC treated between 1998 and 2013 were retrospectively assessed from an institutional database. Patient demographics, tumor and treatment characteristics, and patient outcomes were abstracted from the chart. Differences between groups were assessed via logistic regression multivariate analysis (MVA). Outcomes including locoregional control (LRC) and overall survival (OS) were then estimated via Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression MVA.
   Results: Median follow up was 34 months. Patient races included white (n = 1671, 93%), black (n = 80, 4%), Asian (n = 18, 1%), and other (n = 33, 2%). On logistic regression MVA, Black patients were less likely to be married (39% vs. 63%; OR 0.5 95% CI 0.30-0.83, p = 0.007) or be currently employed (43% vs. 61%; OR 0.44 95% CI 0.26-0.74, p = 0.002) when compared to non-blacks. Black patients were also younger (54 vs. 59 years, p = 0.001), more likely to present with advanced tumor stage (T4: 48% vs. 25%), and more often had > 45 days elapsed from diagnosis to treatment initiation (DTI) (61% vs. 49%, p = 0.028). Delays in treatment, such as delayed diagnosis (advanced disease presentation) and delays in DTI > 45 days were also associated with marital and employment status.
   Black patients were associated with a lower 3-year LRC rate (65% vs. 81%, p < 0.001) and OS rate (43% vs. 69%, p < 0.001), compared to non-black patients. Patients with > 45 days DTI had a detriment in 3-year LRC (77% vs. 83%, p = 0.002) and OS (66% vs. 69%, p = 0.009). On Cox MVA, black race was independently prognostic for worse LRC (HR 1.62 95% CI 1.04-2.51, p = 0.033) and OS (HR 1.55 95% CI 1.15-2.08, p = 0.004) vs. non-blacks.
   Conclusion: Black race is independently prognostic for LRC and OS. Delays in HNC treatment, such as more advanced tumor stage presentation and delays in treatment initiation, may be attributed to socioeconomic factors such as employment status and social support. Efforts to accommodate these factors may expedite treatment, in hopes of improving the race related outcome disparity in HNC. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - COVID-19 significantly altered individual patterns of interaction across the globe. The impediment on physical contact and emphasis on social distancing as measures of curbing its spread gave rise to new forms of interactions among individuals. In the ensuing new normal, digital life took the center stage, anchoring engaging and meaningful interactions of individuals in both public and private spheres. This study appraises the adoption of digital life in Nigeria during this period. Hinged on the technological determinism theory, the study examines the sudden digital migration in Nigeria and identifies the factors that facilitated the process, on the one hand, and the obstacles that inhibited it, on the other. Using secondary data derived from books, official websites, and media reports, the study has established that although the Nigerian society adopted digital life as alternative to face-to-face interactions out of expedience, a combination of systemic, structural, socioeconomic, and environmental factors constrained the process with grave implications on the overall (expected) impact to both individual and national developments. The study concludes that effective digitization in Nigeria requires a holistic approach toward addressing germane issues that retard socioeconomic development in the country-such as endemic poverty, structural inequality and class differences, uneven development between urban and rural communities, low computer literacy and information and communications technology (ICTs) access, poor electricity supply, poor global system for mobile communication (GSM) and Internet access, gender factor and vulnerable groups, and digital frauds-in order to create the enabling environment for productive digitization to thrive.

AB  - Background: The purpose of the present study was to investigate how an athlete's participation in either an individual or team sport is related to their attitude toward sport psychology consulting and their willingness to consult a sport psychology practitioner.
   Method: The Sport Psychology Attitudes-Revised form (SPA-R) (Martin, et al., Sport Psychol 16:272-90, 2020) was completed by 120 athletes from individual and team sports. A 2 (Type of sport: individual and team) x 2 (Gender) multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted with attitudes towards sport psychology as dependent variables. To identify attitudes that accentuated the differences related to type of sport, follow-up univariate analyses were performed.
   Results: Results revealed that overall athletes involved in individual sports reported more positive attitudes towards sport psychology consulting than athletes involved in team sports. In particular, the athletes involved in individual sports were more likely to have greater confidence in sport psychology consulting. The findings also show that gender may mediate this association, indicated by a nearly significant two-way interaction effect for gender and type of sport (individual versus team) regarding confidence in sport psychology. The source of this marginal result was a larger effect of sport type for females than for males.
   Conclusions: The findings of this study imply that athletes involved in individual sports are more likely to have positive attitudes towards sport psychology compared to athletes competing in team-based sports, with females more likely to view sport psychology positively than compared to their male counterparts. The results may go some way to assist sport psychologists to understand and address athletes' concerns and to improve receptivity to sport psychology services.

AB  - Objective: This study assessed knowledge and attitudes of undergraduate nursing students toward epilepsy and patients with epilepsy (PWEs). Associations between different sociodemographic and academic variables and knowledge and attitude scores were also assessed.
   Methods: The present study was conducted in a cross-sectional observational design among Palestinian undergraduate nursing students using a prevalidated and reliable questionnaire of 38 items. After collecting sociodemographic and academic characteristics, students answered a knowledge test (16 items) and attitude test (13 items).
   Results: The questionnaire was completed by 342 nursing students. The median knowledge score was 65.6 with an interquartile range (IQR) of 31.3, and the median attitude score was 81.5 with an IQR of 20.0. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that higher knowledge scores were predicted by being female in gender (p-value <0.05), had a course/studied about epilepsy (p-value <0.001), self-rated knowledge about epilepsy as high (pvalue <0.05), and ever witnessing a PWE experiencing seizures (p-value <0.001). Higher attitude scores were predicted by self-rated knowledge about epilepsy as high (p-value <0.001), had a course/studied about epilepsy (p-value <0.05), and ever witnessed a PWE experiencing seizures (p-value <0.05).
   Conclusion: Nursing students had moderate knowledge of epilepsy and had generally positive attitudes toward PWEs. Findings of this study highlighted knowledge gaps and areas for improvement. As knowledge scores were positively correlated with attitudes, probably, findings of this study might suggest that educational/training interventions can improve knowledge as well as positive attitudes of nursing students with regard to epilepsy and PWEs.

AB  - Two experiments carried out in Spain and the Netherlands tested the joint effects of imagined contact and similarity with a narrative protagonist on attitudes and behavioral intentions related to stigmatized immigrants. We advance a concept of optimal reception condition: imagining a positive interaction with an immigrant before reading a testimonial of an immigrant who is similar to the native audience. The optimal reception condition induced greater identification and transportation than the reference condition, leading to more positive attitudes and a higher intention of intergroup contact. The findings are discussed in the context of research on narrative persuasion and prejudice reduction.

AB  - Purpose Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has shifted purchase behavior and accelerated the diffusion of modern retail channels via mobile application (or m-application). This work aims to frame a mechanism of m-application-based behavioral intentions in the COVID-19 context. Design/methodology/approach The authors designed a web-based survey to retrieve empirical data from 478 Vietnamese users. Quantitative approach and structural equation modeling (SEM) were employed to test a research model. Findings Findings reveal that antecedents of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) (i.e. performance expectancy and facilitating conditions), external influences (i.e. perceived imitation), m-application-related factors (i.e. additive value and alternative attractiveness) and COVID-19-related factors of Protective Motivation Theory (PMT) (i.e. perceived contraction threat, fear and social distancing) are determinants of use intention. Moreover, COVID-19-related dimensions and use intention have direct and indirect positive influences on purchase intention. Practical implications Practitioners should stay agile and focus greater attention on a mechanism in which consumer adoption and purchase intention are formulated in the pandemic. Originality/value This work narrows the gap by simultaneously identifying the importance of the dimensions from UTAUT and COVID-19-related factors from PMT, especially social distancing, integrated with additive value and alternative attractiveness of m-applications in forming the behavioral intention model in a disease context.

T2  - LINGUISTICA ANTVERPIENSIA NEW SERIES-THEMES IN TRANSLATION STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - In this article we explore interpreter ethics in China's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression (1937-1945). Interpreter ethics in conflict zones may be divided into professional and situation ethics, and situation ethics is the focus of this study. Apart from professional identity and ideology, interpreters have other identities and ideologies such as national identity and political ideology, especially when they belong to either of the conflicting parties. The concepts of ethics, identity and ideology remain unchanged when they are related to interpreting as a profession. However, they have different connotations when they are associated with a nation, a group or a community. As mediators across languages and cultures, interpreters are more likely to face moral crises in wartime than in peacetime. Therefore, in many cases, they have to violate professional ethics in order to follow situation ethics, and situation ethics varies with their identities and ideologies. The research findings show that during the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, interpreters' national identity remained the same but their moral attitude changed.

AB  - This chapter reviews a research programme on the effects of humour in advertising on positive and negative brand associations and brand choice, and integrates the findings into a single overarching model. Based on the Associative and Propositional Processes Model of Evaluation (Gawronski & Bodenhausen, 2006, 2007, 2011), we propose that repeated pairings of a novel brand with brand-unrelated humour forms positive brand associations, which mediate spontaneous brand choice. This associative process was found to be independent from the level of distraction posed by humour and from awareness of the stimulus pairings. In fact the distraction posed by humour benefits persuasion by preventing negative brand associations. Previous marketing research, which mainly viewed humour as a cue in peripheral processing, was rather pessimistic about the persuasive impact of humour. In contrast, this research programme suggests that a repeated pairing of a brand with humour affects the brand's underlying associative structure, which may lead to stable attitude changes that guide overt spontaneous brand choice. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - This study develops the concept of brand interactivity based on the characteristics and definitions of interactivity and applies it to advergames. Brand interactivity is significant in advertising research and practice because this concept extends the perspective of interactivity from media to brands. The results of an experiment indicate that consumers have more positive attitudes toward a brand and stronger purchase intentions when playing advergames with brand interactivity rather than without brand interactivity. As this study shows, the role of brand interactivity in advergames provides insights for advertising scholars and practitioners seeking ways to improve consumers' experience with brands through interactive media.

AB  - Background: Health behavior is influenced by culture and social context. However, there are limited data evaluating the scope of these influences on COVID-19 response.
   Objective: This study aimed to compare handwashing and social distancing practices in different countries and evaluate practice predictors using the health belief model (HBM).
   Methods: From April 11 to May 1, 2020, we conducted an online, cross-sectional survey disseminated internationally via social media. Participants were adults aged 18 years or older from four different countries: the United States, Mexico, Hong Kong (China), and Taiwan. Primary outcomes were self-reported handwashing and social distancing practices during COVID-19. Predictors included constructs of the HBM: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy, and cues to action. Associations of these constructs with behavioral outcomes were assessed by multivariable logistic regression.
   Results: We analyzed a total of 71,851 participants, with 3070 from the United States, 3946 from Mexico, 1201 from Hong Kong (China), and 63,634 from Taiwan. Of these countries, respondents from the United States adhered to the most social distancing practices (chi(2)(3)=2169.7, P<.001), while respondents from Taiwan performed the most handwashing (chi(2)(3)=309.8, P<.001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that self-efficacy was a positive predictor for handwashing (odds ratio [OR](United States) 1.58, 95% CI 1.21-2.07; ORMexico 1.5, 95% CI 1.21-1.96; ORHong Kong 2.48, 95% CI 1.80-3.44; ORTaiwan 2.30, 95% CI 2.21-2.39) and social distancing practices (ORUnited States 1.77, 95% CI 1.24-2.49; ORMexico 1.77, 95% CI 1.40-2.25; ORHong Kong 3.25, 95% CI 2.32-4.62; ORTaiwan 2.58, 95% CI 2.47-2.68) in all countries. Handwashing was positively associated with perceived susceptibility in Mexico, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, while social distancing was positively associated with perceived severity in the United States, Mexico, and Taiwan.
   Conclusions: Social media recruitment strategies can be used to reach a large audience during a pandemic. Self-efficacy was the strongest predictor for handwashing and social distancing. Policies that address relevant health beliefs can facilitate adoption of necessary actions for preventing COVID-19. Our findings may be explained by the timing of government policies, the number of cases reported in each country, individual beliefs, and cultural context.

AB  - Many studies of police body cameras explored the officers' attitudes towards their use. Much of this research examined the relationship between officers' characteristics and their attitudes toward body cameras. Missing from the scholarship are measures of general policing attitudes and their impact on body camera attitudes. This study explored the possibility that officers' positive attitudes toward body cameras are mediated by their outlooks toward law enforcement, perceptions of citizen cooperation, or levels of distrust of the public. A convenience sample of police officers from two Northeastern police agencies completed an online survey. Structural equation modeling indicates that officers with an orientation toward aggressive law enforcement are more likely to have a positive view of BWC effects on job performance and community relations. Officers with a positive outlook on citizen cooperation are more likely to have a positive view of BWC effects on job performance and community relations. Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Simulation-based training has seen an increased use of extended reality, that is, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) displays. The health professions have been using VR for simulation-based training more extensively than others. This method can offer the possibility of immediate feedback, which promotes more accurate training to self-correct mistakes in environments that are otherwise risky or provide unsafe conditions. The nuclear industry has attempted to seize the same digital and educational transformation to train their personnel to handle dangerous scenarios. We ran a pilot study with the aim of evaluating the VR training scenario developed for the specific target group and the acceptance of the VR technology itself for this kind of training. We used the Kirkpatrick framework to evaluate the training and the VR-HAM acceptance model to evaluate the acceptance of VR. A VR scenario was developed to test specific technical skills of nuclear power plant personnel. The 13 participants showed results within the basic level of the Kirkpatrick framework and held both positive reactions and concerns, that is, they enjoyed the training with VR and expressed concerns regarding the stability of the VR technology. The participants also showed positive attitudes towards the perceived ease of use and usefulness of the VR-HAM and its various constructs. Even though the COVID-19 pandemic limited our testing, we could show valuable data and positive attitudes and perceived ease by the participants. Simulation-based VR training could be an important complement to traditional training methods, especially where safety is a priority, but we still need to provide solid evidence.

AB  - This paper argues that the enjoyment of interactive media, especially interactive narratives, can be explained via perceptions of control. Specifically, control over a character's choices, lead to higher perceptions of control which increased user enjoyment. Three different experiments using varying narratives, grammatical perspectives and story outcomes support these arguments consistently. This series of studies demonstrates that perceptions of control over media characters facilitate positive attitudes toward media content, corroborating and expanding upon earlier entertainment research. This research demonstrates a low-tech application of content-based user control in new media environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective-We sought to assess the impact of smoking status, cumulative pack-years, and time since cessation (the latter in former smokers only) on 3 important domains of cardiovascular disease: inflammation, vascular dynamics and function, and subclinical atherosclerosis.
   Approach and Results-The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort enrolled 6814 adults without prior cardiovascular disease. Smoking variables were determined by self-report and confirmed with urinary cotinine. We examined cross-sectional associations between smoking parameters and (1) inflammatory biomarkers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP], interleukin-6, and fibrinogen); (2) vascular dynamics and function (brachial flow-mediated dilation and carotid distensibility by ultrasound, as well as aortic distensibility by MRI); and (3) subclinical atherosclerosis (coronary artery calcification, carotid intima-media thickness, and ankle-brachial index). We identified 3218 never smokers, 2607 former smokers, and 971 current smokers. Mean age was 62 years and 47% were male. There was no consistent association between smoking and vascular distensibility or flow-mediated dilation outcomes. However, compared with never smokers, the adjusted association between current smoking and measures of either inflammation or subclinical atherosclerosis was consistently stronger than for former smoking (eg, odds ratio for hsCRP>2 mg/L of 1.7 [95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.1] versus 1.2 [1.1-1.4], odds ratio for coronary artery calcification> 0 of 1.8 [1.5-2.1] versus 1.4 [1.2-1.6], respectively). Similar associations were seen for interleukin-6, fibrinogen, carotid intima-media thickness, and ankle-brachial index. A monotonic association was also found between higher pack-year quartiles and increasing inflammatory markers. Furthermore, current smokers with hsCRP> 2 mg/L were more likely to have increased carotid intima-media thickness, abnormal ankle-brachial index, and coronary artery calcification> 75th percentile for age, sex, and race (relative to smokers with hsCRP<2 mg/L, interaction P<0.05 for all 3 outcomes). In contrast, time since quitting in former smokers was independently associated with lower inflammation and atherosclerosis (eg, odds ratio for hsCRP> 2 mg/L of 0.91 [0.88-0.95] and odds ratio for coronary artery calcification> 0 of 0.94 [0.90-0.97] for every 5-year cessation interval).
   Conclusions-These findings expand our understanding of the harmful effects of smoking and help explain the cardiovascular benefits of smoking cessation.

AB  - Fake news has recently garnered increased attention across the world. Digital collaboration technologies now enable individuals to share information at unprecedented rates to advance their own ideologies. Much of this sharing occurs via social networking sites (SNSs), whose members may choose to share information without consideration for its authenticity. This research advances our understanding of information verification behaviors among SNS users in the context of fake news. Grounded in literature on the epistemology of testimony and theoretical perspectives on trust, we develop a news verification behavior research model and test six hypotheses with a survey of active SNS users. The empirical results confirm the significance of all proposed hypotheses. Perceptions of news sharers' network (perceived cognitive homogeneity, social tie variety, and trust), perceptions of news authors (fake news awareness and perceived media credibility), and innate intentions to share all influence information verification behaviors among SNS members. Theoretical implications, as well as implications for SNS users and designers, are presented in the light of these findings.

AB  - Purpose: Using the theory of reasoned action (TRA), this research examined predictors of sexual intercourse among first-and second-year college women. Methods: Participants completed a confidential self-administered questionnaire on their attitude, subjective norm, and intention regarding sexual intercourse and their behavioral beliefs about the consequences of abstinence and sexual intercourse. Results: At baseline, 58 (34%) of the 172 participants (mean age = 18.2; SD = 0.56) reported ever having sexual intercourse, and 41 (24%) reported having sexual intercourse within the last three months. Proportional-odds analysis on baseline data revealed that attitude and subjective norm were associated with a greater intention to have intercourse, as was relationship status (i.e. being in a relationship), a variable external to the TRA. Three-month follow-up questionnaires were completed by 165 (96%) of the participants. Logistic regression indicated that baseline intention and relationship status predicted self-reported sexual intercourse three months later. Examination of the relation of behavioral beliefs to attitude revealed that beliefs about the positive consequences of abstinence were associated with a negative attitude toward intercourse, whereas beliefs about the negative consequences of intercourse were unrelated to attitude toward intercourse. Being in a relationship and alcohol use were also related to positive attitude toward intercourse. Conclusions: These results suggest that, for college women, the TRA is a useful model of sexual behavior and that abstinence interventions may be a viable risk-reduction approach if the abstinence message is framed to emphasize the positive consequences of abstinence rather than the negative consequences of sexual intercourse.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Phyllodes tumors (PT) are rare breast malignancies accounting for 0.5% to 1% of all breast tumors. PT have unpredictable behavior, with recurrence rates as high as 40%. A dearth of information exists about racial differences; elucidation of these differences is the objective of this study.
   STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of patients treated for PT at either Moffitt Cancer Center or University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio from 1999 to 2010.
   RESULTS: Of the 124 patients, 71 (57%) were treated at Moffitt Cancer Center and 53 (42%) at University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio. Mean age at diagnosis was 44 years (15 to 70 years). Thirty-three patients required mastectomy. Combining both cohorts, 42% of the patients were Caucasian, 43% were Hispanic, and 12% were black. Tumors were benign in 49% patients, borderline in 35%, and malignant in 16%, with a higher percentage of borderline and malignant tumors in Hispanic patients (p < 0.01). Hispanic patients tended to have larger tumors and higher mitotic rates (p = 0.01; p = 0.03). At a median follow-up time of 13 months, the local recurrence rate (6.4%) was associated with tumor size, tumor grade, mitotic rate, and close margin status (<2 mm) (p < 0.01; p < 0.01; p = 0.01; p = 0.04). However, these findings did not translate into a survival difference by race.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this multi-institutional review of PT we found substantial pathologic differences by race with higher-grade tumors present more often in Hispanic patients. These differences did not substantially affect outcomes at short-term follow-up. Further investigation into additional molecular, biologic factors, geographic impact, and socioeconomic factors is needed to more clearly delineate this finding. (J Am Coll Surg 2011;213:537-542.

AB  - Background and aims: Excessive use of social networking sites (SNS) has recently been conceptualized as a behavioral addiction (i.e., "disordered SNS use") using key criteria for the diagnosis of substance dependence and shown to be associated with a variety of impairments in psychosocial functioning, including an increased risk of problem drinking. This study sought to characterize associations between "disordered SNS use" and attitudes towards alcohol, drinking motives, and adverse consequences resulting from alcohol use in young adults. Methods: Undergraduate students (n = 537, 64.0% female, mean age = 19.63 years, SD = 4.24) reported on their use of SNSs and completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, Temptation and Restraint Inventory, Approach and Avoidance of Alcohol and Drinking Motives Questionnaires, and Drinker Inventory of Consequences. Results: Respondents meeting previously established criteria for "disordered SNS use" were significantly more likely to use alcohol to cope with negative affect and to conform to perceived social norms, reported significantly more conflicting (i.e., simultaneous positive and negative) attitudes towards alcohol, and had experienced significantly more, and more frequent adverse consequences from drinking in their inter-and intrapersonal, physical, and social functioning, compared to individuals without problems related to SNS use. Discussion and conclusions: Findings add to an emerging body of literature suggesting a link between excess or maladaptive SNS use and problems related to alcohol in young adults and point to emotion dysregulation and coping motives as potential shared risk factors for substance and behavioral addictions in this demographic.

AB  - Objectives: A three-member central Rapid Response Team (RRT) was deputed to Union Territory of Ladakh on 26th March 2020, to assess the situation and support the preparedness measures including implementation of cluster containment plan and social distancing measures for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: Central RRT addressed the panchayat sarpanch and religious leaders, sensitized doctors and paramedical staff on COVID-19 situation; conducted situational analysis, review of records and logistics, key informant interviews of senior administrative and healthcare officials, focus group discussions with local community people and field visits to various hospitals, isolation centers, quarantine facilities, and containment zones. Results: A total of 14 COVID-19 cases with no deaths were reported and nine patients had recovered till 4 April 2020. The median (range) age of positive cases was found to be 32.5 (6 months-76 years) years and overall attack rate was 1.65 per 1000 population. Ladakh Government declared Chuchot Gongma, Yokma and Sankoo as the containment zones and deputed surveillance teams. A total of 2397 persons were quarantined and 496 samples were tested from Ladakh. COVID-19 sample testing, Srinagar-Leh highway opening and Iran pilgrimage returnees were the major challenges identified. Conclusions: The Ladakh government must continue the robust surveillance system and stringent strategies in key areas for management of COVID-19 namely - aggressive screening and testing, isolation, quarantine, hand hygiene, respiratory etiquettes and social distancing.

KW  - SPREAD
AB  - During outbreaks of infectious diseases with high morbidity and mortality, individuals closely follow media reports of the outbreak. Many will attempt to minimize contacts with other individuals in order to protect themselves from infection and possibly death. This process is called social distancing. Social distancing strategies include restricting socializing and travel, and using barrier protections. We use modeling to show that for short-term outbreaks, social distancing can have a large influence on reducing outbreak morbidity and mortality. In particular, public health agencies working together with the media can significantly reduce the severity of an outbreak by providing timely accounts of new infections and deaths. Our models show that the most effective strategy to reduce infections is to provide this information as early as possible, though providing it well into the course of the outbreak can still have a significant effect. However, our models for long-term outbreaks indicate that reporting historic infection data can result in more infections than with no reporting at all. We examine three types of media influence and we illustrate the media influence with a simulated outbreak of a generic emerging infectious disease in a small city. Social distancing can never be complete; however, for a spectrum of outbreaks, we show that leaving isolation ( stopping applying social distancing measures) for up to 4 hours each day has modest effect on the overall morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Social networks have become one of the major and important parts of daily life. Besides sharing ones views the social networking sites can also be very efficiently used to judge the behavior and attitude of individuals towards the posts. Analysis of the mood of public on a particular social issue can be judged by several methods. Analysis of the society mood towards any particular news in form of tweets is investigated in this paper. The key objective behind this research is to increase the accuracy and effectiveness of the classification by the process of Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques while focusing on semantics and World Sense Disambiguation. The process of classification includes the combination of the effect of various independent classifiers on one particular classification problem. The data that is available in the form of tweets on twitter can easily frame the insight of the public attitude towards the particular tweet. The proposed work implements a hybrid method that includes Hybrid K, clustering and boosting. A comparison of this scheme versus a K-means/SVM approach is provided. Results are shown and discussed.

AB  - Although civic engagement and human rights are critical values in social work education, few empirical studies have explored the association between civic engagement and human rights exposure and attitudes. This study aims to examine the relationship between the exposure to human rights information, human rights attitudes, normative beliefs, and civic engagement behaviors among university students. A total of 214 students at a public university in the Midwest of the United States responded to the study survey. Findings indicate that students with more exposure to human rights issues showed more civic engagement. This relationship between human rights exposure and civic engagement was mediated by students' attitudes toward human rights, but not moderated by normative beliefs. In addition, students majoring in social work revealed higher civic engagement and more positive attitudes toward human rights issues than those in other disciplines.

AB  - Minimal studies have investigated individuals' evaluations of antigay hate crimes and hate crime legislation simultaneously, with most research focusing on one or the other. In a sample of 246 heterosexual undergraduates, the present study found that evaluations of antigay hate crimes and hate crime legislation were unrelated. Higher social dominance orientation (SDO) and crime control orientation scores were associated with more positive evaluations of antigay hate crimes. Positive evaluations of hate crime legislation were associated with more positive attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. We also found that the relationship between SDO and evaluations were mediated by crime control beliefs (for hate crimes evaluations) and antigay attitudes (for hate crime legislation evaluations). The present findings have possible implications for the manner in which organizations advocate for the extension of hate crime legislation to include sexual orientation.

AB  - As reflected in the concept of Global Englishes, English mediates global communication, where English speakers represent not merely those from English-speaking countries like United Kingdom or United States but also global people from a wide range of linguistic backgrounds, who speak the language with diverse accents. Thus, to communicate internationally, cultivating a maximized listening proficiency for and positive attitudes toward global Englishes speakers with diverse accents is ever more important. However, with their preference for American English and its popular culture, it is uncertain whether Swedish youth learners are developing these key linguistic qualities to be prepared for the globalized use of English. To address this, we randomly assigned 160 upper secondary students (mean age = 17.25) into six groups, where each group listened to one of six English speakers. The six speakers first languages were Mandarin, Russian/Ukrainian, Tamil, Lusoga/Luganda, American English, and British English. Through comparing the six student groups, we examined their listener intelligibility (actual understanding), listener comprehensibility (feeling of ease or difficulty), accentedness perception (perceiving an accent as native or foreign), and accentedness acceptance (showing a positive or negative attitude toward an accent) of diverse English accents. The results showed that the intelligibility scores and perception/attitude ratings of participants favored the two speakers with privileged accents-the American and British speakers. However, across all six groups, no correlation was detected between their actual understanding of the speakers and their perception/attitude ratings, which often had a strong correlation with their feelings of ease/difficulty regarding the speakers accents. Taken together, our results suggest that the current English education needs innovation to be more aligned with the national syllabus that promotes a global perspective. That is, students need to be guided to improve their actual understanding and sense of familiarity with Global English speakers besides the native accents that they prefer. Moreover, innovative pedagogical work should be undertaken to change Swedish youths' perceptions and attitudes and prepare them to become open-minded toward diverse English speakers.

AB  - Past research has supported the hypothesis that the relationship between harsh childhood punishment and adult political attitudes is due to the displacement of negative emotions that arise onto punitive public policies, e.g., support for the death penalty (Milburn, Conrad, Sala, & Carberry, 1995). Cognitions associated with childhood punishment may also impact adult political attitudes, yet their effects have not yet been examined, despite research that shows that punitive childhood experiences increase the tendency to attribute hostility to others. Thus, we investigated whether the tendency to make hostile attributions about others' behavior influences a person's authoritarianism, controlling for their parents' political orientation. Respondents completed an online survey concerning their childhood punishment experiences, their parents' political orientation, their trait anger, their level of hostile attribution bias (HAB), and their authoritarianism. Multiple regression analyses and structural equation modeling (SEM) found that higher childhood punishment has a significant direct effect on higher levels of authoritarianism, even after controlling for parents' political orientation, and that trait anger and HAB appear to mediate the effects of childhood punishment experiences on authoritarianism,. These results support the process of affect displacement as an important influence on adult punitiveness and political orientation.

AB  - Effective ESL teaching/learning has always been one of the most important interest areas for researchers and educators-practitioners. Over the past twenty years, teaching methods have been developed to enhance the students' motivation and self-confidence with the purpose of improving their language skills. Learners with higher motivation do better in English, and learners with self-confidence tend to be more successful in learning. The contemporary society is constantly changing and developing new technologies. Using online games in ESL classroom is one of such methods supplementing the teaching-learning process. Learners are often motivated by hands-on and active learning opportunities. The students are able to work on accomplishing a goal by choosing specific actions. They experience the consequences of the actions, which is one of the ways that a game-based learning experience is similar to real life. In this article, we examined how the Kahoot game-based method of teaching ESL may affect the attitude of university students towards the language and their level of motivation and confidence. The obtained data revealed that using Kahoot training sessions was mostly successful in enhancing students' confidence and motivation in learning English and the majority of students revealed positive attitudes to using Kahoot in language learning. However, 11% of students considered using online games to be a waste of time and 22% of students thought that learning English should not have fun as a necessary requirement. The author suggests that game-based method of teaching could be of use when utilized systematically over the academic year. However, university teachers should try various approaches and strategies to create a supportive learning environment in the classroom where learners feel interested, safe and secure to set and pursue their learning goals.

AB  - While there is a proliferation of research on emotion detection, little research has focused on emotion induction in HCI literature. We propose an emotion-induction model that points out the two fundamental design goals (i.e., sensemaking vs. exploration) as antecedents of the four different types of emotions, which, in turn, introspectively reinforce cognitive outcomes (i.e., attitude; behavioral intention). Design elements that facilitate the sensemaking goal (i.e., coherence; legibility) induce emotions along a low-arousal-positive (LAN) to a high arousal-negative (HAN) continuum (e.g., "quiescence" to "agitation"). By contrast, the design elements that facilitate exploration goal (i.e., mystery; complexity) induce emotions along a high-arousal-positive (HAP) to a low arousal-negative (LAN) continuum (e.g., "cheerfulness" to "dejection"). Among them, only the two types of emotions (i.e., HAP; HAN) have a significant mediation effect of reinforcing attitude. The HAP emotions (e.g., cheerfulness) signal a success in exploration efforts. The HAN emotions (e.g., agitation) signal a failure in sensemaking efforts. Thus, the design elements for sensemaking goals are responsible for the emotions that enhance positive (but not negative) attitude, while the design features for exploration are responsible for the emotions that enhance negative (but not positive) attitude. Incidentally, our data reveals that people place more weight on emotional signals that are consistent with their concurrent motivational concern than those inconsistent with it.

AB  - Background: This study examined the effects of alcohol portrayals on transportation and attitude toward a movie. In addition, we examined whether positive and negative movie alcohol portrayals affect transportation into and attitude toward the movie.
   Methods: A within-subject design was used in which participants were exposed to 8 different movie clips containing alcohol (positive or negative context) or no alcohol portrayals in a controlled laboratory setting. A total of 159 college students (84 males and 75 females) ages 18 to 30 participated in the experiment. Transportation and attitude toward the movie were measured after each movie clip.
   Results: Participants were more transported into and had a more positive attitude toward movie clips with alcohol portrayals compared to the same movie clips with no alcohol portrayal. In addition, participants were more transported into movie clips with negative alcohol (NA) portrayals compared to clips with positive alcohol (PA) portrayals. For attitude toward the movie, opposite results were found. Participants had a more positive attitudes toward clips with PA portrayals compared to clips with NA portrayals.
   Conclusions: The way alcohol is portrayed in movies may contribute to how people evaluate and get transported in movies.

AB  - Social stress has a major detrimental impact on subjective well-being. Previous research mainly focused on two methods to induce and measure social stress: social exclusion and performance evaluation. For social exclusion researchers frequently focused on the Cyberball task, which in contrast to many psychosocial stress paradigms does not include a performance component. The aim of the current study was to establish an optimized psychosocial stress paradigm by combining both, social exclusion as well as performance evaluation within a single fMRI paradigm. We implemented a modification of the Cyberball task including a performance game (with exclusion and inclusion periods) in addition to the already established exclusion and inclusion periods. This indeed resulted in increased subjective stress in the performance game. Hence, the modified Cyberball version seems to be superior in mapping relevant neural social stress correlates more pronounced and reliably. Exclusion within the performance-related context contrasted to the unmodified exclusion was associated with higher activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior insula. Moreover, the modified exclusion reflected greater social processing in the precuneus, several temporo-parietal and medial prefrontal areas, as suggested by the additional task aspects of social evaluation and social perspective taking. The findings emphasize that public negative evaluation is effective in substantially enlarging and potentiating the distressing effect of exclusion on a subjective as well as on a neural level. This may have a great potential for further experimental research on social stress.

AB  - We present evidence from two studies probing into whether perceived numerical decline in the White population translate into collective existential threat to Whites, leading in turn to defensive reactions. In Study 1, we used correlational data to show whether collective existential threat mediates the relationship between perceptions of White population decline and defensive political reactions (i.e., racial biases and conservatism) among Whites. In Study 2, we replicate the results of Study 1 experimentally manipulating perceptions of White population decline and growth. Our results suggest that Whites' perceptions of the ingroup's numerical decline have a unique effect on their racial and political attitudes via heightened feelings of collective existential threat.

AB  - Is the common pressure group and media refrain that we are all two pay cheques away from homelessness' justified by the evidence? Drawing on multivariate analysis of two cross-sectional datasets (the Scottish Household Survey' and the UK-wide Poverty and Social Exclusion') Survey and one longitudinal data-set (the British Cohort Study 1970'), this paper provides a systematic account of the social distribution of homelessness in the UK. Informed by a critical realist explanatory framework, our analysis underlines the centrality of poverty, especially childhood poverty, to the generation of homelessness, while also demonstrating the impact of broader labour and housing market contexts, and certain demographic, personal and social support characteristics. These findings reinforce the moral imperative for policy action on homelessness, while at the same time signalling opportunities to target preventative interventions on high risk groups.

AB  - Purpose: Combinations of risk behaviors are common in popular media, which make it difficult to understand how exposure to risk content affects adolescent risk behaviors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether media effects associated with exposure to multiple risk behaviors (i.e., combined alcohol and sex, sex only, alcohol only, and no risk) in television content have specific or more general effects on attitudes and norms associated with performing these behaviors.
   Methods: Adolescents aged 14-17 years from an opt-in Qualtrics panel (n = 338) were randomized into one of four conditions, which varied the presence of risk behaviors (i.e., combined alcohol and sex, sex only, alcohol only, and no risk) that were featured in a brief video clip from a popular television show. We tested the content effects on behavioral attitudes and norms for performing each of the behaviors.
   Results: Analysis of variance analyses showed that exposure to combined alcohol and sex resulted in more positive attitudes toward engaging in combining alcohol and sex, drinking, and smoking. Exposure to the sex only, alcohol only, and no risk videos did not influence any attitudes or norms.
   Conclusions: A brief exposure to combined risk behaviors in media may increase positive attitudes related to the combination behavior (alcohol and sex), a component behavior (alcohol), and also more general risk-taking behaviors (smoking).

AB  - Technological applications, especially the use of multimedia courseware have become more common in today's education, stimulating innovative approaches in teaching and learning. With the growing interest of integrating information and communication technologies (ICTs) into learning and teaching, the use of multimedia technology and digital games offered an alternate method of instruction. Multimedia objects play an important role in the classroom setting because of its ability to provide a virtual environment for learners to effectively acquire knowledge. This paper presents part of the findings of a research project that focused on the advantages of multimedia technology and the benefits of digital game-based learning. By using sample lessons from an interactive multimedia courseware called "DigiGEMs," this paper emphasizes the use of digital games as a vital tool in mathematics learning. The study sets out to examine if a positive attitude exists among young learners towards the learning of mathematical concepts. The DigiGEMs is targeted at primary school children aged between 7 to 9 years old, who can practice mathematical thinking skills in an appealing manner. This paper also describes the efficacy of using multimedia and game-based approaches to motivate mathematical learnings among Primary 1 to 3 students. The research findings corroborate with the hypothesis that digital game-based learning is more effective than traditional classbased learning in acquiring mathematical knowledge. It is hoped that the discussion in this paper will encourage other researchers to not only conduct further studies on children's learnings in the context of digital game-based learning environment in mathematics, but also to adopt game based-learning for other subjects such as science and languages in which the above elements (i.e., multimedia objects and digital games) are cohesively and dynamically integrated to optimise the teaching and learning processes.

AB  - Reduced consumption of meat, particularly red meat, is associated with numerous health benefits. While past research has examined demographic and cognitive correlates of meat-related diet identity and meat consumption behaviour, the predictive influence of personal values on meat-consumption attitudes and behaviour, as well as gender differences therein, has not been explicitly examined, nor has past research focusing on 'meat' generally addressed 'white meat' and 'fish/seafood' as distinct categories of interest. Two hundred and two Australians (59.9% female, 39.1% male, 1% unknown), aged 18 to 91 years (M=31.42, SD =16.18), completed an online questionnaire including the Schwartz Values Survey, and measures of diet identity, attitude towards reduced consumption of each of red meat, white meat, and fish/seafood, as well as self-reported estimates of frequency of consumption of each meat type. Results showed that higher valuing of Universalism predicted more positive attitudes towards reducing, and less frequent consumption of, each of red meat, white meat, and fish/seafood, while higher Power predicted less positive attitudes towards reducing, and more frequent consumption of, these meats. Higher Security predicted less positive attitudes towards reducing, and more frequent consumption, of white meat and fish/seafood, while Conformity produced this latter effect for fish/seafood only. Despite men valuing Power more highly than women, women valuing Universalism more highly than men, and men eating red meat more frequently than women, gender was not a significant moderator of the value attitude behaviour mediations described, suggesting that gender's effects on meat consumption may not be robust once entered into a multivariate model of MRD attitudes and behaviour. Results support past findings associating Universalism, Power, and Security values with meat-eating preferences, and extend these findings by articulating how these values relate specifically to different types of meat.

AB  - Although Moral Foundations Theory claims that the foundations of morality are universal, there are still few studies addressing it through non-English measures. In the current research, 540 persons filled out a Swedish translation of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire, and 332 of them filled out political attitude measures. Confirmatory factor analyses suggested that the fit of the five-factor model was better than alternative models but not optimal, replicating previous findings. Concerns with fairness and prevention of harm predicted political identity leftward, mediated mainly by preference for equality, and concerns with loyalty, authority, and sanctity predicted political identity rightward, mediated mainly by resistance to change and system justification, as hypothesized. Fairness and authority concerns were the best predictors of political ideology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mediated intergroup contact and extended contact hypothesis research shows that observing a positive intergroup interaction can result in improved attitudes toward the outgroup. This experiment tested the common ingroup identity model and how the creation of a superordinate identity among characters in a television narrative influences viewers' willingness to interact with outgroup members and attitudes toward the outgroup. Results reveal that self-efficacy, anxiety, and inclusion of the outgroup in the self mediated the relationship between exposure to narratives featuring intergroup interdependence and both positive attitudes toward and greater willingness to interact with the outgroup. That is, participants who watched a narrative featuring high levels of intergroup teamwork reported increased feelings of self-efficacy when considering future outgroup interactions, which was associated with lower levels of outgroup anxiety. Lower levels of anxiety were then associated with increased inclusion of the outgroup in the self, which was ultimately associated with more positive attitudes toward and greater willingness to interact with the outgroup. These results suggest that, even when comparing the effects of two narratives that portray an identical, positive outcome, positive effects on attitudes toward and willingness to interact with outgroup members are stronger when ingroup and outgroup members display interdependence. This research represents a step toward understanding the ways that the common ingroup identity model might help explain the extended contact hypothesis and the mechanisms by which narratives can affect attitudes toward and willingness to interact with outgroup members.

AB  - The present research examines the role of maths-related literacies, or competencies, in influencing the relationship between ICTs and travel behaviour. We adopted a Bayesian approach to jointly model the frequency of different types of internet use, and total travel distance per traveller, with respect to measures of lifewide literacies (other than reading), specifically in the form of numeracy and financial literacy questions. Our findings revealed that participants with higher levels of these literacies used the internet more frequently, and travelled further than those with fewer skills. These literacies were directly associated with total travel distance, as well as indirectly associated through internet use. Our results therefore imply that a strong policy aim to improve maths related literacies could have implications for mitigating the effects of social exclusion in the digital age.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus accounts for 0.1%-0.2% of all esophageal malignancies, including melanotic and amelanotic melanomas. Primary amelanotic malignant melanoma of the esophagus is extremely rare, and only about 20 cases have been published in the literature to date. Most primary malignant melanomas of the esophagus are diagnosed following development of metastatic lesions and thus have a very poor prognosis. The median survival duration of patients with metastatic melanoma has been reported to be 6.2 mo.
   CASE SUMMARY
   A 49-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a diagnosis of esophageal cancer. Endoscopy, biopsy, imaging evaluation, and physical examination at our hospital indicated a diagnosis of advanced primary amelanotic malignant melanoma of the esophagus. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed melanoma. Nuclear medicine examination revealed a left iliac bone metastatic lesion. After discharge, the patient self-administered apatinib for 3 mo, followed by oral treatment with Chinese medicines (also self-administered) for 2 mo. No treatments had been taken since then. The patient has survived with no growth out to the most recent follow-up (24 mo post diagnosis), and she always presented with a positive attitude about her condition during this period.
   CONCLUSION
   Survival following metastatic melanoma might be related to the pharmaceutical and Chinese medicine treatment and the patient's positive attitude.

AB  - We analyze whether the Islamist terror attack on the Christmas market in Berlin in 2016 had an impact on public opinion toward immigration in general and, since the attacker has entered Germany to apply for asylum, toward refugees in particular. An analysis of this natural experiment reveals a negative shift regarding the latter, while no differences are observed for the former. To shed more light on the driver of attitude change, we combine these findings with a quantitative content analysis of online media reporting about refugees before and after the attack. Mass media have long been considered to have an impact on exclusionary attitudes toward ethnic minorities. However, empirical evidence on this relationship remains largely anecdotal. We draw upon unsupervised machine learning to quantify the developments in reporting in three popular German online news websites. Results reveal that the attack had significant impact on media reporting on these websites. However, the strong focus on the attack was only short lived, quickly decreasing already in the second week after the attack. Linking media data to the public opinion data reveals no clear connection between reporting and attitudes. In contrast to theoretical expectations, descriptive evidence even shows that both follow almost opposite trends, since people changed their attitudes only weeks after the attack. We discuss potential explanations of these, at first sight, counterintuitive findings.

AB  - In the United States, intention to get the COVID-19 vaccine varied across age and racial/ethnic groups, but attitudes toward getting vaccinated were an important predictor across all adults
   Background COVID-19 vaccine uptake is an urgent public health priority. Purpose To identify psychosocial determinants (attitudes, normative pressure, and perceived behavioral control) of COVID-19 vaccination intentions for U.S. White, Black, and Hispanic adults, and how COVID-19 misperceptions, beliefs about the value of science, and perceived media bias relate to these determinants. Methods Longitudinal online survey using two national samples (18-49 years old/50 years and older), each stratified by racial/ethnic group (n = 3,190). Data were collected in October/November 2020 and were weighted by race group to be representative. Results Path analyses showed that more positive attitudes about getting vaccinated predict intention across age and racial/ethnic groups, but normative pressure is relevant among older adults only. Belief in the value of science was positively associated with most determinants across all groups, however the association of COVID-19 misperceptions and perceived media bias with the determinants varied by age group. Conclusions Messages that emphasize attitudes toward vaccination can be targeted to all age and racial/ethnic groups, and positive attitudes are universally related to a belief in the value of science. The varying role of normative pressure poses messages design challenges to increase vaccination acceptance.

AB  - The World Health Organization declared waterpipe smoking as a growing public health concern. Our study aimed to assess waterpipe smoking knowledge and attitude among current waterpipe smokers in comparison with nonsmokers and to evaluate its association with current and cumulative waterpipe smoking. A cross-sectional study was carried between May and December 2018 using a multistage cluster sample across Lebanon. Nonsmokers or exclusive current waterpipe smokers were eligible to participate. A total of 4046 adult individuals participated in the study, 38.3% (n = 1550) being current waterpipe smokers. Current waterpipe smoking was positively associated with female gender [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.79, 95%CI 1.40-2.28] and having a mother who is a regular smoker (aOR 1.47, 95%CI 1.15-1.88) while it was negatively associated with better knowledge about waterpipe smoking harm (aOR 0.95, 95%CI 0.93-0.97) and positive attitude toward waterpipe smoking ban (aOR 0.98, 95%CI 0.96-0.99). Cumulative waterpipe smoking was negatively associated with female gender (beta = - 0.012), higher education level (beta = - 0.28), and positive attitude toward WPS ban (beta = - 0.06). Waterpipe smoking is largely present among the Lebanese population, with waterpipe smokers showing lower knowledge about harm and more intolerant attitude about banning. Health awareness supported by media campaigns and governmental initiatives should be conducted to educate people and change their perceptions regarding waterpipe smoking.

AB  - Over-the-counter (OTC) medicine is defined as safe and effective for the general public to use, without seeking therapy from a health professional. As primary social media and internet users, university and college students are more likely to be exposed to unverified sources of health information. This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour of students at institutions of higher learning in Brunei with regard to the safe use of OTC medicines. A cross-sectional study was performed using a self-administered online questionnaire, adapted from the literature with additional information from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the educational resources in understanding OTC medicine for consumers. The questionnaire consisted of 4 sections: demographic information, knowledge of OTC medicines, attitudes, and practice. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for data analysis. A total of 335 students returned a completed questionnaire. The students had a mean knowledge score of 7.1 out of 9, with more than half (53.4%) having good knowledge (knowledge score > 7), and only a small percentage (5.7%) with poor knowledge. Almost all of the students (99.7%) had a positive attitude toward OTC medicine use. Few of the students practiced improper habits in terms of OTC medicine use, such as not reading the instructions or taking more than the recommended dose. Awareness of proper OTC medicine use among students in institutions of higher learning is necessary to prevent the rise of inappropriate user practices.

AB  - Artificial intelligence technology has been increasingly applied in the hospitality and tourism industry, and it is a matter of concern how to increase customer adoption of AI applications in service encounters. This study examines how cuteness of AI applications interacts with the type of service task (emotional or knowledge-based) in their influence on customers' willingness to use the application. Hypotheses were tested using four experiments in different interactive contexts. It was found that customers were more willing to adopt AI applications with high perceived cuteness to perform emotional tasks, and social distance played a mediating role; conversely, customers preferred AI applications with low perceived cuteness to perform knowledge-based tasks, and here performance expectancy mediated the relationship between perceived cuteness and customers' willingness to use the application. The findings advance the theories of customer adoption by revealing and differentiating the "cuteness effect" within different service types.

AB  - The present study contributes to the investigation of communicative norms and social support in Social Network Sites (SNSs). We suggest that a positivity bias restricts the availability of social support users receive from others via public responses to negative status updates. Moderated mediation analyses of the data of an online experiment (N = 870, M-age = 25.16 years, 64% female) show that users are less willing to comment on negative status updates than on positive ones. In contrast, users are more willing to respond to negative status updates with private messages. These effects are moderated by the strength of the relationship between sender and receiver of the status update and mediated by perceived message appropriateness and support urgency. The results suggest that SNS users canalize supportive reactions to negative experience of their close SNS friends through private modes of communication. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This research examined the characteristics and predicting indicators of netizens which contribute to "Human Flesh Searching" and internet vigilantism. Human Flesh Searching (HFS) is a form of collective online behavior where netizens contribute information to social media and/or networking platforms about a certain event or a target individual or group to achieve what they regard as justice. It has been used to identify and investigate crime. Some netizens go further and take justice into their own hands by punishing alleged criminals and deviants through online shaming. Using the results of a survey conducted in Hong Kong, the research found both gender and time spent online are not significant variables to predict netizens' intention to contribute to HFS. A positive attitude toward HFS was the strongest predictor of HFS intention. Vigilantism was also a strong predictor of HFS intention. Vigilantism not only affects HFS intention directly, but also indirectly through a positive attitude on HFS. Fairness might negatively influence people's HFS intention and attitude toward HFS; however, this influence was found to be weak in the present study. Social Justice might not affect HFS intention directly, yet it might exert its effect via a positive attitude toward HFS. That is, netizens who intend to contribute to HFS are those who have less confidence in the criminal justice system and believe highly that people should take justice into their own hands.

AB  - Purpose As employees' adoption of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) has increased, so has research interest into the impact of BYOD on human resources outcomes. The present study aims at understanding the relationship between BYOD and human resources outcomes. Design/methodology/approach The study employs the inductive data-driven content analysis approach to analyze the data collected through qualitative semi-structured interviews with a sample of 28 knowledge workers from different occupational sectors in Mauritius. Findings The results show the double-edged sword brought about by BYOD implementation. This trend is associated with perceived job performance, job satisfaction, organizational commitment and work motivation while also having an effect on work-life conflict and stress. Practical implications This study has implications for organizations that are concerned about formulating guidelines and policies in relation to workers' adoption of BYOD in the workplace. This trend permits employees to continue to communicate and work irrespective of new working conditions and social distancing since the Covid-19 pandemic has changed the way organizations operate around the globe. Originality/value Driven by the JD-R theory, themes and sub-themes were linked by the emerging relationships to present a conceptual framework to understanding employees' well-being since this is a pertinent research area for scholars and practitioners, as well as a topic of growing prominence for modern organizations.

AB  - Though the political advertising literature has documented the effects of political advertising on political attitudes and voting behavior, less attention has been paid to the role of political advertising in stimulating information search. This study seeks to examine the impact of political advertising on real world information seeking using CMAG data from the Wisconsin Ad Project combined with Google Trends search data. Results suggest that increased advertising volume is associated with increased online information seeking. Additionally, this study tests the feasibility of using Google Trends search data as a proxy measure of political information seeking.

A digital questionnaire was distributed via social media and geographically based meeting applications after the first lockdown (March-April 2020). 1194 MSM responded, 91.8% were HIV negative, 19.4% of them used PrEP regularly, and 8.2% were people living with HIV (PLWH). Median age was 34.5 years. 54.4% reported that they kept strictly social distancing guidelines. Low education, hazardous sexual behavior, moderate/severe, and depression predicted low compliance with social distancing guidelines. 66.7% reported a significant decrease in the number of casual sex partners. 55% of those who took PrEP reduced their PrEP intake. Many of the PLWH and PrEP users reduced their medical follow-up. In light of the continuous outbreak and the risk of further outbreaks in the future consideration should be given to provide continuing access to HIV and sexual health clinics.

AB  - The present study examined gender differences in young people's attitudes toward cosmetic surgery as well as the joint effects of media and peers on their attitudes toward cosmetic surgery. A survey of 555 university students in Singapore showed that young people of both sexes generally held positive attitudes toward cosmetic surgery. We observed no significant gender disparities in their acceptance of cosmetic surgery or intention to undergo cosmetic surgery. We tested the influence of the presumed media influence model, and our findings supported direct and indirect models of media influence on young people's attitudes toward cosmetic surgery. The indirect model was mediated by perceived influence of cosmetic surgery-related media on peers. We also found that men were more susceptible to the influence of presumed media influence than women were. Practice implications of our study for educators include open discussions regarding cosmetic surgery and the influence of media and peers among young people, as well as differentiating intervention programs for emerging adult women and men.

AB  - This article analyses how the political right in parts of the Global South has appropriate agendas and issues that in the past were often associated to the political left and presented them instead as their own. It does so by articulating narratives around poverty and social exclusion in the context of anti-globalisation and nationalistic discursive regimes that appeal to popular 'common sense'. The piece explores this argument by examining the case of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro. Reviewing a sample of Brazilian news media outlets and the type of messages in relation to poverty during the most recent presidential elections, it is suggested that by linking themes of social exclusion with nationalism in the news media, the political right has been able to explain poverty by means of increasing globalisation and liberalism and co-opt this agenda.

AB  - Off-site construction (OSC) has become the direction of China's construction transformation owing to the disappearance of demographic dividend and demand of environmental sustainability. Although the Chinese government has made efforts to promote OSC, its development progress remains slow. According to technology acceptance theory, the positive attitude and sufficient understanding of the public are of great significance to the advancement of new technology transformations. No relevant study has investigated people's awareness of OSC, and social media platforms provide big data for social science research. Accordingly, this study adopts web crawler technology combined with two methods of text mining, which are topic modeling and sentiment analysis, to explore public attitude toward OSC based on data collected from SinaWeibo. The research findings of this study are as follows: The attention status of the public toward OSC was greatly fluctuated but generally showed an upward tendency. The release of relevant government policies also significantly influenced the attention status of the public. What the public most concern about OSC was the building attributes and performance, such as connection issues, earthquake resistance, and waterproof property. Moreover, the Chinese public had relatively positive sentiments on OSC, and most of them expressed their interest and curiosity about OSC. The leading causes of public negative sentiments were safety issues, technical level, high prices, simplistic design and unemployment, indicating that popularization of the updated information on building performance, supportive policy and long-term significance of OSC was far from enough.

AB  - Accurate understanding of COVID-19 safety recommendations early in the outbreak was complicated by inconsistencies in public health and media messages. We sought to characterize high-risk adults' knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, prevention strategies, and prevention behaviors. We used data from the Chicago COVID-19 Comorbidities (C3) survey collected between March 13 thru March 20, 2020. A total of 673 predominately older adults with >= 1 chronic condition completed the telephone interview. Knowledge was assessed by asking participants to name three symptoms of COVID-19 and three actions to prevent infection. Participants were then asked if and how they had changed plans due to coronavirus. Most participants could identify three symptoms (71.0%) and three preventive actions (69.2%). Commonly reported symptoms included: fever (78.5%), cough (70.6%), and shortness of breath (45.2%); preventive actions included: washing hands (86.5%) and social distancing (86.2%). More than a third of participants reported social distancing themselves (38.3%), and 28.8% reported obtaining prescription medication to prepare for the outbreak. In multivariable analyses, no participant characteristics were associated with COVID-19 knowledge. Women were more likely than men, and Black adults were less likely than White adults to report practicing social distancing. Individuals with low health literacy were less likely to report obtaining medication supplies. In conclusion, though most higher-risk individuals were aware of social distancing as a prevention strategy early in the outbreak, less than half reported enacting it, and racial disparities were apparent. Consistent messaging and the provision of tangible resources may improve future adherence to safety recommendations.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of a peer feedback tool and a reflection tool on social and cognitive performance during computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL). A CSCL-environment was augmented with a peer feedback tool (Radar) and a reflection tool (Reflector) in order to make group members aware of both their individual and their group behavior. Radar visualizes how group members perceive their own social and cognitive performance and that of their peers during collaboration along five dimensions. Reflector stimulates group members to reflect upon their own performance and the performance of the group. A 2 x 2 factorial between-subjects design was used to examine whether Radar and Reflector would lead to better team development, more group satisfaction, lower levels of group conflict, more positive attitudes toward problem-based collaboration, and a better group product. Results show that groups with Radar perceived their team as being better developed, experienced lower conflict levels, and had a more positive attitude towards collaborative problem solving than groups without Radar. The quality of group products, however, did not differ. The results demonstrate that peer feedback on the social performance of individual group members can enhance the performance and attitudes of a CSCL-group. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Findings of a Cross-Sectional Survey on Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices about COVID-19 in Uganda: Implications for Public Health Prevention and Control Measures
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
LA  - English
AB  - Background. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) morbidity is rising in Uganda. However, data are limited about people's knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Objective. To determine knowledge about COVID-19, attitudes towards presidential directives and Ministry of Health (MoH) guidelines, and adherence to practicing public health preventive measures (KAP) in Uganda. Methods. This cross-sectional survey was conducted between April 28 and May 19, 2020. Data were collected using online social media platforms, websites, and popular media outlets. We descriptively summarized data and categorized KAP scores as knowledgeable about COVID-19, positive attitude towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines, and adherent to public health preventive measures, respectively. We tested sex differences in KAP using tests of significance and established independently associated factors using modified Poisson regression analysis, reported using adjusted prevalence risk ratio (aPR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results. We studied 362 participants with the following sociodemographic characteristics: 86 (23.8%) aged 25-29 years, 212 (58.6%) males, 270 (74.6%) with tertiary or university levels of education, and 268 (74.0%) urban residents. Of the 362 participants, 264 (93.9%) were knowledgeable about COVID-19 (94.1% males and 93.8% females), 51.3% had positive attitudes towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines (51.0% male and 51.8% female), and 175 (48.3%) were adherent to practicing public health preventive measures (42.9% males and 56.0% females). Compared to males, our data shows that females were more adherent to practicing public health preventive measures (aPR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.01-1.53), knowledgeable about COVID-19 (aPR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.95-1.07), and had positive attitudes towards directives and guidelines (aPR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.82-1.25). Conclusions. This study shows that public health prevention efforts should be directed to closing the identified gaps in KAP among Ugandans in order to halt the spread of COVD-19 in Uganda as well as the East African region.

AB  - Background: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to every country worldwide. A call for global vaccination for COVID-19 plays a pivotal role in the fight against this virus. With the development of COVID-19 vaccines, public willingness to get vaccinated has become an important public health concern, considering the vaccine hesitancy observed worldwide. Social media is powerful in monitoring public attitudes and assess the dissemination, which would provide valuable information for policy makers. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the responses of vaccine positivity on social media when major public events (major outbreaks) or major adverse events related to vaccination (COVID-19 or other similar vaccines) were reported. Methods: A total of 340,783 vaccine-related posts were captured with the poster's information on Weibo, the largest social platform in China. After data cleaning, 156,223 posts were included in the subsequent analysis. Using pandas and SnowNLP Python libraries, posts were classified into 2 categories, positive and negative. After model training and sentiment analysis, the proportion of positive posts was computed to measure the public positivity toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Results: The positivity toward COVID-19 vaccines in China tends to fluctuate over time in the range of 45.7% to 77.0% and is intuitively correlated with public health events. In terms of gender, males were more positive (70.0% of the time) than females. In terms of region, when regional epidemics arose, not only the region with the epidemic and surrounding regions but also the whole country showed more positive attitudes to varying degrees. When the epidemic subsided temporarily, positivity decreased with varying degrees in each region. Conclusions: In China, public positivity toward COVID-19 vaccines fluctuates over time and a regional epidemic or news on social media may cause significant variations in willingness to accept a vaccine. Furthermore, public attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination vary from gender and region. It is crucial for policy makers to adjust their policies through the use of positive incentives with prompt responses to pandemic-related news to promote vaccination acceptance.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the knowledge and attitudes of Saudi patients toward the safety of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 142 Saudi patients at King Khalid hospital, Asir, Saudi Arabia. Data were collected using a self-questionnaire based on MRI safety issues gained from the literature. The questionnaire was divided into two sections, one containing the respondents' sociodemographic information and the other assessing their knowledge and attitudes toward participating in MRI.
   Results: A total of 142 patients responded to the survey, and their average age was 31.5 +/- 4 years. The majority were married and held a bachelor's degree. The mean knowledge score regarding MRI safety was 0.29 +/- 0.25, which reflects poor knowledge, whereas the attitude score was 0.67 +/- 0.20, reflecting a moderately positive attitude. Awareness and attitude among patients improved as education levels increased. Finally, only 53.5% of the respondents were aware of the noise produced by the MRI scanner.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the awareness of MRI safety among patients in the Asir Region is poor, although they showed positive attitudes toward the issue. Thus, education is necessary for patients to improve awareness of MRI safety to facilitate MRI examinations, which will help decrease scan time and image artefacts.

AB  - Objective: to analyze the pedagogical practice experiences of teachers in training during the COVID-19 contingency, making visible the challenges, conditions, and emerging reflections of the pedagogical practice in pandemic and social isolation and characterize the teaching-learning strategies that favor skills in teachers' professional practices consistent with the need for mental health care and maintenance of the quality of life of students. Materials and methods: this research was developed from the constructivist paradigm and through the methodology of systematization of experiences. The study sample consisted of 231 students from strata 1, 2, and 3, and 11 practice advisers from a professional teacher training program. Results: professional practices in teacher training are a crucial moment for the development and strengthening of competencies associated with teaching-learning from the discipline. Before 2020, most of the professional practices were developed in-person, a situation that changed in the health contingency of COVID-19, causing a demand for sudden adaptation on the part of trainers and teachers in training for the development of practices professionals in virtual environments. Conclusions: at the end of the study, the different emerging challenges are evidenced, such as a weak command of information and communication technologies, empathy as a cognitive-emotional teacher competence, the constant maintenance of student motivation and the application of curricular flexibility strategies. Likewise, prevention and support actions developed based on an adaptive educational environment are identified, which favors successful training in times of social distancing, quarantine and isolation.

AB  - There is a considerable relationship between information and communication technology (ICT), community and industry development. Abundance of previous research have tried to investigate ICT benefits for groups such as farmers, rural community, urban community, students, teacher and businessmen but yet there has been very little research on the roles of ICT can play for the development of the fisheries industry and the fishermen. Based on this problem statement, this paper aim to fulfill the three objectives determined which are to 1) to identify the most preferred ICT among the fishermen; 2) to identify the problems and obstacles faced by the fishermen in using ICT and 3) to determine the benefits that ICT can offer to the fishermen. This is a qualitative study; data was gained through four in-depth interviews guided by an interview guide with responsible agencies officers and fishermen. The questions served as a guide, but allowed respondents freedom and flexibility in their answers. ICT in this paper refer to global positioning system (GPS), sonar, wireless set, computer, internet and mobile phone. Based on the results gained, it can be concluded that GPS is the most preferred ICT among the fishermen. Among problems that need to be overcome to further encourage ICT usage among the fishermen are the negative attitude towards ICT usage, expensive cost, still depends on the traditional way, no exposure on ICT usage and ICT benefits, and no need for them to use the computer and the internet and increasing age. Based on the analyses done, it can be concluded that ICT offers a lot of benefits such as increasing socio-economic level of the fishermen, increase fishermen knowledge and skills on ICT, ease the communication process and enhance the safety aspects of the fishermen when they are on the sea. Based on the results gained it is recommended that the number of ICT seminar, workshop and course given to the fishermen should be doubled with the older fishermen should be included as one of the target groups while ICT subsidy for the fishermen can be given to the fishermen who need it.

AB  - This article presents a Portuguese translation and cultural modification of the Organizational Justice Scale of Niehoff and Moorman (1993). The scale was tested in two correlational studies, one with 115 employees from the technical staff of a Portuguese organization and a second with 59 Portuguese teachers, testing the scale's discriminant validity through comparison with other measures such as psychological contract violation, organizational identification, work motivation, job satisfaction and perceived ability-job fit. The scale showed satisfying consistency and in a factorial analysis of the Portuguese version; the item distribution per factor was the same as that of the original scale (Niehoff & Moorman, 1993). The Portuguese Organizational Justice scale showed adequate reliability and validity. Therefore, this Portuguese version can be considered a suitable instrument to assess organizational justice among the Portuguese population.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to explore the barriers that prevent students from moderating their drinking by comparing attitudes towards moderation in a wet (New Zealand) and dry (Vietnam) drinking culture and examines whether these barriers can be understood by applying an ecological framework. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative survey involving a written vignette was conducted with a sample of 226 and 277 undergraduates from New Zealand and Vietnam, respectively. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Findings The analysis reveals that students perceive several barriers to moderate drinking at the intrapersonal level (e.g. positive attitude towards drinking), interpersonal level (e.g. peer pressure) and environmental level (e.g. socialising activities), suggesting that an ecological framework is useful for understanding drinking cultures. The response variations between the two countries provide novel insights into cultural differences in students' perceptions, with external factors being more important and influential in the wet culture and internal influences being of more concern in the dry culture. Originality/value This study provides novel insights into the barriers and facilitators of moderating drinking. Further, the findings demonstrate the value of a holistic ecological framework for understanding student drinking cultures. The comparison between two diverse cultures revealed how insights from one culture can help to understand deep-seated practices and meanings in another.

AB  - Watching contact between members of one's ingroup and members of an outgroup in the media (mediated vicarious contact) improves intergroup attitudes. We compare mediated vicarious contact with observing only members of the outgroup (parasocial contact), and examine whether the activity of the portrayed contact matters. Building on theory, we predict that watching outgroup members playing music should reduce prejudice more than watching them engaged in nonmusical activities, particularly with vicarious (vs. parasocial) contact. Results show that vicarious musical contact enhances perceptions of synchronization, liking, and honesty between ingroup and outgroup actors in a video, which in turn results in more positive attitudes toward the outgroup. Counter to predictions, parasocial musical contact results in less positive outcomes than parasocial nonmusical contact.

AB  - With the rise of COVID-19, the sustainability of air transport is a major challenge, as there is limited space in aircraft cabins, resulting in a higher risk of virus transmission. In order to detect possible chains of infection, technology-supported apps are used for social distancing. These COVID-19 applications are based on the display of the received signal strength for distance estimation, which is strongly influenced by the spreading environment due to the signal multipath reception. Therefore, we evaluate the applicability of technology-based social distancing methods in an aircraft cabin environment using a radio propagation simulation based on a three-dimensional aircraft model. We demonstrate the susceptibility to errors of the conventional COVID-19 distance estimation, which can lead to large errors in the determination of distances and to the impracticability of traditional tracing approaches during passenger boarding/deboarding. In the context of the future connected cabin, a robust distance measurement must be implemented to ensure safe travel. Finally, our results can be transferred to similar fields of application, e.g., trains or public transport.

The study was conducted using an online survey of 1311 Israeli Jews. Realistic threat from EUAS was negatively related to positive attitudes toward three local outgroups, while the association between symbolic threat from EUAS and attitudes toward the local outgroups was insignificant. The effect of distant realistic threat was more pronounced than the effect of symbolic threat and the effect of face-to-face contact.

   The role of information and communications technology (ICT) has been tested in various contexts of online shopping and the results show that ICT has successfully transformed the way of doing business. This study aims to propose that if women have adequate internet skills, namely, operative, informational and creative skills, their entrepreneurial intentions will be high.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This is descriptive research. The data was collected from 246 university students and analyzed using PLS-SEM.
   Findings
   The results of the study show that students belonging to entrepreneurial backgrounds have a positive attitude toward entrepreneurship. The impact of internet skills was mixed on the relationship of entrepreneurial attitude and entrepreneurial intention.
   Research limitations/implications
   The sample was not generalized as the sample consisted of urban and internet-using women. Future research can test the model for rural women entrepreneurs or usage of m-commerce for the same.
   Practical implications
   The results of the study show that women having the skills to operate the internet have higher intentions to become an entrepreneur. Thus, the e-commerce web-space can use the results to influence women of the new generation to use available tools in their journey of entrepreneurship.
   Social implications
   Women are an indispensable part of society. Empowering them will not only improve their confidence but will also strengthen the pillars of society.
   Originality/value
   Extensive research work has been done in the context of women entrepreneurship. The study is a novel attempt to test the effects of internet skills on entrepreneurial intention among new generation women. The results will be very much useful for future research and will extend the body of academic literature.

AB  - The order in which individuals receive information about wildlife may influence their attitude toward wildlife differently. We explored order effects of a threat message that induced more fear versus a suffering message that elicited more compassion on attitude toward wildlife. Specifically, we focused on bats, a risk-laden species also suffering massive mortalities due to a disease affecting bat populations across the United States. We randomly assigned 1,506 U.S. adults to one of eight message conditions as part of a 2 (message order: suffering -> threat vs. threat -> suffering) x 2 (suffering messages) x 2 (threat messages) between-subjects factorial design or a control (no message) condition. We found a significant two-way interaction between message order and biospheric values on attitude toward bats. For people with high biospheric values, reading a suffering message first led to a more positive attitude than reading a threat message first, whereas reading a threat message first led to a more positive attitude than reading a suffering message first for people with low biospheric values. Compassion but not fear mediated these effects. Theoretical and practical implications are provided.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine how learners feel about distance learning as a substitute for face-to-face learning. A nationwide survey of over 11,000 students was conducted during the covid-19 outbreak to evaluate how students in grades 8-12 responded to and viewed full-time e-learning practices. Two-thirds of students had negative attitudes toward e-learning, according to the findings of the survey in the five selected issues of effectiveness, ease of use, interactivity, motivation, and academic assessment of the e-learning platform. Regardless of the students' age, gender, grade, branch, or technology used, they all had a negative opinion regarding e-learning. In addition to technological issues, the majority of students cited psychological and social factors as reasons for their negative attitudes toward e-learning, such as a lack of readiness and ability to adapt to a new style of education, ineffectiveness of the means and methods used, and poor communication with teachers and other classmate learners. On the practical side, the study's findings point to the necessity to adapt the teaching style via the electronic platform to be more acceptable to students, particularly in terms of engagement and providing a stimulating learning environment.

AB  - Integrating the psychological theories of 'cue utilization' and 'trust online', this study identifies the cues in Instagram posts that build trust, in turn mediating consumers' positive attitudinal responses toward the branded products. The survey data from 260 Instagram users support the hypotheses that the 'popularity' and 'quality of the argument' of posts positively influence consumer trust toward a post, which builds positive attitudinal responses toward the branded products. The study supports the conclusion that consumers rely on the cues of popularity and quality of the argument of a post when they make use of cues for reducing uncertainty in purchasing apparel online. Two theoretical orientations are useful for explicating consumer attitudinal behaviors toward Instagram posts. Practical implications for enhancing the quality of Instagram posts by means of cues that create trust in posts are discussed.

AB  - We investigated intergroup contact's cognitively liberalizing function by testing it's association with socio-cognitive skills (perspective-taking and empathy skills, and cognitive flexibility) and group-based ideologies (ethnocentrism and social dominance orientation [SDO]) among a majority (Turks) and minority (Kurds) status group (total N = 483). We further examined whether these relationships were provided by contact's primary intergroup function-more positive attitudes toward the contacted group. Multigroup structural equation modeling analyses demonstrated that high quality cross-group friendships were directly and negatively related to both ethnocentrism and SDO among the minority group. These associations were mediated by positive outgroup attitudes among the majority group. For both groups, perspective-taking and empathy were significantly predicted by lower levels of ethnocentrism and SDO. Contact also indirectly led to higher cognitive flexibility among both groups. Findings highlight the need to explore more extensively contact's psychological outcomes at the individual level, beyond changing outgroup attitudes.

AB  - This study examines consumers' value co-creation via several shopping channels including a traditional out-of-home shopping channel and "smart" channels where consumers use a computer, a mobile phone, or social media. It focuses on the effect that value co-creation has on consumers' shopping behavior as well as on the perceived contribution of a shopping channel to their well-being, with a focus on individuals who perceive themselves as being socially excluded, particularly by mobility disability. The project was carried out in the United States using an online survey (n = 1,220). Social exclusion has a positive statistically significant effect on respondents' self-connection with all channels; for many socially excluded respondents the shopping channel has an important role in their lives. Self-connection with the channel has a positive effect on value co-creation and there is a positive relationship between value co-creation and the perceived contribution of the channel on well-being. When consumers help other individuals in their decision making they not only create value for the retailer and for other customers but also contribute positively to their own well-being. Importantly, for smart shopping channels where consumers use a computer or a mobile phone, the effects of value co-creation on the perceived contribution of these channels to consumer well-being are stronger for shoppers with a mobility disability than for those without such a disability.

AB  - Background Digital resources in learning are increasingly available and offer new possibilities in education. Mobile learning devices (MLD) such as tablets provide easy and flexible access for users. Purpose To investigate whether the introduction of MLDs in radiology education affected time spent on studies over a longer time frame and whether learning behavior and attitudes changed. Material and Methods The radiology residents employed during 2015-2016 were invited to participate in this 12-month MLD intervention study. Results were evaluated using online questionnaires at six months (6 m) and 12 months (12 m). Results Thirty-one residents were included, of whom half were in the early stages of residency (<2 years). After the MLD introduction, most participants (91% [6 m] and 83% [12 m]) estimated increased time spent on studies. Of these, 32% stated "a lot more" at 6 m but only 8% at 12 m (P = 0.12). The MLDs showed positive effects on the experience of radiology studies, as a majority of participants stated better quality and effectiveness in their studies (100% [6 m]-92% [12 m]), that MLD facilitated access to educational materials to a high degree (83% [6 m]-75% [12 m]), and that studies had become better and more fun (96% [6 m]-100% [12 m]). Conclusion The use of MLDs seems to facilitate learning effectively for radiologic residents. However, a larger scale study is required as a trend of decreasing figures in the longer term was seen, but our results did not show a significant reduction of time spent on radiology studies.

AB  - Public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic since March 2020 have led to lockdowns and social distancing in most countries around the world, with a shift from the traditional work environment to virtual one. Employees have been encouraged to work from home where possible to slow down the viral infection. The massive increase in the volume of professional activities executed online has posed a new context for cybercrime, with the increase in the number of emails and phishing websites. Phishing attacks have been broadened and extended through years of pandemics COVID-19. This paper presents a novel approach for detecting phishing Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) applying the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a fast and highly accurate phishing classifier system. Comparative analysis of the GRU classification system indicates better accuracy (98.30%) than other classifier systems.

AB  - The present research aims to investigate whether salience of memberships during imagined contact is necessary for producing generalized positive attitudes toward the outgroup and promoting intergroup cooperation. After a warm-up task that involved reciprocal self-disclosure during the imagined interaction with an outgroup member, we manipulated interpersonal versus intergroup features of imagined contact. Results indicated that participants who imagined a conversation with a Muslim focusing on intergroup differences subsequently reported more positive attitudes and cooperative intentions toward Muslim immigrants compared to either participants who imagined the interaction at the interpersonal level or participants in a control condition. Moreover, these effects were found to be mediated by outgroup trust. These findings attest to the strength of interventions based on imagined intergroup contact and suggest a possible implementation of the technique.

AB  - Little is known about how environmental concern in young adulthood may shape childbearing attitudes and intentions. Here, we examine the relationship between individual environmental concern, fertility intentions, and attitudes toward reproduction in a sample of Canadian university students, N = 139. General environmental concern and pollution-related health concerns both predicted a less positive attitude toward having children. Further, attitude toward having children mediated the negative relationship between pollution-related health concerns and personal fertility intentions. This study offers an important early step in empirical examination of the association between environmental concern and fertility.

AB  - This mixed-methods study investigates the effects of student attitudes and behaviours on the outcomes of learning mathematics with computer tools. A computer tool was used to help students develop the mathematical concept of function. In the whole sample (N = 521), student attitudes could account for a 3.4 point difference in test scores between individuals on a 10-point scale General attitude towards mathematics positively predicted test scores. However, more able students who were well-disposed towards mathematical computer tools achieved lower scores Self-reported behaviours were unrelated to test scores Detailed observation of a small number of students (N = 8) revealed that positive attitudes towards mathematics and mathematical computer tools augmented exhibited learning behaviours, and that both a positive attitude to mathematical computer tools and exhibited learning behaviours benefited tool mastery. Although tool mastery and test scores are intimately related, reflective processes appear to mediate this relationship Promoting learning with mathematical computer tools needs to take several factors into account, including improving student attitudes, raising levels of learning behaviours, and giving sufficient opportunity for constructing new mathematical knowledge within meaningful mathematical discourse (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Context Knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes toward palliative care (PC) constitute barriers to its access. Few studies have focused on the intrinsic relationship between these variables, and none has examined the relationship between them and self-care self-efficacy. Objective To examine the direct and indirect effects of self-care self-efficacy, knowledge, and beliefs on attitudes toward PC. Methods A cross-sectional predictive study was conducted. Self-care self-efficacy, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about PC were analyzed using information from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 5, cycle 2, 2018). Data from 1,162 participants were considered. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to represent the statistical mediation model with latent and observable variables. Results The structural model presents positive coefficients indicating that self-care self-efficacy significantly predicts knowledge (beta = 0.127, p < 0.001) and beliefs (beta = 0.078, p = 0.023). Similarly, knowledge is associated with attitudes (beta = 0.179, p < 0.001) and beliefs (beta = 0.213, p < 0.001). The beliefs measure is also significantly related to attitudes (beta = 0.474, p < 0.001). In addition, this structural multiple mediation model shows optimal goodness-of-fit indices: chi(2)/df = 3.49, CFI = 0.983, TLI = 0.976, RMSEA = 0.046 [90% CI: 0.037-0.056], SRMR = 0.038. Conclusion Self-care self-efficacy is significantly associated with knowledge and beliefs about PC, which in turn are related to each other. Altogether, these variables predict positive attitudes toward PC. Understanding the relationship between these variables is relevant for targeting-specific populations and designing timely strategies to improve access to PC.

AB  - Pressure injury is a serious and preventable problem in intensive care units. Translating guidelines into clinical practice can reduce the incidence of pressure injury. Identifying clinical status, barriers and facilitators contribute to guideline implementation. To identify the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of pressure injury prevention in Chinese critical care nurses. Secondary data were extracted from a multicentric clinical trial. Knowledge and attitudes toward pressure injury prevention were assessed by a fourteen-item questionnaire. The observed practices were recorded using a case report form. The report complies with the STROBE statement. A total of 950 critical care nurses in 15 hospitals from six provinces of China were investigated. A total of 53.1% of nurses received a median score of 6 points or less. Knowledge regarding the repositioning procedure, risk assessment, and heel pressure injury prevention was insufficient. Over 99% of nurses strongly or somewhat agreed that pressure injury prevention was very important and that they were willing to take measures to prevent pressure injury. A total of 27 781 patient days of pressure injury prevention practice were recorded. Repositioning was the most commonly used prevention measure, followed by support surfaces and prophylactic dressings. A combination of repositioning, support surface, and prophylactic dressing was lacking. Chinese critical nurses showed a low level of knowledge and a positive attitude toward pressure injury prevention. Practices of pressure injury prevention were unsatisfactory. There is a clear gap between the guidelines and clinical practices. The barrier (low-level knowledge) and facilitator (positive attitude) were identified in this study. According to these findings, strategies need to be developed to promote guideline implementation.

AB  - Introduction: Obesity is a major public health burden in Qatar. Pharmacists can play an important role in providing weight management services (WMSs). This study aimed to explore their attitudes, practice, perceived competence, and role in WMSs in Qatar. Methods: A mixed-method explanatory sequential design was applied in the study. A validated online questionnaire was administered followed by qualitative individual and focus group interviews. Results: Two-hundred seventy community pharmacists completed the survey (response rate 45%). More than half of them indicated that they often or always explain to patients the risks associated with overweight and obesity (56.2%), recommend weight loss medications, herbs or dietary supplements (52.4%), and counsel about their proper use and/or side effects (56.9%). Conversely, the majority of the pharmacists rarely or never measure patients' waist circumference (83.8%) or calculate their body mass index (72.1%). Over 80% had very positive attitudes towards their role in weight management. Around three-quarters of the participants agreed or strongly agreed that difficulty in following-up with patients (80.7%), lack of private consultation area (75.7%), and lack of pharmacist's time (75.2%) are barriers for implementing WMSs. More than 60% stated that they are fully competent in 7 out of 24 WMSs listed. Some themes generated include pharmacist's role and impact in weight management, need for training about weight management, and impact of social media on patients' perceptions. Conclusion: Qatar community pharmacists reported positive attitudes towards the provision of WMSs. However, they identified several barriers against provision of WMSs. Several strategies are proposed to overcome barriers and to improve the provision of WMSs in community pharmacies in Qatar.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Robots are gaining attention as a potential solution to aging.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to explore the attitude of robot assistance in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) among elderly people living independently.
   METHODS: The one-on-one interview, buddy robot video and questionnaire survey were used to analyze mean, median, range, and the test results of non-parametric statistical methods such as Wilcoxon sign-rank test statistic and one-sample Wilcoxon sign-rank test statistic, so as to explore the attitude of the elderly living independently towards robot-assisted ADLs and the acceptance of the use of robots in 32 ADLs.
   RESULTS: The results showed that there were significant differences in the attitudes, usability and ease of use of elderly people towards robot assistance before and after watching the Buddy Robot video and they had a more positive attitude after watching the video. According to the results, the elderly was more receptive to the use of robots in activities such as "reminding to carry objects" and "reminding to take medicine", while they were less receptive to the use of robots in the group or private activities such as "playing mahjong" and "taking a bath".
   CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the elderly had a positive attitude towards the use of robot-assisted ADLs, and there were differences in the acceptance of robot-assisted ADLs. The results are helpful to understand the assistance needs and attitudes of the elderly, and provide a reference for the design of assistive robots that meet user needs, and ultimately improve the ability of the elderly to live independently at home.

AB  - Introduction: Practice placements are essential for radiotherapy students to learn and embed the necessary skills for practice; thus, each placement should afford an optimum learning experience. A key finding from the Phase 3 student arm of recent doctoral research suggests that for some students an optimum learning experience is not guaranteed. Using students' own words, this paper seeks to increase radiographers' awareness of how their behaviours can affect students' placement learning, and aims to help improve the placement learning experience for both.
   Method: A three-phase, U.K.-wide, mixed methods study was conducted. In the Phase 3 student arm, qualitative data were gathered via focus groups/interviews from volunteer student radiographers. Data were transcribed, manually coded, and analysed thematically by the Researcher using the applied research methodology Framework Analysis.
   Results: The analysed data were complimentary to radiographers, overall, but common themes were identified criticising certain of their attitudes and behaviours. Students exhibited fragility in response to perceived negative attitudes and behaviours, and failed to develop resilience in response to further similar experiences. This had a negative effect on their placement learning. Positive attitudes from radiographers enhanced students' placement learning. The placement experiences of radiotherapy students are consistent with those of other AHP and nursing students identified in the literature.
   Conclusion: Increasing radiographers' awareness of the negative and positive effects of their behaviours and attitudes will help improve students' placement learning experience. Students' resilience may be improved by teaching them coping strategies to use on placement.
   Implications for practice: The retention of radiotherapy students is an urgent concern for the radiotherapy profession therefore it is important to take steps to improve it. Enhancing students' placement experience may contribute to increased retention. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The College of Radiographers. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to segment US green consumers based on their personal, social, and environmental motivations for purchasing pro-environmental products. By using two-step cluster analysis, this study revealed six green consumer segments, each with a distinct combination of motivations. The different segments display a wide range of demographic characteristics, knowledge of pro-environmental products, pro-environmental product use behavior, skepticism, and attitudes toward pro-environmental advertising. This study found that green consumers, who have strong environmental motivations, have high knowledge about pro-environmental products, use a higher number and more varied selection of such products, tend to have less skepticism toward pro-environmental advertising, and have more positive attitudes toward such advertising. The study expands the motivations used in green consumer segmentation, delivering a more detailed analysis of the drivers of green consumer behavior. It also helps to explain the contradictions in the literature as to whether or not green consumers are open to or skeptical of green advertising.

AB  - "Fear of Missing Out " (FOMO) is an all-consuming feeling that is associated with mental and emotional stress. Such strains are caused by a compulsive concern that one is missing an opportunity for a socially rewarding experience often spotted on social media networks. While several personality and psychological factors have been empirically validated as correlated with FOMO, so far, little research has examined the effects of perceived group centrality (i.e., the extent to which group members feel included in the group) and fear of social exclusion on FOMO. Therefore, this study is aimed at examining the mechanism that links these socially driven factors and the need to belong with social media use and, consequently, FOMO, using structural equation modeling. A total of 490 college students (mean age=20.56,SD=1.44) completed a self-reported questionnaire that included measures of FOMO, the need to belong, social media use, perceived centrality, and fear of social exclusion. The need to belong emerged as the best predictor of FOMO, increasing it both directly and indirectly through the significant mediation of social media use. Females reported a greater need to belong and consequently more FOMO. Females also reported greater use of social media and greater perceived group centrality. Perceived centrality increased FOMO through social media use, but this indirect effect was not significant.

KW  - Online experiment
KW  - Vaccine attitudes
AB  - Social media vaccine misinformation can negatively influence vaccine attitudes. It is urgent to develop communication approaches to reduce the misinformation?s impact. This study aimed to test the effects of fact checking labels for misinformation on attitudes toward vaccines. An online survey experiment with 1198 participants recruited from a U.S. national sample was conducted in 2018. Participants were randomly assigned to six conditions: misinformation control, or fact-checking label conditions attributed to algorithms, news media, health institutions, research universities, or fact-checking organizations. We analyzed differences in vaccine attitudes between the fact-checking label and control conditions. Further, we compared perceived expertise and trustworthiness of the five categories of fact-checking sources. Fact-checking labels attached to misinformation posts made vaccine attitudes more positive compared to the misinformation control condition (P = .003, Cohen?s d= 0.21). Conspiracy ideation moderated the effect of the labels on vaccine attitudes (P = .02). Universities and health institutions were rated significantly higher on source expertise than other sources. Mediation analyses showed labels attributed to universities and health institutions indirectly resulted in more positive attitudes than other sources through perceived expertise. Exposure to fact-checking labels on misinformation can generate more positive attitudes toward vaccines in comparison to exposure to misinformation. Incorporating labels from trusted universities and health institutions on social media platforms is a promising direction for addressing the vaccine misinformation problem. This points to the necessity for closer collaboration between public health and research institutions and social media companies to join efforts in addressing the current misinformation threat.

KW  - VIRUS
AB  - Introduction
   Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a major cause of high morbidity and mortality in several states across India. However, in 2014, a sharp rise was observed in the number of cases of JE in north-eastern Assam state, and 51% of the total cases of JE in India were reported from the Assam in the same year. In this regard, a study was conducted to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of healthcare workers in Darrang, a district of Assam highly affected by JE.
   Methods
   A cross sectional study was conducted for 2 months among HCWs in the major district hospital of Darrang, Assam. A pre-tested, self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from the participants. Convenience sampling approach was used to collect data from different departments of the hospitals. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were used to express the results.
   Results
   The knowledge of HCWs regarding JE was poor with a mean knowledge score of 11.02 +/- 2.39 (out of 17), while their attitudes were positive with a mean attitudes score of 43.16 +/- 2.47 (ranging from 13 to 52). Overall, 40.4% and 74.3% of participants demonstrated good knowledge and positive attitudes respectively. Cut-off score for good knowledge and positive attitudes toward JE was set as >= 12 and >40 respectively. Older participants (40-49 years) and experienced workers (>10 years) were significantly associated with good knowledge as compared to their referent group (p<0.05), while knowledge of nurses and other orderlies were significantly lower than physicians (p<0.01). Similar factors were associatedwith the positive attitudes of the participants with the exception of experience. Television was the major source of information regarding JE reported by HCWs (79%).
   Conclusion
   Although the knowledge was not optimized, HCWs exhibited positive attitudes towards JE. Future research is required to design, implement and evaluate interventions to improve the knowledge of JE among HCWs.

AB  - Background The social distancing during COVID-19 is likely to cause a feeling of alienation, which may pose a threat to the public's mental health. Our research aims to examine the relationship between negative emotions and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), considering the mediation effect of alienation and how it is moderated by anxiety and depression.
   Methods For this, the current study conducted a cross-sectional survey on 7145 participants during the outbreak of COVID-19, via online questionnaires comprised of a self-designed Negative emotions questionnaire, Symptom Check List 90 (SCL-90), PTSD Checklist-civilian version (PCL-C), and Adolescent Students Alienation Scale (ASAS).
   Results A total of 6666 pieces of data from the general population were included in the statistical analysis. The descriptive statistics showed a relatively mild level of mental disorders. Besides, results of Conditional Process Model analysis supported our hypotheses that negative emotions and alienation were both predictors for PTSD symptoms, and their direct and indirect effects were all moderated by the level of anxiety.
   Limitations This study was limited by the generality and causality of the conclusion. The moderating effect of depression was left for further study due to the collinearity problem of variables.
   Conclusions Social distancing may have an impact on individuals' mental health by the feeling of alienation, which was moderated by affective disorders. Clinical psychologists should identify individuals' particular cognition and mental disorders to provide a more accurate and adequate intervention for them.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to outline government online training practice. We searched individual research domains of the human-dimensions of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), information and communications technologies (ICT) and instructional design for evidence of either corporate sector or government training practices. We overlapped these domains to investigate primary research outcomes. Corporate sector and government employees encounter barriers to their adoption of web-mediated training. One such barrier is a lack of enthusiasm, possibly due to ineffective instructional design, which in turn affects motivation towards online learning. Although the Australian Government offers training incentives to the general community, a negative attitude towards online training persists in the community, particularly throughout the government sector. Adoption of effective ICT training tools is a critical issue for the corporate sector and government agencies worldwide. This paper presents a compelling case for courseware designers to develop sound instructional design principles to enhance web-mediated learning programmes.

AB  - Previous studies have found that "disgust-sensitive" individuals have negative attitudes toward gay and lesbian people, but the underlying mechanisms for such attitudes remain unclear. Based on moral foundations theory, the current paper assumes that the relationship between disgust sensitivity and attitudes toward homosexuality are mediated by moral foundations. In order to test this assumption, the current authors examined the questionnaire answers from a total of 452 Chinese undergraduates who participated in this study. The results showed that disgust sensitivity was positively correlated with negative attitudes toward homosexuality, and positively correlated with moral concerns in five domains (care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and sanctity). Authority and sanctity were both associated with attitudes toward homosexuality, while only sanctity mediated the relationship between disgust sensitivity and attitudes toward homosexuality. Overall, the results suggest that considering moral foundations (especially sanctity) may lend more insight to the associations between disgust sensitivity and negative attitudes toward gay and lesbian people.

AB  - In an experiment, participants exposed to depictions of an intergroup interaction between a border patrolling U. S. citizen and an illegal immigrant demonstrated changed attitudes toward illegal immigrants depending on the valence of the portrayal. Negative effects were enhanced among people who identified more strongly with the U. S. citizen character, and positive effects were moderately, although nonsignificantly enhanced among those who viewed the illegal immigrant character as more typical of illegal immigrants in general. Liking of the illegal immigrant character was a significant mediator of the effects. The positive effects on attitudes toward illegal immigrants transferred to more positive attitudes toward other social groups as well. The study is framed in terms of a social cognitive theory approach to vicarious intergroup contact.

AB  - Introduction: Regular reporting of health inequalities is essential to monitoring progress of efforts to reduce health inequalities. While reporting of population health became increasingly common, reporting of a subpopulation group breakdown of each indicator of the health of the population is rarely a standard practice. This study reports education-, sex-, and race-related inequalities in four health outcomes in each of the selected 93 counties in the United States in a systematic and comparable manner.
   Methods: This study is a cross-sectional analysis of large, publicly available data, 2008, 2009, and 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Selected Metropolitan/Micropolitan Area Risk Trends (SMART) and 2008, 2009, and 2010 United States Birth Records from the National Vital Statistics System. The study population is American adults older than 25 years of age residing in the selected 93 counties, representing about 30% of the US population, roughly equally covering all geographic regions of the country. Main outcome measures are: (1) Attribute (group characteristic)-specific inequality: education-, sex-, or race-specific inequality in each of the four health outcomes (poor or fair health, poor physical health days, poor mental health days, and low birthweight) in each county; (2) Overall inequality: the average of these three attribute-specific inequalities for each health outcome in each county; and (3) Summary inequality in total morbidity: the weighted average of the overall inequalities across the four health outcomes in each county.
   Results: The range of inequality across the counties differed considerably by health outcome; inequality in poor or fair health had the widest range and the highest median among inequalities in all health outcomes. In more than 70% of the counties, education-specific inequality was the largest in all health outcomes except for low birthweight.
   Conclusions: It is feasible to extend population health reporting to include reporting of a subpopulation group breakdown of each indicator of the health of the population at a small jurisdictional level using publicly available data. No single group characteristic or health outcome represents the whole picture of health inequalities in a population. Examining multiple group characteristics and outcomes in a comparable manner is essential in reporting health inequalities.

Methods A cross-sectional survey was administered to healthcare professionals (defined as someone who is authorized to diagnose and/or treat physical or mental health disorders) currently employed at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center. Beliefs around the role of R&S within the clinical encounter were assessed using four adapted subscales/dimensions (D1-D4) from the Religion and Spirituality in Medicine: Physicians' Perspectives measure: God actively intervenes in patient health (D1), R&S is beneficial for patient mental health (D2), provider inquires about (D3) and discusses (D4) R&S in the clinical encounter. Logistic (D1) and linear (D2-D4) regression were performed using SAS v9.4 to determine the relationship between provider type and each subscale while controlling for gender, race, relationship status, education, and R&S identity. Results Among 340 participants, most participants were female (82.1%) or Caucasian (82.6%) and the median age was 35 years (IQR 31-48). Providers included physicians (17.9%), nurses (64.7%), and "other" (17.4%). Most participants identified as religious (57.5%), followed by spiritual (30.2%) and neither religious nor spiritual (12.3%). Nurses and other providers were more likely than physicians to believe that God intervenes in patient health (physician 41.7% vs. nurse 61.8% vs. other 60.3%;p = 0.02). All providers were equally as likely to believe that R&S is beneficial for patient mental health and to discuss R&S with patients within the clinical encounter (bothp > 0.05). In contrast, nurses more frequently reported inquiring about R&S (median 1.7; IQR 0.9-2.0) compared with physicians (median 1.0; IQR 0.9-2.0) or other providers (median 1.4; IQR 1.0-2.1) (p < 0.001). Conclusions There were differences between providers in beliefs regarding the role of R&S in the clinical cancer encounter. Of note, nurses and other provider types were more likely than physicians to inquire about R&S with patients. Understanding variations in these beliefs will help determine how to best incorporate R&S support for patients during their cancer care.

AB  - Based on the new technology initiative in Serbian education, we explored primary school teachers' attitudes toward Computer Assisted Learning (CAL) in biology teaching, as well as the relationships between the teachers' attitudes and four independent variables: age, teaching experience, teachers' competence to use modern teaching aids and their professional advanced training in the field of computer applied learning. Fifty-four elementary school biology teachers from Novi Sad participated in the study. The findings suggested that the teachers generally had positive attitudes toward CAL in biology teaching. Correlation analyses revealed significant relationships between age, teaching experience, teachers' competence to use modern teaching aids in the teaching process, professional advanced training in the field of computer applied learning, and the teachers' attitudes toward CAL. We offer suggestions for further research in this field.

AB  - This exploratory study engages with eight case studies of music performances broadcast online to investigate the role of music in facilitating social cohesion, intercultural understanding and community resilience during a time of social distancing and concomitant heightened racial tensions. Using an online ethnographic approach and thematic analysis of video comments, the nature of audience engagement with music performances broadcast via YouTube during COVID-19 lockdown of 2020 is explored through the lens of ritual engagement with media events and models of social capital. The eight case studies featured virtual choirs, orchestras and music collaborations of various genres, including classical, pop and fusion styles drawing from European, Asia Minor, South African, West African, North African, Arabic, South Asian, and East Asian cultural origins. Five overarching themes resulted from thematic analysis of video comments, including Interaction, Unity, Resilience, Identity, and Emotion. The paper contributes important theorisation that ritual engagement and social learning fosters intercultural understanding through engaging with music both cognitively and emotionally, which can in turn shape both individual and collective identity. Online platforms provide scope for both bonding and bridging opportunities. Community resilience is supported through the sharing of knowledge, sustaining music practice during social distancing, as well as emotional support shared among audience participants, with potential wellbeing outcomes.

AB  - Common people that are apparently randomly selected by journalists to illustrate a news story (popular exemplars) have a substantial effect on what the audience think about the issue. This effect may be partly due to the mere fact that popular exemplars attract attention and act as attention commanders just like many other speaking sources in the news. Yet, popular exemplars' effects extend well beyond that of other talking sources. Due to their similarity, trustworthiness, and the vividness of their account, popular exemplars have significantly more impact than experts that are being interviewed or, in particular, than politicians that are quoted in the news. We show this drawing on an internet-based experiment that uses fake television news items as stimuli and that systematically compares the effect of these talking sources in the news. We also find that taking into account preexisting attitudes changes the findings substantially. The effects are more robust and yield a more nuanced picture of what type of exemplars have what kind of effect on what type of public.

AB  - Background: Recent implementation of national health coverage and the increasing health burden in Indonesia require health professionals, including pharmacists, to work more collaboratively to improve access and quality of health care. Nevertheless, relatively little is known about Indonesian pharmacists' attitude towards collaboration.
   Objective: To assess and compare the attitude of Indonesian pharmacy students and pharmacists towards collaboration with physicians.
   Methods: A survey of 95 pharmacy students (Universitas Surabaya) and 114 pharmacists (public health facilities in East Java) in Indonesia was conducted using the validated questionnaire, Scale of Attitudes Toward Physician-Pharmacist Collaboration (SATP2C), which was translated in Bahasa Indonesia. The questionnaire contained 16 items which were based on a 4-point Likert scale. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the responses, (i.e., individual scores, factor scores and total scores).
   Results: Response rates of 97.9% and 65.8% were reported for students and pharmacists, respectively. The mean total score of SATP2C among Indonesian students and pharmacists were 56.53 versus 56.77, respectively; indicating positive attitudes toward collaboration. Further analysis of each item of SATP2C confirmed the positive attitudes in which mean and median scores of were reported for most items in both groups. Significant differences between students and pharmacists were found regarding the following items: (i) 'there are many overlapping areas of responsibility between pharmacists and physicians' (3.28 versus 2.89, respectively; p<0.001), (ii) 'pharmacist should clarify a physician's order' (3.54 versus 3.71, respectively; p=0.046); and (iii) 'physicians should consult with pharmacists about adverse reactions or refractory to drug treatment' (3.60 versus 3.44, respectively; p=0.022).
   Conclusions: Indonesian pharmacists reported positive attitudes toward collaboration with physicians. Further research is needed to understand other factors contributing in translating those positive attitudes into actual practice, and thus, providing a good foundation for policy makers, researchers and practitioners to support pharmacist-physician collaboration in Indonesia.

AB  - This study tests whether the consequences of cross-cutting exposure (CCE) to political news on affective polarization depend on the type of media individuals consume. Findings from the 2020 American National Election Studies panel data suggest that CCE to cable TV news, a medium frequently described as uncivil, may increase negative affect toward the out-party candidate, and that such effect may be mediated by feelings of anger and certainty in one's political attitudes. These insights draw attention to elite incivility, in addition to citizens' partisan predispositions, as a potential contributor to the growing affective divide in American politics.

AB  - Awe is an emotional response to perceptually vast stimuli that transcend current frames of reference. Guided by prior work documenting that awe promotes humility, increases perceptions of uncertainty, and diminishes personal concerns, across 3 studies (N = 776) we tested the hypothesis that awe results in reduced conviction about one's ideological attitudes. In Study 1. participants induced to experience awe, relative to those feeling amusement or in a neutral control condition, expressed less conviction regarding their attitudes toward capital punishment. In 2 subsequent studies, we showed that experiencing awe decreased perceptions of ideological polarization in the U.S. vis-a-vis racial bias in the criminal justice system (Study 2) and reduced desired social distance from those with different viewpoints regarding immigration (Study 3)-effects that were partially mediated by reduced conviction. These findings indicate that awe may lead to uncertainty and ambivalence regarding one's attitudes, a form of epistemological humility, and that this in turn may promote reduced dogmatism and increased perceptions of social cohesion.

AB  - Despite a growing body of research outlining the harms of thirdhand smoke (THS), the public remains generally unaware of risks and exposure routes. This project built on past tobacco prevention campaigns and the tenants of McGuire's input-output model to implement and evaluate a seven-month Facebook-disseminated campaign seeking to improve THS awareness among California adults (n = 1087). Multilinear regression showed that THS-related knowledge (chi(2)[6] = 19.31, p < .01), attitude (chi(2)[6] = 13.88, p < .05), and efficacy (chi(2)[6] = 13.81, p < .05) significantly increased by the campaign's end, with messages highlighting children's health (r = .110, p < .05), pets (r = .145, p < .01), and dust reservoirs (r = .144, p < .01) as the most persuasive. Path analysis modeling found campaign recall to be associated with changes in knowledge (beta = .161, p < .01), which predicated attitude change (beta = .614, p < .001) and, in turn, behavior change (beta = .149, p < .05). Findings suggest social media campaigns should continue to educate diverse populations about new tobacco risks and that tobacco control advocates should consider integrating educational THS messages.

AB  - Studies on the social role of transport disadvantage have influenced the policy discourse, especially in the developed world. However, the potential of information and communication technologies (ICT) to improve access to opportunities has been rarely explored. In a scenario where disparities exist in both physical proximity and access to ICT, this study aims to analyse the interrelationships between three key areas viz. ICT, social disadvantage, and activity participation behaviour. A time use survey representative of Mumbai's housing disparity was conducted for 1205 individuals. The data showcased the differences in household socio-economic characteristics, individual personal characteristics, ICT use patterns, activity participation, and time allocation patterns. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate exclusionary factors and their interconnectedness. It was found out that 'social advantage' had a significant positive relationship with 'access to ICT' and 'farness to services'. The effects of exclusionary factors, along with activity and individual specific variables were tested on activity participation and time allocation behaviour using type II Tobit models. Finally, marginal effects of 'access to ICT' and 'farness to services' on activity participation and time allocation behaviour were estimated. The findings suggested that an increase in access to ICT increased in-home leisure participation and travel time allocation. However, no significant positive relationship was established between access to ICT and in-home mandatory activities. Policy implications of the findings were discussed highlighting the importance of an integrated framework to improve both physical access and the access to ICT to tackle the issue of social exclusion.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between student technology acceptance, student engagement, and perceived learning on tourism-related massive open online courses (MOOCs). The respondents include 389 Indian university students who took tourism-related MOOCs. The results of PLS-SEM indicate the weak relationship between MOOC technology acceptance and the perceived learning of students. Technology acceptance has an impact on student engagement, but the impact is not highly significant. The findings show the strong relationship between student engagement and perceived learning in the context of tourism-MOOCs. The study suggested several ways to ensure student engagement and perceived learning to develop a positive attitude toward MOOC platforms and institutions that deliver MOOCs. Several implications are drawn from the findings, and future research directions are suggested.

AB  - Purpose: The present study aims to develop a valid and reliable scale that measures attitude towards using technology in music education and to investigate pre-school and primary school pre-service teachers' attitudes towards using technology in music education concerning their demographic variables and musical experiences.
   Research Methods: A total of 640 students studying in pre-school and primary education departments at a public university in Turkey participated in this research (N=640). Data were collected using a questionnaire for collecting the demographic information and the musical background of the respondents in addition to Attitude towards Using Technology in Music Education Scale, which was developed by the researchers in this study.
   Findings: Analyses resulted in an 8-item Attitude towards Using Technology in Music Education Scale with a Cronbach's a of 0.931. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated a statistically significant model fit to the data with six indices indicating a good fit and three indicating a substantial fit. Attitude towards using technology in music education did not show any significant difference concerning gender and musical background. However, primary school pre-service teachers had a more positive attitude than those of pre-school pre-service teachers. Finally, age correlated with the attitude towards using technology in music education.
   Implications for Research and Practice: Attitude towards Using Technology in Music Education Scale is a valid and reliable research instrument. Having more experience in using technology or perceiving that the future profession and instructional program at the universities necessitate the use of technology improves attitude towards using technology. Positive attitudes of pre-service teachers, who feel themselves inadequate about using their voice and instruments, and have inadequate musical experience, maybe due to their belief that they will be able to compensate for these deficiencies in music with the opportunities offered by technology.

AB  - Aim This study aimed to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward COVID-19 among youth in Bangladesh.
   Subject and methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 5 May to 25 May 2020. People aged between 18 and 35 years were approached via social media to complete an online questionnaire that consisted of socio-demographic information and KAP toward COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted.
   Results Out of 707 survey participants, 57.1% were male, the majority were students (60.3%), aged 24-29 years (61.5%), having a bachelor's degree (57%), having family income 25,000-50,000 BDT (40.5%) and living in urban areas (64.4%). Participants gathered information on COVID-19 mostly through social media (70.4%). Overall, 61.2% had adequate knowledge with 78.9% having a positive attitudes toward COVID-19 and only 51.6% had good practices. Most (86.8%) of the participants were confident that COVID-19 will be successfully controlled and Bangladesh was handling the COVID-19 health crisis well (84.20%). Only 75.2% of participants always washed their hands with soap or hand-sanitizer, and 70.6% wore a mask when going outside the home. Factors associated with adequate knowledge were being female, having a master's degree and above, and living in an urban area (p < 0.05). Participants having adequate knowledge of COVID-19 had higher likelihood of positive attitudes (OR: 6.41, 95% CI = 2.34-25.56, p = 0.000) and good practices (OR: 8.93, 95% CI = 3.92-38.42, p = 0.000).
   Conclusion The findings highlight the need for tailored education programs for COVID-19 which incorporates consideration of associated factors to improve the level of public knowledge, attitudes, and practices.

AB  - As some nature experiences, such as viewing wild animals, may be difficult to implement in science education, immersive virtual reality (VR) technologies have become a promising tool in education. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the effectiveness of nature experiences in VR. In this study, 50 German university students (M = 23.76 years, SD = 3.73 years) from diverse disciplines were randomly assigned to an immersive (head-mounted display; Oculus Quest) or a nonimmersive setting (external computer screen; desktop computer) and individually watched two 360 degrees videos from the social media site YouTube about wolves in their natural habitat. Besides measuring participants' attitudes towards wolves, we investigated their feeling of presence in the virtual environments with the Spatial Presence Experience Scale (SPES) and the retrospective emotions of interest, joy, and fear with the Differential Affect Scale (M-DAS). The immersive head-mounted display induced higher levels of presence and interest compared to the nonimmersive external computer screen. While higher interest in the screen setting was associated with more positive attitudes towards wolves, such a correlation could not be found in the head-mounted display setting. Thus, our study found that immersive technology could induce interest in a nature experience related to the tested socio-scientific issue, even among people who did not already hold positive attitudes toward the issue. Overall, our findings suggest that 360 degrees videos using immersive technology provide nature experiences with positive affective learning outcomes, even though the study focused on nature experiences in VR and was not an educational experience per se. As we were unable to assess the role of novelty of VR experiences, the application of VR technologies and its effects in larger teaching and learning settings needs to be evaluated in further studies.

AB  - Background and objectives: Enteral nutrition (EN) support plays a vital role in reducing malnutrition in hospitalised patients, and its provision is primarily a nurse's role. Therefore, nurses need to have adequate knowledge and a positive attitude regarding EN. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) regarding enteral nutrition of nursing personnel at 1 Military Hospital and to determine the need for updated in-service training.
   Method: A descriptive, cross-sectional study with an analytical component was used to collect data from military nurses through a validated self-administered questionnaire. A score of 80% and above was rated as adequate knowledge. Descriptive statistics were employed to describe the results and correlations were used to determine relationships between continuous variables.
   Results: In total, 207 (86.2% response rate) questionnaires were completed. The median knowledge score was 46.3% (mean 45.8 +/- 13.7%, range 6.3-81.2%). Only one participant achieved the target score of >= 80%, and 16.3% scored >= 60%. No significant differences were found between knowledge and professional rank (p = 0.14) and knowledge and years of working experience (r -= -0.01; p -= 0.85). A positive attitude towards EN was found and 96.1% of participants expressed the need for additional in-service training.
   Conclusion: The nursing personnel have inadequate EN knowledge, irrespective of their professional rank and experience. However, they are perceived to have positive attitudes towards the importance and administration of EN. Therefore, in-service training should be conducted regularly to mitigate the gap in knowledge.

AB  - This paper reports the findings of a study that aimed to identify the music beliefs and values of educators in early childhood education and care settings in Australia. The aims of the study were 2-fold: to adapt and pilot a survey of music beliefs and values which might be implemented subsequently nationally in childcare settings; and, secondly, to identify the music beliefs and values held by early childhood and care educators concerning music in children's learning. The research questions that guided this component of the study were: What is the profile of early childhood and care educators? What beliefs and values for music engagement are held by early childhood and care educators? What shapes early childhood and care educators'music beliefs and values? Findings indicated that educators' beliefs and values on all items are above the mid-point indicating overall positive attitudes toward music despite the majority having no formal qualifications in music or a history of instrumental performance and/ or singing. Given the overall positive attitudes toward music we suggest there is enormous potential within this population for further professional learning and development targeted at music and its potential wider benefits in young children's learning and lives.

AB  - We investigated the endorsement of an expanded construct of environmental justice (ExEJ) that includes the rights of nature, other species, and future generations. We contextualized this study in terms of the environmental challenges posed by hydraulic fracturing. We used structural equation modeling to test a model that hypothesized that attitudes toward fracking would mediate an endorsement of ExEJ. We tested multiple factors that research suggests contribute to those attitudes using a student and non-student sample from a state experiencing fracking activity. Results suggest that self-transcendent factors directly predicted ExEJ endorsement, while self-focus factors predicted positive attitudes toward fracking, and a varied set of factors predicted a negative fracking attitude. Attitudes had no direct effect on ExEJ. Patterns of result suggest self-transcendent factors and avenues for change facilitate ExEJ, while self-enhancement factors influence positive fracking attitudes. Interpretations of these patterns are offered.

AB  - Democratic school climate, critical reflection, and student participation at school have been linked to the development of civic and political attitudes. The study aims to identify the contribution of these characteristics to the development of civic and political attitudes and their impact on students' participation (civic, political, activist, and lifestyle/online). Questionnaire data were collected in two waves with 1589 students from four European countries (Italy, Sweden, Germany, and the Czech Republic). Structural equation modelling tested the effects of school characteristics on different types of participation, mediated by institutional trust, political efficacy, and political interest. The results highlight the importance of opportunities for active involvement and critical reflection in fostering interest, efficacy, and all forms of participation activities. Democratic school climate was found to positively impact institutional trust and efficacy, but not participation. The findings highlight the need for a school environment that invites critical reflection and gives value to students' participation.

AB  - Background: Peer victimization is associated with increased risk for depression, as well as increased neural response to social exclusion in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the amygdala. Altered functional connectivity (FxC) of fronto-limbic circuitry is associated with risk for various affective disorders. The present study examined the relationship between fronto-limbic FxC during social exclusion, prior peer victimization experience and depressive symptoms.
   Methods: Three mutually exclusive groups were formed: peer victimized (with a history of peer victimization), defenders (history of defending peers), and controls (no prior peer victimization experience) (n = 15/group; M-age = 17.7 years). Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data were collected while participants completed the Cyberball paradigm (simulating the experience of social exclusion). FxC between the Medial Prefrontal Cortex (MPFC), ACC, right insula and left amygdala, was compared between groups and examined in relation to depressive symptoms.
   Results: Prior peer victimization experience was associated with differences in fronto-limbic FxC across social inclusion and exclusion. Defenders displayed distinct shifts in FxC across the transition from being included to excluded. Peer victimized individuals exhibited a unique pattern of amygdala-specific FxC during inclusive interaction with peers, and in the continuous FxC across inclusion and exclusion. FxC of the MPFC-amygdala across inclusion and exclusion moderated the relationship between peer victimization and depressive symptoms.
   Limitations: Small sample size and cross-sectional design limit interpretation of the findings.
   Conclusions: Peer victimized individuals who exhibit continuous positive FxC of the MPFC-left amygdala across inclusion and exclusion may be at greater risk for depressive symptoms.

AB  - Background
   The COVID-19 outbreak raised questions about how people experience their mental health, quality of life (QoL), wellbeing and loneliness in the context of social distancing, and the use of social media during this time
   Aims
   To examine the experience of mental health, QoL, wellbeing and loneliness and use of social media among people living in Norway, USA, UK and Australia.
   Methods
   A cross-country comparative survey of people living in Norway, USA, UK and Australia. Relevant statistical analyses were used to examine differences between the countries and to explore associations between demographic, mental health and psychosocial variables and use of social media.
   Results
   There were 3810 respondents from four countries, of which 50 - 74% showed a high level of emotional distress. The Norwegian population reported significantly better mental health, QoL and wellbeing and lower levels of loneliness compared to the other countries. High-frequent use of social media after the COVID-19 outbreak was associated with poorer mental- and psychosocial health.
   Conclusions
   The results suggest that the COVID-19 outbreak took a toll on people's experience of mental health, QoL, wellbeing and experienced loneliness, and high-frequent use of social media was associated with these factors.

AB  - Is a powerful person more or less generous than a powerless person in terms of charitable giving request? In this work, we argue that power's effect on charitable giving depends on donation target. Across two studies, having high power decreased donation to a specific person, whereas having high power increased donation to a charitable organization. Moreover, the effect of power on donation across donation targets was mediated by the felt social distance toward the population in need. We discuss the theoretical implications for contemporary debates about power's effects and practical implications of power for designing effective donation appeals.

AB  - Pandemics such as that of COVID-19 affect a relatively large number of people and impose new rules and social habits on the world population. Information about the pandemic is constant in the media. Moreover, social distancing has been adopted in Brazil to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which may have economic and psychosocial consequences. This study aimed to verify the factors associated with indicators of mental disorders symptoms in residents of Rio Grande do Sul during the initial period of the social distancing policy. The study was approved by CONEP. There were 799 participants, aged between 18 and 75 years (M = 36.56; SD = 12.88); 82.7% were women, who answered a sociodemographic questionnaire of social distancing and the Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20). The results indicated that having decreased income in the period, being part of the risk group and being more exposed to information about deaths and infected, are factors that can significantly harm mental health in this pandemic period. Investigating social determinants that contribute to greater vulnerability to the mental illness of the population is vital in the field of collective health for the planning of public actions and policies.

AB  - Quantified self refers to the process consumers collect, analyze to reflect, control, and optimize their behaviors, thus obtaining self-knowledge. Since the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our lives dramatically, this research aims to explore how mortality salience caused by COVID-19 affects people's quantified self behavior. The current study used an online survey and the experimental method to test multiple research hypotheses. The results indicated that mortality salience has a positive impact on quantified self; perceived control mediates the relationship between mortality salience and the quantified self, and social distance plays a moderating role between mortality salience and perceived control. The conclusions provide a new way to help people deal with anxiety and fear brought by the COVID-19, and enhance public health and well-being.

AB  - Despite the significant increase in the use of nanotechnology in academic research and commercial products over the past decade, there have been few studies that have explored scientists' perceptions and attitudes about the technology. In this article, we use survey data from the leading U.S. nano-scientists to explore their perceptions about two issues: the public communication of research findings and media coverage of nanotechnology, which serves as one relatively rapid outlet for public communication. We find that leading U.S. nano-scientists do see an important connection between the public communication of research findings and public attitudes about science. Also, there is a connection between the scientists' perceptions about media coverage and their views on the timing of public communication; scientists with positive attitudes about the media are more likely to support immediate public communication of research findings, while others believe that communication should take place only after research findings have been published through a peer-review process. We also demonstrate that journalists might have a more challenging time getting scientists to talk with them about nanotechnology news stories because nano-scientists tend to view media coverage of nanotechnology as less credible and less accurate than general science media coverage. We conclude that leading U.S. nano-scientists do feel a sense of responsibility for communicating their research findings to the public, but attitudes about the timing and the pathway of that communication vary across the group.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to adopt a critical relational dialectics framework to identify and explore gender discursive struggles about social inclusion observed in an online gaming community, in South Africa.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper uses a technique called contrapuntal analysis to identify and explore competing discourses in over 200 messages on gender struggles about social inclusion posted in the local community's gamer discussion board, based on seven threads initiated by women gamer activists.
   Findings The findings show how four interrelated gender discursive struggles about social inclusion and social exclusion animated the meanings of online gamer relations: dominance vs equality, stereotyping vs diversity, competitiveness vs cooperativeness and privilege vs empowerment.
   Practical implications Game designers should reinforce more accurate and positive stereotypes to cater for the rapidly growing female gamer segment joining the online gaming market and to develop a less chauvinistic and more diversely representative online gaming community. Enlightened gamers should exercise greater solidarity in fighting for gender equality in online gaming communities.
   Originality/value The critical relational dialectics analysis adopted in this study offers a promising avenue to understand and critique the discursive struggles that arise when online gamers from the different gender groups relate. The findings highlight the unequal discursive power and privilege of many white male gamers when discussing social inclusion. Advancing our understanding of these discursive struggles creates the possibilities for improving social inclusion in online gaming communities.

AB  - Introduction Approximately 10 million people in Brazil have some hearing impairment. Because of the natural progression of hearing impairment to presbycusis, coupled with the increasing number of young people exposed to the risk factors for early hearing loss, the social impact of hearing impairment is high. Objective A team of otolaryngologists and speech therapists conducted an unprecedented worldwide campaign in the primary health sector, aiming to reduce the global burden of hearing impairment with preventive measures. Methods A cultural information campaign called "Ear Parade" was developed. It lasted 3 months, during which SAo Paulo received information on the prevention of deafness and the importance of hearing rehabilitation to reduce prejudice against the use of hearing aids. Results The information was relayed through an art exhibition of public paintings, including 62 sculptures of ears, 2.40 meters high, which colored the city, elucidating the beauty of hearing. The media coverage impacted 170 million people, and at the end of the campaign, a nongovernmental organization was established to raise resources for hearing rehabilitation. In addition, an auction of the ear sculptures raised money toward hearing aid batteries and stem-cell research for hearing. Conclusion The present paper presents the effects of this campaign. Information dissemination is a powerful preventive measure for the primary healthcare system to reduce future treatment expenditures.

AB  - Purpose This paper investigates the use of Twitter for studying the social representations of different regions across the world towards new food trends. Design/methodology/approach A density-based clustering algorithm was applied to 7,014 tweets to identify regions of consumers sharing content about food trends. The attitude of their social representations was addressed with the sentiment analysis, and grid maps were used to explore subregional differences. Findings Twitter users have a weak, positive attitude towards food trends, and significant differences were found across regions identified, which suggests that factors at the regional level such as cultural context determine users' attitude towards food innovations. The subregional analysis showed differences at the local level, which reinforces the evidence that context matters in consumers' attitude expressed in social media. Research limitations/implications The social media content is sensitive to spatio-temporal events. Therefore, research should take into account content, location and contextual information to understand consumers' perceptions. The methodology proposed here serves to identify consumers' regions and to characterize their attitude towards specific topics. It considers not only administrative but also cognitive boundaries in order to analyse subsequent contextual influences on consumers' social representations. Practical implications The approach presented allows marketers to identify regions of interest and localize consumers' attitudes towards their products using social media data, providing real-time information to contrast with their strategies in different areas and adapt them to consumers' feelings. Originality/value This study presents a research methodology to analyse food consumers' understanding and perceptions using not only content but also geographical information of social media data, which provides a means to extract more information than the content analysis applied in the literature.

AB  - The Olympic Games are one of the most popular global mega-media events. However, the ways in which the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games in London were reported varied significantly from one country to another. In order to compare how different countries represented this event, we conducted a qualitative discourse analysis of three days of television news coverage from 10 channels in five countries: the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. We explored whether different locations, political systems, and television systems affect how the same event is reported. We found that while European public service broadcasters (BBC and ARD) were more serious, critical, and political than their commercial counterparts (ITV and RTL), the Japanese commercial broadcaster's coverage of the event was more critical than that of the public service broadcaster, which was popularized and nationalistic throughout. In China, the more market-oriented Dragon TV was more evaluative in its reporting than the state-run CCTV. NBC, which monopolized the broadcast rights in the United States, emphasized the universal values of the Olympics and avoided nationalism. In light of our results, future attention should be directed toward the role of commercial broadcasting in a contemporary globalized world in which ideological constellations are changing.

AB  - The spread of misinformation on the internet regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, such as unproven or fake cures, has been a serious concern. However, the extent to which social media usage affects individuals? health behavior, particularly when reliable information is scarce, is not well understood. This study evaluates the impact of social media usage on individuals? responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as demand for necessities and social distancing. We conduct an original online survey of 1804 Japanese respondents in March 2020. Japan is suitable because it confirmed COVID-19 cases earlier than most other countries. Scientific evidence about the coronavirus and protective measures was scarce in the initial pandemic phase, despite the spread of unconfirmed rumors. Our analysis focuses on the usage of Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. We use the entropy balancing method to control for heterogeneity in observed characteristics between social media users and non-users. The results show that while users are more likely to maintain social distancing practices, they are also more likely to take measures whose reliability is not scientifically confirmed, such as eating fermented soybeans. Although previous studies emphasize the negative effects of social media, our results suggest that it has both bright and dark sides.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine how and when narcissism and faith in humanity simultaneously influence product reuse. Despite its critical role in promoting sustainability, scholars have paid scant attention to product reuse as a reliable aspect of sustainable consumer behavior. Moreover, research on personality traits as drivers of sustainable consumption has mostly focused on the Big Five personality traits. We posit that the effects of consumers' narcissism and faith in humanity on product reuse are explained by social exclusion and are conditional on subjective norms. We test our hypotheses using two experiments and three cross-sectional surveys. We find that while narcissism has a negative effect on product reuse, faith in humanity has a positive effect on product reuse. We also observe that social exclusion mediates the effects of narcissism and faith in humanity, and that subjective norms positively moderate the relationships between narcissism and product reuse. This study highlights the importance of product reuse as a key indicator of sustainable consumption and offers novel insights into the how and when consumers engage in product reuse.

AB  - Recent studies of alcohol consumption among students have consistently linked in-group influence with excessive drinking. Concurrently, these studies have largely overlooked the influence of non-alcohol-consuming peers (the out-group) on the in-group's decisions to consume alcohol. However, out-groups can have a significant impact on in-group members' decisions regarding publicly consumed products (White, Simpson, & Argo, ), such as is the case of alcohol. In light of this, our study aims to explore how in-group members' views of their consumption of alcohol are influenced by their out-group. This study uses Social Identity Theory as the theoretical lens to explain consumer interaction with the out-group (abstainers) and subsequent views of in-group members (alcohol consumers). A social constructivist approach is adopted to enable this exploration of meaning, with concomitant use of the qualitative narrative methodology. A sample of 18 postgraduate students studying in the UK was selected. Narratives were collected and analysed using thematic analysis. Although the widely accepted view is that people tend to avoid products or behaviours that are linked with an out-group, this paper demonstrates conditions in which alcohol consumers appreciate the out-group. Furthermore, it reveals how drinkers' interaction with their out-group can lead to negative attitudes towards their in-group and their own consumption of alcohol. Based on their views of out-groups, we propose a categorisation of alcohol consumers into 3 groups: avoiders, open admirers, and covert admirers. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical implications for social marketers and policy makers.

AB  - The present study examined the role of positive outcome expectancy in the relationship between peer/parental influence and Internet gaming addiction (IGA) among adolescents in Taiwan. Two thousand, one hundred and four junior high students completed the Chen Internet Addiction Scale for IGA, Parental Influence for IGA, peer influence for IGA, and Positive Outcome Expectancy of Internet Gaming Questionnaire. Results showed that the three types of peer influences (positive attitudes toward Internet gaming, frequency of Internet game use, and invitation to play) and positive outcome expectancy were significantly and positively correlated with IGA. Moreover, peer influence was also positively correlated with positive outcome expectancy. On the other hand, positive outcome expectancy and parental influences had a low correlation. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that positive outcome expectancy did not mediate the relationship between either type of parental influences and IGA, and only the parent's invitation to play Internet games directly predicted IGA severity. However, peers' positive attitude or the frequency of peers' Internet game use positively predicted IGA and was fully mediated through positive outcome expectancy of Internet gaming. In addition, the frequency of peers' invitation to play Internet games directly and indirectly predicted IGA severity through a partial mediation of positive outcome expectancy of Internet gaming. The overall fit of the model was adequate and was able to explain 25.0 percent of the variance. The findings provide evidence in illuminating the role of peer influences and positive outcome expectancy of Internet gaming in the process of why adolescents may develop IGA.

AB  - Cross-group romantic relationships are an extremely intimate and often maligned form of intergroup contact. Yet, according to intergroup contact theory, these relationships have the potential to improve the intergroup attitudes of others via extended contact. This study combines the interpersonal and intergroup literatures to examine the outcomes associated with knowing a partner in a cross-group romantic relationship. Results suggest that cross-group romantic partners encounter greater disapproval toward their relationships than same-group partners and, as a result, their relationships are perceived more negatively. Nevertheless, extended contact with cross-group partners, controlling for participants' cross-group friendships and romantic relationships, predicts more positive attitudes toward cross-group dating and positive intergroup attitudes in general, mediated by perceived ingroup norms toward cross-group relationships.

AB  - Objective Social participation in daily living the activities requires the maintenance of a variety of social relationships with others and engagement in various social activities. Proper social participation increases the feeling of attachment, provides a stable sense of identity, and increases one's sense of worth, belonging, and dependence on society. Lack of social participation leads to anxiety, loneliness, depression, panic, mental disorders and many other mental problems and affects society in general. A new coronavirus, called COVID-19, was identified in late December 2019 in China. After just one year, it has been reportedly infected more than 85 million people (up to January 1, 2021) worldwide, and more than 1.8 million have died. Two public health measures to break the transmission chain include quarantine and social distancing. These measures restrict gatherings or separate individuals. Due to these measures in many countries, people's participation in many social activities has been disrupted. The purpose of this study is to survey the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on home integration, community integration and productive activities.
   Materials & Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in June 2020 by using the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) which measures home integration, community integration, and productive activities, along with a demographic form which were sent to 461 participants in Iran (Mean +/- SD age= 36.86 +/- 5.8 years) on WhatsApp or via email and completed online. Participants were selected from among college students, patients, people with disabilities, their families and relatives, and others who could use smartphones, computers, tablets, and laptops. The effects of Covid-19 were evaluated by analyzing the CIQ scores before and after the pandemic in SPSS v. 22 software.
   Results Comparing the CIQ scores before and after the pandemic, results showed that it significantly reduced home integration (P<0.0001), social integration (P<0.0001), productive activities (P<0.0001) and total score (P<0.0001).
   Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the social life of people. In addition to health threats of this disease, the fear of being infected and losing loved ones, job, educational opportunities, recreation, freedom and support, have profound psychological effects. Not only getting infected, but also the fear of getting infected can lead to a lack of access to resources that can improve people's resistance to this disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has direct and indirect psychological and social effects and can affect mental health. In order to reduce the negative psychosocial effects of quarantine and social distancing, the implementation of national strategies to promote social participation by Information and Communication Technology-based programs is recommended.

AB  - Objective: To measure highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) among Cambodian women. Methods: This cross-sectional study selected 246 married women aged between 1855 years who had backyard poultry and lived at least one year in the areas of the survey through multi-stage cluster sampling. An average score of correct answers was generated to evaluate respondents' knowledge (Good/Poor), attitudes (Positive/Negative), and practices (Good/Bad). Results: We reported that about half of the respondents had good knowledge and good practices and four-fifth of them had positive attitudes towards HPAI. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated through a logistic regression model to explore contributing factors that raise their KAP levels. Most of the sources were significant in increasing knowledge of the respondent, like television (OR=1.6, 95% CI=1.02.7), radio (OR=2.5, 95% CI=1.34.9), leaflets/booklets (OR=2.1, 95% CI=1.23.9), school students (OR=18.4, 95% CI=2.4142.9), village health volunteers (OR=4.5, 95% CI=2.210.9) etc. Factors such as television (OR=3.7, 95% CI=2.16.4), leaflets/booklets (OR=2.6, 95% CI=1.45.1), and public health staff (OR=2.2, 95% CI=1.24.1) had similar influence on practices. Although, we found similar effect on raising the attitudes of the responded, it was not significant. Conclusions: We report a satisfactory level of positive attitudes, and moderate level of knowledge and practices related to HPAI among Cambodian women. Raising KAPs through television, radio and other medias may be more efficient than using usual information, education and communication materials to prevent HPAI.

AB  - Electronic Mediated Communication (EMC) has become highly prevalent in our daily lives. Many of the communication formats used in EMC are text-based (e.g., instant messaging), and users often include visual paralinguistic cues in their messages. In the current study, we examined the usage of two such cues - emoji and emoticons. Specifically, we compared self-reported frequency of use, as well as attitudes (6 bipolar items, e.g., "fun" vs. "boring") and motives for their usage (9 motives, e.g., "express how I feel to others"). We also examined these indicators according to age and gender. Overall, participants (N = 474, 72.6% women; M-age = 30.71, SD = 12.58) reported using emoji (vs. emoticons) more often, revealed more positive attitudes toward emoji usage, and identified more with motives to use them. Moreover, all the ratings were higher among younger (vs. older) participants. Results also showed that women reported to use emoji (but not emoticons) more often and expressed more positive attitudes toward their usage than men. However, these gender differences were particularly evident for younger participants. No gender differences were found for emoticons usage. These findings add to the emerging body of literature by showing the relevance of considering age and gender, and their interplay, when examining patterns of emoji and emoticons use.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the level of informed decision making in a randomized controlled trial comparing colonoscopy and CT-colonography for colorectal cancer screening.
   Methods: 8844 citizens aged 50-75 were randomly invited to colonoscopy (n = 5924) or CT-colonography (n = 2920) screening. All invitees received an information leaflet. Screenees received a questionnaire within 4 weeks before the planned examination, non-screenees 4 weeks after the invitation. A decision was categorized as informed when characterized by sufficient decision-relevant knowledge and consistent with personal attitudes toward participation in screening.
   Results: Knowledge and attitude items were completed by 1032/1276 colonoscopy screenees (81%), by 698/4648 colonoscopy non-screenees (15%), by 824/982 CT-colonography screenees (84%) and by 192/1938 CT-colonography non-screenees (10%). 1027 colonoscopy screenees (>99%) and 815 CT-colonography screenees (99%) had adequate knowledge; 915 (89%) and 742 (90%) had a positive attitude. 675 non-screenees invited to colonoscopy (97%) and 182 invited to CT-colonography (95%) had adequate knowledge; 344 (49%) and 94 (49%) expressed a negative attitude.
   Conclusion: A large majority of screenees made an informed decision on participation. Almost half of responding. non-screenees, made an uninformed decision, suggesting additional barriers to participation.
   Practice implications: Efforts to understand the additional barriers will create opportunities to facilitate informed participation to colorectal cancer screening. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between religious orientation and death attitudes in Christian U.S. students and Muslim Turkish students. It also assessed whether meaning in life mediated these relationships. Multivariate statistics and path analyses were conducted to identify significant predictors of death attitudes in these groups. Intrinsic religiosity was more consistently associated with positive attitudes toward death than extrinsic religiosity, and these patterns remained consistent across groups. Meaning in life mediated some of these relationships, although not consistently. Evidence suggesting differential relationships between religiosity and death attitudes across groups was found, although the overall results suggest more similarities than differences.

AB  - Background From 2015 to 2018, the Netherlands faced an outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) caused by serogroup W. To counter the rise in infections, the government introduced a catch-up menACWY vaccination campaign for teenagers in 2018 and 2019. The outbreak situation induced substantial media attention and a run on menACWY vaccines outside the vaccination campaign. This study aimed to gain insights into the dynamics of public perceptions of and responses to the outbreak and the menACWY vaccination, and into the media coverage about the outbreak. Methods Three repeated surveys (N = 1110) between 2017 and 2019 were sent to parents of teenagers invited for a menACWY catch-up vaccination, other parents, and individuals with no under-age children. These surveys assessed IMD risk perceptions, attitudes towards the menACWY vaccination, trust in involved institutions, and willingness to vaccinate with the menACWY vaccine. Changes in the public perceptions and responses were studied with linear multilevel regression analyses. In addition, 103 national newspaper articles from the period 2017-2019 were thematically coded with themes about IMD and the menACWY vaccination. Results The survey results showed clear increases in perceived IMD severity, positive attitude towards the menACWY vaccination, and willingness to vaccinate over time. Perceived IMD vulnerability remained low across all three waves, and trust in involved institutions increased slightly. Differences between the survey groups were limited. The newspaper articles discussed the rise in infections extensively, the disease symptoms, and the possible fatal outcome of IMD. In addition, while many articles discussed the menACWY vaccine shortage, few discussed the safety or effectiveness of the vaccine. Conclusion The real-time insights into the interrelated dynamics of public perceptions, responses, and media coverage provide an integrated portrait of the social developments during this outbreak. The focus on IMD severity and the absence of doubt in the public discussion about vaccine safety may have played an important role in the societal response to this outbreak and the recommended vaccine.

AB  - Objectives Psychological and neural evidence suggests that negative attitudes toward stigmatized individuals arise in part from failures to perceive them as social targets. Here, we tested whether experimentally upregulating neural regions involved in social cognition would predict subsequent decreases in bias toward stigmatized individuals (i.e., people who use substances). Methods Participants underwent fMRI while completing either a lovingkindness intervention task or a control task, and each task was reinforced via daily text messages for a month following the one-time fMRI scan. Changes in implicit bias against stigmatized individuals were measured by Implicit Association Tests. Results The lovingkindness intervention task, compared with a control task, elicited greater baseline activity in the right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ), implicated in mentalizing, or the process of making inferences about others' mental states. The lovingkindness task compared with the control task also produced marginal decreases in bias over the month of the intervention. Individual differences in initial RTPJ activity at baseline during the fMRI intervention tasks further predicted improved implicit attitudes toward stigmatized individuals a month later. Conclusions The current study suggests that individual differences in people's tendency to engage brain regions that support taking others' perspectives are associated with greater changes in bias reduction over time. It is possible that strategies that upregulate mentalizing activity, such as lovingkindness training and other strategies that increase social cognitive processing, may be effective in shifting people's biases against stigmatized individuals.

AB  - This study expands uses and gratifications research into the area of political Instagram use. A survey shows the motives for following political leaders on the social media platform and how followers' motives are associated with their demographics and political attitudes. Findings indicate that information/guidance motives are the most important for following political leaders on Instagram, with social utility being the next highest motive. Also, males use Instagram more for social utility purposes than females, and having an entertainment motive is related to being young. The results also provide insight into how the politically active can be more influential on Instagram.

AB  - Background: Improving awareness, knowledge and attittude (AKA) of teachers and students about epilepsy is an important step to reduce the stigma experienced by children with epilepsy. To date there are no studies evaluating effectiveness of an information technology based epilepsy education programme in improving AKA among teachers and students. Method: Cross-sectional study was to assess the baseline AKA of epilepsy among Malaysian teachers and secondary school students, and to examine effectiveness improving their AKA using the Interactive Animated Epilepsy Education Programme (IAEEP). AKA of teachers and students were assessed pre- and post-implementationof IAEEP. Results: Total of 54 teachers and 67 secondary students participated in this study. The baseline AKA on epilepsy among Malaysian teachers was low in the awareness domain, moderate in the knowledge domain, and positive in the attitude domain. The baseline AKA on epilepsy among students was very low in the awareness domain, low in the knowledge domain, and indifferent in the attitude domain. The AKA scores in all domains of teachers and students improved significantly after introduction of 1AEEP (P<0.001). Post-IAEEP the AKA of teachers was moderate in the awareness domain, high in the knowledge domain, and very positive in the attitude domain; the AKA of students was low in the awareness domain, very high in the knowledge domain, and very positive in the attitude domain Conclusion: Our findings highlight a need for epilepsy educational programmes to be implemented in Malaysian schools. The IAEEP is an effective educational programme to improve the AKA particularly in the knowledge domain among teachers and students.

AB  - Objective: Health misinformation on social media threatens public health. One question that could lend insight into how and through whom misinformation spreads is whether certain people are susceptible to many types of health misinformation, regardless of the health topic at hand. This study provided an initial answer to this question and also tested four hypotheses concerning the psychosocial attributes of people who are susceptible to health misinformation: (1) deficits in knowledge or skill, (2) preexisting attitudes, (3) trust in health care and/or science, and (4) cognitive miserliness. Method: Participants in a national U.S. survey (N = 923) rated the perceived accuracy and influence of true and false social media posts about statin medications, cancer treatment, and the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine and then responded to individual difference and demographic questions. Results: Perceived accuracy of health misinformation was strongly correlated across statins, cancer, and the HPV vaccine (rs >= .70), indicating that individuals who are susceptible to misinformation about one of these topics are very likely to believe misinformation about the other topics as well. Misinformation susceptibility across all three topics was most strongly predicted by lower educational attainment and health literacy, distrust in the health care system, and positive attitudes toward alternative medicine. Conclusions: A person who is susceptible to online misinformation about one health topic may be susceptible to many types of health misinformation. Individuals who were more susceptible to health misinformation had less education and health literacy, less health care trust, and more positive attitudes toward alternative medicine.

AB  - "Augmented reality" (AR) is presented as technology that harmonizes, in real time and with user collaboration, digital information with physical information through different technological supports. Such are AR possibilities, that when it is incorporated into teaching, students show high satisfaction rates and positive attitudes for its use, but at the same time, a series of limitations and obstacles can be noticed. As an attempt to investigate the technical, curricular and organizational difficulties of AR incorporation in training contexts, an instrument "AR obstacle questionnaire" (CORA) was designed, which in turn was administered to a total of 264 subject experts for validation through the Delphi method, subsequently applying the "K coefficient" (K = 1/2 Kc (knowledge coefficient) + Ka (argumentation coefficient)), selecting those experts who obtained a >= 0,8 score in the coefficient. Among the results obtained in the study we manage to point out the main obstacles involving AR implementation into university education: the lack of teacher training and improvement, the few educational experiences found, lack of conceptual foundation, limited educational research and lack of institutional support.

AB  - Using Spencer-Oatey's (2005) rapport-management model to analyze data collected in open role-play interactions in Lima, Peril, this paper expands research on the preferred communicative patterns of Peruvian Spanish speakers when expressing gratitude in a situation exhibiting high social distance (+SD) and no power (-P) difference between interlocutors, and where the benefit received from the interlocutor is considerable. It is argued that although the development of interpersonal communication in social interactions reflects the relationship of each speaker with his/her interlocutor and his/her "own values and personal standards" (Furukawa 2000), it also reflects their cultural preferences to manage interpersonal relationships (Spencer-Oatey 2005).
   Results show that participants exhibited what apparently is prescribed behavior in this sociocultural context in the realization of their interactional goals: The creation and enhancement of the relationship using communicative strategies respecting the association and equity principles and enhancing the interlocutor's identity face. Despite the fact that disrespect to the interlocutor and violations to her autonomy were voiced, it is asserted here, that given this specific context, this might be expected and permitted behavior.

AB  - This study tested the relationships of individualism, power distance, and mastery orientation to 2 employee attitudes (organizational trust and organizational commitment) that are associated with employees' psychological benefits within the organization. Results from university employees (N = 706) showed that individualism negatively, whereas mastery positively, related to trust and commitment. Power distance positively related to trust only. The moderating role of mastery was also identified. These findings can help employment or organizational counselors to appreciate value-related factors that facilitate employees in psychologically integrating into the organization and to explore new ways for employers to foster employees' positive attitudes.

AB  - Using Cognitive Dissonance and Balance Theory, this study investigates factors that predict how and why MMO players inaccurately report their game playing time. It was hypothesized that players belonging to categories other than the stereotypical game player (e. g. younger, less educated, male) would be likely to underreport playing time. It was also hypothesized that those players who held less positive attitudes toward the game would be more likely to underreport their playing time. Comparing people's self-reported weekly usage of an MMO, EverQuest II, with their actual average weekly usage of the game, data showed that age, education, lack of enjoyment playing the game, and lack of an online sense of community predicted greater levels of underreporting.

AB  - This study contributes to the still limited evidence on the effects of online intergroup contact. We conceptualize online contact as occurring through users' comments online, an easy and accessible venue for intergroup encounters. We test two forms of online contact: encountering an outgroup member directly (direct online contact) or through an ingroup member (extended online contact) and their effects on outgroup attitudes, here various forms of threat and social distance. We also examine the emotional mechanisms through which these effects emerge. We rely on an online experiment (N = 396) testing online contact with two distinct outgroups, an undocumented immigrant or a gay person. Compared to the control, direct online contact decreased perceived threat and social distance toward gays and lesbians, but not toward undocumented immigrants. Direct online contact improved attitudes toward both outgroups through positive and negative emotions, whereas extended online contact reduced negative emotions, improving attitudes towards undocumented immigrants. We discuss theoretical, methodological and practical implications of these findings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that cognitive and social interventions are crucial to the overall health of older adults including their psychological, cognitive, and physical well-being. However, due to the rapidly growing elderly population of the world, the resources and people to provide these interventions is lacking. Our work focuses on the use of social robotic technologies to provide person-centered cognitive interventions. In this article, we investigate the acceptance and attitudes of older adults toward the human-like expressive socially assistive robot Brian 2.1 in order to determine if the robot's human-like assistive and social characteristics would promote the use of the robot as a cognitive and social interaction tool to aid with activities of daily living. The results of a robot acceptance questionnaire administered during a robot demonstration session with a group of 46 elderly adults showed that the majority of the individuals had positive attitudes toward the socially assistive robot and its intended applications.

AB  - In North America, Asians reliably report higher levels of stigma toward people with depression than do Europeans. Possible methods of reducing this discrepancy have rarely been explored. Asian undergraduate students (n = 132) were presented with one of four antistigma videos with two actresses: one portraying a student with depression and the other a professor. The videos used the concept of social proof, presenting either positive or negative descriptive norms, to effect change in stigma, measured by social distance. It was hypothesized that the positive descriptive norms intervention would show significantly greater positive change in social distance compared with the negative descriptive norms intervention. All videos were effective in reducing preferred social distance toward people with depression relative to the control condition. The effectiveness of the positive descriptive norm video was mediated through descriptive norms and self-efficacy. The effectiveness of the negative descriptive norm video was mediated through injunctive norms and perceived value of support. The findings can help guide interventions that aim to encourage social engagement with people with depression among Asian student populations. Manipulating social norms and increasing self-efficacy may be especially effective.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine how older LGTBQ adults were portrayed in mainstream Canadian newspapers and popular magazines. Our sample included stories that were published in English between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017 in three national newspapers, 13 provincial newspapers, one national online news website, and the five most widely-read popular magazines whose readerships included or catered to the mature market. Our content and thematic analyses of our sample of 190 stories resulted in three overarching findings: a) older LGBTQ adults were largely invisible; b) older LGBTQ persons were often depicted as victims of historical and ongoing discrimination and social exclusion; and c) older LGBTQ individuals were frequently portrayed as extraordinary role models and icons who demonstrated resilience and had paved the way for the younger generations. We discuss our findings in light of the extant research and theorizing concerning the role of the media in reflecting, reproducing, and/or challenging dominant social norms and ideologies, including heterosexism, homophobia, and age-based prejudice.

AB  - Genetic analysis has become integral to many large cohort studies. However, little is known about longitudinal cohort study participants' attitudes toward genetics and genetic testing. We analyzed data from a survey of participants in the Jackson Heart Study (n = 960), Framingham Heart Study (n = 955), and Framingham Heart Study-Omni Cohort (n = 160). Based on a three-question attitude scale, most participants had positive attitudes toward genetic testing (median score = 4.3-5/5). Participants were also asked to select words to describe their attitudes toward genetics. More respondents endorsed the positive words "hopeful" (60%-70%), "optimistic" (44%-64%), "enthusiastic" (35%-43%), or "excited" (28%-30%) than the negative words "cautious" (35%-38%), "concerned" (25%-55%), "worried" (6%-13%), "pessimistic" (2%-5%), or "horrified" (1%-5%). Characteristics associated with favorable attitudes were greater genetics knowledge, higher subjective numeracy, experience with genetic testing, less frequent religious attendance, and not being employed. These findings demonstrate variation in attitudes even among participants in long-standing cohort studies, indicating a need for ongoing participant engagement and education.

AB  - The migrant caravan is comprised of thousands of people traveling from Central America to the Mexico-U.S. border seeking refuge from their home countries. In news coverage, images of the caravan regularly portray large groups of immigrants walking toward the border. What are the consequences of this depiction on attitudes toward immigration? We suggest that images of groups of immigrants, in contrast with images of individual immigrants, will tend to decrease support for immigration. In 2019, we preregistered and ran a web-based survey experiment in the United States in which respondents read a news story with either an image of immigrants in a crowd setting, an image of an individual immigrant, or a control condition. The group treatment produces no systematic increase in anti-immigrant sentiment relative to the control. However, we do find differences in the group and individual treatments for respondents who are high in threat sensitivity. Findings are discussed as they relate to recent work on the roles of both fear and person positivity in attitudes about immigration, as well as the potential importance of editorial choices in the portrayal of immigration to the United States.

AB  - Face-to-face (F2F) embodied interaction is the initial ingredient of interaction ritual (IR), the buildup of shared emotion, mutual focus of attention, and rhythmic entrainment that produces interpersonal solidarity. What happens when a natural experiment (the COVID-19 epidemic) prevents most F2F encounters or limits the modes of micro-interactional communication by masking? The paper examines evidence of the effects of masking and social distancing on public behavior, family life, remote schooling and remote work, prohibition of large audiences and assemblies, and attempts to substitute non-embodied electronic media. Most effects are consistent with IR theory predictions.

AB  - Background: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a major threat to human life around the world. This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding COVID-19 among people with chronic diseases at the outpatient departments in Ho Chi Minh City.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out between February and March 2020 using a convenience sampling strategy in three hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) via the use of a structured self-administered questionnaire. Factors relating to practices, prevalence ratio (PR), and 95% confidence interval were estimated by using the Poisson regression with robust options. P-value <0.05 was considered as statistically different.
   Results: A total of 522 participants had a mean age of 51.5 +/- 10.6 years. Most of them reported seeing information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic (93.7%) via television and social media (72.8% and 62.1%, respectively). Just over two-thirds of the participants (68.4%) answered with sufficient knowledge of COVID-19. Most respondents had a positive attitude toward COVID-19 (90.8%), although some misconceptions existed. Almost over three-fourths of them (77.2%) maintained good practices for prevention. The rate of good practices in those who had sufficient knowledge was 1.24 times greater than that among those who had insufficient knowledge (PR 1.24, 95% CI: 1.10-1.41, P<0.05). Also, the rate of good practices in males was lower than that of females (PR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83-0.99, P<0.05).
   Conclusion: There still exists an amount of insufficient knowledge and negative attitude regarding COVID-19, which may be barriers to good prevention practices among chronic illness patients. Education programs need to continue via television and social media and emphasize that people with chronic diseases are more likely to experience severe symptoms, including death from COVID-19. Additionally, management authorities should prolong specific policies to protect the more vulnerable in our community.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PC) screening aims to detect PC in early stages, amenable to curative treatment and reduction in disease morbidity and mortality. However, PC screening may be associated with overdiagnosis and complications of unnecessary treatment for indolent disease. Therefore, careful patient selection for PC screening is critical to avoid overestimation and missed diagnosis. The aim of this study was to assess physicians' knowledge and attitude towards early detection of PC in Jordan and whether their knowledge is an important predictor of their attitude. An electronic, self-reported questionnaire was used to collect data on demographics, knowledge, and attitude of physicians regarding early detection of PC. The participants' responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression. Around 296 physicians agreed to participate in this study. Most respondents were males (75.7%), residents (34%), practiced medicine more than 15 years (29%) and graduated (81.4%) from local universities. Surprisingly, only 28.4% recognized PC as a non-self-detected disease and less than one-half (48.6%) were aware that PC screening tests are not enough to exclude a diagnosis of PC. The median knowledge Percent of Maximum Possible (POMP) score was 59%. Around two-thirds of participants showed a positive attitude towards early detection of PC (median attitude POMP score was 66%). Higher attitude scores were significantly associated with younger age, those working in private hospitals, and those having higher knowledge POMP score (P < .05). This study highlighted that most physicians demonstrated a positive attitude towards PC screening but with moderate level of knowledge that is considered an important predictor of their attitude towards PC early detection. Thus, improving knowledge and awareness of physicians should be considered as a strategy to improve their attitude towards prostate screening practices and informing men of the importance of regular screening.

AB  - Play in work, as one specific type of work designs, is regarded as the possible solution to experienced burnout and could bring the desirable outcomes to organizations. Drawing on Affective Events Theory (AET), we argued that workplace events (such as play) cause emotional reactions on the part of employees (i.e., burnout), which in turn influence workplace attitudes and behaviors (i.e., innovation behaviors). A total of 439 employees completed surveys, and the results showed that play in work positively relates to innovation behaviors. We also examined individual's attitude toward workplace fun to further understand the impact of individual differences on the relationship between play in work and their feelings and subsequent behaviors. We found that the positive attitude toward fun moderated the indirect relationship between play in work and innovation behaviors via experienced burnout. Based on AET, our results showed that play in work could reduce employees' experienced burnout which in turn lead to their innovation behaviors. Such an effect of play in work are stronger when an individual has more positive attitude toward fun at work. Practically, it is suggested that play in work would contribute to favorable outcomes in the workplace, but managers should pay attention to individual differences in attitude toward workplace fun to ensure the maximum benefit of play.

AB  - Research has demonstrated the effects of culture and mobility on the utilization of monetary rewards and punishments in response to norm-related behaviors (e.g., honesty and dishonesty), but less is known about their effects on the utilization of social inclusion and exclusion. Three experiments found that individuals in high job mobility contexts were more likely to exclude dishonest actors than those in low mobility contexts; job mobility did not affect the level of social inclusion. Experiment 1 demonstrated cultural differences in the utilization of social inclusion/exclusion versus monetary rewards/punishments,with perceived job mobility as an underlying mechanism. Experiment 2 provided a behavioral measure of social inclusion/exclusion. Experiment 3 manipulated job mobility and found that the perceived difficulty of social exclusion mediated the relationship between job mobility and social exclusion. This paper illustrates critical boundary conditions for past findings and provides insight into responses to norm-related behavior across different cultures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (hereafter COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. People were admitted to hospitals complaining of fever, fatigue, cough, and difficulty breathing. Consequently, the strategy being adopted to limit the spread of COVID-19 is to encourage people in society to follow preventive measures. We aimed to estimate how the knowledge of and compliance with safe distancing measures affected the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia during Holy Ramadan. A cross-sectional survey was implemented in the central regions of Saudi Arabia from 24th of April to 22nd May to coincide with Ramadan. The study was conducted using a Google forum distributed through social media. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling of the Saudi population. In total, 1515 participants completed the survey. A significant difference between males and females was observed in answering questions about committing to: not attending gatherings, keeping a safe distance, not making physical contact, and staying at home during partial lockdown. In general, participants in our study demonstrated excellent adherence to all social distance measures, considered essential for limiting the spread and progression of COVID-19. However, attitudes regarding reduced physical contact was poor in the Makkah region, which necessitates greater efforts to educate and inform people about the associated risks.

AB  - Background Social distancing presents a significant obstacle for relationships and threatens mental health. Identifying maladaptive, voluntary coping strategies may inform how to maintain interpersonal relationships and mental health during quarantine. Co-ruminating with peers on negative events, moods and fears has adjustment trade-offs of increasing depression and anxiety risk while also enhancing friendship quality. Similarly, social media use is associated with social benefits and risk to mental health. We extend prior research by examining whether co-ruminating on COVID-19, social media use, and social media use focused on COVID-19 during social isolation was associated with heightened depression and anxiety symptoms but also lower loneliness and higher social support during initial lockdown measures in the USA. Methods Adults were recruited through social media (n = 345) to complete self-report surveys on co-rumination, social media use, social distancing, social support from March-May 2020. During this cross-sectional assessment, in addition to completing surveys on current depressive symptoms and state and health anxiety, participants also provided retrospective report of their perceived health anxiety levels six months prior. Results Co-ruminating on COVID-19 with peers and greater time on social media focused on COVID-19 predicted perceived increases in health anxiety and were also associated with higher depressive symptoms and state anxiety, even after controlling for significant demographic predictors. Further, in the context of social distancing, both interaction strategies failed to confer social benefits. Conclusions Results have direct implications for maintaining psychosocial health during social distancing restrictions. Adults may modify how they engage with peers by limiting COVID-19 content on social media and COVID-19 discussion.

AB  - We sought to examine how the near-lockdown measures, announced by the Israeli government in an effort to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, impacted the self-rated health (SRH), health behaviors, and loneliness of people with chronic illnesses. An online cross-sectional survey was carried out about one month (20-22 April 2020) after the Israeli government reinforced the severe social distancing regulations, among a convenience sample of 315 participants (60% women) with chronic conditions (27% metabolic, 17% cardiovascular, 21% cancer/autoimmune, 18% orthopedic/pain, 12% mental-health). Results suggested that about half of the participants reported a decline in physical or mental SRH, and as many as two-thirds reported feeling lonely. A significant deterioration in health behaviors was reported, including a decrease in vegetable consumption (p= 0.008) and physical activity (p< 0.001), an increase in time spent on social media (p< 0.001), and a perception among about half of the participants that they were eating more than before. Ordinal regression suggested that a decline in general SRH was linked with female gender (p= 0.016), lack of higher education (p= 0.015), crowded housing conditions (p= 0.001), longer illness duration (p= 0.010), and loneliness (p= 0.008). Findings highlight the important role of loneliness in SRH during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Future studies are warranted to clarify the long-term effects of social-distancing and loneliness on people with chronic illnesses.

TI  - Knowledge and attitude toward hemoglobinopathies premarital screening program among unmarried population in western Saudi Arabia
T2  - SAUDI MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - Objectives: To assess the knowledge and attitude toward hemoglobinopathies premarital screening (PMS) program among unmarried population in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1039 unmarried males and females from the general population who fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Data was collected from July-December 2017, using an electronic questionnaire to assess the socio-demographic data, knowledge and attitudes of the participants regarding PMS.
   Results: Approximately half of the participants had poor knowledge scores (51.1%), while 28.4% of them had fair and 20.5% had good scores. Individuals with an educational level of "university degree and above" had significantly higher knowledge than those with lower educational levels. Furthermore, 60.4% of the participants had a positive attitude toward PMS. The data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA); and a Chi-squared test was used for comparisons between proportions and a p-value <= 0.05 was considered significant.
   Conclusion: Participants showed a lack of knowledge regarding PMS but they had a positive attitude towards the program. More efforts are required to raise awareness in the public regarding PMS, via social media and educational lectures in schools and universities. Additionally, early genetic screening may help improve test acceptance and higher impact.

AB  - A brief intervention aimed at buttressing college freshmen's sense of social belonging in school was tested in a randomized controlled trial (N = 92), and its academic and health-related consequences over 3 years are reported. The intervention aimed to lessen psychological perceptions of threat on campus by framing social adversity as common and transient. It used subtle attitude-change strategies to lead participants to self-generate the intervention message. The intervention was expected to be particularly beneficial to African-American students (N = 49), a stereotyped and socially marginalized group in academics, and less so to European-American students (N = 43). Consistent with these expectations, over the 3-year observation period the intervention raised African Americans' grade-point average (GPA) relative to multiple control groups and halved the minority achievement gap. This performance boost was mediated by the effect of the intervention on subjective construal: It prevented students from seeing adversity on campus as an indictment of their belonging. Additionally, the intervention improved African Americans' self-reported health and well-being and reduced their reported number of doctor visits 3 years postintervention. Senior-year surveys indicated no awareness among participants of the intervention's impact. The results suggest that social belonging is a psychological lever where targeted intervention can have broad consequences that lessen inequalities in achievement and health.

AB  - Background: The importance of net durability and the average useful life of a net is increasingly recognized as one of the critical factors that determine how often nets need to be replaced. A study to assess the effect of a net care and repair behaviour change communication (BCC) programme on net durability was conducted in one district in Eastern Uganda with a district in a neighbouring region serving as a comparison. Both districts had received LLINs in September of 2012.
   Methods: The intervention was comprised of radio programmes, school and community events. Two-stage cluster sampling household surveys to assess net condition, exposure to BCC messages, and attitudes towards net care and repair were conducted in both districts at baseline (2-3 months post net distribution) and endline (20-21 months post distribution). Net condition was assessed using the proportionate hole index, with nets being classified as either serviceable or too torn.
   Results: The intervention led to an additional 31.2 % increased exposure to net care and repair messages in the intervention district. Respondents in the intervention district had a more positive attitude towards net care and repair (32 % of respondents were classified as having a very positive attitude compared to 10 % in the comparison district), which was positively associated with the number of channels through which messages had been received (P < 0.001). Nets belonging to respondents with a very positive attitude were more often categorized as serviceable (80.2 %) compared to respondents with a poor/average attitude (66.4 %; odds ratio: 2.05, P = 0.028); however, this was only observed for the net brand with the greater physical integrity. Additionally, socio-economic status was a significant predictor of net condition. Although nets in the intervention district had significantly more repairs done per net, the act of repairing alone did not improve net condition.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, the evaluation showed that the BCC programme resulted in improved knowledge and attitudes towards care and repair, which impacted positively on net condition. Repairs alone were not sufficient to improve net condition. Additional research on which care behaviours and attitudes are most associated with improved net condition would help BCC planners hone their campaigns.

AB  - This paper investigates gender differences in political participation across 10 countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region using data from the World Values Survey (2010-2014). A distinction is made between two different participation types, institutional and non-institutional. We use an ordered logit model to evaluate whether the gender gap in both forms is mediated by demographic and attitudinal controls and assess whether variables influencing participation affect men and women differently. We find that most socioeconomic resources and political attitudes are correlated with higher levels of participation. However, the analysis reveals a persistent gender gap that can be generalized to the entire spectrum of engagement in the MENA, with larger gaps for less institutionalized forms.

AB  - Objectives: Patient-centered-care (PCC) attitudes are important to enhance PCC behavior, but research on perceptions and attitudes that contribute to PCC attitudes is limited. We tested a new model, assessing whether the association between self-efficacy and PCC attitudes is mediated by communication and empathy attitudes. Furthermore, we assessed medical-school-stage and gender differences in these variables.
   Methods: Medical/dentistry students (N = 653) completed self-reported questionnaires. Analyses were performed using Pearson's-correlations, PROCESS macro, and independent samples t-tests.
   Results: The association between communication self-efficacy and PCC attitudes was completely mediated by communication and empathy attitudes. Students in clinical years had more positive attitudes toward PCC and empathy, and higher communication self-efficacy. Females had more positive attitudes toward PCC, communication, and empathy.
   Conclusions: The results emphasize the importance of communication self-efficacy and the mediating role of communication and empathy attitudes in enhancing PCC attitudes. This highlights the need to focus on learners' affective matter (what they feel/think) about their competencies and attitudes.
   Practice implications: Educational interventions should improve understanding of the benefits of applying good communication skills, of learning the importance of empathy and its relevance to patient care, and strengthening students' confidence in applying these skills. Attention to these is important for enhancing students' PCC attitudes. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: Self-efficacy belief procures teachers to root for each other's development in some issues such as ameliorating new methods to conduct much more effective teaching. A school with a high level of self-efficacy teachers makes a great contribution in order to corroborate self-efficacy perceptions of students. When examining it on a model with many attitudinal variables, self-efficacy belief, an important concept in terms of education quality, has been deemed significant so as to propound the effects of self-efficacy more clearly. This study aimed to determine the relationship between self-efficacy and job satisfaction, organizational commitment, motivation and job involvement.
   Research Method: 321 teachers from 33 schools that were selected randomly with the cluster sampling method from the middle schools in the province of Hatay city center in the 2017-2018 academic year have composed the sampling of this study.
   Findings: The more teachers' self-efficacy beliefs increased, the more their job satisfaction, organizational commitment, motivation and job involvement increased. Both job satisfaction and organizational commitment partially mediated the relationship between teachers' sense of self-efficacy and motivation. Self-efficacy beliefs positively affected teachers' job involvement through the full mediation effect of job satisfaction and motivation Organizational commitment and motivation fully mediated the relationship between teachers' self-efficacy and job involvement.
   Implications for Research and Practice:It is crucial for school administrators to contribute to amend and strengthen self-efficacy perceptions of teachers if they hope teachers to take positive attitudes towards their work much more frequently and to take the edge off negative attitudes.

AB  - While biobanks have become more prevalent, little is known about adolescents' views of key governance issues. We conducted semi-structured interviews with adolescents between 15 and 17 years old to solicit their views. All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed. Two investigators coded the transcripts and resolved any discrepancies through consensus. We conducted 18 interviews before reaching data saturation. Four participants (22%) had previously heard of a biobank. Many participants had misunderstandings about biobanks, some of which persisted after education. Participants believed that enrolling in a biobank would benefit others through scientific research. Many study participants were unable to identify risks of biobank participation. Thirteen participants (72%) were willing to enrolling in a biobank and only one (6%) initially was not. Participants believed that if they were unable to provide assent when enrolled, then they should be re-contacted at the age of majority and their data should not be shared until that time. Participants emphasized the importance of being aware of their enrollment and the possibility of disagreeing with their parents. Participants' misunderstanding of biobanks suggests that assent may not be adequately informed without additional education. While adolescents had positive attitudes toward biobanks, they emphasized the importance of awareness of and involvement in the decision to enroll.

AB  - Introduction
   From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health officials have sought to develop evidence-based messages to reduce COVID-19 transmission by communicating key information to media outlets and the public. We describe the development of an interdisciplinary rapid message testing model to quickly create, test, and share messages with public health officials for use in health campaigns and policy briefings.
   Methods
   An interdisciplinary research team from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill assembled in March 2020 to assist the state health department in developing evidence-based messages to influence social distancing behaviors in the state. We developed and iteratively executed a rapid message testing model; the components of the 4-step model were message creation, survey development, survey administration, and analysis and presentation to health department officials. The model was executed 4 times, each during a 7-day period in April and May, and each subsequent survey included new phrasing and/or messaging informed by the previous week's survey. A total of 917 adults from North Carolina participated in the 4 surveys.
   Results
   Survey participants rated messages focused on protecting oneself and others higher than messages focused on norms and fear-based approaches. Pairing behaviors with motivations increased participants' desire to social distance across all themes and subgroups. For example, adding "Protect your grandmother, your neighbor with cancer, and your best friend with asthma," to messaging received a 0.9-point higher score than the base message, "Stay 6 feet apart from others when out in public."
   Practice Implications
   Our model to promote social distancing in North Carolina during the COVID-19 pandemic can be used for rapid, iterative message testing during public health emergencies.

AB  - Background Pharmaceutical care practice has been championed as the primary mission of the pharmacy profession, but its implementation has been suboptimal in many developing countries including Kuwait. Pharmacists must have sufficient knowledge, skills, and positive attitudes to practise pharmaceutical care, and barriers in the pharmacy practice model must be overcome before pharmaceutical care can be broadly implemented in a given healthcare system. Objective To investigate hospital pharmacists' attitudes towards pharmaceutical care, perceptions of their preparedness to provide pharmaceutical care, and the barriers to its implementation in Kuwait. Setting Six general hospitals, eight specialized hospitals and seven specialized health centers in Kuwait. Method A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was distributed to all pharmacists working in the governmental hospitals in Kuwait (385 pharmacists). Data were collected via a pre-tested self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics including percentages, medians and means Likert scale rating (standard deviations) were calculated and compared using statistical package for social sciences, version 20. Statistical significance was accepted at a p value of < 0.05. Main outcome measure Pharmacists' attitudes towards pharmaceutical care, perceptions of their preparedness to provide pharmaceutical care competencies, and the barriers to its implementation in Kuwait. Results Completed surveys were received from 250 (64.9 %) of the 385 pharmacists. Pharmacists expressed overall positive attitudes towards pharmaceutical care. They felt well prepared to implement the various aspects of pharmaceutical care, with the least preparedness in the administrative/management aspects. Pharmacists with more practice experience expressed significantly more positive attitudes towards pharmaceutical care (p = 0.001) and they felt better prepared to provide pharmaceutical care competencies (p < 0.001) than those with less experience as practitioners. The respondents agreed/strongly agreed that the most significant barriers to the integration of pharmaceutical care into practice were lack of private counseling areas or inappropriate pharmacy layout (87.6 %), organizational obstacles (81.6 %), inadequate staff (79.6 %), and lack of pharmacist time and adequate technology (76.0 %). Conclusion Hospital pharmacists in Kuwait advocate implementation of pharmaceutical care while also appreciating the organizational, technical and professional barriers to its widespread adoption. Collaborative efforts between health authorities and educational institutions, and the integration of innovative approaches in pharmacy management and education could overcome these barriers and achieve the transition towards pharmaceutical care practice.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The emergence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the measures implemented to curb its spread may have deleterious effects on mental health. Older adults may be at increased risk for adverse psychosocial outcomes because opportunities to remain socially connected have diminished. Research is needed to better understand the impact of pandemic-related stress on mental health. The purpose of this study is 3-fold: (a) to examine the influences of COVID-19 pandemic-related stress on depression, anxiety, and loneliness; (b) to assess the mediating role of coping style and social support; and (c) to investigate whether these relationships vary across age.
   Research Design and Methods: Participants (N = 1,318) aged 18-92 years completed an online survey assessing pandemic-related stress, mental health, social support, coping, and their experiences with social distancing, during the initial implementation of social distancing measures in the United States.
   Results: Social support and coping style were found to relate to psychosocial outcomes. Avoidant coping was the strongest mediator of the relationship between pandemic-related stress and psychosocial outcomes, particularly depression. Avoidant coping more strongly mediated the relationship between stress and depression in younger adults compared to older adults.
   Discussion and Implications: Results were consistent with the stress and coping framework and recent work highlighting older adults' resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings highlight the associations between positive coping behaviors and psychosocial well-being and indicate that older adults may use unique adaptive mechanisms to preserve well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Objectives. To determine the attitudes of patients toward long-term opioid therapy (LtOT) and the potential risk of misuse/abuse in patients with chronic noncancer pain (CNCP).
   Design. Prospective, descriptive epidemiological study.
   Setting. Multidisciplinary tertiary care pain center within the Montreal University Health Center.
   Subjects. Patients who had had at least one visit at least one year prior to the invitation.
   Methods. We used four questionnaires: demographic questionnaire, the Drug Attitude Inventory Modified (DAI-M), the Opioid Risk Tool (ORT), and the Screening Tool for Addiction Risk (STAR). All questionnaires were administered in their validated French version.
   Results. Three hundred seventy patients completed questionnaires. The response rate was 79.26%. Of those who responded, 61.62% women and 38.38% men, the mean age was 57 years. The patients had been treated with LtOT for an average of 6.31 years, and the median dose per day in morphine equivalents was 48.21mg. The DAI-M showed that 32.16% had a positive attitude toward opioids, 39.73% had a negative attitude, and 22.16% had a neutral attitude. The ORT questionnaire demonstrated that 86.2% of the patients were at low risk of abuse/misuse, 13.2% were at moderate risk, and only 0.54% were at high risk. The STAR questionnaire showed that 4.2% had a low risk of abuse/misuse.
   Conclusions. Despite public opinion, patients treated with LtOT for CNCP and followed in a tertiary care pain center are at low risk for opioid misuse/abuse. We need to refine the way of prescribing opioids, should be selective with our patients, and should relive their pain adequately. Vargas-Schaffer and Cogan

KW  - Attitude
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The robotic surgery and procedures are increasing worldwide. It is unknown whether medical students are well prepared for their future exposure to such technology.
   OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the knowledge and attitude of medical students from Saudi Arabia (SA) towards the robotic surgery.
   METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional survey of medical students at different colleges of medicine in SA. A web-based self-administered questionnaire using google forms was completed over a 2-month period starting on June 2021. Comparison between those with and without background about robotic surgery was performed.
   RESULTS: A total of 239 medical students from both governmental (46%) and private colleges (54%) responded to the questionnaire. 51.9% were interested in the surgical field and 37.7% considered themselves tech-savvy persons. Only (22.6%) had previous background about robotic surgery mainly from internet. Many (63.2%) showed positive attitude towards robotic surgery and expected that using robots will improve surgical outcomes. 48.5% of the students expected that patients in SA will not accept the robotic surgeries. Some (51.1%) concerned that robots could replace the surgeons and could make them less professional. Many believed that SA should invest and expand the robotic surgeries (69.1%). Students with background in robotic surgery had significantly younger median age (p < 0.030), earlier academic years (p < 0.001), higher GPA (p < 0.025), and more tech-savvy personality (p < 0.000) compared to those without background.
   CONCLUSION: Most medical students are unaware of robotic surgery, but they have positive attitude with some concerns. Young students who consider themselves tech-savvy persons are in a better position, but they access their knowledge from internet rather than from their medical education. Medical curricula and residency training program should take these findings into consideration for preparing the future surgeons in SA.

AB  - Along with advancements in information technology and related infrastructure, the gig economy is expanding to more and more cities in the world. In emerging economies like India, due to increasing urbanisation and Internet connectivity, many services are being delivered through technology platforms, and their numbers are growing fast. However, not much is known about the impact of app-based employment on the workers. The online food delivery sector is a suitable segment to probe the same. How vulnerable is this ever-dispensable food delivery employee in his monotonous job? These workers are employed under the mobile apps that control them like in a sci-fi game. What does it mean to be constantly under the mobile app surveillance? Does the flexibility of the gig economy impact the skills and aspirations of these boys? Does it dehumanise the workers and transform them into human drones? This study maps the lived experience of food delivery boys and their families, which has so far remained behind the celebrated success of the platform economy in India. Using both interview and participant observation methods to study gig workers and deploying dimensional analysis to unpack the context, this study finds evidence of unobtrusive dehumanisation. Given the mushrooming trend of such gig workers, the findings of this study call for a deeper analysis of the social impact of the gig economy and have far-reaching implications.

AB  - Background: Lung cancer (LC) patients experience high symptom burden and significant decline of physical fitness and quality of life following lung resection. Good quality of survivorship care post-surgery is essential to optimize recovery and prevent unscheduled healthcare use. The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can improve post-surgery care, as it enables frequent monitoring of health status in daily life, provides timely and personalized feedback to patients and professionals, and improves accessibility to rehabilitation programs. Despite its promises, implementation of telehealthcare applications is challenging, often hampered by non-acceptance of the developed service by its end-users. A promising approach is to involve the end-users early and continuously during the developmental process through a so-called user-centred design approach. The aim of this article is to report on this process of co-creation and evaluation of a multimodal ICT-supported cancer rehabilitation program with and for lung cancer patients treated with lung resection and their healthcare professionals (HCPs).
   Methods: A user-centered design approach was used. Through semi-structured interviews (n = 10 LC patients and 6 HCPs), focus groups (n = 5 HCPs), and scenarios (n = 5 HCPs), user needs and requirements were elicited. Semi-structured interviews and the System Usability Scale (SUS) were used to evaluate usability of the telehealthcare application with 7 LC patients and 10 HCPs.
   Results: The developed application consists of: 1) self-monitoring of symptoms and physical activity using on-body sensors and a smartphone, and 2) a web based physical exercise program. 71 % of LC patients and 78 % of HCPs were willing to use the application as part of lung cancer treatment. Accessibility of data via electronic patient records was essential for HCPs. LC patients regarded a positive attitude of the HCP towards the application essential. Overall, the usability (SUS median score = 70, range 35-95) was rated acceptable.
   Conclusions: A telehealthcare application that facilitates symptom monitoring and physical fitness training is considered a useful tool to further improve recovery following surgery of resected lung cancer (LC) patients. Involvement of end users in the design process appears to be necessary to optimize chances of adoption, compliance and implementation of telemedicine.

AB  - Previous research found support for an association between exposure to alcohol-related media content and alcohol attitudes, intentions and behavior. Nevertheless, research on what makes young people susceptible to the occurrence of this relationship is scarce. The current study examined the behavioral activation (BAS) and inhibition system (BIS) as moderators of the relationship between soap opera viewing and alcohol attitudes. A cross-sectional survey was carried out among a sample of 922 adolescents (M-age=14.96years, SD=.85, 56% girls). Regression analyses showed no association between total television viewing and alcohol attitudes, but did confirm that soap opera viewing is associated with positive attitudes towards alcohol use. Moderation analyses indicated that BAS did not moderate this relationship, while BIS did; the relationship between soap opera viewing and positive attitudes toward alcohol was only significant for adolescents with a low BIS-profile. These results provide support for the premise that an elevated BIS protects adolescents from the effect of soap opera viewing frequency on their alcohol attitudes.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this article is to determine knowledge level and perception about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among people with diabetes. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 268 diabetic subjects from April 2020 to October 2020 at the outpatient department of Baqai Institute of Diabetology and Endocrinology, Karachi, Pakistan. A series of questions regarding knowledge and perception about COVID-19 were asked, and participants' demographic characteristics and source of information regarding COVID-19 were recorded and analyzed. Results: Among 268 participants, 59.7% had diabetes for more than 5 years. More than half of the subjects had heard about COVID-19 on television (63.8%). The majority of subjects had information about symptoms of COVID-19, including fever (92.2%), dry cough (79.9%), flu (78%), and shortness of breath (52.6%). Most of the participants had knowledge about preventive measures for COVID-19 such as wearing a face mask (77.6%), washing hands frequently with soap (72.8%), using hand sanitizer (72%), social distancing (47.4%), isolation and hygiene (38.8%), and quarantining (32.1%). However, less than half of the participants knew the correct meanings of social distancing (40.3%), isolation (29.1%), and quarantine (22.4%). Conclusion: Overall, most of the participants had information about common symptoms of COVID-19 including fever, dry cough, flu, and shortness of breath as they had heard about COVID-19 on television, at office, radio, and their living area. The government has taken effective measures in the prevention of COVID-19. Still, there remains a need for public awareness campaigns to combat the spread of disease.

AB  - A study of undergraduate students in Saudi Arabia found that although they used technology for an average of 45 h per week and had positive attitudes to it, they did not frequently use technology, in particular computers, in support of their learning. Qualitative evidence suggests that the students were not routinely required to use computers at university, and that in some cases the universities did not provide computing facilities or actively prevented technology usage. Factors which influenced attitudes to computers included: city of study, parental encouragement, and English language proficiency but not gender. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The need for interaction that arose given the social distancing imposed on people by governments during the COVID-19 has increased the use of social media (SM). The current study distinguishes between two different patterns of SM use: problematic and intensive, and examines the impact of each specific type of SM on social and mental aspects (i.e., social support, loneliness, and life satisfaction). The sample included 363 higher education students. Data were gathered during a second lockdown using Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling. The model indicated two different trajectories corresponding to the two types of SM users: Intensive users reported having more family support, whereas problematic users tended to feel lonely, reported having low life satisfaction, and had less support from friends. This study may allude to the possible positive role of SM use, especially during social distancing, in alleviating social and mental burdens in times of crisis.

AB  - Objectives
   With the increasing severity of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, it is essential that dental health care professionals (DHCPs) are prepared. The study aim was to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding COVID-19 among DHCPs in Saudi Arabia.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study using a web-based survey was conducted. A validated and reliable questionnaire was developed that comprised 44 questions. Using Qualtrics survey software, DHCPs working in different settings were approached across five geographical regions of Saudi Arabia.
   Results
   A total of 318 respondents voluntarily participated in the survey. Most DHCPs showed a moderate level of knowledge (51.6%), a positive attitude (92.1%) and adequate practice standards (86.5%). We found that 94.7% of DHCPs had an adequate overall level of KAP. DHCPs with a doctorate significantly outscored DHCPs with other educational levels with respect to knowledge and practice. Older (51-60 years) DHCPs reported significantly more knowledge than younger DHCPs.
   Conclusion
   DHCPs displayed an average level of knowledge that needs to be enhanced through continuing education programmes. However, they showed a positive attitude and an acceptable level of practice, as they were abiding by guidelines issued from various international and national health agencies.

AB  - In this paper the incidental language acquisition of 11-year-old Flemish children (n = 30) who have not received any formal English instruction is investigated. The study looks into children's English proficiency and the learner characteristics that can be associated with it. In order to measure the children's English proficiency, a receptive vocabulary test and a proficiency test (which measured listening skills, speaking skills, reading skills and writing skills) were used. Information about learner characteristics was gathered through two questionnaires (for children and parents). The results show that a significant proportion of the 11-year-olds can already perform tasks at the A2 level (The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) without having had any formal instruction. The study confirms that children learn English from the input they receive through different media (especially gaming and computer use). Furthermore, the data reveal a strikingly positive attitude towards English and demonstrate that in some situations Flemish children prefer using English over their L1 with their peers.

AB  - This study evaluated an alcohol intervention among Norwegian 8th graders. Participants competed class wise in producing the best 3-minutes alcohol prevention video aimed at convincing 7th graders not to start drinking. Consistent with the induced compliance approach to attitude change, involvement in producing the video was expected to influence the 8th graders' own attitudes and behavior. Furthermore, the 8th graders carried out a survey of alcohol use at their own school, and were provided feedback on the results from their own as well as from other schools. The aim was to reduce the overestimation of alcohol use common among adolescents at this age and thereby change both social norms related to drinking alcohol and reducing drinking. Questionnaires were administered at baseline and four months later. The questionnaire included nine scales of known social psychological alcohol use correlates which explained as much as 54.6% and 58.6% of the variance in alcohol use at T1 and T2, respectively. The intervention group (n = 586) had significantly lower increase in alcohol use compared to the comparison group (n = 392) after controlling for covariates. A multilevel mediation analysis showed that changes in four of the covariates (Descriptive norms, AEQ-A social scale, Attitudes, and Anticipated regrets) significantly predicted change in alcohol use at the within level and two of the covariates (Descriptive norms and Perceived behavioral control) at the between level. No significant mediation effects were, however, revealed.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to focus on the motivation of service customers to create user-generated content (UGC) after a negative service experience. In examining this relationship, the moderating role of "extraversion" personality trait is also taken into consideration. Furthermore, the paper examines how differently motivated service customers react to a firm's service recovery strategies, whilst insights into the relationship between UGC creation and specific online platform usage are also provided.
   Design/methodology/approach - Structural Equation Modeling is used to test the conceptual model, based on an empirical dataset collected from an online survey research of 239 service customers. The dataset pertains to international travellers and their UGC behaviour after a negative travel experience.
   Findings - Altruistic, vengeance and economic motivations are strong drivers for UGC creation after a negative service experience. Motivations also correlate to participation in specific online platforms. Furthermore, it is shown that highly extraverted customers create more UGC after a negative service experience when motivated by vengeance. Finally, higher levels of altruistic and self-enhancement motivations correlate with a positive attitude towards a firm's response, whereas customers who are motivated by vengeance have a negative attitude towards a firm's response.
   Practical implications - Customers who share their negative service experience by creating UGC in social media can be segmented according to their motivation. Service providers should inspect the UGC of their customers to understand the motivation behind it. The motivation to create UGC varies across platforms, and hence, customized service recovery strategies are required.
   Originality/value - This paper examines UGC creation in relation to motivation, extraversion, and attitude towards a firm's response. This is the first reported application which collectively examines important issues like these in a unified theoretical framework.

AB  - Objective To describe COVID-19 related symptoms and medical care experienced in the first six months of the pandemic as well as stay-at-home order adherence, and attitudes related to COVID-19 risk and social distancing among a diverse sample of adults in the Deep South. Methods Survey data were collected from 411 Louisiana and Mississippi residents for three weeks in June 2020 through social media. Results Over half (52.5%) of participants who experienced COVID-19 related symptoms (with 41.5% experiencing at least one symptom) did not feel the severity of symptoms warranted seeking medical care. 91.6% of the Deep South adults visited certain places or did activities where visiting or gathering with other people was involved during stay-at-home mandates. Religiosity/spirituality, age, education, number of children in the home, attitudes related to COVID-19 risk of complications and social distancing were related to the greater/lesser likelihood of stay-at-home order adherence. Conclusions Various cultural and contextual factors were related to stay-at-home order adherence. Understanding how social values, life stage, socioeconomic, and geographic factors influence stay-at-home order adherence would lead to more effective policy design to improve population adherence.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between interreligious contact and negative attitudes toward the religious outgroup among minority Christians and majority Muslims in Indonesia. It answers two research questions: Does interreligious contact reduce negative outgroup attitudes equally for minority Christians and majority Muslims? Are mediation by perceived group threat and moderation by perceived discrimination equally important for religious minorities and majorities? The analysis is based on unique survey data collected from among Christian and Muslim students in Ambon (the Moluccas) and Yogyakarta (central Java). Results show that a higher quantity of interreligious contact reduces negative outgroup attitudes among majority Muslims but not among minority Christians. However, the quality of contact reduces negative attitudes regardless of relative group size. Perceived group threat is an important mediator of the contact-attitude relationship and is equally so for Christians and Muslims. Findings suggest that perceived discrimination does not affect the relationship between interreligious contact and negative attitudes.

AB  - Researchers and practitioners have encouraged the use of simulation games as a means of training for enhancing users' IT knowledge. However, prior research on IT knowledge has not paid much attention as to how individuals' perceptions of knowledge shift from the pre-training to the post-training state, and has focused mainly on individual-level interventions. Drawing on the theoretical foundation of belief and attitude change, this study examines the construct of perceived knowledge update (i.e., the difference between perceived post-training knowledge and perceived pre-training knowledge) and its antecedents and consequences. In particular, we examine team collaboration effectiveness at the team level and participant effort at the individual level as predictors of perceived ERP knowledge update, which then influences intention to learn about ERP systems. We tested our research model using 252 students in 85 teams in the context of an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) simulation game. ERP systems are a business process management software which allows an organization to utilize a system of integrated applications. ERP simulation games are designed to educate ERP system users on the complexities of such systems. Our results show that team collaboration effectiveness positively influences individual effort and perceived knowledge update. We also provide empirical evidence that individual effort positively affects perceived knowledge update which in turn influences intention to learn about ERP systems.

AB  - BackgroundWhile HPV vaccination uptake in Sweden is quite high, at around 80%, vaccine hesitancy remains an issue in countries throughout Europe. The latter can be related to a contemporary context of increased contestation of expert knowledge and of a large share of information on health-related issues including vaccination today being sought via the internet. Still, there is a paucity of recent research on attitudes toward the HPV vaccine in a larger sample of the population in Sweden. This survey study assesses such attitudes and any correlations between vaccine hesitancy and sociodemographic characteristics, trust in healthcare and other societal institutions, and evaluation of the reliability of different sources of information. MethodsThe validated survey questionnaire was distributed to adult women in Sweden (n = 2,000), via a nationally representative web panel. The response rate was 37%. Aside from descriptive statistics, associations between vaccine hesitancy and sociodemographic and other variables were computed using logistic regressions and expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). ResultsOur results show a positive attitude toward HPV vaccination overall. Still, some degree of HPV vaccine hesitancy was indicated by 33.8% of the respondents, and more pronounced hesitancy by 7.6%. Regarding vaccination in general, a very positive attitude was indicated by 55%. HPV vaccine hesitancy was associated with low education and low income and strongly associated with a lack of confidence in healthcare and other societal institutions. It was also correlated with a self-assessed lack of access to, and ability to assess the origin, quality and reliability of, information about the HPV vaccine. ConclusionEfforts to provide transparent information about HPV vaccination should be combined with healthcare providers being open to discuss vaccine concerns with patients and avoiding practices that do not promote trust.

AB  - Celebrity disclosures and narratives are popular strategies in health promotion. However, less is known about their joint effects and the mechanisms through which they function. A 2 (narrative type: celebrity vs. layperson) x 2 (personal relevance: low vs. high) online experiment (N = 248) tested the impact of different narrative types in increasing awareness about prescription opioid abuse. Results indicated that a celebrity narrative is more persuasive than its layperson counterpart. Also, personal relevance toward opioid addiction moderated the influence of narrative type. Celebrity narratives evoked more positive attitudes toward opioid prevention and greater behavioral compliance intentions with the recommended action for low-relevance individuals. Transportation and identification mediated the effects of celebrity narratives on participants' issue attitudes and behavioral intentions, but only for low-relevance individuals. Practically, the data suggest that incorporating celebrities in health narratives about opioid addiction prevention facilitates behavioral compliance, especially for individuals to whom a pressing health issue like opioid misuse is currently of low relevance.

AB  - Materialism is known to be negatively related to consumers' ethical behaviors, and prior research has often assumed that highly materialistic consumers do not behave ethically. This study challenges such conventional wisdom and investigated ways to motivate highly materialistic consumers to engage in ethical consumption behaviors by examining the moderating role of the appeal type across two studies. The results indicated that highly materialistic consumers showed more positive attitudinal and behavioral responses to ethical products and campaigns when self-benefit (vs. other-benefit) appeals are implemented; however, less materialistic consumers' responses did not depend on the appeal type. The two egoistic motivations, protective and enhancement motivations, were found to mediate the positive effect of self-benefit appeals among highly materialistic consumers. These findings suggest that materialistic and ethical values do not represent opposite ends of a single dimension, but rather indicate two independent dimensions in the same individual. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed, and suggestions for future research are offered.

AB  - In response to the early stages of the Coronavirus pandemic in January, 2020, an opportunity was created to apply for grant funding to host a real-time, social media teaching modality that would help Hospitality and Tourism Management (HTM) students remain engaged [and enrolled] in classes as they quickly pivoted to the practice social distancing. This new modality [ZOOM] was also intended to connect former students, alumni, and industry professionals to industry leadership through an online [streaming] format. The initial proposal indicated faculty would travel offsite, visiting alumni and former students to conduct interviews and bring the classroom to students as they returned home early. However, as the situation continued to evolve, it was determined traveling would not be feasible. As a result, the initiative evolved into the planning and facilitation of a virtual event/conference attended by approximately 500 students, alumni, and industry professionals from around the globe.

AB  - In large-scale international assessments such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), or the Progress in International Reading Study (PISA), research has struggled to find positive associations between the frequency of educational technology use in schools and student achievement. While computer use at home showed a tendency for positive correlations with test scores, computer use in schools did not. Following a different approach, the study reanalyzes PISA 2012 data by combining frequency of use and positive perceptions with regard to educational technology as predictors for student test scores. When controlling for influential sociodemographic factors, results indicate that positive attitudes toward educational technology are associated with higher test scores in the large majority of countries. As positive attitudes are likely to be a result of positive experiences, it seems reasonable to conclude that it might be quality instead of quantity of educational technology use that matters.

AB  - Background Mandatory rules for social distancing to curb the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic require individuals to maintain a critical interpersonal distance above 1.5 m. However, this contradicts our natural preference, which is closer to 1 m for non-intimate encounters, for example, when asking a stranger for directions. Objective This review addresses how humans typically regulate interpersonal distances, in order to highlight the challenges of enforcing atypically large interpersonal distances. Method To understand the challenges posed by social distancing requirements, we integrate relevant contributions from visual perception, social perception, and human factors. Results To date, research on preferred interpersonal distances suggests that social distancing could induce discomfort, heighten arousal, and decrease social signaling in the short term. While the protracted effects of social distancing are unclear, we propose hypotheses on the mid- to long-term consequences of violating preferred norms of interpersonal distances. Conclusion We suggest that enforcing a physical distance of 1.5-2 m presents a serious challenge to behavioral norms. Application We address how notifications, architectural design, and visualizations could be effectively applied to promote interpersonal distance requirements.

AB  - In contrast to the common assumption that voluntary associations from male voice choirs to gymnastic clubs mediate political culture, this article stresses that leisure clubs were frequented first and foremost as places where soci-ability could unfold. This form of social exchange, which suspends differences of social status or political attitudes, is relevant for the development of the political system, as it can work as an antidote against a fundamental politicization of all social relations. In Weimar Germany, leisure clubs did not realize this potential. This article argues that this was mainly the consequence of state authorities interfering with the voluntary sector of leisure.

AB  - Adolescents' attitudes toward disadvantaged groups are surprisingly understudied. What we know from these few studies is that adolescents' attitudes tend to become more favorable over time and that adolescent girls display more favorable attitudes than do adolescent boys. However, researchers have not offered explanations for why these effects occur. We proposed that changes in social-cognitive abilities that accompany adolescent development increase perspective taking and that the increased perspective taking facilitates more favorable attitudes toward disadvantaged groups. Because girls develop social-cognitive abilities earlier than boys, girls should show greater perspective taking and thus more positive attitudes toward disadvantaged groups than should boys. Importantly, we propose that these more positive attitudes are explained better by perspective taking than by gender. Participants were late adolescents (n = 803, 53.3 % female, ages 15-19) from high schools in north-central Florida (United States) participating in an ongoing, multi-wave study. Participants completed a measure of perspective-taking and reported their attitudes toward three disadvantaged groups (Black, gay, and poor people) during their third year of high school and, again, 6 months later during their fourth year of high school. Our findings provided strong support for our theorizing. Girls generally reported warmer attitudes than did boys toward disadvantaged groups, with the gender differences in warmth tending to diminish across time. Similarly, girls were higher than boys in perspective-taking abilities at both time points, although boys increased over time whereas girls did not. Crucially, perspective taking mediated observed gender differences in attitudes, suggesting that perspective taking is a mechanism for improving attitudes toward disadvantaged groups during late adolescence.

AB  - Prior studies demonstrated contributions of the insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) for both experiencing and observing social exclusion, but it is not yet well understood how the brain processes the compensation of exclusion, as is observed in prosocial helping. Here, we tested if social brain regions, specifically the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and temporal parietal junction (TPJ) are involved when individuals show prosocial behavior towards excluded others. For this purpose, 23 female participants played a four-player Cyberball Game in which participants could toss balls to each other. During the exclusion game, two players excluded one of the other players. When participants observed exclusion by others, they showed elevated activity in the insula, consistent with prior studies. However, when they tossed the ball to the excluded player, they showed increased activation in the TPJ, consistent with the hypothesis that prosocial behavior is associated with social reasoning. In addition, tossing to the excluded player was associated with increased activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Given that prior studies reported that the NAcc is involved in experiencing rewards, this may suggest a warm glow for showing prosocial compensation behavior when helping excluded others.

AB  - The main purpose of this study is to explore which factors of users' perceived gratifications and technology attributes are associated with changes in the usage level of Facebook and Instagram during the past three months. We identified common gratifications (social interaction, entertainment, passing time, browsing, need for recognition) as well as technology attributes (visual element, recommendation algorithm, privacy setting, openness, simultaneousness) of Facebook and Instagram and surveyed respondents who have both Facebook and Instagram accounts (n = 613). Respondents who were more gratified with entertainment and need for recognition aspects and those who have positive attitudes toward Facebook's recommendation algorithm features were more likely to report that they have increased use of the platform during the past three months. Meanwhile, respondents who were gratified with the browsing aspect of gratifications and those who have positive attitudes toward levels of openness on Instagram tended to report that they have increasingly used the platform during the past three months.

Results from a 2 (type of information tailoring: personalization vs. customization) x 2 (level of locational congruity: high vs. low) x 2 (level of product involvement: high vs. low involvement) between-subjects experiment (N = 115) showed that customization and locational congruity were effective strategies for inducing positive attitudes about LBA and its service quality. In addition, the ad's perceived intrusiveness was found to mediate the effects of product involvement on participants' attitudes toward LBA. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Although one of the most severe forms of bias all over Europe, anti-Roma prejudice has been neglected within social psychology. We argue that anti-Roma attitudes need to be recognized as a unique form of prejudice because (a). they reflect socially approved dominant societal norms, (b) intergroup contact increases rather than decreases prejudice, and (c) not just negative stereotyping, but also cultural distancing of Roma people is a form of social exclusion. We developed an integrative Attitudes Toward Roma Scale (ATRS) based on existing measures and theoretical assumptions about prejudice toward Roma people. We conducted a study (N = 1082) relying on student and community samples in Hungary and Slovakia. Exploratory factor analysis revealed and confirmatory factor analysis supported the structural equivalence of a three-factor solution of the 16-item scale, consisting of Blatant Stereotyping, Undeserved Benefits, and Cultural Difference.
   Our findings confirmed that intergroup contact with Roma people is associated with more negative attitudes, and prejudice is mostly expressed in blatantly negative ways, made possible by social contexts that approve of these beliefs. The analysis also revealed that essentialist, romanticized ideas of cultural differences between Roma and non-Roma populations contribute to the psychological distancing of Roma people from the national ingroup.

AB  - This study focused on the contribution of the extended theory of planned behavior regarding intention to perform physical activity, adherence to physical activity, and its mediator role in the relationship between trust in the physician and adherence to physical activity, in a sample of 120 patients with type 2 diabetes. The results revealed that positive attitudes and perception of control predicted a stronger intention to do physical activity. The intention to do physical activity was the only predictor of adherence to physical activity. Planning mediated the relationship between trust in the physician and adherence. Implications for patients with type 2 diabetes are discussed.

AB  - Background and aimsBased on the principles of scaffolding for motivation and on the assumptions of self-determination theory, two studies aimed to assess the role played by perceived parental autonomy-supportive scaffolding on child homework autonomous motivation, self-efficacy, affect, and engagement.
   Samples and resultsThe results of Study 1, which involved 122 parents and their children, showed that the higher the parental autonomous motivation, the more their children perceived them as autonomy-supportive while scaffolding for motivation, and hence developed autonomous motivation, self-efficacy, and engagement in homework. In Study 2, 37 parents were involved in a four-session training programme that focused on sustaining autonomy-supportive scaffolding modalities. The training decreased parental negative affect, prevented child negative affect increase, and maintained child homework motivation.
   ConclusionsThe discussion focuses on the strength that parents have with regard to helping their children develop less negative, and potentially also more positive attitude towards homework, through autonomy support as a scaffold for motivation.

AB  - Workers' perception that their job experience enriches their family life has been considered a mechanism that explains their positive attitudes toward the organization where they work. However, because women and men live their work and family differently, gender may condition this relationship between the work-family enrichment and workers' attitudes. With a sample of 1885 workers from one Portuguese bank, with 802 women, the current study investigated the relationship between work-family enrichment and organizational affective commitment as well as the role of sex as a moderator of this relationship. The hypotheses were tested by using regression analysis. The results indicated that the perception held by workers that their work enriches their family is positively correlated with their affective commitment toward the organization. Furthermore, the data revealed that this relationship is stronger for women than for men. Study results have implications for management, particularly for human resource management, enhancing their knowledge about the relationship of work-family enrichment and workers' affective commitment toward organization.

AB  - Education is undergoing profound changes due to permanent technological innovations. This paper reports the results of a pilot study aimed at developing, implementing and evaluating the course, "Applicative Use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Medicine," upon medical school entry. The Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, introduced a curriculum reform in 2014 that included the implementation of the course, "Applicative Use of ICT in Medicine" for first year medical students. The course was designed using a blended learning format to introduce the concepts of Web-based learning environments. Data regarding student knowledge, use and attitudes towards ICT were prospectively collected for the classes of 2015/16 and 2016/17. The teaching approach was supported by multimedia didactic materials using Moodle LMS. The overall quality of the course was also assessed. The five level Likert scale was used to measure attitudes related to ICT. In total, 1110 students were assessed upon medical school entry. A small number of students (19%) had previous experience with e-learning. Students were largely in agreement that informatics is needed in medical education, and that it is also useful for doctors (4.1 +/- 1.0 and 4.1 +/- 0.9, respectively). Ability in informatics and use of the Internet in education in the adjusted multivariate regression model were significantly associated with positive student attitudes toward ICT. More than 80% of students stated that they had learned to evaluate medical information and would use the Internet to search medical literature as an additional source for education. The majority of students (77%) agreed that a blended learning approach facilitates access to learning materials and enables time independent learning (72%). Implementing the blended learning course, "Applicative Use of ICT in Medicine," may bridge the gap between medicine and informatics upon medical school entry. Students displayed positive attitudes towards using ICT and gained skills necessary to function effectively in an information-rich environment.

AB  - In this article we revisit the gateway hypothesis, which argues that political satire programs open the door to people using more hard news content. Using over-time survey data, we examine whether use of satire leads people to use more cable news. Although our cross-sectional analyses replicate previous results attempting to assess the gateway hypothesis, our over-time data suggest that satire does not lead to increased use of news programming on cable outlets. However, we did find support for the gateway hypothesis when looking at a mediation model where political attitudes serve as the intervening variable between satire use and cable news use.

AB  - The aim of the article is to highlight the key elements related to the implementation of new technologies in education from the perspective of the opinions and experiences of educators in the field in Bolivia, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Finland, Poland, Turkey, and Uruguay. The text compares issues related to attitudes towards the use of new media in education, experiences with different forms of e-learning, and the level of restrictions on the use of smartphones in school. These variables are juxtaposed with the self-assessment of digital competence and how cyberspace is used. The survey was conducted using a standardised survey questionnaire translated into the relevant national languages in the first half of 2019, and involved a sample of 873 teachers representing eight countries. On the basis of the pilot studies it was noted that: 1) Teachers from LAC and EU like to use digital media - this is a constant trend independent of geographical location; 2) Teachers note that new technologies are not always better than analogue didactic aids; 3) Teachers from selected countries (the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Turkey, and Uruguay) have much greater techno-optimism in themselves than teachers from Bolivia, Poland, Finland and Turkey in terms of the impact of ICT on student motivation and engagement; 4) In all countries teachers prefer free online courses (the different forms of e-learning are used most often by those in the Dominican Republic, and the least often in Bolivia and Poland); 5) In each country teachers who highly value their own digital competences and have a positive attitude towards new media use ICT much more actively; 6) There is also a global trend in that the extensive use of cyberspace (typical e-services) appears in combination with the extensive use of various forms of e-learning; 7) Teachers from Ecuador are most likely to want to ban the use of smartphones in schools. The most liberal approach in this respect is taken by the Uruguayans; 8) The knowledge of the conditions related to restricting the use of smartphones goes beyond the analyses related to the style of use and attitude towards new media. This article is the result of pilot studies conducted within the framework of the SMART ECOSYSTEM FOR LEARNING AND INCLUSION project carried out in selected Latin American, Caribbean (LAC) and European (EU) countries.

AB  - When contributing to groups on social networking sites (SNS), not all group members necessarily adhere to the group's norms (i.e., its explicit or implicit rules); in other words, they show norm-deviant behavior. Despite the popularity of groups on SNS and the frequency of norm-deviant behavior within them, research has to date rarely investigated how members of online groups react to those behaviors. This article introduces a model based on the social identity approach regarding the responses to norm deviations in Facebook groups and reports an experiment testing this model. In this experiment, deviant members were perceived as questioning what the group stands for (i.e., as subverting the group's identity). Perceptions of identity subversion, in turn, motivated group members to derogate and exclude the deviate. Furthermore, participants were found to ignore the deviate's contributions (i.e., not to recall them after reading the group's timeline). Taken together, the results suggest that group members perceive a deviate's behavior as questioning their group's image. This, however, does not seem to lead to a group's decay, but rather promotes a "natural purification" within the group through elimination of negative influences. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Research has shown that members of the national majority group generally consider host culture adoption by immigrants as desirable. However, so far, this positive effect of perceived host culture adoption on attitudes toward immigrants has not been explained. We argue that majority members infer national identification of immigrants from their cultural adoption. Moreover, we predict that this inference should decrease majority members' feeling of ingroup threat, therefore also improving their attitudes toward immigrants. We conducted two experimental studies. In Study 1, majority members who were presented an immigrant group that adopted the host culture held more positive attitudes than those who were presented one that disregarded it. In line with our hypothesis, this effect was fully mediated by perceived identification of the immigrants with the host nation, itself decreasing perception of ingroup threat. Study 2 reproduced the same experimental design, but used descriptions of individual immigrants' acculturation strategies, and the immigrant group's status - valued vs. devalued origin - was also manipulated. In addition, Study 2 focused on dimensions of the "Big Two" of social perception. Results replicated the mediational effect of perceived identification on attribution of both warmth and competence traits. The status manipulation had no significant effect and did not interact with cultural adoption. These two studies provide robust evidence that perception of host nation identification explains the effects of perceived cultural adoption on attitudes towards immigrants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper is the report of a study which sought to compare the attitudes held by student and qualified mental health nurses towards individuals with schizophrenia in the Republic of Ireland. Background. Media portrayals of individuals with schizophrenia often include images of aggression and violence. With global initiatives aimed at reducing the stigma and exclusion associated with mental illness, the attitudes of those who care for people with schizophrenia are of particular interest. Methods. A survey was administered to 66 student mental health nurses, and 121 qualified mental health nurses. Participants completed the community attitudes to mental illness scale and the social interaction scale in 2009. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to test for the effects of qualification, work setting, years of experience and education on the measures. Results. Nurses employed in a community setting held more positive attitudes, when compared with colleagues who worked in an inpatient setting, as measured by the community mental health ideology subscale, indicating their desire to promote community care for individuals with schizophrenia. Nurses working in an inpatient setting held more socially restrictive attitudes indicating that they felt individuals with schizophrenia were dangerous and should be avoided. These findings were statistically significant at the P < 0.05 level. Conclusions. Mental health nurses must be alerted to the fact that holding negative attitudes may adversely affect the therapeutic relationship and ultimately lead to stigmatization and its negative consequences.

AB  - Key questions for developmentalists concern the origins of gender attitudes and their implications for behavior. We examined whether prenatal androgen exposure was related to gender attitudes, and whether and how the links between attitudes and gendered activity interest and participation were mediated by gender identity and moderated by hormones. Gender attitudes (i.e., gender-role attitudes and attitudes about being a girl), gender identity, and gender-typed activities were reported by 54 girls aged 10-13 years varying in degree of prenatal androgen exposure, including 40 girls with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (C-CAH) exposed to high prenatal androgens and 14 girls with non-classical (NC) CAH exposed to low, female-typical, prenatal androgens. Both girls with C-CAH and NC-CAH reported positive attitudes about being a girl and egalitarian gender attitudes, consistent with their female-typical gender identity. In contrast, girls with C-CAH had more male-typed activity interest and participation than girls with NC-CAH. Gender attitudes were linked to activities in both groups, with gender identity mediating the links. Specifically, gender-role attitudes and positive attitudes about being a girl were associated with feminine gender identity, which in turn was associated with decreased male-typed activity interests and participation, and increased female-typed activity interests. Our results are consistent with schema theories, with attitudes more closely associated with gender identity than with prenatal androgens.

AB  - Background: Individuals with psychosis demonstrate positive attitudes towards utilising digital technology in mental health treatment. Although preliminary research suggests digital interventions are feasible and acceptable in this population, little is known about how to best promote engagement with these resources. Candidate predictors include therapist support, sources of motivation and recovery style. Understanding what factors predict engagement will aid more effective design and implementation of digital interventions to improve clinical benefits.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate demographic, psychological, and treatment variables that predict overall and type of engagement with a psychosocial, online intervention for individuals with psychosis.
   Methods: Ninety-eight participants with a history of psychosis were given access to a web program containing modules on self-management and recovery, which they were asked to use flexibly at their own pace. Activity was automatically logged by the system. Baseline measures of demographics, recovery style and motivation were administered, and participants were randomised to receive either website access alone, or website access plus weekly, asynchronous emails from an online coach over 12 weeks. Log and baseline assessment data were used in negative binomial regressions to examine predictors of depth and breadth of use over the intervention period. A logistic regression was used to examine the impact of predictor variables on usage profiles (active or passive).
   Results: Depth and breadth of engagement were positively predicted by receiving email support, low levels of externally controlled motivations for website use, older age, and having a tertiary education. There was a significant interaction between level of controlled motivation and condition (+ / - email) on breadth and depth of engagement: receiving asynchronous emails was associated with increased engagement for individuals with low, but not high, levels of externally controlled motivations. Receiving email support and more autonomous motivations for treatment predicted more active use of the website.
   Conclusions: Asynchronous email support can promote engagement with online interventions for individuals with psychosis, potentially enabling self-management of illness and improving clinical outcomes. However, those using online interventions due to external motivating factors, may have low levels of engagement with the intervention, irrespective of coaching provided. These findings may guide design and implementation of future online interventions in this population.

AB  - Does seeing Spanish-language news in the media change the racial and political attitudes of Whites and Spanish-speaking Latinos? We examine the effects of Spanish-language media on White and Spanish-speaking Latino attitudes using online survey experiments in English and Spanish, respectively. We expect White Americans to react to Spanish-language media options by developing more hostile attitudes toward Hispanics, and Spanish-speaking Latino audiences to feel a greater sense of belonging in America when they see Spanish represented in the media. We find that seeing articles about non-immigration politics in Spanish, as an option next to English articles, significantly raises racial resentment toward Hispanics among Whites. Among Spanish-speaking Latinos, seeing a political news article option in Spanish increases feelings of inclusion and belonging, even when it is not about a racialized issue like immigration. Such evidence suggests that language alone may prime identity and shape political attitudes for White and Spanish-speaking Latino voters.

AB  - Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have an increasing influence on the way we interact, learn, and live. The increase in teaching and learning methodologies that are mediated by ICT in the field of education and in the domestic settings encourages the design of new effective technological tools, supported by scientific research and development to improve student learning. The challenge psychology is facing in the education field is to promote those technologies and make them available to the education community. Technologies also would produce attractive items for users and realistic commercial issues for businesses. This also allows an effective transfer for scientific work, providing visibility to Research and Development. In this context, the main aim of the article is to describe the process to get an agreement between Babyradio (a children's entertainment company: https://babyradio.es/) and our research team, starting a collaborative work between two groups of people (Babyradio's technical designer and Psychologist-Engineers software designer), in order to create several educative applications (APPs) in the field of early mathematics cognition. The institutional framework of the relationship of the R&D project and a children's entertainment company is described. The article also focuses on experience in Psychology, Technological Innovation, and Entrepreneurship. In considering the efficiency of the agreement, we present different APPs designed for tablets and smartphone devices, adapted to the different operating systems (IOS, Android, Windows). APPs are designed to instill the cognitive fundamentals associated with early math learning for students aged 4 to 7 years. The study developed after this babyradio-university enterprise agreement contributes to the development of mathematics skills in children, aged 4-7 years, so that they can successfully meet the mathematics school requirements; it also contributes to encouraging a more positive attitude toward mathematics. This study also suggests how the education system and software and educational content developers' companies would manage verified instructional APPs, with a more realistic commercial perspective.

AB  - Background Interventions in India to improve menstrual health and hygiene management (MHHM) have been implemented at the national, state, district and school level. However, evaluations of these interventions have been scarce. The objective of the study was to determine if a social and behavioral change communication (SBCC) intervention (GARIMA) had a relationship with knowledge, attitudes, interpersonal communication, restrictions and MHHM using a comparison group post-test only design among 2206 adolescent girls. Methods Intervention villages and adolescent girls were selected through stratified random sampling based on where GARIMA was implemented. Villages and adolescent girls in comparison villages were matched socio-demographically to intervention villages and adolescent girls. Multi-level logistic regressions assessed the relationship between the encoded exposure, mediators and MHHM. Results The results showed that the encoded exposure predicted all behaviors corresponding to MHHM. Additionally, adolescent girls in the high encoded exposure group had significantly higher knowledge about puberty and reproductive parts (AOR: 2.03 (95% CI: 1.31 - 3.15)), positive attitudes towards gender (AOR: 1.48 (95% CI: 1.02 - 2.16)) and higher levels of some discussion and dialogue (AOR: 1.41 (95% CI: 1.04 - 1.92)). Conclusions Future programs should use SBCC to improve MHHM behavior but involve families, peers and community members to a greater extent in order to improve attitudes towards menstruation, attitudes towards restrictions, attitudes towards absorbent use and reduce restrictions within the community.

AB  - This paper explores how cyber threats are represented in Swedish newspapers. The sample comprises 1269 articles from three newspapers (Aftonbladet, Gateborgs-Posten, and Svenska Dagbladet) covering 25 years (1995-2019). The study provides a text-near and detailed analysis of the threats covered. The study analyzes these threats along several dimensions: their modality (e.g. unauthorized access or manipulation); to what extent ambiguous themes (e.g. attack, crime, and warfare) are specified in context; how cyber-threat coverage has changed over time; and the event orientation of the coverage, i.e. whether articles address topical events and, if so, which ones. There are five main findings. First, the Swedish newspaper cybersecurity discourse covers multiple threats; in total, 34 themes (present in at least 4% of articles) have been identified. Second, the representation of cyber threats varies in specificity. While generic themes such as attack and warfare are mostly specified in terms of their modality, they sometimes are not, leaving the representation vague. Third, this study, given its general approach, provides insights into media representations of particular cyber threats. For example, this study finds the meaning of "hacking" in the media to be more diversified and nuanced than previously assumed (e.g. as simply meaning "computer breakin"). Fourth, newspaper coverage of cyber threats has changed over time, in both quantity (i.e. the amount of coverage has increased) and quality, as three general trends have been observed: the state-ification and militarization of threats (i.e. increased attention to, e.g. nations and warfare as threats), the organization-ification of threats (i.e. increased attention to, e.g. government agencies and companies as threats), and the diversification and hyping of threats (i.e. cumulatively more threats are added to the cybersecurity discourse, although attention to particular threats is sometimes restricted in time). Finally, parallel to coverage of particular topical events (e.g. the "I love you" virus), newspaper representations of cyber threats largely exemplify "amplification without the event," i.e. threats are covered without linking them to topical events, as is otherwise typical of news reports. The findings in relation to previous studies of cybersecurity discourse and the implications for informal learning and threat perception are discussed.

AB  - The novel coronavirus may impact exercise habits of those with intellectual disabilities. Due to the mandated discontinuation of face-to-face research, investigators must adapt projects to protect all involved while collecting objective physical activity metrics. This brief report outlines a modification process of research methods to adhere to social distancing mandates present during COVID-19. Actions taken included electronic consent and assent forms, an electronic survey, and mailing an accelerometer with included instructions. The amended research methods were implemented without risk for virus transmission or undue burden on the research team, participant, or caregiver. Recruitment was likely impacted by the coronavirus-mediated quarantine, plausibly resulting in bias. Objective physical activity data collection can be sufficiently modified to protect those with intellectual disabilities and investigators. Future research designs may require greater participant incentives and the creation of in-home participation.

AB  - Purpose To describe the favorable procedural profile of CT colonography (CTC) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion Postponement of cancer screening due to COVID-19 has resulted in a backlog of individuals needing to undergo structural examination of the colon. The experience during the initial COVID-19 surge with urgent evaluation of the colon for transplant patients prior to transplant suggests that CTC can be done in a lower risk manner as compared to other structural examinations. The procedural profile of CTC is advantageous during this pandemic as maintaining social distancing and preserving healthcare supplies including PPE are of paramount importance. CTC is an important option to utilize in the screening armamentarium to allow effective screening of average risk asymptomatic individuals in the COVID-19 era.

AB  - Objective: Nonhuman and human studies have documented the adverse effects of early life stress (ELS) on emotion regulation and underlying neural circuitry. Less is known about how these experiences shape social processes and neural circuitry. In this study, we thus investigated how ELS affects children's perception of, and neural response to, negative social experiences in a social exclusion paradigm (Cyberball). Method: Twenty-five foster or adopted children with ELS (age 10.6 +/- 1.8 years, 13 male and 12 female) and 26 matched nonseparated controls (age 10.38 +/- 1.7 years, 12 male and 14 female) took part in a Cyberball paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results: During peer rejection, children with ELS reported significantly more feelings of exclusion and frustration than nonseparated controls. On the neural level, children with ELS showed reduced activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and reduced connectivity between dlPFC-dACC, areas previously implicated in affect regulation. Conversely, children with ELS showed increased neural activation in brain regions involved in memory, arousal, and threat-related processing (middle temporal gyrus, thalamus, ventral tegmental area) relative to controls during social exclusion. The number of separation experiences before entering the permanent family predicted reductions in fronto-cingulate recruitment. The relationship between early separations and self-reported exclusion was mediated by dlPFC activity. Conclusion: The findings suggest that ELS leads to alterations in neural circuitry implicated in the regulation of socioemotional processes. This neural signature may underlie foster children's differential reactivity to rejection in everyday life and could increase risk for developing affective disorders.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the process through which institutional trust influences individuals' vaccination intentions for a coronavirus vaccine. We collected data from a national representative sample of the Spanish population (N = 500) from an online research panel to test the proposed conceptual model. Results revealed a positive association of institutional trust with coronavirus vaccination intentions. This effect was mediated by perceived vaccine safety and positive attitude toward the vaccine. Furthermore, findings corroborate the moderating effect of interdependent self-construal on the indirect relationship between institutional trust and vaccination intention, implying that this effect was stronger for individuals with higher levels of interdependent orientation. Findings have implications for the development of evidence-based health communication strategies for encouraging COVID-19 vaccination.

TI  - Association of Mobile Phone Location Data Indications of Travel and Stay-at-Home Mandates With COVID-19 Infection Rates in the US
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
LA  - English
AB  - Question Did human mobility patterns change during stay-at-home orders and were the mobility changes associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) curve? Findings This cross-sectional study using anonymous location data from more than 45 million mobile phones found that median travel distance decreased and stay-at-home time increased across the nation, although there was geographic variation. State-specific empirical doubling time of total COVID-19 cases increased (ie, the spread reduced) significantly after stay-at-home orders were put in place. Meaning These findings suggest that stay-at-home social distancing mandates were associated with the reduced spread of COVID-19 when they were followed.
   This cross-sectional study uses anonymous mobile phone location data to examine travel and home dwell time patterns before and after enactment of stay-at-home orders in US states during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
   Importance A stay-at-home social distancing mandate is a key nonpharmacological measure to reduce the transmission rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), but a high rate of adherence is needed. Objective To examine the association between the rate of human mobility changes and the rate of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study used daily travel distance and home dwell time derived from millions of anonymous mobile phone location data from March 11 to April 10, 2020, provided by the Descartes Labs and SafeGraph to quantify the degree to which social distancing mandates were followed in the 50 US states and District of Columbia and the association of mobility changes with rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Exposure State-level stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was the association of state-specific rates of COVID-19 confirmed cases with the change rates of median travel distance and median home dwell time of anonymous mobile phone users. The increase rates are measured by the exponent in curve fitting of the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases, while the mobility change (increase or decrease) rates were measured by the slope coefficient in curve fitting of median travel distance and median home dwell time for each state. Results Data from more than 45 million anonymous mobile phone devices were analyzed. The correlation between the COVID-19 increase rate and travel distance decrease rate was -0.586 (95% CI, -0.742 to -0.370) and the correlation between COVID-19 increase rate and home dwell time increase rate was 0.526 (95% CI, 0.293 to 0.700). Increases in state-specific doubling time of total cases ranged from 1.0 to 6.9 days (median [interquartile range], 2.7 [2.3-3.3] days) before stay-at-home orders were enacted to 3.7 to 30.3 days (median [interquartile range], 6.0 [4.8-7.1] days) after stay-at-home social distancing orders were put in place, consistent with pandemic modeling results. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that stay-at-home social distancing mandates, when they were followed by measurable mobility changes, were associated with reduction in COVID-19 spread. These results come at a particularly critical period when US states are beginning to relax social distancing policies and reopen their economies. These findings support the efficacy of social distancing and could help inform future implementation of social distancing policies should they need to be reinstated during later periods of COVID-19 reemergence.

AB  - Introduction: Health workers are at high risk of contracting the disease because they are at the forefront of assisting COVID19 patients. Globally, Indonesia has the worst death toll of health workers. Many previous studies have shown the differences in knowledge, attitudes, and behavior of health workers in handling with the COVID19 pandemic. This study aims to asses the role of knowledge, attitudes, and health workers' preparedness during the COVID-19 pandemic in Aceh Pidie Jaya District.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study and the data were collected by distributing online questionnaires about knowledge, attitudes, behavior, and preparedness related to the COVID-19 at 12 Pidie Jaya District health centers. The knowledge, behavior, and preparedness parameters used Guttman and Likert scales to measure the workers' attitudes. Chi-square test was used to evaluate the relationship between knowledge, attitudes, behavior, and preparedness.
   Results: In this study, 377 health workers were selected, the majority of respondents' education level was diploma, level 3 (257, 76.3%), and one-third of the respondents did not attend training. There are 197 (58.5%) respondents who had good knowledge, 177 (52.5%) positive attitudes, 283 (84%) good behavior, and 173 (51, 3%) well prepared. Furthermore, good knowledge, positive attitude, and good behavior had a significant correlation statistically with well prepared during the pandemic (p < 0.05).
   Discussion: Most of the health workers in Aceh Pidie Jaya have good knowledge, positive attitudes, and good behavior that create adequate preparedness. Even though training is still very limited, educational attainment would remain the cornerstone for preparedness to encounter COVID-19.

AB  - Translanguaging practice has become increasingly popular in individuals' lives, particularly in online communication among young people. A body of existing research has described translanguaging practice and its potential functions, but few studies have systematically examined individuals' attitudes towards translanguaging practices. Therefore, this paper investigates the extent to which young people consider translanguaging practices appro-priate, and how they judge the motivating factors and effects of translanguaging practices on social media. The study chose to focus on self-praise on social media as its research context, aiming to investigate Chinese young people's attitudes toward translanguaging on Weibo and examine whether their gender influences their attitudes. The results showed that Chinese young people generally perceived the use of translanguaging strategies in self-praise on Weibo as appropriate. The participants rated multi-semiotic resources the highest, significantly higher than their ratings of multimodal and multilingual resources. They held a neutral-to-positive attitude towards translanguaging on social media, and the results also revealed consistent gender differences in attitudes towards translanguaging practices in this context.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Little is known about whether the benefits of intergroup contact extend to contexts (e.g., a diverse underdeveloped township) likely to prove demanding for improved intergroup relations. There is a need for further research in these contexts on the potential inhibitors of contact (such as diversity and threat) and their effects. Perceived social diversity has been implicated in the deterioration of intergroup relations. This is particularly salient in the context of immigrant relations, where anti-immigrant sentiments are characterized by perceived threat and lower outgroup trust. Diversity can, however, have an indirect positive effect on outgroup attitudes, via intergroup contact, which reliably predicts lower perceived threat and prejudice. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that empathy could mitigate negative attitudes towards immigrants. We investigated the relationship between perceived neighbourhood diversity, cross-group friendships, realistic and symbolic threat, empathic responding, trust, and outgroup orientation within the volatile context of Black (African) South Africans' relations with African immigrants. Survey data were collected from South Africans (N = 317) living in a township. Structural equation modelling showed that perceived diversity was significantly positively associated with both realistic threat (which was significantly negatively associated with outgroup trust) and cross-group friendships (which was significantly negatively associated with realistic threat). There was a significant indirect association between cross-group friendships and positive orientation towards African immigrants via empathic responding towards African immigrants. These findings suggest that cross-group friendships and empathy might mitigate the negative impact of diversity and threat on attitudes towards immigrants, even in this demanding context.

AB  - To many commentators and social scientists, Americans' stances on political issues are to an important extent driven by an underlying conservative-liberal ideological dimension. Self-identification as conservative vs. liberal is regarded as a marker of this dimension. However, past research has not thoroughly distinguished between ideological identity (a self-categorization) and ideology (an integrated value system). This research evaluates the thesis that conservative-liberal identity functions as a readiness to adopt beliefs and attitudes about newly politicized issues that one is told are consistent with the socially prescribed meaning of conservatism-liberalism. In Study 1, conservative-liberal identity, measured in 2000, had an independent prospective effect on support for invading Iraq in 2002 and support for the Iraq war in 2004, controlling for substantive ideology, party identity, and demographics. In Study 2, conservative- and liberal-identifiers adopted stances on farm subsidy policy based on randomly varied cues indicating which ideological group supports which stance. This cue-based influence was mediated by adoption of attitude-supportive beliefs. Discussion addresses the joint impact of political discourse and identity-based social influence on the organization of political attitudes.

AB  - This study examines how organizational workers improve their perceived job performance through the use of Mobile Enterprise Systems (MES), while also investigating the impact of perceived organizational agility and location independence on technology acceptance of MES. This study also tests the moderating role of task characteristics (task significance and feedback) on the relationship between MES usage and perceived job performance. Based on the extant technology acceptance model (TAM), we proposed an extended TAM and conducted a large-scale survey among organizational workers who use MES in their workplace across industries. Our findings suggest that both positive attitude toward MES and a high level of habitual MES usage are positively associated with perceived job performance, and that task characteristics positively moderate the relationship between habitual usage (attitude toward MES) and perceived job performance. More importantly, we also found that organizational agility is positively associated with both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, while location independence is positively associated with perceived ease of use. The present findings provide us with a deeper understanding of how organizational workers utilize MES and how they improve their perceived job performance through the use of MES. Based on these findings, we discuss further implications and limitations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. Attitudes and views are critical to the adoption of innovation. Although there have been broadening calls for a standardized dental diagnostic terminology, little is known about the views of private practice dental team members regarding the adoption of such a terminology.
   Methods. The authors developed a survey by using validated questions identified through literature review. Domain experts' input allowed for further modifications. The authors administered the final survey electronically to 814 team members at a multioffice practice based in the US Pacific Northwest.
   Results. Response proportion was 92%. The survey had excellent reliability (Cronbach alpha coefficient = 0.87). Results suggested that participants showed, in general, positive attitudes and beliefs about using a standardized diagnostic terminology in their practices. Additional written comments by participants highlighted the potential for improved communication with use of the terminology.
   Conclusions. Dental care providers and staff in 1 multioffice practice showed positive attitudes about the use of a diagnostic terminology; specifically, they believed it would improve communication between the dentist and patient, as well as among providers, while expressing some concerns about whether using standardized dental diagnostic terms helps clinicians to deliver better dental care.
   Practical Implications. As the dental profession is advancing toward the use of standardized diagnostic terminology, successful implementation will require that dental team leaders prepare their teams by gauging their attitude about the use of such a terminology.

AB  - This research responds to the need to study trust in the national government (national trust) and in local government (local trust) simultaneously and investigates how decentralization reshapes political attitudes toward different layers of government. The argument is that decentralization contributes to variant patterns of political trust, defined by the relative strength of national trust and local trust, across countries. A multilevel analysis of East Asian countries shows that decentralization nurtures local trust in democracies, but decreases local trust in autocracies. Further, decentralization boosts national trust in autocracies, but not in democracies. Such a variant effect of decentralization sheds light on regime stability and viability in democratic and authoritarian countries.

TI  - The Impact of the first COVID-19 shelter-in-place announcement on social distancing, difficulty in daily activities, and levels of concern in the San Francisco Bay Area: A cross-sectional social media survey
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Background
   The U.S. has experienced an unprecedented number of orders to shelter in place throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to ascertain whether social distancing; difficulty with daily activities; and levels of concern regarding COVID-19 changed after the March 16, 2020 announcement of the nation's first shelter-in-place orders (SIPO) among individuals living in the seven affected counties in the San Francisco Bay Area.
   Methods
   We conducted an online, cross-sectional social media survey from March 14 -April 1, 2020. We measured changes in social distancing behavior; experienced difficulties with daily activities (i.e., access to healthcare, childcare, obtaining essential food and medications); and level of concern regarding COVID-19 after the March 16 shelter-in-place announcement in the San Francisco Bay Area versus elsewhere in the U.S.
   Results
   In this non-representative sample, the percentage of respondents social distancing all of the time increased following the shelter-in-place announcement in the Bay Area (9.2%, 95% CI: 6.6, 11.9) and elsewhere in the U.S. (3.4%, 95% CI: 2.0, 5.0). Respondents also reported increased difficulty obtaining hand sanitizer, medications, and in particular respondents reported increased difficulty obtaining food in the Bay Area (13.3%, 95% CI: 10.4, 16.3) and elsewhere (8.2%, 95% CI: 6.6, 9.7). We found limited evidence that level of concern regarding the COVID-19 crisis changed following the announcement.
   Conclusion
   This study characterizes early changes in attitudes, behaviors, and difficulties. As states and localities implement, rollback, and reinstate shelter-in-place orders, ongoing efforts to more fully examine the social, economic, and health impacts of COVID-19, especially among vulnerable populations, are urgently needed.

TI  - Sex Trafficking Related Knowledge, Awareness, and Attitudes among Adolescent Female Students in Nepal: A Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Background
   Sex trafficking has been a long-standing concern in Nepal. Very little has been achieved, however, in terms of actual reduction in the number of victims despite numerous anti-sex trafficking programs. This situation may be attributable to a lack of empirical evidence upon which to formulate anti-sexual trafficking interventions. This study aimed to assess sex trafficking-related knowledge, awareness and attitudes, and factors associated with sex trafficking awareness and attitudes towards the victims of sex trafficking and/or anti-sex trafficking campaigns among adolescent female students in Nepal.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study was conducted between August-September 2013 among 292 adolescent female students (> 10 years old) using systematic random sampling from three high schools in Sindhupalchowk district, Nepal. As an initial step, descriptive analyses were employed to characterize the data and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore factors associated with sex trafficking awareness and related attitudes.
   Results
   Seventy-six percent of sampled students reported that they were aware of sex trafficking and 94.6% indicated media (i.e., radio or television) as the primary sources of their knowledge. Fifty-one percent mentioned relatives/friends as mediators of sex trafficking, 60.4% reported promise for better jobs as the primary attraction behind sex trafficking, and 48.6% mentioned adolescent females as the most vulnerable group for sex trafficking. Over half (56.8%) of the respondents had positive attitudes towards the victims of sex trafficking and/or anti-sex trafficking campaigns. Age (OR = 3.38, 95% CI: 2.51-4.55), parents' occupation (OR = 3.89, 95% CI: 1.58-9.58), and having a radio/TV at home (OR = 6.67, 95% CI: 3.99-9.54) were significantly associated with awareness, whereas being younger (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.55-0.79) and having joint-family (OR = 2.67, 95% CI: 1.49-4.80) were significantly associated with having a positive attitudes towards the victims of sex trafficking and/or anti-sex trafficking campaigns.
   Conclusion
   Findings presented have important implications for anti- trafficking programs, in particular those designed to educate the adolescent females who are at most-risk of sex trafficking. Educational programs need to include specific interventions to improve knowledge and attitudes towards sex trafficking among adolescent females in Nepal.

AB  - As virtual reality (VR) games are getting more widespread, the need to understand the interaction between players and the VR games is gaining prominence. The present study examines player endorsement of virtual reality games from an amalgamation of technology acceptance, self-determination, and flow theory perspectives. A survey was carried out with participants (N = 396) who had played a VR game at least once and at most five times. Structural equation modeling analyses showed that perceived ease of use was the primary predictor for satisfaction of self-determination constructs (autonomy and competence) and flow constructs (immersion and concentration), which in turn predicted player enjoyment. Accordingly, the results suggest the importance of including self-determination constructs in addition to the flow perspective within the context of technology acceptance model, for explaining the acceptance of VR gaming. Findings also showed that enjoyment resulted in positive attitudes towards VR gaming, and these attitudes predicted intention to play VR games.

AB  - This article highlights the support, attitude and perception of the general public towards drug abuse so that appropriate policies can be framed for the prevention of drug abuse among youth. The study aims to understand the relationship among variables influencing behaviour change with respect to drug abuse. Questionnaire from 1,159 respondents was administered comprising of 39 items exploring Perception, Attitude, Support pertaining to illicit drugs. Positive or negative attitude towards drug abuse is evolved out of the perception of problems associated with drug abuse and the support provided to dissuade drug-abusing behaviour, and relationship among these variables was tested using SEM-Path analysis. The perception of problems related to drug addiction significantly influences the attitude towards drug addiction. The perceived nature of the support structure augments the influence further (partial mediation). The augmenting effect of the support structure can be seen among gender, age and education. Moderator effects of age, gender and education were studied by estimating multi-group path coefficients. This article is useful to local government as they may take some of the findings of this article for framing policy related to educating youth related to drugs, creating a campaign regarding the harm of drug abuse and involving those volunteers in drug assistance programmes that are more supportive of drug addicts. This article is helpful for society to make them understand that their positive attitude and support towards drug abuse will give a second chance to drug addicts to leave drugs and live a normal life again.

KW  - DEPRESSION
AB  - Background. Blue light glasses have been introduced as a possible new treatment option to treat sleep disturbances in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Assessing patient attitudes represents a key step in the road towards formal testing and introduction into clinical practice. Specifically, we aimed to assess how patients experience the use of blue light glasses, aiming to optimise compliance in upcoming clinical trials where these glasses will be tested for efficacy. Methods. We invited 58 PD patients who had used the blue light glasses for at least one week on a daily basis to complete an online survey about their experiences and self-reported impact. For this purpose, the System Usability Scale was used, supplemented with additional questions about (side) effects. A total of 31 patients (53%) replied. Results. 74% of respondents reported subjective improvements in night-time sleep, daytime sleepiness, depressive symptoms, motor functioning, or a combination thereof. The median score for the System Usability Scale (SUS; 0-100 range, higher scores indicating better performance) was 70.0. A total of 26 patients (84%) had an overall positive attitude towards the technique, with patients rating the glasses with an average score of 6.9 +/- 2.0 (SD) out of 10. Except for one patient, all responders would like to continue using the glasses, mostly because they considered it a useful aid. Conclusion. Blue light therapy appears to have a positive effect on sleep, mood, and motor symptoms in PD. PD patients had an overall positive attitude towards blue light glasses as treatment for sleep disorders.

AB  - Background: Low adherence to therapies in psoriasis decreases treatment outcomes and increases the total health care costs. In spite of the wide use of biologic agents, patients' adherence to these drugs has not been extensively investigated. Objective: The aim of this study is to measure adherence to the biologic drugs in a population of patients treated for psoriasis vulgaris using the medication possession ratio (MPR) index and to survey patients' attitudes to the treatment. Methods: This is a single-center study on 247 patients with psoriasis vulgaris treated with adalimumab (n = 113), etanercept (n = 39), and ustekinumab (n = 95). MPR calculation was calculated monthly based on the hospital records documenting the dispensing of biologics to the patients. Clinical data [ Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), presence of psoriatic arthritis, concomitant treatment, and cause for treatment discontinuation] were obtained from the national database DERMBIO. Patients' attitudes and beliefs were measured using the Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS). Results: A total of 93.5% of all patients had an MPR >= 0.8, indicating very good adherence. MPR was independent of patients' age, gender, median PASI or DLQI score, concomitant diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis, or treatment with methotrexate. MPR for etanercept was slightly lower than that for ustekinumab and adalimumab. The MARS questionnaire documented satisfactory understanding of the treatment and its adverse effects, and positive attitudes to the treatment. Conclusion: Adherence to biologic therapies is very high in patients with psoriasis, which is consistent with a positive attitude to the treatment. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are known to spearhead the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, their knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) toward coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are considered critical to the success of the current COVID-19 response efforts. This study aims to determine HCWs' KAP toward COVID-19 and assesses their perception of their healthcare facilities preparedness to respond appropriately to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Sierra Leone.
   Methods: We conducted an online cross-sectional study among HCWs (n=516) between 1st May 2020 and 30th June 2020. We collected our data using a self-administered structured questionnaire via email and online social media platforms. We analyzed our data using descriptive statistics and regression analysis (p < 0.05).
   Results: Close to three-fourth of HCWs (n=375, 72.7%) were knowledgeable regarding COVID-19. Doctors were more knowledgeable than community health workers and laboratory technicians (AOR= 2.48, 95% CI: 1.16-5.31, p=0.019) regarding COVID-19. Close to two-thirds of HCWs (n=301, 58.3%) HCWs show positive attitudes toward COVID-19. Being male (AOR=2.08, 95% CI: 1.36-3.20, p=0.001) and directly involved in COVID-19 patient care (AOR=3.21, 95% CI: 1.88-5.48, p < 0.001) were identified as predictors of positive attitude towards COVID-19. HCWs are generally adhering to COVID-19 safe practices with majority indicating that they regularly wash or sanitize their hands (n=510, 98.8%) and used facemask at point of care (n=499, 96.7%). Majority of HCWs are of the view that their healthcare facilities are ill-prepared to adequately respond to COVID-19 with majority (n= 400, 77.5%) of them stating that their facilities lack enough personal protective equipment.
   Conclusion: HCWs in Sierra Leone showed good knowledge, positive attitude and practice regarding COVID-19. However, HCWs are of the view that their healthcare facilities are ill-prepared to respond adequately to the COVID-19 outbreak. Health authorities and policymakers need to provide the necessary resources to allow HCWs to work in a safe environment.

AB  - Recent research has focused on the potential negative consequences of belonging to the upper class. The present study attempted to directly replicate previous research examining whether upper-class individuals had more positive attitudes toward greed than lower-class individuals, and whether these attitudes mediated the negative association between social class and unethical behaviour. The current research includes two studies with 317 and 320 participants, from Amazon's Mechanical Turk and Prolific Academic, respectively. We used the same measures and procedures of the original research. The resulting dataset, and analytic code, are hosted on the Open Science Framework (Clerke et al., 2017). Collectively these datasets provide access to data from over 600 participants pertaining to social class, ethical behaviour, and sociodemographic information, such as obtained education and religious and political orientation. As in the original, we found a significant positive correlation between SES and greed in one of two studies, however the size of the effect was smaller. Contrary to the original, we did not find a significant association between SES and the propensity to lie in a hypothetical salary negotiation.

AB  - This article centers on the developmental trajectory of a young woman who took part in a study that tracked the language and intercultural development of international exchange students from a Hong Kong university. 'Serena', a translation ( Chinese-English) major, took steps toward a more intercultural mindset while studying in England. Compared with many of the other participants, she displayed a more positive attitude toward the host language and culture, developed a more diverse social network, and gained more access to local communities of practice. Over time, she became more open-minded and invested in her intercultural relationships which she mediated through English. Weaving together the rich oral and written data related to her case, this paper presents a narrative of her 'international story'. Her lived experiences and the subjective meanings invoked raise awareness of individual characteristics, attributes, and agency that can facilitate second language learning and intercultural development. By drawing comparisons with the stories of her peers, this narrativized account also points to the impact of external elements on sojourn outcomes.

AB  - In three studies we examined how observers making meaning of victimization by finding benefits for the victim leads to the perception that victims are morally obligated to help others and not do harm. In Experiment 1, participants perceived a victim as having greater moral obligations when the meaning of victimization was considered for the victim rather than the perpetrator. This effect on moral obligations was mediated by the extent to which participants believed victims should have found benefits. Experiments 2 and 3 examined the consequences when victims fail or fulfill their moral obligations. Greater social distance from a victim who did harm was sought when participants focused on the meaning of victimization for the victim as compared to the perpetrator. Less social distance from a victim who helped was sought when participants focused on the meaning of victimization for the victim as compared to the perpetrator or when they made no meaning. These studies show that how observers make meaning of victimization has implications for subsequent responses to victims. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: Negative attitudes toward aging are common among formal healthcare providers, but have been infrequently assessed among informal caregivers providing assistance to older adults. The current study sought to identify factors associated with ageism toward older women. Design: Multivariate hierarchical linear regression model Setting: Lower-income neighborhoods in an urban setting in the Midwestern USA Participants: 144 care network members of White and African American women aged >= 65 years Measurements: Age Group Evaluation and Description (AGED) Inventory assessed attitudes toward older women; CES-D scale measured depressive symptoms; Intergenerational Affectional Solidarity Scale assessed relationship closeness. Results: In bivariate analyses, African American caregivers endorsed more positive attitudes toward older women. In the multivariate regression model, attitudes toward older women were associated with care recipient health (beta = 0.18, p < 0.05) and relationship closeness with the care recipient (beta = 0.23, p < 0.05). However, these associations were fully mediated by care recipient-specific attitude ratings by the care network member. The association between person-specific attitudes and general attitudes was uniquely directional. Conclusions: Findings from the present study are consistent with past research suggesting that 'ageism' may, at least in part, derive from bias against perceived poor health. Further, our findings of an association between attitude toward the care recipient and attitudes toward older women in general provide support for cognitive psychology theory which emphasizes the role of personal experience in stereotype formation through the availability heuristic. The current study underlines the necessity for development of interventions to address ageism in informal caregivers.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSGENDER HEALTH
LA  - English
KW  - Transgender
KW  - gender diverse
KW  - media intervention
KW  - attitudes
KW  - social action
AB  - Background:
   As issues related to transgender and gender diverse individuals gain more national media attention, professional organizations that promote mental health and LGBTQ + rights continue to advocate for equality and inclusion. Barriers to equality and inclusion for transgender and gender diverse individuals can include a variety of factors including discrimination in educational and workplace settings, and issues related to housing, poverty, and homelessness.
   Aim:
   To examine the impact of a media intervention on changing attitudes toward transgender and gender diverse individuals.
   Methods:
   A total of 223 students from a large, Midwestern university in the USA participated and received a 45-minute media intervention along with pre- and post-testing.
   Results:
   A split-plot factorial ANOVA to investigate potential differences in attitudes and beliefs toward transgender and gender diverse individuals using the Transgender Attitude and Beliefs Scale indicated a statistically significant interaction based on a media intervention where F(1, 109) = 7.042, p = .009. A split-plot factorial ANOVA to investigate potential differences in willingness to engage in social action on behalf of this population measured by the Social Justice Scale did not indicate a statistically significant interaction based on the media intervention where F(1, 109) = .881, p = .350.
   Conclusion:
   These findings suggest that a variety of potential media interventions can increase positive attitudes and beliefs toward marginalized groups, but a stronger and/or additional intervention is needed for participants to engage in social action on behalf of the group. Implications and limitations of the study are discussed.

AB  - This study examined the roles of popular music in the lives of immigrant adolescents from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS-former Soviet Union) in Israel. Based on 70 in-depth interviews with newly arrived adolescents aged 12-18, our research revealed that these adolescents' musical preferences matched different stages of adaptation to their new country, with different music styles fulfilling different integration needs. During their first two years in Israel, interviewees enthusiastically explored local musical fare. This stage was also characterised by positive attitudes towards their new home and their anticipated integration. In dramatic contrast, the next three to five years were characterised by disappointment with the local culture, accompanied by growing social alienation. Many adolescents found consolation in late-1980s Russian rock music, as texts critical of the Soviet regime helped them express anger and frustration felt as they came of age in new, difficult and often hostile surroundings. It seems, therefore, that, for immigrant adolescents, different types of popular music not only serve as a marker of their evolving cultural identity but also as indicators of social and psychological adaptation.

AB  - Background:
   Today, Japan is becoming a super-aged society, with senior citizens already constituting over 21% of the population. In this situation, the question of how elderly people can extend their lives and enjoy independent lifestyles is becoming more important. The present study aims to clarify the relationship between the Quality of Life (QOL) of elderly females and their current oral functions and experiences of music and art education in early life.
   Methods:
   We carried out a survey study focusing on elderly females (Takarazuka Revue Company OG group and general female group) by carrying out a questionnaire survey and comparing cognitive function, oral examinations, cerebral atrophy in magnetic resonance imaging, and other characteristics.
   Results:
   It was shown that the Takarazuka Revue Company OG group had greater hippocampal volumes and significantly higher cognitive functions than the general female group. In addition, in the general female group, there was a significant correlation between a decrease in the number of remaining teeth and a decrease in activities in daily living, but in the Takarazuka Revue Company OG group, no such correlation was observed.
   Conclusions:
   The results showed that those who have received art education as part of their careers over an extensive period since early life have higher levels of cognitive function, QOL, physical activity, social activity and life satisfaction compared with the general female group; showing that they sense a purpose in life and live with a positive attitude. In contrast, in the general female group, those who have continued to enjoy hobbies have higher levels of cognitive function, QOL, physical activity, social activity and life satisfaction than those who have not, thus showing that they live with a positive attitude.

AB  - This paper aims to answer how we can increase students' engagement in a large class. We hypothesised that the use of KeyPad, an interactive student response system, can lead to enhanced student engagement in a large classroom. We tested a model of classroom technology integration enhancing the students' engagement among first year undergraduate students (n=131). This study provides evidence of significant effect of positive attitude and social pressure on the intent to use KeyPads. In turn, the intent to use KeyPads leads to the actual use of KeyPads which is directly associated with the level of student engagement. In addition, we find evidence for the relationship between extraversion and level of engagement such that compared to extrovert students, introvert students felt more engaged.

AB  - A key predictor of support for Turkey's EU membership is citizens' attitudes toward immigrants. How anti-immigrant attitudes relate to support is not obvious and has remained unclear thus far. We argue that the presence of immigrants in a country reduces support for Turkey's membership. Second, the stronger this presence, the stronger the effect of anti-immigrant attitudes on support. Third, the more salient immigration issues in a country, the stronger the effect of anti-immigrant attitudes on support. Using cross sectional survey data (N = 26,344) from 20 EU member states, we find support for these claims. Our findings provide a prime example of how politicians and media can influence citizens' thinking about specific issues, and, in doing so, can influence public opinion.

AB  - Objective. To explore the attitudes of pharmacy, pharmacy technician, medical, and public health students before and after an IPE activity that focused on smoking cessation in the Middle East.
   Methods. A pre-post intervention research design using the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) was used for this study. The tool contained 20 items, categorized under the following subscales: teamwork and collaboration, professional identity, and patient-centeredness.
   Results. A total of 47 out of 50 students from four different health disciplines in Qatar (medicine, pharmacy, pharmacy technician, and public health) who participated in the activity completed a pre- and post-intervention pre-validated questionnaire (94% response rate). Total attitude scores were calculated for all the 20 items along with attitudinal scores of the three domains. Most of the students reported having a positive attitude toward IPE; the number of students having a positive attitude toward IPE increased after the IPE session. The overall median (IQR) score increased from 82 (16) before the session to 84 (15) after the session. Students from different disciplines did not vary in their attitude scores.
   Conclusion. Health care professional students in Qatar perceived IPE positively, believing that it enhanced their communication skills, collaboration and appreciation of professional roles. This study has implication on developing effective methods to implement IPE in various health professional education curricula.

AB  - Literatures across the social sciences highlight the tendency for humans to be more attentive to negative information than to positive information. We focus here on negativity biases in news selection (NBNS) and suggest that this bias varies across individuals and contexts. We introduce a survey-based measure of NBNS which is used to explore the correlates of negative news bias in surveys in the U.S., Canada, and Sweden. We find that some respondents are more prone to NBNS than others. There is evidence of contextual effects, but panel data suggests that some of the individual-level differences persist over time. NBNS likely reflects some combination of longterm personality differences and short-term situational factors, and is systematically related to a number of economic and political attitudes.

AB  - Abrupt interruption in the performance of everyday occupations as a consequence of forced social distancing and home confinement, coupled with a lack of regulatory capacities and skills, can trigger harmful effects on people's health and well-being. This study aimed to determine the factors related to the occupational balance in the Spanish population during home confinement as a consequence of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. A total of 3261 subjects completed an online survey, which was disseminated through the mainstream social media platforms in Spain and included the Occupational Balance Questionnaire (OBQ), sociodemographic variables, and factors related to COVID-19 infection. The mean age of the participants (81.69% women) was 40.53 years (SD +/- 14.05). Sociodemographic variables were related to a greater occupational balance, and the multivariate analysis showed that age (beta = 0.071; p = 0.001), the perception of having received enough information (beta = 0.071; p <= 0.001), not telecommuting (beta = -0.047; p = 0.022), and not being infected by COVID-19 (beta = 0.055; p = 0.007) contributed to a better occupational balance. There were profiles of people less likely to suffer disturbances in occupational balance during home confinement, but more studies are needed to help understand and analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's occupational and mental health.

AB  - After the approval of the sales of IQOS in the United States market, discussions about IQOS have become active on social media. Twitter is a popular social media platform to understand public opinions toward IQOS. This study aims to explore public perceptions toward IQOS on Twitter in the United States. IQOS-related tweets from the United States between November 19, 2019, and August 24, 2020, were collected using a Twitter streaming application programming interface (API). Sentiment analysis was performed to determine whether the public perceptions toward IQOS were positive, neutral, or negative. In addition, topics discussed in these tweets were manually coded. From November 2019 to August 2020, the number of tweets discussing IQOS was relatively constant except for a peak starting from July 7, 2020, which lasted for 4 days. Among IQOS tweets with positive sentiments, the most popular topic is "IQOS is safer than cigarettes," followed by "IQOS helps quit smoking." Among tweets with negative sentiments, the most popular topic is "illegal marketing/selling to youth," followed by "health risks/fire hazards." "FDA approval/regulation" is the most popular topic for tweets with neutral sentiments. After the announcement of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enforcement policy on unauthorized flavored e-cigarette products on January 2, 2020, the proportion of tweets with positive attitudes toward IQOS significantly increased, while the proportion of negative tweets significantly decreased. Our study showed that the public perception of IQOS in the United States became more positive after the FDA enforcement policy on flavored e-cigarettes. While many Twitter users thought IQOS is safer than cigarettes and helps quit smoking, some Twitter users complained about the illegal marketing and health risks of IQOS. These findings provide useful information on future tobacco regulations.

AB  - Objective Metric based virtual reality simulation training may enhance the capability of interventional neuroradiologists (INR) to perform endovascular thrombectomy. As pilot for a national simulation study we examined the feasibility and utility of simulated endovascular thrombectomy procedures on a virtual reality (VR) simulator. Methods Six INR and four residents participated in the thrombectomy skill training on a VR simulator (Mentice VIST 5G). Two different case-scenarios were defined as benchmark-cases, performed before and after VR simulator training. INR performing endovascular thrombectomy clinically were also asked to fill out a questionnaire analyzing their degree of expectation and general attitude towards VR simulator training. Results All participants improved in mean total procedure time for both benchmark-cases. Experts showed significant improvements in handling errors (case 2), a reduction in contrast volume used (case 1 and 2), and fluoroscopy time (case 1 and 2). Novices showed a significant improvement in steps finished (case 2), a reduction in fluoroscopy time (case 1), and radiation used (case 1). Both, before and after having performed simulation training the participating INR had a positive attitude towards VR simulation training. Conclusion VR simulation training enhances the capability of INR to perform endovascular thrombectomy on the VR simulator. INR have generally a positive attitude towards VR simulation training. Whether the VR simulation training translates to enhanced clinical performance will be evaluated in the ongoing Norwegian national simulation study.

AB  - Young adults were vulnerable to mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the underlying pathway by which COVID-19-related stress influences mental health outcomes among young adults remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the mediating effects of social support and resilience between COVID-19-related stress and mental health outcomes. A sample of 1000 Korean young adults was obtained via online survey. Participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing COVID-19-related stress, social support, resilience, depression, and anxiety. Overall, 48.1% and 23.4% of participants were classified as having depression and anxiety states, respectively. Path analysis using AMOS version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) showed that the direct effects of stress from social distancing difficulties on depression and anxiety were much greater than those of stress from fear of infection and anger toward others. In addition, there were significant indirect effects of social support and resilience in the relationship between stress related to difficulties due to social distancing and mental health outcomes. The mediating roles of social support and resilience suggest that interventions to increase these factors can be effective strategies to reduce the risks of depression and anxiety among young adults suffering from stress related to social distancing difficulties.

AB  - Satirical news shows such asThe Daily Showare popular with students, but are they appropriate for classroom use? In this two-group, pretest-posttest study, I examine differences in engagement, political knowledge, and political attitudes between two American Government classes: one assigned to watchThe Daily Showand the other assigned to readThe New York Times. The findings reveal no differences in engagement between the groups, but greater political knowledge inThe Daily Showgroup, as well as more cynicism and less trust in government. I conclude that given the surprising lack of greater engagement inThe Daily Showclass, along with higher levels of cynicism and mistrust in government,The Daily Showmay not be an appropriate substitute forThe New York Timesas a primary political information resource.

AB  - This research proposes that after an experience of being excluded, consumers may strategically choose products to differentiate themselves from the majority of others as a result of their appraisal of the exclusion situation. Experiments 1 and 2 show that when excluded individuals perceive that the cause of social exclusion is stable (vs. unstable), they exhibit greater preference for distinctive products than do included individuals. Experiment 3 documents that excluded individuals prefer distinctive products when their self-view is enhanced through self-affirmation. Moreover, these effects are driven by a strengthened perception of uniqueness. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - To what extent do mass media outlets influence viewers' trust in scientific evidence and compliance with behavior recommended by scientific experts? Exploiting the U.S. lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, we analyze a large longitudinal database that combines daily stay-at-home behavior from approximately 8 million mobile phones and local viewership of cable news networks. Early in the pandemic, several of Fox News' hosts downplayed the severity of the pandemic and the risks associated with the transmission of the virus. A combination of regression analysis and a natural experiment finds that a 10% increase in viewership of Fox News in a zip code causes a 0.76 percentage-point reduction in compliance with stay-at-home behavior. The results imply a media persuasion rate that is larger than typical advertising persuasion rates on consumer behavior. Similar analyses using viewership of MSNBC and CNN, which supported lock down measures, were inconclusive but suggested a smaller, positive effect on compliance with social distancing regulations.

AB  - Penal history museums are among the sites where cultural meanings about prisoners and imprisonment are developed, communicated, and consumed. Little research has explored what visitors take from these encounters. Drawing on literature concerning new media communication and Brown's (2009) work on penal spectatorship, we analyze visitor comments about their sojourns into Canadian penal history sites found on TripAdvisor, a global travel website. We delve into the diverse stories that tourists share about their encounters with representations of incarceration, which we have found address the following themes: the performance of on-site actors; perceived authenticity of experiences and emotions; the convenience of visiting museums; attitudes about imprisonment; and views of penal history. Our research suggests that visits to penal history museums in Canada seldom translate into humanizing conceptions of the criminalized and views that challenge punitiveness among visitors, at least online. We also highlight how new media communications shape the actions of penal history museum workers in ways that tend to reinforce memorialization practices that foster social distance between authors and recipients of punishment.

AB  - Background: The drug supply model termed 'County Lines' has generated extensive attention over recent years in the UK. Associated street violence, the involvement of young people and exploitation have been the source of intense concern. However, little discussion has sought to situate this drug market 'phenomenon' in relation to recent austerity policies and intensifying social exclusion. Drawing on Douglas' (1995) conceptualisation of scapegoating as a process of blame transfer, this paper provides a critical analysis of the ways that attention has been diverted from the social conditions that are arguably fundamental to driving involvement in this supply model and its associated harms.
   Methods: A critical discourse analysis was undertaken on publicly available content on the subject of County Lines. Sources included newspaper articles, other media outputs, official publications and parliamentary debates. These were analysed to identify scapegoating discourses. Once established, these were theoretically developed by drawing on a range of extant perspectives. Results: Three forms of scapegoating related to County Lines were identified. A familiar process was found in the form of 'gang talk', with County Lines reduced as a product of these 'evil' groups. A notably less familiar outlet of blame was identified in the form of middle class cocaine users, with a range of powerful actors attempting to denounce this 'imagined' population as fuelling the market. A final form was identified in relation to drug legalisation campaigns, with an unwavering focus on prohibition also arguably serving to obfuscate underlying structural drivers.
   Discussion: Scapegoating for the issue of County Lines has taken multiple forms. The role of these discourses in diverting attention away from the social conditions that drive these market harms should be recognised and challenged. In their place, political economy and addressing social exclusion should be at the fore of policy discussions.

AB  - This study assessed the knowledge and attitude of patients with ovarian cancer (OC) toward OC and next generation sequencing (NGS). The data, including characteristics of patients, their knowledge about OC and their knowledge and attitude of NGS, were collected from June to October 2018. Of the 103 participants, 70.9% (n = 73) had cancer within the second-degree relatives, and 18.4% (n = 19) had BRCA pathogenic mutations. The percentage of right answer for the knowledge about OC and NGS was 64.7% (11/17) and 50% (6/12), respectively. The median number of patients who had positive expectations for the genetic test was 34 (range, 22-44). Based on a first-degree familial history, patients had a different degree of knowledge about OC (11 vs. 8.5, p = 0.026) and NGS (6.5 vs. 5, p = 0.011), but patients with a BRCA pathogenic mutation did not have a different degree of knowledge about OC and NGS panel testing. High-income families had a more positive attitude towards the genetic test than low-income families (p = 0.005). Women with OC do not have enough knowledge about OC (11/17, 64.7%) and NGS (6/12, 50%) but they showed a positive attitude toward the NGS test. These women need OC and NGS educational intervention.

AB  - We carried out an in-depth analysis of a media campaign designed to raise awareness of the ecology and conservation of the Critically Endangered saiga antelope Saiga tatarica in the Pre-Caspian region of Russia. We carried out 250 semi-structured interviews in eight villages. The effectiveness of the campaign was assessed using change in opinion over the previous 3 years as an attitudinal indicator and amount pledged for saiga conservation as a measure of behavioural intention. The campaign induced positive changes in attitudes and behavioural intention. Reinforcement was important, with people's retention of information about saiga conservation from the campaign being positively correlated with their level of ecological knowledge about the species. Similarly, behavioural intention towards the saiga was more likely to be positive in individuals who had a high level of exposure to the species and/or had been subject to two or more different conservation interventions. Level of attitudinal change was dependent on an interaction between the date when the media campaign was carried out and the age of the respondent. We conclude that public awareness campaigns, if designed to take into account the socio-demographics and cultural background of the target audience, can be an effective method of improving attitudes towards conservation.

AB  - Public service announcements (PSAs) are non-commercial advertisements aiming to improve knowledge, attitudes and/or behavior. No evaluations of epilepsy PSAs exist. This study sought to evaluate a televised PSA showing first aid for a seizure. A multilevel regression analysis was used to determine the effect of the PSA on epilepsy knowledge and attitudes taking into account school-level clustering as well as individual-level variables, including socioeconomic status, gender, language and familiarity with epilepsy. Of the 803 randomly selected Grade 5 (9-11 years) students, 406 (51%) had seen the epilepsy PSA. Those who saw the PSA scored significantly higher on knowledge (P < 0.001) and had more positive attitudes (P < 0.001) about epilepsy. Those who saw the PSA had even greater knowledge about epilepsy 1 month later, even though the PSA was no longer being televised. Having viewed, the PSA continued to be associated with higher knowledge and more positive attitudes independent of the effects of a school-based epilepsy education program.

AB  - For public safety and physical security, currently more than a billion closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras are in use around the world. Proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine/deep learning (M/DL) technologies have gained significant applications including crowd surveillance. The state-of-the-art distance and area estimation algorithms either need multiple cameras or a reference object as a ground truth. It is an open question to obtain an estimation using a single camera without a scale reference. In this paper, we propose a novel solution called E-SEC, which estimates interpersonal distance between a pair of dynamic human objects, area occupied by a dynamic crowd, and density using a single edge camera. The E-SEC framework comprises edge CCTV cameras responsible for capturing a crowd on video frames leveraging a customized YOLOv3 model for human detection. E-SEC contributes an interpersonal distance estimation algorithm vital for monitoring the social distancing of a crowd, and an area estimation algorithm for dynamically determining an area occupied by a crowd with changing size and position. A unified output module generates the crowd size, interpersonal distances, social distancing violations, area, and density per every frame. Experimental results validate the accuracy and efficiency of E-SEC with a range of different video datasets.

AB  - In head and neck cancer patients with late radiation injury, hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is used for therapeutic or prophylactic reasons against soft-tissue and osteoradionecrosis (ORN). Twenty-nine departments of oncology, ENT, oral and maxillofacial (OMF) surgery were surveyed using the Enalyzer tool < www.enalyzer.com >, of whom 21 responded. Data were incomplete in four returns. Within the previous year, 14 departments had referred at least one patient for hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). There appears to be a generally positive attitude in Danish OMF, ENT and oncology departments towards referral of patients with ORN for HBOT. However, there is an increasing desire for better evidence for its role in head and neck cancer in the prevention and treatment of soft-tissue injury and osteonecrosis following radiotherapy.

AB  - Introduction: In order to curb the abrupt advance of "Coronavirus Disease 2019" (COVID-19) and prevent the collapse of the health system, authorities around the world have opted for social distancing strategies that include closing gyms, among other measures. Objectives: This study analyzed the effect of social distancing on resistance training practitioners' quality of life and perception of body image in silhouette. Methods: The volunteers were contacted through social media; data were collected between April 13 and 19, 2020, through a structured questionnaire, comprised of an Informed Consent Form, four questions about COVID-19 and restrictive measures; and twenty-nine questions designed to characterize the individuals' habits; as well as the Short Form Health Survey 36 questionnaire. All the questionnaires were applied over the Internet, using Google Forms (R). After collection, the data were tabulated and interpreted using the software program AppleNumbers (R), and subsequently presented as mean, standard deviation and percentiles. Results: The results revealed changes in perception of body image and decreased frequency and satisfaction with training. There was also an increase in sedentary behavior, food intake, and amount of sleep; and a reduction in parameters related to health and quality of life. Conclusions: The strategy of social distancing, adopted to curb the progress of COVID-19, has harmful consequences for resistance training practitioners, such as increased calorie intake, stress and anxiety, as well as possible psychological effects. These consequences, in turn, lead to changes in self-perception of body image and in the quality of training.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to investigate how the green image of a city can affect potential visitors' attitude toward the city in the context of user-generated content. The study adopts a 2 x 2 experimental design in which the greenness of the city image and the social distance between the users and the authors of social media content are examined. The results demonstrate that green image has a significant effect on attitudes toward cities. Moreover, the effects of social media content vary according to the perceived social distance between the author of the post and potential visitors. This study contributes to the literature by assessing the role that social media content plays in place branding and communication. Furthermore, it provides relevant insights on how institutions should enhance the sustainable resources of cities with their environmental policy and encourage the generation of content from various stakeholders to contribute to the development of a city's image.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic may be having many psychological impacts on people, at both an individual and a community level.
   OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the relationship between the weekly frequency of physical activity and levels of stress among Brazilian adults during social distancing due to the coronavirus (COVID-19), and the interaction of sex in this association.
   DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study with a descriptive approach conducted at a public university in Curitiba (PR), Brazil.
   METHODS: 2,000 Brazilian adults (average age 36.4 years; 59.6% women) were recruited according to convenience through digital media. They filled out a questionnaire in electronic format that asked for sociodemographic information, health data, food consumption data, weekly frequency of physical activity and stress levels on the 10-item Kessler psychological distress scale. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were used to evaluate the data.
   RESULTS: Associations were observed for the following correlations: male sex * no physical activity (odds ratio (OR): 4.35; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-16.67); female sex * physical activity 4 or 5 times a week (OR: 7.86; 95% CI: 2.28-27.05); female sex * physical activity 3 times a week (OR: 7.32; 95% CI: 2.09-25.58); female sex * physical activity 1 or 2 times a week (OR: 14.57; 95% CI: 4.28-49.57); and female sex * no physical activity (OR: 24.17; 95% CI: 7.21-80.97).
   CONCLUSION: The lower the weekly frequency of physical activity during the period of social distancing was, the greater the chances of having stress levels were, especially for women.

AB  - This paper analyses the migration intentions of university graduates using the Theory of Planned Behaviour not just to unravel their intention but also to uncover how subjective perceptions enter the decision-making process. The results suggest that perceived parental and peer pressures have strong direct effects on the formation of the intention, and exert indirect effects by shaping positive attitudes about staying in the city. In terms of behavioural control, the expected difficulty in finding a satisfactory job does not influence the intention. The perceived difficulty in finding affordable housing, however, acts as a barrier to the intention to stay. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Context: A range of studies have consistently shown that listeners associate negative psychosocial characteristics to speakers with dysphonia. The reasons why have not formerly been explored. A better understanding of the mechanisms behind this negative stereotype could help to develop attitude-changing measures towards voice disorders. Aim: We want to explore if the negative psychosocial stereotype linked to dysphonia is due to dysphonia's negative impact on perceived vocal beauty. Methods: A group of naive listeners was asked to listen to female voice samples with varying degrees of dysphonia according to the Grade (G) of the GRBAS scale, and then to rate the perceived degree of vocal beauty for each voice on a visual analogue scale. They were also asked to infer personal characteristics of each speaker on a set of 21 Bipolar semantic scales. Results: Mediation analyses showed that G significantly and negatively predicts perceptions of vocal beauty (p < .001) and that vocal beauty in its turn was significantly and positively predicting inferences of negative psychosocial characteristics in the speakers (p < .001). When vocal beauty was partialled out, the negative impact of G was diminished or even cancelled. Conclusion: Our results show that in female speakers, the negative impact of dysphonia on the attribution of speakers' personal characteristic is explained by the negative impact of dysphonia on perceived vocal beauty. Our results support the hypothesis that the beauty stereotype underlies the negative biases existing towards dysphonic speakers. We suggest that clinicians should be aware of this mechanism when promoting awareness about dysphonia.

AB  - This study assessed consumers' initial reactions to in-feed native ads appearing as news content. In particular, it focuses on consumers' recognition of advertising when they realize that content they had thought were news stories had in fact been advertising. Recognition of advertising made consumers infer that advertisers had deliberately manipulated them. Consequently, consumers engaged less with the message, had less positive attitudes toward the brand, and were less likely to purchase and share. The results demonstrated the mechanisms through which the two mediators, manipulative intent and message engagement, lowered brand attitude, purchase intention, and sharing intention. In addition, ad disclosure made more people recognize the ad when they were exposed to it than when it was not disclosed as an ad.

AB  - Terrorist attacks often fuel online hate and increase the expression of xenophobic and antiminority messages. Previous research has focused on the impact of terrorist attacks on prejudiced attitudes toward groups linked to the perpetrators as the cause of this increase. We argue that social norms can contain the expression of prejudice after the attacks. We report the results of a combination of a natural and a laboratory-in-the-field (lab-in-the-field) experiment in which we exploit data collected about the occurrence of two consecutive Islamist terrorist attacks in Germany, the Wurzburg and Ansbach attacks, in July 2016. The experiment compares the effect of the terrorist attacks in hate speech toward refugees in contexts where a descriptive norm against the use of hate speech is evidently in place to contexts in which the norm is ambiguous because participants observe antiminority comments. Hate toward refugees, but not toward other minority groups, increased as a result of the attacks only in the absence of a strong norm. These results imply that attitudinal changes due to terrorist attacks are more likely to be voiced if norms erode.

AB  - This paper is about the "Internet-based performance support systems with educational elements" model. The theoretical foundations and characteristics are analyzed together with their application being to check the model's effectiveness by means of a mixed research approach with university students. Measuring instruments consisted of questionnaires on attitude about learning through the use of computers as well as reflection on the learning methods, and achievements on practice tests. The results showed that students had positive attitudes and good results on achievement in performance. We recommend the use of educational platforms that are performance learning-centered in universities and for continuing training, as a necessary answer to current workplace demands.

AB  - Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) often engage in dangerous self-injurious behaviors (SIBs) as a maladaptive technique to decrease heightened feelings of distress (e.g. negative feelings caused by social exclusion). The reward system has recently been proposed as a plausible neural substrate, which may influence the interaction between social distress and physical pain processing in patients that engage in SIBs. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 20 adult BPD patients with a history of SIBs and 23 healthy controls (HCs), we found a hyper-activation of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and amygdala when painful stimuli were presented to BPD patients (but not HCs) in a state of heightened distress, induced via social exclusion. This differential NAcc activity was mediated by anxious attachment style, which is a key developmental feature of the disorder. Altogether, these results suggest a neural mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of SIBs in these patients, which is likely reinforced via the reward system.

KW  - BEHAVIORS
AB  - While effective preventive measures against COVID-19 are now widely known, many individuals fail to adopt them. This article provides experimental evidence about one potentially important driver of compliance with social distancing: social norms. We asked each of 23,000 survey respondents in Mexico to predict how a fictional person would behave when faced with the choice about whether or not to attend a friend's birthday gathering. Every respondent was randomly assigned to one of four social norms conditions. Expecting that other people would attend the gathering and/or believing that other people approved of attending the gathering both increased the predicted probability that the fictional character would attend the gathering by 25%, in comparison with a scenario where other people were not expected to attend nor to approve of attending. Our results speak to the potential effects of communication campaigns and media coverage of compliance with, and normative views about, COVID-19 preventive measures. They also suggest that policies aimed at modifying social norms or making existing ones salient could impact compliance.

AB  - Objectives Edication management is a process in which medications are selected, procured, delivered, prescribed, reviewed, administered and monitored to assure high-quality patient care and safety. This paper explores clinicians' attitudes towards medication management which is both open to influence and strongly linked to successful changes in mediation behaviour. We aimed to investigate effects of engaging in participatory action research to improve emergency medicine clinicians' attitudes to safety in medication management. Setting Emergency department of one university affiliated hospital. Participants A total of 85 clinicians including nurses and physicians partook as participants. Eight managers and clinicians participated as representatives. Design Data are drawn from two-cycle participatory action research. Initially, a situation analysis on the current medication management and clinician views regarding medication management was conducted using three focus groups. Evaluation and reflection data were obtained through qualitative interviews. All qualitative data were analysed using content analysis. Results Clinicians initially expressed negative attitudes towards existing and new plans for medication management, in that they were critical of current medication-related policy and procedures, as well as wary of the potential relevance and utility of potential changes to medication management. Through the action research, improvement actions were implemented including interprofessional courses, pharmacist-led interventions and the development of new guidelines regarding medication management. Participants and their representatives were engaged in all participatory action research stages with different levels of involvement. Extracted results from evaluation and reflection stages revealed that by engaging in the action research and practice new interventions, clinicians' attitude towards medication management was improved. Conclusions The results support the impact of participatory action research on enhancing clinicians' positive attitudes through their involvement in planning and implementing safety enhancing aspects of medication management.

AB  - Background: As COVID-19 poses different levels of threat to people of different ages, health communication regarding prevention measures such as social distancing and isolation may be strengthened by understanding the unique experiences of various age groups.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to examine how people of different ages (1) experienced the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) their respective rates and reasons for compliance or noncompliance with social distancing and isolation health guidance.
   Methods: We fielded a survey on social media early in the pandemic to examine the emotional impact of COVID-19 and individuals' rates and reasons for noncompliance with public health guidance, using computational and content analytic methods of linguistic analysis.
   Results: A total of 17,287 participants were surveyed. The majority (n=13,183, 76.3%) were from the United States. Younger (18-31 years), middle-aged (32-44 years and 45-64 years), and older (>= 65 years) individuals significantly varied in how they described the impact of COVID-19 on their lives, including their emotional experience, self-focused attention, and topical concerns. Younger individuals were more emotionally negative and self-focused, while middle-aged people were other-focused and concerned with family. The oldest and most at-risk group was most concerned with health-related terms but were lower in anxiety (use of fewer anxiety-related terms) and higher in the use of emotionally positive terms than the other less at-risk age groups. While all groups discussed topics such as acquiring essential supplies, they differentially experienced the impact of school closures and limited social interactions. We also found relatively high rates of noncompliance with COVID-19 prevention measures, such as social distancing and self-isolation, with younger people being more likely to be noncompliant than older people (P<.001). Among the 43.1% (n=7456) of respondents who did not fully comply with health orders, people differed substantially in the reasons they gave for noncompliance. The most common reason for noncompliance was not being able to afford to miss work (n=4273, 57.3%). While work obligations proved challenging for participants across ages, younger people struggled more to find adequate space to self-isolate and manage their mental and physical health; middle-aged people had more concerns regarding childcare; and older people perceived themselves as being able to take sufficient precautions.
   Conclusions: Analysis of natural language can provide insight into rapidly developing public health challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, uncovering individual differences in emotional experiences and health-related behaviors. In this case, our analyses revealed significant differences between different age groups in feelings about and responses to public health orders aimed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. To improve public compliance with health orders as the pandemic continues, health communication strategies could be made more effective by being tailored to these age-related differences.

AB  - Governments throughout the world have set social distancing guidelines to manage COVID-19 that reduced opportunities for maintaining social connections through face-to-face interactions. For this study, we conceptualized social collaboration as an intentional social activity in which people are willing to share their knowledge, experience, and expertise. We examined the relative impacts of we-intention (WI), moral trust (MT), and self-motivation (SM) on participation in social collaboration (PSC) and knowledge sharing (KS). We distributed a questionnaire-based survey to a group of Nepalese residents who actively participated in, commented on, and posted questions on social networking sites and received a total of 239 valid questionnaires for analysis. We tested and verified the research model and variables in SPSS 20 to investigate how PSC accelerates KS intention at digital platforms. The standardized path coefficient for PSM to KS was 0.75, suggesting that social collaborator's participation has a strong positive effect on KS purpose. The standardized path coefficients for WI to MT, WI to PSC, WI to SM, MT to PSC, and SM to PSC were 0.55, 0.72, 0.49, 0.42, and 0.67, respectively. All of the values supported the hypothesis and were significant at p <= 0.001.

AB  - Social exclusion is a condition that seems to allow terrorism to flourish. Since radicalization is argued to occur mostly in the context of group identification and accompanying processes, we hypothesized that these may contribute to pushing excluded individuals toward radicalism. To investigate this, we performed four studies. In Studies 1 to 3, we conducted experiments in which we manipulated exclusion (vs. inclusion), created new in-groups, and measured radicalism intentions in the context of eco- or animal rights extremism. In Study 4, we tested the focal variables in a reanalysis of coded qualitative data on an Islamist sample. In Study 1, the exclusion-radicalism link revealed to be mediated by in-group sympathy as opposed to out-group antipathy. Studies 2 to 4 specifically identified perceived group threat as a driver of radicalism in the aftermath of exclusion. This work provides first experimental evidence for the catalyzing power of relationships in the exclusion-radicalism link.

AB  - Morocco's international development enterprise, the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH), aims to boost the economy and stimulate the integration of marginalised groups, including rural women. Has the INDH achieved social impact? Are attitudes changing toward women's economic independence, literacy, numeracy, political participation, and overall freer participation in a society that has long disadvantaged women? This mixed-methods approach to impact evaluation compares rural women's and men's views toward democratisation and women's empowerment in developing communities where INDH-supported argan oil cooperatives exist and in similar, undeveloped communities where they do not. Using two survey instruments tailored to women and men, the American-Moroccan research team collected quantitative and qualitative data through 829 surveys with randomly selected, overwhelmingly Amazigh (Berber) participants in fifty-four communities in the Atlas Mountains and their foothills. Results reveal the core tension of the INDH mission. While the impact of these programmes, or treatment, is clearer on women than on men-the men being profoundly conflicted-positive correlations exist between treatment and women earning money and viewing opportunity in their communities. At the same time, in some regards treatment adversely correlates to greater gender parity, and in crucial ways other variables, such as basic math skills, more strongly predict favourable attitudes than treatment. In effect, rather than transforming society, these INDH-funded programmes strengthen the state's stability and control, giving just enough help to rural women to have a modest positive impact without eroding the bedrock of traditional rural society, which the argan tree poetically symbolises for Moroccans.

AB  - BackgroundIn Germany, a mandatory policy on measles vaccination came into effect in March 2020. Physicians, as the main vaccine providers, have a crucial role in implementing it. Mandatory vaccination changes the preconditions under which patient-provider communication on vaccines occurs. Physicians might or might not favor vaccine mandates depending on, among other factors, their attitudes towards vaccines and capabilities as vaccine providers. The aim of this study was to investigate in different subgroups of physicians the association between various factors and their attitudes towards a mandatory policy.MethodsIn total, 2229 physicians participated in a mixed-mode online/paper-pencil survey. Respondents were general practitioners, pediatricians, gynecologists, and internists. Primary determinants were the 5C psychological antecedents of vaccination, communication self-efficacy, patient clientele, projected consequences of the mandate and sociodemographic characteristics. Associations between outcomes and determinants were examined using linear regression analysis.ResultsApproximately 86% of physicians were in favor of the measles vaccine mandate for children. Regarding the 5C model, physicians were more in favor of vaccine mandates when they scored higher on confidence and collective responsibility, and lower on complacency and calculation. They were more in favor of vaccine mandates when they had higher communication self-efficacy and a more vaccine-positive patient clientele. Pediatricians were less in favor of mandates for children (80.0%) than other physician subgroups (87.1%). They were also less convinced that a mandate would result in more children getting vaccinated (59.3%) than other physician subgroups (78.3%). When controlled for these expected consequences, being a pediatrician no longer lowered the attitude towards the mandate.ConclusionsPhysicians in Germany are predominantly in favor of a measles vaccine mandate. Whether or not physicians believe the mandate to be effective in increasing vaccine coverage affects their attitude towards the mandate. In pediatricians, this belief explains their less positive attitude towards the mandate. In addition, physicians need adequate support to communicate well with patients, especially those who are hesitant, to booster their communication self-efficacy. To increase acceptance of vaccine mandates, the 5C model can be used, e.g., collective responsibility can be communicated, to avoid anger stemming from a negative attitude to mandates.

AB  - Introduction: To design, implement and evaluate the effect of an educational intervention on student radiographer attitudes across their educational tenure.
   Methods: In the first phase, an educational intervention that involved didactic lectures, reflective exercises and simulation suits, aimed at improving student radiographer attitudes towards the older person, was designed and implemented. Kogan's attitudes towards older people (KoP) scale was administrated at five test points; pre-intervention; post-intervention; 6 months post intervention; 12 months post intervention and 24 months post intervention. At the final test point these quantitative data was supplemented with qualitative data for triangulation of the findings.
   Results: Students held positive attitudes towards older people pre intervention, these increased significantly post intervention (p = 0.01). However, this increase in positive scores was not noted at 6 months and 12-months post intervention. At 24-months post intervention, although there was a slight increase in positive attitudes when compared to the 6 and 12 month scores, this increase was not found to be significant (p = 0.178)
   Conclusion: The results post-intervention suggested that an educational intervention can have a significant impact on student radiographer's attitudes towards older people. However, the qualitative data suggests that experiences on initial clinical placement can be detrimental to attitudinal scores, particularly if the intervention does not include Dementia care strategies.

AB  - Background Among all cancers, breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer and the leading cause of mortality among women in developing countries including Palestine. Community pharmacists are trusted and easily accessible healthcare providers who could be engaged in breast cancer health promotion. This study was conducted with the aim of exploring knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and barriers toward breast cancer health promotion among community pharmacists in the Palestinian territories. Methods This study was conducted in a cross-sectional design using a questionnaire among community pharmacists. Knowledge of community pharmacists of breast cancer was tested using a 26-item knowledge test. Attitudes and beliefs of the community pharmacists with regard to breast cancer promotion were explored using 14 items. Barrier to breast cancer health promotion were explored using 9 items. Results Data were collected from 200 community pharmacists. The median knowledge score was 69.2 % with and IQR of 15.2 %. Of the community pharmacists, 67.5 % scored 50 % and above in the knowledge test. Multivariate logistic regression showed that community pharmacists who were female in gender were more likely to score 50 % and above in the knowledge test compared to the community pharmacists who were male in gender (OR = 4.73, 95 % CI of 2.26-9.89). The community pharmacists had positive attitudes toward breast cancer health promotion. There was a significant moderate positive correlation between knowledge and attitudes scores (Spearman's rho = 0.37, p-value < 0.001). Lack of reimbursement, lack of enough personnel, lack of time, and fear of offending the patients were the main barriers to breast cancer health promotion (percentage of agreement > 60.0 %). Conclusions This study shed light on the role of community pharmacists in breast cancer health promotion. Pharmacists had good knowledge of breast cancer and positive attitudes toward promoting the health of patients with breast cancer. Further studies are still needed to determine how to integrate community pharmacists in the team of healthcare providers caring for patients with breast cancer.

AB  - Background: SARS-CoV-2 spreads rapidly around the world, and some patients present gastrointestinal symptoms. The existence of the virus in the gastrointestinal tract makes digestive endoscopy a high-risk operation, which associated with an increased risk of infection rate in healthcare workers. This study aimed at exploring current knowledge, practice and attitudes of healthcare workers in endoscopy units in China regarding the status of occupational protection during COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study of a national online survey involving 717 healthcare workers in endoscopy units from 94 medical structures in 24 provinces and municipalities around China was conducted online via a questionnaire platform called Wenjuanxing (wjx.cn). The data were analyzed using correlation approaches, Kruskal-Wallis test for independent samples, and linear regression models.
   Results: Most Chinese healthcare workers in endoscopy units had a good knowledge of COVID-19 (median: 10; range: 7-12), showed a strikingly positive attitude (median: 65; range: 39-65), and carried out good practice (median: 47; range: 14-50) in strengthening the protection, disinfection and management of COVID-19. In terms of attitudes, female staff was more concerned about protection against COVID-19 than male staff (KW = 8.146, P = 0.004). Nurses performed better in both attitude (KW = 2.600, P = 0.009) and practice (KW = 6.358, P < 0.001) than endoscopic physicians when carrying out personal protection, patient care and environmental disinfection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. More positive attitudes in protection were related to better protective behavior in endoscopic daily medical work (r = 0.312; P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that Chinese endoscopy healthcare workers have an excellent mastery of knowledge about COVID-19, which is transformed into positive beliefs and attitudes, contributing to good practice during daily endoscopic procedures. Medical staff may benefit from further education. With the gradual normalization amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, protection and management in endoscopy units may be changed accordingly.

AB  - Background: The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 has led to a global pandemic in which case fatality rate (CFR) has varied from country to country. This study aims to identify factors that may explain the variation in CFR across countries. Methods: We identified 24 potential risk factors affecting CFR. For all countries with over 5000 reported COVID-19 cases, we used country-specific datasets from the WHO, the OECD, and the United Nations to quantify each of these factors. We examined univariable relationships of each variable with CFR, as well as correlations among predictors and potential interaction terms. Our final multivariable negative binomial model included univariable predictors of significance and all significant interaction terms. Results: Across the 39 countries under consideration, our model shows COVID-19 case fatality rate was best predicted by time to implementation of social distancing measures, hospital beds per 1000 individuals, percent population over 70 years, CT scanners per 1 million individuals, and (in countries with high population density) smoking prevalence. Conclusion: Our model predicted an increased CFR for countries that waited over 14 days to implement social distancing interventions after the 100th reported case. Smoking prevalence and percentage population over the age of 70 years were also associated with higher CFR. Hospital beds per 1000 and CT scanners per million were identified as possible protective factors associated with decreased CFR.

AB  - Social distancing was found to prevent COVID-19 contagion. Therefore, understanding the factors associated with the public's adherence is important. Acknowledging the importance of emotional wellbeing regarding older people's health, and understanding their emotional state during the pandemic, are crucial. This study assessed factors associated with older people's adherence to social distancing and their emotional status. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 1822 respondents above the age of 60. Distancing adherence, negative emotion, trust, social support, threat perception, attitudes, and subjective norms were assessed, and a path analysis was performed. Adherence was positively associated with attitudes (beta = 0.10; p < 0.001), and with subjective norms (beta = 0.19; p < 0.001). Negative emotions were positively associated with threat perception (beta = 0.33; p < 0.001), and negatively associated with social support (beta = -0.13; p < 0.001) and subjective norms (beta = -0.10; p < 0.001). Attitudes mediated the relationship of threat perception (95% CI = 0.009, 0.034), trust (95% CI = 0.008, 0.029), and social support (95% CI = 0.006, 0.023) with distancing adherence. Subjective norms mediated the relationship between threat perception (95% CI = 0.014, 0.034), trust (95% CI = 0.026, 0.055), and social support (95% CI = 0.002, 0.048) with distancing adherence. Subjective norms mediated the relationship between threat perception (95% CI = -0.022, -0.006), trust (95% CI = -0.034, -0.010), and social support (95% CI = -0.029, -0.009) with negative emotions. When promoting social distancing adherence, subjective norms and attitudes must be considered, as they play a role in promoting adherence and negative-emotion regulation.

AB  - With our social lives increasingly experienced online, it is critical to understand online relationship development. The current study examined the outcomes of disclosing stigmatized group membership (i.e., being gay or lesbian) earlier (vs. later) in a developing online relationship. Heterosexuals (n = 214) engaged in an experimentally controlled closeness-inducing online interaction with an ostensible partner, learning that he/she was gay/lesbian either before (i.e., earlier) or after (i.e., later) the interaction. Earlier (vs. later) discovery led to a subjectively more positive contact experience, which predicted heightened bond with the partner, itself predicting more positive attitudes toward the partner. Outcomes were uninfluenced by pretest biases and authoritarianism, suggesting the general benefits of disclosing gay/lesbian identity earlier (vs. later) in online relationships.

AB  - Background: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use continues to rise, while there is conflicting evidence about the health effects of its use. As such, research is needed to better determine risks factors for e-cigarette use. Accumulating evidence suggests that attitudes toward e-cigarette use could be a potential risk factor for e-cigarette use. Objectives: This study sought to examine the psychometric properties of the Comparing E-cigarette And Cigarette questionnaire (CEAC), and to replicate a structural model of the relationship between impulsive-related personality traits and e-cigarette use mediated by positive attitudes toward e-cigarettes. Methods: Participants were 525 adults (mean age = 33.42, SD = 11.27) who completed the CEAC and UPPS-P (trait impulsivity) questionnaires online. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis of the CEAC replicated the a priori factor structure of the questionnaire reasonably well (chi(2)(df = 32) =172.85, CFI = 0.94, TLI = 0.91, RMSEA = 0.09 (0.08-0.11, 90% Confidence Interval, SRMR = 0.06). Structural path analysis showed that deficits in conscientiousness was significantly negatively related to e-cigarette attitudes (beta = -0.20, p = .01), while urgency (beta = 0.19, p = .018) showed a significant positive relationship to e-cigarette attitudes. E-cigarette users showed significantly more positive attitudes toward e-cigarettes than nonusers (beta = 0.59, p < .001). No significant direct effects were found between impulsivity-related traits and e-cigarette use. Conclusions: The present study suggests that impulsivity-related traits and attitudes toward e-cigarettes are likely to be important risk factors for e-cigarette use. Future prospective and experimental studies should test if the causal model described in this study predicts risk for e-cigarette use, and whether this model could therefore be used to guide strategies for reducing risk for e-cigarette use.

AB  - Computer-mediated communication is becoming an increasingly popular medium for mental illness self-disclosure. However, little is known about how observers respond to such disclosures (e.g., support or rejections). Using Facebook as a medium of communication, we experimentally examined how different depression disclosure posts can lead to different reactions from observers. In two experimental studies, we examined how (a) the self-presentation used in a depression disclosure on Facebook and (b) peers' supportive responses to the disclosure impacted observers' responses involving social support intention, empathy, social distance, and depression stigma. Participants in both studies (N = 679 and 1,280, respectively) were recruited from Amazon's MTurk. They viewed a mock-up Facebook page in which two factors were manipulated: self-presentation of coping (good vs. poor vs. balanced coping) and peers' supportive responses (present vs. absent). Participants then completed online surveys assessing outcome variables. Results showed that poor coping elicited greater support intention and social distance than good coping across two studies. Further, Study 2 (but not Study 1) showed that participants reported greater empathy and lower social distance when peer responses were present compared to when they were absent. Neither self-presentation nor peers' responses impacted depression stigma in both studies. Our research is the first to experimentally examine observers' reactions to mental illness disclosure posts on social media.

AB  - Aims and objectivesTo evaluate the short-term effects of a suicide care educational intervention on the family's ability to care, family's caring stress levels and family's attitudes towards attempted suicide.
   BackgroundResearch has demonstrated that suicide prevention educational programmes are provided mostly for professional staff and not for the family caregivers of people who are suicidal.
   DesignA experimental design, using two groups and a pre- and postintervention survey method, was used.
   MethodsA randomised controlled study was conducted with 74 family caregivers of people who are suicidal (37 using suicide education and 37 in the control group). The experimental group was provided with a two-hour suicide care education intervention, and the control group received normal suicide care support. Participants were recruited at a Suicide Prevention Centre and two acute psychiatric hospitals between October 2009-December 2010. Three questionnaires were collected: (1) the Suicidal Caring Ability Scale (2) the Caring Stress Scale and (3) the Suicide Attitudes Scale. Descriptive statistics, independent t-tests or Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to analyse the data.
   ResultsThe results demonstrated that there were statistically significant differences in the Suicidal Caring Ability Scale and the Suicide Attitudes Scale but no statistically significant differences in the Caring Stress Scale. That is, the suicide education programme can promote the ability to care for people who are suicidal and can generate a positive attitude towards people who are suicidal from their caregivers.
   ConclusionsFamily caregivers of suicidal individuals who attended the psycho-education programme had an increased caring ability and positive attitudes for their suicidal relatives.
   Relevance to clinical practiceNurses could use the two-hour personal suicidal education programme to increase one's ability to care for their relatives who had attempted suicide and promote one's positive attitudes towards attempted suicide.

AB  - Building upon extant research on the reasoned action approach and message sidedness, this study investigates the persuasive effects of one-sided and two-sided social media messages on the attitude about human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in the context of misinformation. Results of a controlled experiment (N = 251) indicated that compared to the control, one-sided messages addressing misinformation increased positive attitude about the vaccine as prior misperceptions increased. However, a backfire effect may be looming for individuals with lower prior misperceptions. Within the sidedness conditions, refutational two-sided messages were more effective in increasing cognitive attitude for individuals with lower misperceptions; whereas one-sided messages had a persuasive advantage for individuals with higher misperceptions. Theoretical and practical contributions are discussed.

KW  - POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION
KW  - MODEL MINORITY

AB  - Background: Prevailing perceptions of Asian Americans as model minorities have long situated this population within postracial discourse, an assumption that highlights their educational success as evidence of the declining significance of race and racism, placing them as models of success for other people of color. Despite evidence to repudiate the model minority thesis, the visibility of Asian Americans in higher education continues to reinforce essentialist paradigms about their presumed success while rendering invisible the educational experiences and diminished educational earning power of low-income, women, and noncitizen Asian populations.
   Purpose: The purpose of this article is to situate the most recent data on the mobility of Asian American students within the K-Ph. D. educational system in the new so-called colorblind postracial America. This article presents the most recent national educational outcomes for Asian Americans by looking at differences in attainment across race, class, gender, citizenship, and educational earning power.
   Research Design: Drawing from the March Supplement of the Census' 2010 Current Population Survey (CPS), we carried out multiple cross-tabulations that allowed us to disaggregate the educational attainment and earning power for Asian Americans across various social categories. The March Supplement of the CPS, referred to as the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC), is given once a year over 3 months-the 2010 ASEC was given to 77,000 households, with a response rate of over 91.5%. This quantitative analysis of the intersectional effect of race, class, gender, and citizenship provides a more nuanced examination of their interactional impact on educational attainment.
   Findings/Results: Our intersectional analysis of educational attainment and earning power reveals the multiplicity of experiences and heterogeneity among Asian Americans. There is a clear positive relationship between class and educational attainment, but the intersectional impact of gender with class, and gender with citizenship points to a nonlinear relationship between these constructs and educational attainment when they are examined together. The data also make evident important gaps in earning power for Asian Americans compared with White Americans, and an especially disproportionate burden of diminished earnings for Asian American women.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: This study sounds the alarm as postracial discourse has created several new challenges on issues related to Asian Americans, affirmative action policies, and the vitality of ethnic studies in the K-Ph.D. system. As a result of this study, the authors warn that the model minority thesis inaccurately depicts Asian Americans in policy discussions on education, race relations, poverty, and civil rights. This article makes important recommendations for coalition building, research approaches, and a new educational policy framework that can mediate current policy failures to include Asian Americans in discussions of equity.

AB  - Although social class was once central to political sociology, it has become increasingly less so; many analysts now believe that one's class position is less important in determining political attitudes and political party preferences. Simultaneously, more attention has been paid to what might be called the culturalization of politics, as epitomized by the US culture wars and stereotypes like the "latte-drinking liberal." Here, political attitudes are regarded as primarily structured by people's lifestyles and broader way of life. But do political preferences have to be explained by either relations of sociomaterial conditions (e.g. class) or cultural orientations (e.g. status and lifestyles)? In this article, we argue in favor of an approach that aims to reconcile these factors, allowing for the empirical mapping of whether and how they intersect in shaping political party preferences. We investigate this by using detailed Norwegian survey data to measure the extent to which intraclass heterogeneity in political party choices can be accounted for by the interaction between class and lifestyle. We employ a novel combination of Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) and Chi-Squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID). In drawing on constructed models of the social space and the space of lifestyles, we show that there are important correspondences between these spaces and that their interaction may help account for party choices. The results highlight the need for a more complex account than that suggested in recent works of cultural stratification research.

AB  - In this study, we examine the role of social trust as an individual and a neighborhood-level determinant for radical right-wing populist party preferences. We argue that high social trust decreases radical right-wing populist party preferences and that this relationship is essentially mediated by negative attitudes toward immigrants. Using data from the Netherlands' Life Course Study, we employ multilevel structural equation modeling to test our argument on support for the Party for Freedom (PVV). The results reveal that individual social trust decreases radical right-wing populist party preferences. Beyond the micro-level relationship, we find that neighborhood social trust decreases radical right-wing populist party preferences. In either case, the effects are mediated by anti-immigrant sentiments. Our findings provide evidence for the importance of social trust as a multilevel construct in explanations for radical right-wing populist party preferences.

AB  - Aims: Opioid substitution therapy (OST) is an evidence-based HIV prevention strategy for people who inject drugs (PWIDs). Yet, only 2.7% of Ukraine's estimated 310,000 PWIDs receive it despite free treatment since 2004. The multi-level barriers to entering OST among opioid-dependent PWIDs have not been examined in Ukraine. Methods: A multi-year mixed methods implementation science project included focus group discussions with 199 PWIDs in five major Ukrainian cities in 2013 covering drug treatment attitudes, beliefs, knowledge and experiences with OST. Data were transcribed, translated into English and coded. Coded segments related to OST access, entry, knowledge, beliefs and attitudes were analyzed among 41 PWIDs who were eligible for but had never received OST. Findings: A number of programmatic and structural barriers were mentioned by participants as barriers to entry to OST, including compulsory drug user registration, waiting lists and limited number of treatment slots. Participants also voiced strong negative attitudes and beliefs about OST, especially methadone. Their perceptions about methadone's side effects as well as the stigma of being a methadone client were expressed as obstacles to treatment. Conclusions: Despite expressed interest in treatment, Ukrainian OST-naive PWIDs evade OST for reasons that can be addressed through changes in program-level and governmental policies and social-marketing campaigns. Voiced OST barriers can effectively inform public health and policy directives related to HIV prevention and treatment in Ukraine to improve evidence-based treatment access and availability.

AB  - Contemporary science and environmental news coverage of global warming increasingly portrays scientific consensus. Political news coverage of global warming, however, typically portrays controversy. We hypothesize that attention to science and environmental news is associated with beliefs more consistent with the global warming science and higher risk perceptions, and that the opposite is true of attention to political news. Furthermore, we hypothesize that science-based beliefs and risk perceptions are positively associated with support for policies aiming at reducing global warming. These hypotheses were confirmed by survey data from a nationally representative sample of adults (N = 2,164). These findings support and extend the cognitive mediation model of news learning and have important practical ramifications.

AB  - This article investigated the effects of attributions that are derived from being aware of interconnectedness in reducing public stigma for people with schizophrenia. The first study tested the mediating role of biogenetic, psychosocial, societal, and personal attributions on the relationship between interconnectedness and social distance from people with schizophrenia. In the second study, an experiment with four conditions was employed to test the incremental effects of societal and personal attributions over biopsychosocial attribution. Study 1 showed interconnectedness is associated with less social distance only through personal attribution. Study 2 found levels of personal advocacy differ between pre- and postexperiment among four conditions across time. Public responsibility at postexperiment mediated the relationship between conditions involving personal attribution and less social distance and greater personal advocacy at 2-week follow-up. These studies highlight the importance of accounting for societal factors and reminding all members of 4 the society their interconnectedness to achieve stigma reduction.

AB  - This study was carried out to assess perceptions and attitudes of key informants towards national food control systems (NFCSs) in developing countries. Two Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries were selected, namely Botswana and Mauritius. The methodology involved qualitative and quantitative techniques. The qualitative method was an in-depth interview of key informants to identify strengths, weaknesses and improvements relating to the NFCSs. The quantitative method involved the use of a 5 point likert scale where key informants were requested to express their level of agreement with attitude statements pertaining to the NFCS. The participants were twenty-two and twenty key informants from Mauritius and Botswana respectively. Specific and common issues emerged from the key informants' evaluation of the NFCS in their respective countries. Strengths, weaknesses and improvements perceived by the majority of key informants in Botswana and Mauritius, were identified. Perceived strengths: regulations are based on international standards; analytical services use internationally recognised methods; participation in international meetings related to food control. Perceived weaknesses: the food laws do not cover primary production; food control laboratories are not accredited; food control administration activities are spread across a number of government ministries with overlapping responsibilities; the lack of code of practice and inspection manuals; implementation of HACCP is not required by the law. Proposed improvements: the law should cover primary production; accreditation of food control laboratories; development of enforcement codes of practice; setting up of a Food Control Agency; the law should make HACCP mandatory. The median of responses to attitude statements revealed common trends in key informants' expressed attitude to most defined NFCS issues. In both countries, most key informants indicated agreement with negative attitude statements and disagreement with positive attitude statements. This research constitutes a starting point for further regional studies to drive harmonisation of NFCSs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A High-Precision Dynamic Six Degree-of-Freedom Pose Measurement of the Subreflectors of Large Antennas Based on a Position Sensitive Detector and Laser Array
T2  - ADVANCES IN ASTRONOMY
LA  - English
AB  - Subreflector misalignment of a large steerable radio telescope induces a pointing error and reduces the gain of the antenna system. To improve the antenna's operational efficiency, it is necessary to measure and adjust the position and attitude of the subreflector in real time. In this paper, a method based on a position sensitive detector (PSD) and laser array without an optical system is proposed to measure the six degree-of-freedom (DOF) poses of the subreflector. The laser emitted by the laser module array ensures that the PSD can be covered as it moves with the subreflector, and the PSD can obtain more than three laser beams. These ensure the measurement of all attitude changes of a large-aperture antenna subreflector. The two-dimensional coordinates of the centroids of three laser spots are extracted using the PSD, and then the bursa model is established to complete the coordinate transformation. Finally, the 6-DOF attitude information of the antenna subreflector is obtained. The results of a 6.05 m measurement simulation show that it can obtain high 6-DOF PSD attitude information. The experimental results show that the 6-DOF position and attitude information of the subreflector at a distance of 5.78 m can be obtained within seconds. Moreover, the error of the translation is within 0.014 mm and the error of the rotation is within 0.37 degrees. This method can meet the pose measurement requirements of the subreflector.

AB  - Background: Continuous nursing education (CNE) courses delivered through e-learning is believed to be an effective mode of learning for nurses. Implementation of e-learning modules requires pre-assessment of infrastructure and learners' characteristics. Understanding the learners' needs and their perspectives would facilitate effective e-learning delivery by addressing the underlying issues and providing necessary support to learners.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to examine access to computer and Internet facilities, interest in and preferences regarding e-leaming, and attitudes toward e-learning among nurses in Peninsular Malaysia.
   Design: The study utilized a cross-sectional descriptive survey.
   Setting: Government hospitals and community clinics in four main regions of Peninsular Malaysia.
   Participants: A total of 300 registered nurses.
   Method: Data were collected using questionnaires, which consisted of demographic and background items and questions on access to computer and Internet facilities, interest and preferences in e-learning, and attitudes toward e-learning. Descriptive analysis and a chi-squared test were used to identify associations between variables.
   Results: Most Malaysian nurses had access to a personal or home computer (85.3%, n = 256) and computer access at work (85.3%, n = 256). The majority had Internet access at home (84%, n = 252) and at work (71.8%, n = 215); however, average hours of weekly computer use were low. Most nurses (83%, n = 249) did not have an e-learning experience but were interested in e-learning activities. Most nurses displayed positive attitudes toward e-learning. Average weekly computer use and interest in e-leaming were positively associated with attitudes toward e-leaming.
   Conclusion: Study findings suggest that organizational support is needed to promote accessibility of information and communications technology (ICT) facilities for Malaysian nurses to motivate their involvement in e-learning. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This research is an attempt to examine the developmental relationship between democracy and the socioeconomic conditions in Bulgaria. The assumption is that one of the factors contributing to the negative attitude towards democracy in Bulgaria is the high level of social inequality. After discussing the relevance of studying democracy and socioeconomic conditions from a developmental perspective, the paper traces the socioeconomic development of Bulgaria from 1989 to date and examines public perceptions of social inequality in the country. The research has not revealed any overall negative public attitude towards democracy in Bulgaria. However, the findings have demonstrated a clear tendency for the public support for democracy to decline reflecting the growth of social inequality.

Results showed that when the environmental issue was framed as global, a fear appeal enhanced viewers' attention, positive attitude toward the green issue, and behavioral intention more than a hope appeal did. The opposite was found when the environmental issue was framed as local. To enhance external validity, Study 2 incorporated actual donation amount and replicated the results found in Study 1. Perspective taking, the act of viewing a situation or understanding of a concept from an alternative point of view, served as an underlying mechanism.

AB  - Popularity has been linked to heightened aggression and fewer depressive symptoms. The current study extends this literature by examining the unique contributions of same-sex and cross-sex popularity to children's development, as well as potential mediating processes. Third-and 4th-graders (212 boys, 250 girls) provided data at 3 time points over 2 school years. Data included peer-reported popularity, social exclusion, friendships, peer victimization, and aggression and self-reported social self-esteem and depressive affect. Same-sex and cross-sex popularity independently contributed to the prediction of aggression and depressive affect. Popularity was associated with heightened aggression through reduced social exclusion and was indirectly related to lower levels of depressive affect through increased friendships. For boys only, same-sex popularity was further associated with dampened depressive affect through reduced social exclusion and peer victimization and increased social self-esteem. Findings are discussed in light of the potential tradeoffs associated with popularity in preadolescence.

KW  - EXCLUSION
AB  - This paper presents the results of a research project aiming to develop a robust empirical model to measure links between transport disadvantage (TD), social exclusion (SE) and well-being (WB). Its principal aim is to improve on current research methods in this field. Existing approaches derive associations between TD and its impacts through simple comparative methods, through qualitative methods and using limited and prescriptive definitions of SE. The new method draws from an interview questionnaire measuring TD through self-reported difficulties with transport. A principal components analysis of responses identifies four statistically significant sub-scales (transit disadvantage, transport disadvantage, vulnerable/impaired and rely on others). SE is represented in five dimensions including income, unemployment, political engagement, participation in activities and social support networks. Well-being adopts standard psychological measures-'Satisfaction With Life Scale' (SWLS), 'Positive Affect' (PA) and 'Negative Affect' (NA). Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to model links between TD, SE and WB. A hypothesised model proposed negative associations between SE and WB and between TD and WB and a positive association between TD and SE. Modelling results showed that scales used to measure TD, SE and WB were all statistically related to their underlying concepts. Modelling of the hypothesised links between constructs was generally favourable with a good statistical fit. However the relationship between TD and WB was not significant. An exploratory analysis supported the hypothesis that this was caused by high reported travel difficulties for both highly mobile and less mobile people. A revised theoretical model explored the theory that feelings of isolation due to time poverty might be mediating the TD-WB link. SEM analysis of the revised model confirmed a good model fit with statistically significant measures between TD, time poverty and WB. Time poverty was not found to be associated with social exclusion. The final model suggested that TD is positively associated with SE with a measured strength of .27. SE is strongly negatively associated with WB (-.87). TD is positively associated with time poverty (.19) while time poverty is negatively associated with well-being (-.14). Areas for future research are identified.

AB  - Background Some U.S. municipalities have proclaimed themselves "sanctuary cities" and/or adopted laws and policies limiting local involvement in enforcement of federal immigration policies. Several states, however, have adopted laws that preempt municipal laws and policies designed to protect immigrants. We explored the consequences of House Bill (H.B.) 318, one such preemption law in North Carolina (NC), on the health and well-being of Latine immigrants. Methods We conducted focus groups with Latine immigrants (n=49) and in-depth interviews with representatives from health, social service, and immigrant-serving organizations and local government (including law enforcement) (n=21) in NC municipalities that, before HB 318, adopted laws and policies supporting immigrants. Data were analyzed using constant comparison. Results Twelve themes emerged, including the positive impacts of municipal sanctuary laws and policies are limited by preemption and other state and federal actions; laws and policies like HB 318 are confusing, have a chilling effect on health services use, and make life harder overall for Latine communities; intensified federal immigration enforcement has increased fear among Latine communities; Trump administration policies worsened anti-immigrant climates; and use of community identification cards and greater information dissemination and inter-organization coordination can lessen the consequences of preemption and other restrictive laws and policies. Conclusion State preemption of protective municipal laws and policies negatively and profoundly affects immigrant health and well-being. However, creative strategies have been implemented to respond to preemption. These findings provide critical data for decision-makers and community leaders regarding the detrimental impacts of preemption laws and mitigation of these impacts.

AB  - Personality's direct effects on various aspects of political attitudes and behavior have received substantial attention, yet few investigate its indirect effects-even though several studies posit that these may be even more important. We utilize original survey data from five European countries (Denmark, Germany, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) to provide a comprehensive, cross-national test of the extent to which personal predispositions have a direct versus indirect impact on public support for the European Union (EU). Knowing that ideology is an important determinant of views towards European integration, we look specifically at the extent to which ideological self-placement mediates the effect of the Big Five personality traits on EU attitudes. We indeed find evidence of significant mediation-most robustly for the traits of openness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability-particularly in contexts where party-system complexity is low. These results reiterate that personality matters-both directly and indirectly-for political attitudes and behavior, confirm that ideology is an important mechanism transferring personality effects forward, and suggest that scholars would do well to further evaluate alternative pathways through which personality's effects travel.

AB  - Aim/Purpose ICT integration into classroom pedagogical practices is considered an essential aspect of learning processes in developed countries but there are issues in developing countries regarding funding, infrastructure, access, and teacher skills and professional learning. This article presents some aspects of the findings of a study in one remote region within a developing country after the implementation of a widescale ICT initiative. This study investigates issues for implementing ICT in schools in relation to teacher and school leader attitudes, access and ICT use, and improvements needed in Papua which is one of the most remote regions of Indonesia. The paper frames these issues within the context of successful online learning initiatives in developing countries and foreign aid implementation literature, with these aspects being under-researched, especially in significantly remote developing country locations.
   Background Developing countries like Indonesia have progressively introduced online learning into school management and classrooms within government planning frameworks and with initial support from foreign aid providers. While there is research available regarding ICT implementation in more urbanized contexts within developing countries, there is a gap in terms of large-scale research which is focused on more remote regions and is supported by foreign aid.
   Methodology Mixed methods including surveys and interviews were used to investigate research questions concerning teachers' and principals' attitudes, ICT access and use, and perceptions about improvements needed. SPSS software was used for surveys and descriptive analysis, and interviews were analysed through manual coding processes.
   Contribution ICT access and e-learning in schools are increasingly becoming relevant in developing country contexts, and this research paper is a preliminary large-scale study that makes a contribution through highlighting issues experienced in more remote locations. This includes specific internet and power issues and transport inaccessibility problems, which highlight the need for locallybased and ongoing coaching of teachers within schools and regions. The paper also draws on the literature about online learning in developing countries and foreign aid towards some possible success directions in isolated contexts, an under-researched area. The importance of education systems establishing ICT skills levels for students integrated across subjects, for well-coordinated planning involving partnerships with hardware and internet providers, as well as the need for school leaders being trained in establishing teacher peer support groups for ongoing coaching, are learnings for Papua and other remote locations from the comparative developing countries literature
   Findings The findings highlight teachers' and school leaders' positive attitudes to ICT in education, although the results indicate that ICT was frequently applied for administrative purposes rather than for teaching and learning. Principals and teachers highlighted some improvements that were needed including systematic training in computer skills and professional learning about the integration of ICT with teaching and learning, especially in relation to pedagogical practices, as well as the need for improved infrastructure and equipment.
   Recommendations for Practitioners The study highlights issues and potential success factors as evident in remote regions of developing countries that have achieved recognition for widescale ICT implementation in schools. This includes issues in relation to policy makers and education authorities working with foreign aid funders. Of significant importance is the need for coordinated and collaborative strategic planning including in relation to sustained professional learning towards studentoriented ICT pedagogies and skilling principals to establish a positive culture and teacher peer coaching. Particularly relevant to developing countries in remote locations is the importance of additionally addressing specific infrastructure and maintenance issues.
   Recommendations for Researchers Regarding ICT and its use for student learning, more research is needed in developing countries and, in particular, in more remote locations where specific issues, differing from those encountered in capital cities, may be evident for teachers and principals.
   Impact on Society Teachers and principals in remote locations of Indonesia such as Papua have generally positive attitudes about the benefits of online learning but need greater ICT access for students in the classroom and also professional development regarding pedagogical practices to support students in learning effectively through online processes.
   Future Research Updated and more detailed comparative research with other developing countries, especially those with remote locations, would be beneficial to more comprehensively identify Papua's current stage of development and to design appropriate future interventions.

AB  - Background COVID-19 caused by a new form of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first appeared in China end of 2019 and quickly spread to all counties of the world. To slow down the spread of the virus and to limit the pressure on the health care systems, different regulations and recommendations have been implemented by authorities, comprising amongst others the closure of all entertainment venues and social distancing. These measures have received mixed reactions, particularly from young individuals, with many not following available advice. Drawing on the information in social media discussion forums, the present study explores the reasons why people ignore the orders and recommendations of the authorities and why the authorities are unable to produce a shared sense of inclusion concerning protective measures against the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods Three open-access social media forums (Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube comments) were systematically searched with respect to COVID-19-related beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours of individuals. The data was retrieved in the first 3 weeks of March 2020. Qualitative document analysis and qualitative content analysis were used as the methodical approach. The data was reviewed by all authors and jointly interpreted to minimise inconsistencies. Results The study reveals that reasons such as information pollution on social media, the persistence of uncertainty about the rapidly spreading virus, the impact of the social environment on the individual, and fear of unemployment associated with inequality in the distribution of income lead people to ignore the orders and recommendations of the authorities. The findings suggest that government representatives and politicians could not produce a shared sense of inclusion concerning protective measures against the COVID-19 outbreak, due to not building trust among the public and taking concrete economic steps to satisfy them. Conclusion In uncertain crises, transparency in the presentation of information and government policies emerge as influential determinants in creating social susceptibility and solidarity. The differences between social classes constitute one of the important factors that affect the decision-making mechanisms of individuals in determining the necessary steps to be undertaken in times of crisis.

AB  - Stigma in mental illness is a problem fueled by misrepresentation by the media and the assimilation of parent opinion, noted in those as young as six years old. Intervening in adolescence is critical given juxtaposition of increased judgement/fear of judgement and the onset of serious mental illness. This paper details the efforts of an intervention designed to specifically target the perception of dangerousness, social distancing, and use of stigmatizing language. A total of 124 high school freshman participated in the interactive presentation delivered over the course of a typical 40 min class period. An identical survey with a 5-point Likert scale was administered before and after to measure level of agreement with stigmatizing statements. Most participants reported prior exposure through the media (86.6%) and through conversations with family/friends (67.7%). Post intervention, improvement was seen in the perception of dangerousness (MD = 0.45, t = 4.435, p = <0.001), the need for social distancing (measure 1: MD = 0.148, t = 1.785, p = 0.039; measure 2: MD = 0.142, t = 1.773, p = 0.04), and understanding of the experience of those with serious mental illness (MD = 0.377, t = 3.378, p = <0.001). No significant difference was seen in terms of stigmatizing language use (MD = 0.114, t = 1.192, p = 0.118). This study supports the delivery of anti-stigma education to adolescents that avoids the biogenetic and contact approaches, embraces the continuum model of mental health, normalizes psychotic experiences, addresses dangerousness with data, identifies prominent figures with mental illness, and uses personalized statistics to demonstrate why this topic is of importance.

AB  - Objective: 40 - 50% of cancer patients use complementary or alternative medicine (CAM). While oncologists are skeptical regarding CAM, no data has been published with respect to nurses. The objective of our study was to learn about the attitude of nurses with a specialization in cancer care towards CAM. Subjects and methods: A survey was performed on nurses in Germany, Switzerland and Austria using an online questionnaire, which addressed attitude towards, and experiences with CAM. Results: 877 participants filled in the questionnaire. 61% have a very positive or positive attitude towards complementary (CM) and 20% towards alternative medicine (AM). 71% rate their knowledge as high to moderate regarding CM. 43% use some source of information on CAM and 48% would like more training on CAM. The most important reason to use CM is the patient becoming active (50%). CM is a means for reducing side effects (46%), increasing coping (42%), or quality of life (47%). For AM, less than 20% give positive statements. Risks as a result of interactions and side effects are anticipated by 40 (CM) and 50% (AM). Conclusion: In sum, many but not all participants are aware of the pros and cons of CAM. In general, they have a positive attitude towards CM. In order to make CM safer, a structured training should be offered.

KW  - Teacher Education
AB  - The rapid development of computer technology has led to the use of fuzzy set theory in the medical, financial, economic, commercial and other fields as one of the basic components of artificial intelligence. This is due to its universal mechanism designed to analyze research in the field of humanities research. The mathematical apparatus of fuzzy set theory allows them to be performed with unformalized data, and the development and improvement of information and communication technologies make it possible to automate this process. Unformalized, abstract, "blurred" statistics, which are difficult to analyze, are also common in pedagogy. But in pedagogical practice, fuzzy logic has not been widely used. The article proves the importance and expediency of teaching students, future teachers of computer science, skills in the application of fuzzy set theory. The ability to use the mechanisms of fuzzy logic in applied programs will allow future teachers in their further pedagogical activities to conduct multi-criteria analysis of various characteristics of their students, analysis of pedagogical methods, comprehensive assessment of competencies and more.
   The article presents the experience of teaching fuzzy set theory, the logic of teaching and its sequence, as well as the results of such training at a pedagogical university. The necessity of the step-by-step study of fuzzy set theory is proved - from acquaintance with its basic concepts, giving examples of its application in expert systems, neural networks and artificial intelligence systems to independent construction of fuzzy knowledge representation model, development of linguistic variables and use of spreadsheet or specialized programs. The results of the experimental introduction of the topic "Fuzzy model of knowledge representation" in a training course of computer disciplines are shown. Examination of learning outcomes reveals a positive attitude of the students toward mastering the skills of using fuzzy set theory and willingness to apply it in their further pedagogical activities.

AB  - This study examines the effects of the interaction between regulatory focus frames and self-construal (i.e., regulatory fit effects), and the mediating effects of involvement on responses to advertising messages that promote recycling. The results show that promotion-focused frames generate more positive attitudes and behavioral intentions in individuals with interdependent self-construal, whereas there was no differential framing effect in individuals with independent self-construal. The findings demonstrate a unique pattern of regulatory fit effects, also mediated by involvement with the recycling issues, in the context of environmental appeals. This study contributes to the findings of regulatory goal compatibility by investigating the effects of regulatory focus, self-construal, and involvement interplay in the context of recycling advertising campaign. Theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed.

AB  - The objective of the research was to obtain data on the attitudes of the future generation of teachers towards using new media in their didactic and educational activities. Additionally, the text presents the level of these teachers' self-evaluation regarding the use of new ICT-based devices. Indicators of both variables are compared. The research was conducted in the biggest Polish pedagogical university, using a sample of 450 students. The technique used was the diagnostic survey. The data were collected in the first half of 2019 as part of the international project SELI. Based on the data obtained, it was noticed that pre-service teachers do not form a homogeneous group, which means there are individuals presenting a very positive attitudes towards the introduction of new media as well as those who are careful when it comes to using ICT in teaching. Most respondents emphasize that using ICT in education is necessary and that this trend is irreversible. There is a minor group of future teachers who do not know about websites and software to support learning and teaching (about 10%). Almost half of the respondents present divided views regarding the role of ICT in stimulating engagement, motivation and interest among students. However, it should also be noted that almost half of the interviewees state that the use of smartphones at school should be banned. A positive attitude to new technologies in one area coincides with a high opinion about ICT in other areas. The self-evaluation of the teachers' own competencies is also internally coherent, meaning that respondents who declared that they had no problems with using, for example, new devices, also have no problems with using new websites or software.

AB  - All over the world, people are prevented from participating fully in society through mechanisms that go beyond the structural and institutional barriers that rational choice theory identifies (-poverty, exclusion by law or force, taste-based or statistical discrimination, and externalities from social networks differentiated by socioeconomic status). This paper discusses four additional mechanisms that can be explained by bounded rationality: (a) implicit discrimination, (b) self-stereotyping and self-censorship, (c) rules of thumb adapted to disadvantaged environments that are dysfunctional in more privileged settings, and (d) "adaptive preferences," in which an excluded group comes to view its exclusion as natural. Institutions, if they are stable, come to have cognitive foundations---concepts, categories, social identities, and worldviews---through which people mediate their perceptions of themselves and the world around them. Abolishing or reforming a discriminatory institution may have little effect on the social categories it created; groups previously discriminated against by law may remain excluded through custom and habits of the mind. Recognizing new forces of social exclusion, behavioral economics identifies ways to offset them. Some interventions have had very consequential impacts.

AB  - Prior research on public attitudes towards the police has tended to refer to three concepts-satisfaction with the police, confidence in the police, and trust in the police-entirely interchangeably. Recently, there has been a call to differentiate these three concepts. The current study seeks to address this research gap by analysing a unique Canadian dataset that includes all three concepts. The main research question that the study tries to answer is whether significant co-variates will differ in predicting the three concepts. The findings indicate that different models have slightly different demographic co-variates, but they share three of the same co-variates: dissatisfaction with prior citizen-police contacts, victimization, and neighbourhood conditions. The study suggests that while differentiating these three concepts may be promising, it is important, efficient, and practical to handle the three shared co-variates to improve overall public attitudes towards the police.

AB  - Background Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) endure healthcare biases that are partially due to a lack of disease-specific education among healthcare providers. Furthermore, there is a paucity of age-appropriate health education materials for patients with SCD. To address this gap, we created the GRAPES tool (Game to Raise Awareness for Patient/Provider/Public Education of SCD; ) and hypothesized that utilization of the GRAPES tool will improve patient and provider SCD knowledge and mitigate healthcare bias. Procedure The GRAPES tool is an online, single-player trivia game. A feasibility study was conducted in pediatric patients with SCD at age 10 years or older and registered nurses. All participants were assessed for change in SCD-relevant knowledge and satisfaction post-gameplay. Providers were assessed for change in attitudes toward patients with SCD post-gameplay. Results Twenty-five patients and 25 providers were enrolled. All participants (P < 0.001), and specifically within the patient (P = 0.019) and provider (P < 0.001) cohorts, showed increased SCD knowledge post-gameplay. Both patients and providers reported high satisfaction with GRAPES. Provider negative attitudes were reduced (P = 0.007) post-gameplay without change in positive attitudes (P = 0.959). Providers demonstrated post-gameplay reduced (P = 0.001) belief that patients' changing behavior around providers indicates inappropriate drug-seeking behavior. Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of the GRAPES tool as a potential digital, behavioral intervention to provide educational materials for patients and their providers in different clinical settings, improve knowledge about SCD, and decrease stigma against patients with SCD in the healthcare setting.

AB  - Background: The establishment of a functional information system for human resource for health (HRH) was one of the major challenges for the Tanzanian health sector. In 2008, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare developed the HRH Strategic Plan, in which establishment of computerized information systems were one of the strategic objectives. In response to this objective, the Ministry developed two information systems, namely the Human Resource for Health Information System (HRHIS) and the Training Institution Information System (TIIS), to capture information from both the public and private sectors.
   Case description: The national rollout of HRHIS and TIIS was carried out in four phases during a 6 year period between 2009 and 2014. Together with other activities, the rollout process included conducting system operation training and data utilization training for evidence-based planning, development and management of HRH and social welfare workers and health training institutions.
   Discussion: HRHIS was rolled out in all 25 regions of the Tanzanian mainland, including 171 districts, and TIIS was rolled out in all 154 health training institutions and universities. Information is captured from both the private and public health sectors with high-data coverage. The authors identified several key factors for the achievements such as using local experts for developing the systems, involvement of system users, positive attitudes among users, focusing on routine work of the system users and provision of operations and data utilization trainings. However, several challenges were also identified such as getting a consensus on sustainable HR information systems among stakeholders, difficulty in obtaining baseline HRH information, inadequate computer skills and unsatisfactory infrastructure for information and communication technology. We learned that detailed situation analysis and understanding of the reality on the ground helped to reduce the "design-reality gap" and contributed to establishing user-friendly systems and to improve sustainability of the systems.
   Conclusions: This paper illustrates the successful development and national rollout of two information systems for HRH in Tanzania. The approaches used and activities conducted here and lessons learned could be useful for countries which are planning to establish HR information systems.

AB  - Background: Health authorities can minimize the impact of an emergent infectious disease outbreak through effective and timely risk communication, which can build trust and adherence to subsequent behavioral messaging. Monitoring the psychological impacts of an outbreak, as well as public adherence to such messaging, is also important for minimizing long-term effects of an outbreak.
   Objective: We used social media data from Twitter to identify human behaviors relevant to COVID-19 transmission, as well as the perceived impacts of COVID-19 on individuals, as a first step toward real-time monitoring of public perceptions to inform public health communications.
   Methods: We developed a coding schema for 6 categories and 11 subcategories, which included both a wide number of behaviors as well codes focused on the impacts of the pandemic (eg, economic and mental health impacts). We used this to develop training data and develop supervised learning classifiers for classes with sufficient labels. Classifiers that performed adequately were applied to our remaining corpus, and temporal and geospatial trends were assessed. We compared the classified patterns to ground truth mobility data and actual COVID-19 confirmed cases to assess the signal achieved here.
   Results: We applied our labeling schema to approximately 7200 tweets. The worst-performing classifiers had F1 scores of only 0.18 to 0.28 when trying to identify tweets about monitoring symptoms and testing. Classifiers about social distancing, however, were much stronger, with F1 scores of 0.64 to 0.66. We applied the social distancing classifiers to over 228 million tweets. We showed temporal patterns consistent with real-world events, and we showed correlations of up to -0.5 between social distancing signals on Twitter and ground truth mobility throughout the United States.
   Conclusions: Behaviors discussed on Twitter are exceptionally varied. Twitter can provide useful information for parameterizing models that incorporate human behavior, as well as for informing public health communication strategies by describing awareness of and compliance with suggested behaviors.

AB  - The rapid spread of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants combined with slowing pace of vaccination in Fall 2021 created uncertainty around the future trajectory of the epidemic in King County, Washington, USA. We analyzed the benefits of offering vaccination to children ages 5- 11 and expanding the overall vaccination coverage using mathematical modeling. We adapted a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, calibrated to data from King County, Washington, to simulate scenarios of vaccinating children aged 5-11 with different starting dates and different proportions of physical interactions (PPI) in schools being restored. Dynamic social distancing was implemented in response to changes in weekly hospitalizations. Reduction of hospitalizations and estimated time under additional social distancing measures are reported over the 2021-2022 school year. In the scenario with 85% vaccination coverage of 12+ year-olds, offering early vaccination to children aged 5-11 with 75% PPI was predicted to prevent 756 (median, IQR 301-1434) hospitalizations cutting youth hospitalizations in half compared to no vaccination and largely reducing the need for additional social distancing measures over the school year. If, in addition, 90% overall vaccination coverage was reached, 60% of remaining hospitalizations would be averted and the need for increased social distancing would almost certainly be avoided. Our work suggests that uninterrupted in-person schooling in King County was partly possible because reasonable precaution measures were taken at schools to reduce infectious contacts. Rapid vaccination of all school-aged children provides meaningful reduction of the COVID-19 health burden over this school year but only if implemented early. It remains critical to vaccinate as many people as possible to limit the morbidity and mortality associated with future epidemic waves.

AB  - Smart cities integrate a wide variety of technologies and support those innovations capable of delivering sustainable socio-economic development of cities. They are complex environments that are shaped by their innovation capacity, information and communication technologies (ICTs) development and adoption, living standards, residents' readiness, and, last but not least, the willingness to invest. Higher urbanization rates and "mega-cities" with 10 million inhabitants or more make difficult to create a sustainable and cost-effective environment and a high quality of life for the citizens. To overcome this shortcoming, the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are needed to increase ICTs solutions and implicitly, to augment the cities competitiveness. Our paper objective is to analyse the public attitude regarding the influence of AI on smart cities characteristics and to identify if there are significant differences in their perspective by gender and by age group. The statistical data analysis was performed using two-way measure analysis of variance (ANOVA). The differences between groups were analysed using inferential statistics. This paper contributes to the understanding of the importance of AI techniques in improving urban living.

AB  - Three experiments address how people react to a sexual abuse victim compared to a nonvictim when a justification for negative evaluation is available or not available. A harm-doing victim was rated lower on expected job performance and higher on desired social distance than a harm-doing nonvictim. When subsequent harm-doing was absent, judgments of a victim and nonvictim did not differ on expected job performance or social distance. Experiment 2 replicated the results of Experiment 1 and revealed that the order in which victimization history and harm-doing information were presented had no effect. Experiment 3 showed that participants desired greater social distance from a harm-doing victim compared to a non-harm-doing victim to the extent they thought the target should have derived benefits from the childhood victimization. Implications for judgments of harm-doers-depending on whether their victimization history is known or not-are considered.

AB  - Introduction Suicide is the 9th leading cause of death in Canada, and a common reason for patients to present to Canadian emergency departments (ED). Little knowledge exists around Canadian emergency physicians (EPs) attitudes toward and understanding of individuals with suicidal ideation. Methods We developed a web-based survey on suicide knowledge, which was pilot tested by two EPs and one psychiatrist for clarity and content. The survey was distributed via email to attending physician members of the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians. Data were described using counts, means, medians and interquartile ranges. The Understanding of Suicidal Patients (USP) Scale is an 11-point questionnaire to assess healthcare providers' attitudes toward individuals with suicidal ideation. Other questions pertaining to suicidal ideation, self-perceptions on ability to treat suicidal patients, and personal experiences with suicide were asked in Likert format. Results One hundred eighty-eight Canadian EPs responded to the survey (15% response rate), with a median age of 49 (IQR 39-55), academic practice reported by 55% of respondents, and 65% of respondents identified as male. The mean USP score was 21.8 (95% CI 21.1-22.5), which indicates a generally positive attitude and willingness to provide care for suicidal patients. Only 17% of respondents had participated in specific training for treatment of suicidal patients in the last five years, while the majority of respondents estimate treating 5-15 patients with suicidal ideation a month. Sixty four percent of respondents indicated they had the skills to screen patients for suicidal ideation, but less than one-third felt they could create a personalized safety plan for patients. Conclusions Respondents have a generally positive attitude toward treating individuals with suicidal ideation. Respondents scored highly on the USP scale that measured willingness to provide care for and empathize with suicidal patients. Respondents felt they had the skills to adequately screen patients for suicidal ideation. Key gaps in knowledge were identified suggesting improved residency and ongoing medical education opportunities are needed to better improve care for this vulnerable population.

AB  - The management of natural resources has become a crucial agenda item at the community level of every country, due to the importance of a community's direct involvement in the stewardship of these resources. The sustainable management of natural resources is not easy without the involvement of the community. To know the attitudes of residents in the communities in close proximity to Central Karakoram National Park (CKNP) towards natural resource sustainable management policy, a study of CKNP in northern Pakistan was conducted. This is the first community study for this park. It is difficult to overstate the economic and geographic importance of this national resource to the Pakistani people at local and national levels, as well as at the international level. This is the world's highest public park; as a natural resource it is not only important to the local community, it also has great relevance internationally. The study attempted to gauge the attitudes of the local community towards the sustainable management practices of CKNP. The results of this study showed generally positive attitudes towards the park. The majority of respondents revealed that the park's primary appeal is its geographic location. Households were afraid that pollution in the park will gradually destroy the park's natural resources. For sustainable management of the CKNP, community members expressed willingness to contribute to the betterment of park through volunteerism. Community members praised the government's supportive actions, including budgetary support and public-awareness campaigns. As such, the positive attitude of the community towards the CKNP also revealed new insights for the community-centered sustainable management of natural resources in developing countries. This study also provides a research gap for future work relating to the sustainable management of community-based natural resources to consider more factors beside the factors used in this study.

AB  - By analyzing variability in credibility assessments of news outlets CNN and FOX, this study extends prior research focusing on perceptions of credibility for a single media source. Using national survey data from 2006 and 2008, we find that demographic and political characteristics help to explain different patterns of perceived credibility. Those detecting larger differences between CNN and FOX are more politically knowledgeable and hold more polarized political attitudes. Some findings coincide with research on overall news media trust. Yet other findings demonstrate the importance of considering different patterns. Liberal Democrats were more likely than conservative Republicans to find neither network particularly credible, for example. We also examine the connection between selective exposure and credibility. We find evidence that credibility perceptions for both networks mediate the relationship between political predispositions and cable news use.

AB  - BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, many humorous videos on how to practice social distancing appeared on social media. However, the effect of using humor as a crisis communication strategy to persuade people to conform to social distancing rules is not known. ObjectiveDrawing on the literature on humorous message framing and crisis communication, this research explores the effectiveness of a humorous message in communicating social distancing rules in two crisis severity phases (low vs. high severity) and also evaluates how humor affects individuals' online and offline engagement intentions during the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsA 2 (message framing: humorous vs. non-humorous) x 2 (crisis severity phase: low vs. high) between-subjects design experiment was conducted to test the research questions during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in China from January 30 to February 2, 2020. ResultsThe results showed that the severity of the phase of a health crisis can significantly affect stakeholders' online and offline responses toward the disease. More specifically, in a low severity phase, humor led to increased source likability for the message, and more online and offline engagement intentions. However, no differences between a humorous and non-humorous message in perceived risk were observed. Whereas, in a high severity crisis phase, humor reduced individuals' offline engagement intentions and a decrease in perceived risk, no significant difference was found between a humorous and non-humorous message on source likeability. ConclusionHumor can motivate both more online engagement and offline protective action intention when the crisis severity phase is low, while when crisis severity soars, a non-humorous message should be more desirable. More specifically, using humor in communicating information about an infectious disease can enhance the spokesperson's likeability in a low severity phase, and also helps to spread health information to a larger audience. While, the negative side of using humor in communicating an infectious disease appears in severe crisis phases, as it then decreased the public's perception of risk, and triggers less protective actions. Going beyond previous research, this study recognized that crisis severity changes in different phases of the spread of infectious disease, thereby providing actionable strategy selections for crisis practitioners in a dynamic communication environment.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to worldwide implementation of unprecedented restrictions to control its rapid spread and mitigate its impact. The Spanish government has enforced social distancing, quarantine, and home confinement measures. Such restrictions on activities of daily life and separation from loved ones may lead to social isolation and loneliness with health-related consequences among community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and their caregivers. Additionally, inadequate access to health care and social support services may aggravate chronic conditions. Home-based technological interventions have emerged for combating social isolation and loneliness, while simultaneously preventing the risk of virus exposure.
   Objective: The aim of this cohort study is to explore, analyze, and determine the impact of social isolation on (1) cognition, quality of life, mood, technophilia, and perceived stress among community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and on the caregiver burden; (2) access to and utilization of health and social care services; and (3) cognitive, social, and entertainment-related uses of information and communication technologies.
   Methods: This study will be conducted in Malaga (Andalucia, Spain). In total 200 dyads, consisting of a person with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and his/her informal caregiver, will be contacted by telephone. Potential respondents will be participants of the following clinical trials: support, monitoring, and reminder technology for mild dementia (n=100) and television-based assistive integrated service to support European adults living with mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment (n=100).
   Results: As of May 2021, a total of 153 participants have been enrolled and assessed during COVID-19 confinement, of whom 67 have been assessed at 6 months of enrollment. Changes in the mean values of the variables will be analyzed relative to baseline findings of previous studies with those during and after confinement, using repeated-measures analysis of variance or the nonparametric Friedman test, as appropriate. The performance of multivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to introduce potential covariates will also be considered. Values of 95% CI will be used.
   Conclusions: If our hypothesis is accepted, these findings will demonstrate the negative impact of social isolation owing to COVID-19 confinement on cognition, quality of life, mood, and perceived stress among community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia, the impact on technophilia, caregiver burden, the access to and utilization of health and social care services, and the cognitive, social, and entertainment-related use of information and communication technologies during and after COVID-19 confinement.

AB  - The study examines how program-induced mood and a five-second countdown warning affect reception of midroll video commercials. Building on mood regulation theory, findings from three studies suggest that program-induced moods and five-second countdowns systematically influence advertising effectiveness. When the main program is tragic (comedic) and when a countdown precedes (does not precede) the midroll ad, viewers have more positive attitudes toward the ad and purchase intentions. The findings are replicated in realistic (Study 1) and controlled (Studies 2A and 2B) settings.

AB  - The present study aimed to understand how status-oriented individual differences such as narcissistic antagonism, narcissistic extraversion, and moral grandstanding motivations may have longitudinally predicted both behavioral and social media responses during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Via YouGov, a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults was recruited in August of 2019 (N = 2,519; M-age = 47.5, SD = 17.8; 51.4% women) and resampled in May of 2020, (N = 1,533). Results indicated that baseline levels of narcissistic antagonism were associated with lower levels of social distancing and lower compliance with public health recommended behaviors. Similarly, dominance oriented moral grandstanding motivations predicted greater conflict with others over COVID-19, greater engagement in status-oriented social media behaviors about COVID-19, and lower levels of social distancing.

AB  - Background: The article addresses the issue of attitudes towards safety at work in the context of subjective variables such as psychological stress and the subjective self-efficacy of workers in the aviation sector. The research was exploratory in nature. It focused on capturing the individual experiences of ground handling staff at Polish and Slovak airports. Among the 326 people surveyed were engineers, firefighters, mechanics and electricians - a crew that works in difficult and threatening working conditions on a daily basis, often experiencing unexpected accidents and breakdowns. The psychosocial factors in industry 4.0 and this branch of industry itself are - according to the authors - verified empirically quite poorly. Taking care of safety at work and strengthening a positive attitude towards safety seems to be a key aspect of management in such units. Material and Methods: The Polish Questionnaire of Attitude towards Safety by M. Znajmiecka-Sikora, the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale and the Plopa and Makarowski Stress Feeling Questionnaire were used in the research. Results: The statistical analyses carried out, including regression analyses and a model of analysis of mediation between variables, have indicated that this sense of effectiveness is a key positive predictor of every aspect related to strengthening attitudes towards safety (a cognitive aspect [beta = 0.21, p < 0.001], an affective aspect [beta = 0.15, p = 0.001] and a behavioral aspect [beta = 0.15, p = 0.002]), as well as the overall level of attitude towards safety (beta = 0.19, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The sense of effectiveness is an important mediator between the level of perceived stress and attitudes towards safety, which means that as the subjectively perceived sense of self-efficacy increases, the level of experienced stress decreases and thus the positive attitude towards safe actions and behaviors in the workplace is strengthened.

AB  - Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in healthcare. Here, AI-based chatbot systems can act as automated conversational agents, capable of promoting health, providing education, and potentially prompting behaviour change. Exploring the motivation to use health chatbots is required to predict uptake; however, few studies to date have explored their acceptability. This research aimed to explore participants' willingness to engage with AI-led health chatbots. Methods The study incorporated semi-structured interviews (N-29) which informed the development of an online survey (N-216) advertised via social media. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. A survey of 24 items explored demographic and attitudinal variables, including acceptability and perceived utility. The quantitative data were analysed using binary regressions with a single categorical predictor. Results Three broad themes: 'Understanding of chatbots', 'AI hesitancy' and 'Motivations for health chatbots' were identified, outlining concerns about accuracy, cyber-security, and the inability of AI-led services to empathise. The survey showed moderate acceptability (67%), correlated negatively with perceived poorer IT skills OR = 0.32 [CI95%:0.13-0.78] and dislike for talking to computers OR = 0.77 [CI95%:0.60-0.99] as well as positively correlated with perceived utility OR = 5.10 [CI95%:3.08-8.43], positive attitude OR = 2.71 [CI95%:1.77-4.16] and perceived trustworthiness OR = 1.92 [CI95%:1.13-3.25]. Conclusion Most internet users would be receptive to using health chatbots, although hesitancy regarding this technology is likely to compromise engagement. Intervention designers focusing on AI-led health chatbots need to employ user-centred and theory-based approaches addressing patients' concerns and optimising user experience in order to achieve the best uptake and utilisation. Patients' perspectives, motivation and capabilities need to be taken into account when developing and assessing the effectiveness of health chatbots.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the role of socio-political attitudes and motivational tendencies supposed to mark closed-mindedness, as well as other relevant variables of individual differences (Disintegration, i.e., proneness to psychotic-like experiences/behaviors and Death Anxiety), in the Militant Extremist Mindset (MEM). A community sample of 600 young respondents (Serbs, Bosniaks, and Albanians, aged 18-30) was recruited within a multiethnic region of Serbia that experienced armed conflict during the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. The best-fitted SEM model, incorporating measurement and structural relationships between the variables, showed that the latent factor of Closed-mindedness predicted all three aspects of MEM as well as Neighborhood Grudge, that is, resentment toward neighboring ethnicities. The effects of Disintegration and Death Anxiety on MEM were entirely mediated by Closed-mindedness. Compared to previous findings, Closed-mindedness appears to represent the most important set of cognitive and motivational tendencies that channel protracted intergroup tensions into militant extremism.

AB  - Energy efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and comfort in public buildings has received increasing attention in recent years as it can contribute to maintaining safety conditions and to the reduction of conventional fuels consumption, energy costs for building owners, and greenhouse gas emissions. People are an integral part of any building energetic ecosystem as, according to some estimates, they spend a great part of their life in indoor spaces. On one side, occupants are responsible for the energy consumption of the building and for this reason the "psychology of energy saving" has received attention since the 70s up to recent results. On the other hand, strategies for energy efficiency should not jeopardize occupants' health and quality of life. While general awareness of the value of environmental variables has increased in the last few years, this interest has recently been further exacerbated by the spreading of the well-known COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, as most countries have started planning post-lock-down activities, there is a growing concern regarding how social distancing measures can be enforced in shared buildings and strict indoor air quality control can prevent airborne virus transmission in crowded spaces. The paper discusses the perspectives of increasing the level of social interaction of building users through the systematic use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), and in particular, some specific platforms. The ICT system, taking information from the occupants in a concerted way, can be an important instrument to collect data, coming both from physical sensors and from people to develop a multi-objective control strategy for the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Cooling (HVAC) systems in order to obtain energy savings whilst balancing user comfort and healthy conditions.

AB  - Background: Knowledge and positive attitude toward vitiligo would foster support for affected individuals, improving their sense of well-being and possibly treatment outcome. Purpose: To evaluate the levels of public knowledge and attitude toward vitiligo among Saudis. Methods:A cross-sectional study among 12,181 participants. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire enquiring about knowledge, attitude, and perceptions in vitiligo. Results: The response rate was 95.4%. Most respondents had heard about vitiligo (96.9%). The median knowledge score was four out of eight and median attitude score was six out of eight. Social media/Internet was the most commonly reported source of information (34.7%), followed by family/friends/acquaintances (30%). Higher proportions of correct responses were recorded regarding the noninfectious nature of vitiligo (85.0%) and whether vitiligo was dangerous or connected to skin cancer (63.4%). However, unsatisfactory responses were found regarding the immunological basis of the condition: only 24.3% knew that vitiligo was an immune disease and 24.5% knew about the role of heredity in vitiligo. The majority of respondents did not mind employing patients with vitiligo (89.0%). Only 40.6% responded that they would many someone with vitiligo. Positive attitude was significantly common in respondents aged 31-50 years (P < 0.01), women (P < 0.01), and those who had a university degree or higher (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Although overall attitude toward vitiligo patients was positive, there were gaps in the knowledge, particularly regarding the nature of the disease. More awareness and education are required to improve attitude toward vitiligo patients, with an aim to improve their overall well-being.

AB  - Prejudice towards trans women is an under-examined but a critical social problem in Turkey. Patriarchal femininity sanctions women who do not comply with the idealised female bodies and feminine norms. On the other hand, ideals of hegemonic masculinity necessitate that men avoid femininity. In that sense, prejudice against trans women ostensibly stands at the intersection of hegemonic masculinity ideology and femininities that diverge from patriarchal feminine norms. Therefore, this study examines the mediatory effect of femmephobia in the link between masculinity ideology and prejudice towards trans women as measured by negative affect and social distancing motivations. Results indicate that femmephobia significantly mediates the relationship between the endorsement of masculinity ideology and prejudice towards trans women. Among three mandates of masculinity ideology, the endorsement of the antifemininity mandate was the most solid indirect predictor of negative affect and social distance through femmephobia, followed by mandates of toughness and status, respectively. Although participant gender does not have an indirect effect on the outcome variables, it has a direct effect on men's social distancing intentions but not on negative emotions. The results are discussed in the light of existing literature which intersects with the devaluation of femininity.

AB  - Companies often seek to persuade consumers to buy products or services through assertive advertising, but such advertising is often resisted by consumers. In order to identify ways to increase consumers' preference for assertive advertising, this study starts by considering consumers' anxiety and finds, through two between-group experiments, that the emotional state of consumers when viewing advertisements affects their attitudes toward assertive advertisements: anxious consumers have a more positive attitudes toward assertive advertisement, and cognitive fluency plays a mediating role in the relationship between consumer anxiety and consumer attitudes toward assertive advertisement. This study incorporates consumer anxiety into the study of assertive advertising, thus both enriching the theoretical research on assertive advertising and consumer anxiety and providing novel ideas for companies to enhance the effectiveness of their assertive advertising strategies.

AB  - Objectives Pediatric transplant recipients may be at increased risk of developing serious infections due to COVID-19. We undertook a web-based survey among parents of post-liver transplant pediatric patients to assess knowledge and concerns regarding COVID-19 pandemic and impact of social media on them. Methods This cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March 21 and March 26, 2020. A 19-item questionnaire was sent to 172 parents of post-liver transplant children. Results 106 (62%) of parents responded. Median time since transplant was 31 (12-52) months. The majority of parents had good understanding regarding symptomatology and routes of transmission. Only 27% were aware of feco-oral transmission, and 34% knew about gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19. 100% of parents understood concept of social distancing, and 70% knew that asymptomatic individuals can transmit the virus. Television followed by newspapers was the main source of their information, though over 40% claim to regularly receive information through social media. 87% would consult their doctor if the child had flu-like symptoms rather than modify immunosuppression or try alternative medications. Parental concerns mainly revolved around early recognition of symptoms, queries on unconventional treatments circulating over social media, and supply of medications during the lockdown period. Conclusions The majority of parents had basic understanding of COVID-19 pandemic. Social media appeared to be an important source of information. Results from this survey helped us in modifying patient care protocols to ensure continuity of care while maintaining social distancing.

AB  - Experiments on economic games typically fail to find positive reputational effects of using peer punishment of selfish behavior in social dilemmas. Theorists had expected positive reputational effects because of the potentially beneficial consequences that punishment may have on norm violators' behavior. Going beyond the game-theoretic paradigm, we used vignettes to study how various social factors influence approval ratings of a peer who reprimands a violator of a group-beneficial norm. We found that ratings declined when punishers showed anger, and this effect was mediated by perceived aggressiveness. Thus the same emotions that motivate peer punishers may make them come across as aggressive, to the detriment of their reputation. However, the negative effect of showing anger disappeared when the norm violation was sufficiently severe. Ratings of punishers were also influenced by social distance, such that it is less appropriate for a stranger than a friend to reprimand a violator. In sum, peer punisher ratings were very high for a friend reprimanding a severe norm violation, but particularly poor for a stranger showing anger at a mild norm violation. We found no effect on ratings of whether the reprimand had the beneficial consequence of changing the violator's behavior. Our findings provide insight into how peer punishers can avoid negative reputational effects. They also point to the importance of going beyond economic games when studying peer punishment.

Participants included 227 adults living in the United States who completed a web-based survey between 23 May 2020 and 25 August 2020. Results indicated that increased EMA was related to less distress and that meaning in life (MIL), but not social distancing stress, mediated this relationship. Our findings highlight the benefits of EMA in the context of a pandemic, and suggest that interventions that promote EMA may reduce distress by enhancing MIL.

AB  - This study aims to investigate how daily activities affect mood in the context of social distancing guidelines enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) administered four times a day during a 2-week period, we asked participants (N = 91) about their mood and the activities they engaged in. Seven individuals were selected for a follow-up, open-ended questionnaire. Results show that a stable routine, including physical exercise, hobbies, regular sleep hours, and minimal time spent in front of the computer, helps maintain a good mood. Coping strategies such as planning and scheduling help keep routines and circadian rhythms stable. Face-to-face contact is associated with a more positive mood, while similar interaction through electronic communication has a less positive effect. We observe an effect related to the infodemic phenomenon: Daily reports on COVID-19 cases and deaths affect mood fluctuations. This is an important consideration in shaping public information policies.

KW  - PRIVACY
AB  - This article draws on researcher vignettes to explore ethical decisions made in the process of collecting and analysing mobile messaging data as part of a team ethnographic project exploring multilingualism in superdiverse UK cities. The research involves observing key participants at work as well as recording them at home and collecting their digital interactions. The nature of ethnographic research raises ethical issues which highlight the impossibility of divorcing ethics from project decision-making. We therefore take on board a reconceptualisation of research ethics not as an external set of guidelines but as being at the core of research, driving decision-making at all steps of the process. The researcher vignettes on which we draw in exploring this process facilitate a reflexive approach and enable us to identify and address ethical issues in our research. In this article, we focus on the potential impact that digital communication technologies can have on the kinds of relationships that are possible between researchers and research participants, and on the roles that both carry out within the project. In doing so, we explore the part that digital communications play in the co-construction of social distance and closeness in research relationships. Our discussions around these issues highlight the need for an awareness not only of how our participants' media ideologies shape their use and perceptions of digital technologies, but also how our own assumptions inform our handling of the digital data.

AB  - How do technology users effectively transit from having zero knowledge about a technology to making the best use of it after an authoritative technology adoption? This post-adoption user learning has received little research attention in technology management literature. In this paper we investigate user learning in authoritative technology adoption by developing an agent-based model using the case of council-led smart meter deployment in the UK City of Leeds. Energy consumers gain experience of using smart meters based on the learning curve in behavioural learning. With the agent-based model we carry out experiments to validate the model and test different energy interventions that local authorities can use to facilitate energy consumers' learning and maintain their continuous use of the technology. Our results show that the easier energy consumers become experienced, the more energy-efficient they are and the more energy saving they can achieve; encouraging energy consumers' contacts via various informational means can facilitate their learning; and developing and maintaining their positive attitude toward smart metering can enable them to use the technology continuously. Contributions and energy policy/intervention implications are discussed in this paper. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (April to May 2020), 6,169 Polish and 939 Italian residents were surveyed with an online questionnaire investigating socio-demographic information and personality traits (first section) as well as attitudes, position, and efficacy perceptions on the impact of lockdown (second section) and various health protection measures enforced (third section).Methods: The "health protection attitude score" (HPAS), an endpoint obtained by pooling up the answers to questions of the third section of the survey tool, was investigated by multiple linear regression models, reporting regression coefficients (RC) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).Results: Concerns for business and health due to COVID-19 were associated with a positive attitude toward risk reduction rules. By contrast, male sex, concerns about the reliability of information available online on COVID-19 and its prevention, along with the feeling of not being enough informed on the transmissibility/prevention of SARS-CoV-2 were associated with a negative attitude toward risk mitigation measures.Discussion: A recent literature review identified two social patterns with different features in relation to their attitude toward health protection rules against the spread of COVID-19. Factors positively associated with adherence to public health guidelines were perceived threat of COVID-19, trust in government, female sex, and increasing age. Factors associated with decreased compliance were instead underestimation of the COVID-19 risk, limited knowledge of the pandemic, belief in conspiracy theories, and political conservativism. Very few studies have tested interventions to change attitudes or behaviors.Conclusion: To improve attitude and compliance toward risk reduction norms, a key intervention is fostering education and knowledge on COVID-19 health risk and prevention among the general population. However, information on COVID-19 epidemiology might be user-generated and contaminated by social media, which contributed to creating an infodemic around the disease. To prevent the negative impact of social media and to increase adherence to health protection, stronger content control by providers of social platforms is recommended.

AB  - Purpose A framework is being developed to help Integrated Electronic Technical Publications (IETP) consultation inside and outside the aviation maintenance hangar. The expected results are the reduction in time to access the desired IETP and to assist mechanics while performing maintenance tasks using voice recognition. Design/methodology/approach The work is being conducted based on literature review and consultation with mechanics from the aviation industry, through questionnaires. The development will be made through study cases by building a core search engine and mobile applications to support the mechanics during the maintenance activities. Findings The identified problem in small maintenance shops and defence organizations suggests that IETP are not entirely accessible before and during the maintenance activity. Such organizations suffer from information and communications technology (ICT) low infrastructure capability and demand access to multiple IETP databases as they usually support different aircraft. To have access to the IETP through voice assistant application will help mechanics to access the IETP, including when they would be with dirty hands and having difficulty in using mobile devices with touch displays. Originality/value The framework being developed will give mechanics the ability to quickly find any existing IETP to support its maintenance task at any time and in any place with low demanding for ICT infrastructure. The architecture will support different applications, and the identified priority is for IETP viewers to the most demanding functionality of specification ASD S1000D. This approach could also help in troubleshooting activities since COVID-19 brought new demands for the social distancing for mechanics.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to explore the implementation of data analytics in the Big-Four accounting firms, including the extent to which a digital transformation is changing the work of financial auditors, why it is doing so and how these firms are managing the transformation process. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted 23 interviews with 20 participants across four hierarchical levels from three of the Big-Four accounting firms in New Zealand. Findings The firms have entered the era of "smart audit systems", in which auditors provide deep business insights that are communicated more effectively through data visualisation. The full potential, however, of data analytics depends not only on the transformation process within accounting firms but also on improvement in the quality of IT systems in client companies. The appointment of transformation managers, the recruitment of technology-savvy graduates and the provision of extensive training are helping to embed data analytics in the Big-Four firms. Accounting graduates in financial audit now need to show that they have the aptitude to become "citizen data scientists". Practical implications The findings explain how data analytics is being embraced in the Big-Four auditing firms and underline the implications for those who work in them. Originality/value The findings challenge the "technological reluctance" thesis. In contrast, the authors observe a climate of positive attitudes towards new technology and accompanying actions in the Big-Four firms. The authors show how branches of the Big-Four firms operating distantly from their global headquarters, and with smaller economies of scale, are implementing the new technologies that characterise their global firms.

Results indicate that issue-related CSR programmes work well in reducing scepticism when stakeholders have high issue involvement and positive attitudes. Scepticism is also found to be a mediator between issue-related CSR programmes and perceived corporate credibility.

AB  - Childhood sexual abuse is a growing concern throughout the world, although the legal sequelae of this phenomenon are frequently neglected. We aimed to reveal and compare the attitudes of judiciary and junior clerks toward sexually abused children that might contribute to these sequelae. We divided 302 study participants into two groups of judiciary members and junior clerks. All the participants were asked to anonymously complete a questionnaire about stigmatization, including questions assessing social distance, dangerousness and skillfulness. In their responses, 51.2% of the judiciary and 64.0% of the junior clerks displayed a negative attitude toward "asking a childhood sexual abuse (CSA) survivor to supervise their child for few hours" (p = 0.029). When asked "What would you think if your child wanted to marry a CSA survivor?" 76.5% of the judiciary and 84.1% of the junior clerks were opposed to the idea (p = 0.095). Interestingly, significantly more judiciary than junior clerks believed that a "CSA survivor can control his/her rage" (p = 0.001), and significantly more of the junior clerks did not believe that "CSA survivors do not behave impulsively" (p = 0.034). Both groups of legal professionals in this study appear to distance themselves from or have negative thoughts about CSA survivors, particularly when the issue involves their own children and/or social situations. Along with other factors, these negative assumptions might also contribute to lower prosecution rates and retestifying procedures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Open access podcasting or podcasts on the internet on specific disciplinary topics are gaining prominence but are not well researched. This paper explores the usefulness of a new podcast series for social workers freely available on the internet that aims to: promote the profession of social work and contribute to a social work identity; make connections between theory, research, and practice; introduce students to real-life practice issues much earlier than often occurs in undergraduate degrees; and provide practitioners with opportunities for ongoing professional development. The evaluation was based on social media and website statistics, a survey of 22 students and nine educators, and a content analysis of listener feedback. While the evaluation provided limited evidence that all the aims had been met, the findings revealed very positive attitudes towards the initiative.

AB  - In 2016, the Netherlands was required to introduce new European Union (EU)'s (pictorial) tobacco health warnings. Our objective was to describe the pathways through which the new EU tobacco health warnings may influence quit attempts and smoking cessation among Dutch smokers. Longitudinal data from 2016 and 2017 from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Netherlands Survey were used. Smokers who participated in both surveys were included (N = 1017). Structural equation modeling was applied to examine the hypothesized pathways. Health warning salience was positively associated with more health worries (beta = 0.301, p < 0.001) and a more positive attitude towards quitting (beta = 0.180, p < 0.001), which, in turn, were associated with a stronger quit intention (health worries: beta = 0.304, p < 0.001; attitude: beta = 0.340, p < 0.001). Quit intention was a strong predictor of quit attempts (beta = 0.336, p = 0.001). Health warning salience was also associated with stronger perceived social norms towards quitting (beta = 0.166, p < 0.001), which directly predicted quit attempts (beta = 0.141, p = 0.048). Quit attempts were positively associated with smoking cessation (beta = 0.453, p = 0.043). Based on these findings, we posit that the effect of the EU's tobacco health warnings on quit attempts and smoking cessation is mediated by increased health worries and a more positive attitude and perceived social norms towards quitting. Making tobacco health warnings more salient (e.g., by using plain packaging) may increase their potential to stimulate quitting among smokers.

AB  - Collective memory theories propose that groups' remembrances of their past depend upon their current social situation. In Belgium, a significant proportion of Dutch speakers share a collective memory of past victimisation by French speakers and fight for an ever-larger autonomy of their region. Yet, as the respective economic, political and social situations of the linguistic regions of Belgium recently evolved with a reversal of fortunes, the current experience of younger Dutch speakers does not fit the traditional memory anymore. We thus predicted that the collective memories of victimhood would decline amongst them, thus bringing changes in intergroup attitudes and political aspirations. Three generations were compared in a survey of 1226 French-speaking and 1457 Dutch-speaking individuals. For both groups, younger generations evidenced less regionalist and more integrative positions than older ones. However, these effects were stronger for Dutch-speaking respondents, and for them, collective memory of victimhood mediated the relation linking age and identification with Belgium, intergroup attitudes and political aspirations. We concluded that the current social context has decisive consequences for collective remembrances, which, in turn, impact intergroup relations and political attitudes and choices.

AB  - Introduction: Evidence relating to long-term outcomes of online education programs is largely lacking and headto-head comparisons of different delivery formats are very rare. The aims of the study were to test whether eLearning Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) or blended training (eLearning plus face-to-face course delivery), implemented in an Australian public sector workplace, were more effective than a control intervention at 1-year and 2-year follow-up, and whether blended MHFA training was more effective than eLearning alone. Material and methods: Australian public servants (n = 608 at baseline) were randomly assigned to complete an eLearning MHFA course, a blended MHFA course or Red Cross eLearning Provide First Aid (PFA) (the control) and completed online questionnaires pre- and post-training and one and two years later (n = 289, n = 272, n = 243 at post, 1- and 2-year follow-up respectively). The questionnaires were based on vignettes describing a person with depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Primary outcomes were mental health first aid knowledge, desire for social distance and quality of support provided to a person in the workplace. Secondary outcomes were recognition of mental health problems, beliefs about treatment, helping intentions and confidence, personal stigma, quality of support provided to a person outside the workplace, self-reported professional help seeking and psychological distress. Results: At 1-year follow-up, both eLearning and blended courses produced greater improvements than PFA training in knowledge, confidence and intentions to help a person with depression or PTSD, beliefs about dangerousness and desire for social distance. At 2-year follow-up, some of these improvements were maintained, particularly those relating to knowledge and intentions to help someone with PTSD. When eLearning and blended courses were compared at 1-year follow-up, the blended course led to greater improvements in knowledge and in confidence and intentions to help a person with depression. At 2-year follow-up, improvements in the quality of help provided to a person with a mental health problem outside the workplace were greater in participants in the blended course. Conclusions: Both blended and eLearning MHFA courses led to significant longer-term improvements in knowledge, attitudes and intentions to help a person with a mental health problem. Blended MHFA training led to an improvement in the quality of helping behaviours and appears to be more effective than online training alone.

AB  - Based on a comparative project on media and religion across Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, this article analyzes relationships between religiosity and political attitudes in Scandinavia and how these connect with attitudes regarding the representation of Islam in various media. Data comes from population-wide surveys conducted in the three countries in April 2015. Most Scandinavians relate 'religion' with conflict, and half of the population perceives Islam as a threat to their national culture. Scandinavians thus perceive religion in terms of political tensions and predominantly feel that news media should serve a critical function towards Islam and religious conflicts. Finally, the results of the empirical analysis are discussed in view of the intertwined processes of politicization of Islam and mediatization of religion.

AB  - The Educast is an educational videos' platform that captures simultaneously video and digital support materials. This paper presents a study on the acceptance of Educast, by students, using the Technology Acceptance Model-TAM. The data was collected through a questionnaire applied to 54 students which results were analyzed using descriptive analysis and non-parametric tests. It was concluded that students expressed a positive attitude towards the variables Perceived Ease Of Use, Perceived Usefulness and Attitude Toward Using. The comparison between ratings assigned to the questionnaire items by the students who viewed video recordings and those that did not was performed, and it was found that the former showed higher levels of agreement with the referred items than the latter. It is considered that introducing some training before students have contact with Educast should be taken into account. The result of this work can be valuable not only for researchers on the Education area, but also for teachers that intend to use educational videos in their teaching/learning environment.

AB  - Objective: To investigate differences in motivation perceptions toward exercise per self-determination theory and theory of planned behavior between active and insufficiently active persons with multiple sclerosis, given the well-being enhancements associated with exercise engagement for this population.
   Design: Cross-sectional between-groups design where active persons >= 14 points on the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire, and insufficiently active <14.
   Setting: Community setting in Australia.
   Participants: Australian participants (N=70; mean age, 49.61 +/- 12.79y; FIM 64:6; Patient Disability Disease Steps median, 3).
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire and adaptations of the self-determination theory (autonomous and controlling forms of motivation) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (attitudes to exercise, subjective norms to exercise, behavioral control to exercise, intention to exercise) items tailored toward exercise perceptions.
   Results: Active persons perceived higher ratings compared with insufficiently active persons of autonomous motivations toward their exercise d = 0.85 in addition to positive attitudes toward the value of exercise d = 1.28, their behavioral control over exercise d = 1.86, and their enhanced intentions to engage in exercise d = 1.14. All effect sizes were large (d>0.80).
   Conclusions: These findings suggest the value of considering ways of enhancing the perceived autonomy toward engaging in physical activity in addition to the reduction of barriers toward participating and enhancing positive attitudes toward the value of physical activity when practitioners are working with persons living with multiple sclerosis.

T2  - JAVNOST-THE PUBLIC
LA  - English
KW  - ENDORSEMENTS
AB  - Although one of the main aims of celebrities' societal engagement is to grab the attention of a wide audience for a social cause, research about public perceptions of the phenomenon is scarce. This study wants to gain a theoretical and empirical insight into the possible influence of celebrities' engagements on the general population. An internet survey among a sample of one thousand Flemish adults was conducted to ascertain which celebrities are considered to support social causes and how the general population perceives this phenomenon. Results show a select group of celebrity supporters, i.e. those in a deeply engaged role or with a considerable track record of engagement, to be the most popular. While most respondents consider such celebrity engagements to make a significant contribution to social-profit organisations' goals, scepticism about the celebrities' motives is apparent. Young adults and celebrity news followers, traditionally less involved in social causes, demonstrate a more positive attitude towards celebrity engagement than older respondents. As such, celebrities' societal engagement might be advantageous in reaching thus far uninterested parts of society.

AB  - This study heightens the understanding of response efficacy as a determinant of engagement in preventive behavior during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve a more nuanced conceptualization of response efficacy, this study proposes and examines a time-based coping appraisal framework, drawing upon a part of the extended parallel process model (EPPM). The current study investigates how the temporality of coping response message features work in generating social distancing behavioral intentions and explicates the role of anticipated emotions in this motivational process. Results of the experimental study (N = 584) indicate that proximal future framed coping response message (vs. distant future message) led to greater response efficacy, which in turn led to greater anticipated guilt and pride, and by extension increased social distancing behavioral intentions. Mediation analyses also demonstrated the indirect effects of the temporality conditions (proximal future-oriented message vs. distant future-oriented message) on social distancing intentions through response efficacy, anticipated guilt, and anticipated pride. The theoretical and practical implications of this study are discussed.

AB  - Based on construal-level theory (CLT) and its view of power as an instance of social distance, we predicted that high, relative to low power would enhance women's mental-rotation performance and impede their emotion-recognition performance. The predicted effects of power emerged both when it was manipulated via a recall priming task (Study 1) and environmental cues (Studies 2 and 3). Studies 3 and 4 found evidence for mediation by construal level of the effect of power on emotion recognition but not on mental rotation. We discuss potential mediating mechanisms for these effects based on both the social distance/construal level and the approach/inhibition views of power. We also discuss implications for optimizing performance on mental rotation and emotion recognition in everyday life.

AB  - Background: The Japanese have had three experiences of radiation disasters: the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, and the 2011 Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant disaster. The former two experiences have been covered in compulsory education programs. In light of these incidents, a strong fear of radiation has pervaded people of several generations. In such a situation, the role of nurses is important. When nurses treat residents, their attitudes change depending on how they understand and feel about radiation. The foundations of these attitudes are formed through student education. Hence, it is necessary to explore nursing students' understanding and risk perception of radiation, and the nature of radiation education received.
   Objectives: To assess the levels of understanding and risk perception of nursing students regarding radiation.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Methods: A questionnaire survey was administered to all students (74 first-year, 79 second-year, 65 third-year, and 69 fourth-year students) in the nursing department of a Japanese national university. The response rate was 84%. Respondents were asked to rate their level of understanding of 50 phrases chosen from two supplementary texts about radiation for elementary school students and for middle and high school students, prepared by the Japanese Ministry. Further, they were asked to rate their risk perception for 30 events, and to answer six questions about radiation.
   Results: It was found that knowledge about radiation among Japanese nursing students was poor, because sufficient radiation education had not been provided. Hence, they displayed a greater fear of X-rays as compared to American students and members of the League of Woman Voters. However, it was also found that an increase in understanding might decrease risk perception.
   Conclusions: It was concluded that nursing students require adequate education about radiation, in order to reduce their fear of X-rays and to mitigate their risk perception.

AB  - Health professionals must improve interprofessional communication and collaboration to ensure quality patient care. Through socialization, simulation, and case-based learning, improved collaboration among health professions is possible. Students from two programs, nursing and radiography, were involved in interprofessional activities, including case studies, simulation, and debriefing. The students completed a pre- and postsurvey to assess attitudes and knowledge of each profession. Data were analyzed in SPSS using paired t tests. Nursing and radiography students were assessed separately. A 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree) was used to quantify student selections. The nursing students showed increased confidence and knowledge in preparing patients, and deeper understanding of the role and knowledge base of the radiographer. While significant changes in student nurse attitudes and perceptions were noted, no significance was shown pre- to postsurvey in the radiography students' attitudes and perceptions. This may be attributed to an increased level of clinical exposure and experience in the radiography students. The perceptions of the students during debriefing, as well as from the survey data, indicate a heightened awareness of the collaborative nature of health care. Student comments support interprofessional education (IPE) as a method to reach beyond a single professional boundary and increase communication and understanding among healthcare providers. Through this activity, attitudes changed and knowledge of health profession roles increased in novice nursing students. Health professions educators must embrace IPE to encourage interprofessional collaboration for patients navigating the complex healthcare system today and in the future.

AB  - Considerable research indicates that personal contact from political campaigns can mobilize people to vote, but little attention has been given to whether the tone of the message matters. Studies of message tone have mostly been confined to mass media campaigns and ignored the growing role grassroots techniques play in contemporary political campaigns. Two randomized field experiments were conducted to determine the importance of message tone in grassroots contact. We find evidence that personally delivered messages can be effective at influencing voting preferences, but neither experiment uncovered a systematic difference between the effects of negative and positive messages on voter turnout or political attitudes.

AB  - Prevailing theories hold that U.S. public support for a war depends primarily on its degree of success, U.S. casualties, or conflict goals. Yet, research into the framing of foreign policy shows that public perceptions concerning each of these factors are often endogenous and malleable by elites. In this article, we argue that both elite rhetoric and the situation on the ground in the conflict affect public opinion, but the qualities that make such information persuasive vary over time and with circumstances. Early in a conflict, elites (especially the president) have an informational advantage that renders public perceptions of "reality" very elastic. As events unfold and as the public gathers more information, this elasticity recedes, allowing alternative frames to challenge the administration's preferred frame. We predict that over time the marginal impact of elite rhetoric and reality will decrease, although a sustained change in events may eventually restore their influence. We test our argument through a content analysis of news coverage of the Iraq war from 2003 through 2007, an original survey of public attitudes regarding Iraq, and partially disaggregated data from more than 200 surveys of public opinion on the war.

AB  - Background: Communication skills (CS) learning is a core skill in medical and dental education. The comparison of attitudes towards CS between dental and medical students based on the taught curriculum (problem-based learning vs. traditional teaching) in Saudi Arabia awaits investigation. Aims: (1) To assess the attitudes of both undergraduate dental and medical students towards communication skills (CS) learning and (2) to compare the attitudes towards CS between Medical and Dental students in relation to sociodemographic and education-related characteristics. Methods and Materials: A cross-sectional study, using an online survey, invited 260 conveniently sampled Taibah university medical and dental undergraduate students. The survey collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, education-related factors, and CS using Communication Skills Attitude Scale (CSAS) that assess positive and negative attitudes (PAS, NAS). Data analysis included descriptive statistics and the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Of the distributed questionnaire 91% responded (145 dental and 91 medical students). There were, overall, non-significant scores' differences between medical and dental students on PAS (Medicine Median 51 vs. Dentistry Median 50, p = 0.059) and NAS (Medicine Median 32 vs. Dentistry Median 32, p = 0.596). Older medical students, those at clinical levels and those who reported they need to improve their communication skills and student whose parents were not doctors, tended to score statistically significantly (p = 0.032, 0.017, 0.034, and 0.004, respectively) on PAS compared with dental students; on the other hand, medical students with doctor parents scored significantly high in NAS compared to dental students (p = 0.015). Conclusion: Demographic and education-related characteristics underpinned medical student positive attitude towards CS compared to dental students. Although medical and dental students showed no differences in self-rating their attitudes towards (CS). Different factors influence medical and dental students' attitudes towards CS learning.

TI  - Compliance to a Five-Year Biannual Ivermectin Treatment for Onchocerciasis Elimination and Its Determinants among Adults in the Bench Maji Zone, Southwest Ethiopia: A Community-Based Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - Background. Community-directed treatment with ivermectin twice a year is a major action to control onchocerciasis in endemic countries. Even though the community-directed treatment with ivermectin was proven effective in treating the disease, the level of compliance to the treatment and its contributing factors was not well addressed in our study area. Therefore, the current study was aimed at determining the magnitude of compliance with the five-year (2013-2017 years) biannual ivermectin treatment and its associated factors among adults living in the Bench Maji Zone, Ethiopia. Methods. A community-based cross-sectional study was done on 572 randomly selected people aged greater than or equal to 15 years. Data were collected by a face-to-face interview. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize descriptive data. Binary logistic regression was done to assess statistical associations. Adjusted odds ratio and its 95% CI were, respectively, used to measure the strength of statistical association and its significance. Result. Five hundred fifty-three (553) people had participated in the study making the response rate 96.7%. The overall magnitude of compliance to the five-year biannual ivermectin treatment was 361 (65.3%). The results of the multivariable logistic regression showed that age, positive attitude towards community drug distributers' performance, positive attitude towards height measurement for the treatment dose determination, and involvement in community-directed treatment with ivermectin were independently associated with compliance to ivermectin treatment at P value < 0.05. Conclusions. Even though the Ethiopian government has set a goal to eliminate onchocerciasis through community-directed treatment with the ivermectin, which is proven effective in treating the disease, the magnitude of compliance with the treatment among adults aged >= 15 years in the Semen Bench District is still unacceptably low. The Bench Maji Zonal Health Department and other stakeholders working on onchocerciasis prevention, control, and elimination should give due emphasis to behavioral change communication through community-based education and other social media to promote community's awareness on community-directed treatment with ivermectin giving due focus to adults aged 45 years and above.

AB  - United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions are complex social organizations, with soldiers coming from several countries. In this environment, effective communication and interactions with local populations are often difficult, and establishing essential local support can be jeopardized when soldiers are culturally distant from local communities. At the same time, however, when local populations perceive peacekeepers as sufficiently distant or unbiased, the promotion of cooperation is enhanced. We explore whether cultural distance-in terms of geography, language, and religion-and social distance-in terms of economy and institutions-between the peacekeepers and the local population improve the operational capabilities of a mission. We use monthly information on UN peacekeeping missions' composition from 1990 to 2015. We find that higher geographic and cultural distances correspond to higher levels of violence against civilians and higher battle deaths, whereas institutional and economic differences have the opposite effects, although these are less robust.

AB  - Given recent and growing societal movements focusing on sexual assault, such as the #MeToo Movement, it is imperative to understand current attitudes about sexual assault and these movements. The aim of this study was to examine negative attitudes and beliefs about sexual assault in the context of the #MeToo Movement by qualitatively analyzing social media posts (i.e., tweets) containing the hashtag "metoo" on Twitter, a popular social media platform. The initial sample consisted of 4,559 tweets that were publicly posted by Twitter users across a four-day timeframe and represented events and attitudes regarding both about an accuser and an accused. Data were cleaned and coded, and a remaining 508 tweets were included because they contained content that was categorized as negative in their attitudes or beliefs (either through attitudes of condemnation or ambivalence towards accusers and/or the #MeToo Movement). Results from a qualitative content analysis of tweets demonstrated that negative attitudes and beliefs about sexual assault within the context of the #MeToo Movement were conveyed through six main themes: (1) invalidating the accusations made as part of the #MeToo Movement; (2) insisting, and likely believing, that accusations made were false; (3) claiming that there were alternative motives for those accusations; (4) showing a concern for the harm that accusations may cause those accused; (5) exhibiting concerns about the effects of the Movement on male power, privilege, and status; and (6) questioning the integrity of the #MeToo Movement as a whole. These findings provide a deeper understanding of attitudes and beliefs about the #MeToo Movement, including novel beliefs not often addressed in the literature. Most importantly, these findings show that rape culture continues to persist despite current interventions and social movements. Results underscore the need for future interventions that aim to educate and improve societal attitudes towards sexual assault.

AB  - This article deals comprehensively with factors which influence attitudes to the placement of high-voltage overhead transmission lines (HVOTLs). It employs an analytical schema which links the initial stimulus of the power lines' proposal in an area to Background and Socio-economic independent variables and a set of mediating variables. From a survey of 600 residents in three different domiciliary settings in Queensland, Australia, results indicate an absence of positive attitudes and, at best, neutral ones to HVOTL placement. By multinomial logistic regression, the study probes the grounds behind negativity and extreme negativity, uncovering direct links between these attitudes and certain of the variables included in the analytical schema.

AB  - BACKGROUNDBecause human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine rates remain low, we evaluated US school nurses' knowledge, attitudes, perceptions of their role as opinion leaders, and professional practice regarding HPV vaccine, and assessed whether knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of being an opinion leader influenced their professional practice regarding the HPV vaccine.
   METHODSWe used a cross-sectional design by recruiting members from the National Association of School Nurses. All participants (N=505) were e-mailed a survey designed for this study. Structural equation modeling (SEM) tested direct and indirect effects.
   RESULTSOverall, school nurses had knowledge about HPV and the vaccine, and positive attitudes toward the vaccine. They had less-than-enthusiastic perceptions of their role as opinion leaders regarding the vaccine and implemented few activities related to providing vaccine information. The model revealed a good fit ((2)=20.238 [df=8, p<.01]), with knowledge directly related to attitudes, attitudes directly related to perceptions and practice, and perceptions directly affecting practice. In our model, perceptions functioned as a partial mediator.
   CONCLUSIONSTo enhance school nurses' practice regarding the HPV vaccine, focus should be on increasing positive attitudes toward the vaccine and strengthening perceptions of their role as opinion leaders.

AB  - Despite lacking the resources to adequately adhere to public health protocols, urban residents belonging to impoverished communities in Kingston, Jamaica were prominently featured in local news reports that highlighted their breaches of social distancing. These reports generated an overwhelmingly prejudiced online social discourse, characterized by derogatory and dehumanizing remarks. This research aims to explore the ways media representations of calls for social distancing have unearthed latent social cleavages and contributed to the othering of Kingston's poor. A thematic analysis was used to understand the nature of the public response to these news reports. The comments were manually coded, and emergent themes were classified based on the sentiments expressed. The comments generated evoked class, place, race, and political tensions, potentially perpetuating the public perception of vulnerable groups as the 'threatening other'. These comments possibly represent deeper problems associated with the social divergence of Jamaican society. The lack of sensitivity exhibited shows a general disregard for the stark social realities commonly experienced by subaltern groups. These findings suggest media coverage promoting public safety, while important, may inadvertently lead to heightened social tensions and perpetuate social stigmas against marginalized groups, potentially stirring social divergence and countering efforts toward inclusiveness and integration.

AB  - As paradigms of clinical care delivery have been significantly impacted by the novel coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic, so has the structure, delivery, and future of medical education. Both undergraduate and graduate medical education have seen disruptions ranging from fully virtual delivery of educational content and limited clinical care for medical students to increased clinical demands with redeployment for residents and fellows. Adherence to social distancing has led to the adoption and implementation of already available technologies in medical education, including video conferencing softwares and social media platforms. Efficient and effective use of these technologies requires an understanding not only of these platforms and their features but also of their inherent limitations. During a time of uncertainty and increased clinical demands, the approach to medical education must be thoughtful with attention to wellness of both the educator and learner. In this review, we discuss the influence of the pandemic on the existing medical education landscape, outline existing and proposed adaptations to social distancing, and describe challenges that lie ahead.

AB  - The present study was conducted to answer a single question: What is the role of picture-posting activities on social networking sites in emotion regulation? Across three studies, we find evidence suggesting that posting psychologically distant pictures is related to online negative emotional disclosure and could be a strategy for reducing negative affect by promoting cognitive reappraisal. We discuss important theoretical and practical implications of our study.

AB  - Social media has become an important marketing media to attract and retain consumers. This article focuses on the movie industry and aims to investigate how different channels and events in social media marketing achieve box office success through different consumers' responses. In reference to elaboration likelihood model (ELM), we propose our research model and test hypotheses using the data of 304 movies with the information of box office, attributes, and associated social media posts. The results show that: (1) official microblog activity increases the purchase intent through changing audience's attitude while third-party mention increases purchase intent through catching audience's attention and promoting positive attitude, and there is an interaction effect between official microblog and third-party media; (2) social media marketing events related to contents introduction promote purchase intent through central route while those related to surrounding information promote purchase intent through peripheral route; and (3) movie attributes interact with marketing intensity in affecting purchase intent. Under the same marketing intensity, the marketing effect of domestic sequel movies released on popular holidays is better. Our findings provide both theoretical and practical implications.

AB  - Affective polarization (i.e., differences in evaluations of the in-party and out-party) has important implications for political outcomes including civic engagement and partisan-motivated attitudes and behaviours. In this study, we add to the burgeoning literature on affective polarization by examining moderators of the effect of in-party support on out-party opposition across the three main political parties in New Zealand. Using a large national probability sample of adults (N = 19,078), we assessed the effects of social demographics, Big-Five personality traits, liberal-conservative ideology, political identity centrality, and weekly news exposure on the relationship between in-party and out-party support. Results show political identity centrality is the strongest and most consistent moderator. The effects of some other moderators (e.g., personality, news exposure) are party-specific.

AB  - The investigation of established drivers of online purchase behavior is of great relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic, as companies must anticipate consumer behavior during this global crisis to maintain a competitive edge. This study investigates online shopping motives of generation Y and Z during the COVID-19 shutdown in April 2020. We use survey data from 451 German consumers to examine the relations between normative, utilitarian and hedonic motives, and purchase intentions employing structural equation modeling. The results show that normative determinants such as media reports on the economic situation are related to consumers' purchase intentions, whereas the normative influence of close social networks is not. Furthermore, we find that hedonic motivation is a better predictor of purchase intentions than utilitarian motives and that individuals practicing social distancing, generation Z, and women show higher levels of hedonic motivation. We provide recommendations for e-commerce companies on ways to address consumers' purchase motives and strategically harness normative influences.

Design/methodology/approach This study collected survey-based data from 194 participants who suffered from natural and anthropogenic disasters in the state of Texas. Path analysis was used to test each structural relationship among variables after verifying the reliability and validity of each variable. Analysis of variance was used to investigate the difference in resilience between the two groups. Findings This study verified that there is a positive relationship between CSR and consumer attitude. More importantly, the results show that both resilience and familiarity play an important role as a mediator in the relationship between CSR and attitudes. In particular, it tells us that a group with high resilience shows a higher possibility of having positive attitudes toward the company than another group having low resilience. Originality/value This study empirically tested the impacts of CSR, resilience and brand familiarity on building consumer attitudes. Furthermore, this study explored the effects of resilience and brand familiarity on the relationship between CSR and attitudes. Thus, this study was able to contribute to understanding the effects of CSR, resilience and familiarity on building a positive attitude in the specific settings, in terms of traumatic events, theoretically and practically.

AB  - Were policy responses of the US states to the pandemic driven by partisan politics or by budgetary reasons? We show that balanced-budget rules also had an impact, mediated by the possibility of benefiting from the funds previously stored in budget stabilisation funds. State policymakers tried to square the circle by simultaneously respecting budget rules, limiting the economic impact of the social distancing measures, combating the pandemic and pandering to their political bases. Some fiscal rules have induced a trade-off between health and public finance, which may reignite the debate on the pro-cyclicality of fiscal rules.

AB  - This paper reports a test and extension of the model posited by the theory of crisis response narratives, in which the public manifests identification with a spokesperson who tells ethical narratives rather than spinning stories. The effect is hypothesized as being mediated through the public perceiving trustworthiness of, and positive attitudes toward, the spokesperson. An experiment is reported (N = 262) with a televised news interview featuring a spokesperson representing a scandalized company, in which the messaging varies in terms of narratives. The study finds support for the theoretical model as originally specified. In addition, the model is extended to serial and parallel multiple mediation, finding that the effect is processed through the public's anger.

AB  - This article applies the theory of planned behaviour in order to understand intentions to create new ventures or participate in existing ones, by investing human, social and financial capital in a turbulent economic environment, such as the one in Greece. We hypothesize that subjective norms relate to investment intentions (IIs) and that individual attitudes and perceived behavioural control over the investment mediate this relationship. We also propose that norms, attitudes and control interact in explaining IIs in such a way that intentions are stronger when positive norms and attitudes coexist with high levels of control. Hypotheses are tested by means of a cross-sectional quantitative study that was conducted in Greece (N = 203). Bootstrap analyses support our mediation hypotheses by showing that norms relate positively to IIs via their associations with positive attitudes and high control. In addition, regression analyses show that norms, attitudes and control interact in explaining intentions. However, contrary to expectations, results show that positive attitudes towards investment boost IIs, in conditions where norms are positive but control is low.

Methods: Focus groups were conducted with residents, managers and caregivers, and questionnaires were collected from 32 residents, 30 staff and 27 relatives of residents. Results: The most popular robot tasks were detection of falls and calling for help, lifting, and monitoring location. Robot functionality was more important than appearance. Concerns included the loss of jobs and personal care, while perceived benefits included allowing staff to spend quality time with residents, and helping residents with self-care. Residents showed a more positive attitude towards robots than both staff and relatives. Conclusions: These results provide an initial guide for the tasks and appearance appropriate for a robot to provide assistance in aged care facilities and highlight concerns.

Studying the case of North Cyprus, the last place in Europe to decriminalize same-sex relationships, it investigates the relationship between journalists and lesbian, gay and bisexual people by focusing on their experiences, opinions and practices and how these contribute to the social inclusion and exclusion of lesbian, gay and bisexual people. Through analysis of interviews conducted with members of the lesbian, gay and bisexual community and journalists, the article demonstrates the processes by which lesbian, gay and bisexual people become socially excluded. The findings show that homophobia within the news media, journalists' lack of awareness and/or understanding of the social concerns of lesbian, gay and bisexual people, public pressure and lack of communication between the lesbian, gay and bisexual community and journalists contribute to processes by which lesbian, gay and bisexual people become socially excluded.

AB  - Abstract
   Online platforms now provide a valuable medium for political socialization and mobilization. Recent events such as the Gezi Park protests, the Occupy Wall Street, or the anti-government protests in Iran demonstrate how effective social media can be in shaping an individual's political attitudes and actions. Traditional public opinion research does not acknowledge this emerging data source to its fullest extent. In this study, findings from the "Identifying Policy Opinion Shapers and Trends in Turkey" project, which has been collecting and exploring Twitter data to define how the online political debates are shaped in Turkey, are presented. Having identified over ten million active Turkish Twitter users and produced a social network graph of these users, this study identifies public opinion leadership in the Turkish online discussion space. The findings suggest that who these opinion leaders are may not follow the conventional expectations, but these leaders employ various tactics in managing their online presence and disseminating their ideas. This research endeavor as well as the findings suggests that engaging in cross-disciplinary research with scholars from different backgrounds can advance Turkish studies, in terms of both content and methodology. Most importantly, such interdisciplinary research can render significant leverage toward making Turkey more globally salient for scholarly debates.

AB  - We examined a general population sample (n = 1330) from an epidemiological study (SHIP), investigating whether shame, social distance and reluctance to self-identify as having a mental illness interfere with willingness to seek help for mental health problems. Analyses were stratified for life-time diagnosis of any mental illness. Shame was the strongest negative predictor for willingness to seek help (beta = -0.183, p < .001). Structured Estimation Modelling showed shame being a full mediator of a negative association between social distance and willingness. Our results corroborate the important role of shame as an impediment to help-seeking for mental health problems in the general population.

AB  - Visual framing can improve health-message effectiveness. Narrative structure provides a template needed for determining how to frame visuals to maximise message effectiveness. Participants (N = 190) were assigned to a message condition determined by segments (establisher, initial, peak), graphic (static, animated) and cancer (lung, melanoma). ANOVAs revealed that melanoma was more believable than lung cancer with static graphics at the establisher and peak; narratives were more believable with animated graphics at the peak segment; melanoma elicited greater positive attitudes; graphics in the peak influenced greatest intentions. Animated graphics visually framed to emphasise information at the establisher and peak segments suggest maximum effectiveness.

AB  - Today, in the digital age, the Internet usage is common among university students. The Internet is also an important platform for actively participating in democracy. This study explores physical education (PE) candidate teachers' attitudes toward the Internet and democracy. It also explores whether the Internet is an important predictor for democracy. In adopting the survey design, a total of 455 PE teacher candidates participated in the study. The study used the "Attitude Scale towards Internet Use" and the "Attitude Scale of Democracy" as data collection tools. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation (Pearson) techniques, and multiple regressions analyses. It was found that PE teacher candidates have positive attitudes towards the Internet and democracy. There was a significant positive correlation (p <.05) found between the Internet and democracy. The study also found that the Internet is an important predictor of negative views of democracy.

AB  - Japanese often find it pleasant when someone engages in amae, defined as an inappropriate request with the expectation of acceptance. Using a random sampling survey, we examined why Japanese adults feel good when a friend or an acquaintance engages in amae and when they, themselves, engage in amae. In both situations, positive attitude toward amae predicted more positive emotions. Relationship closeness and feeling of control mediated this association, and perceiving enough resources to grant the request did so only in the friend/acquaintance amae situation. Despite its inappropriateness, amae could be an effective way to seek help and express closeness with others.

AB  - The two major challenges facing people with mental health conditions (MHCs) are stigma and discrimination. This study focused on the Amitim program's nationwide integrated arts-based groups that not only aim to impart knowledge and skills in the arts (e.g., theater, writing, music, poetry, visual art, etc.) but also reduce public and self-stigma, and promote personal recovery. This study, composed of a sample of 642 Israeli adults, examined whether people with MHCs and nonclinical community members who attended the integrated groups would report greater adaptive changes in outcomes than those who did not participate, the association of change process factors and in-group factors with these outcomes, and candidate mediators in the association between participation in the groups and the outcomes. The findings showed that change in creative self-efficacy (CSE) significantly predicted adaptive change in outcomes in people with MHCs who participated in these integrated arts-based groups. Participants with MHCs in groups facilitated by arts therapists reported significantly more positive outcomes than participants in groups with facilitators from other professional human services. Nonclinical community members in the integrated groups reported higher postprogram CSE and less desire for social distance from people with MHCs compared with the control group. Finally, change in the desire for social distance significantly mediated the relationship between group participation and change in public stigma. Overall, direct intergroup contact while engaging in arts-based activities appears to be a promising way to promote positive changes in people with MHCs and nonclinical community members. The implications and future directions are discussed.

AB  - Food marketing targeted to Black and Latino adolescents primarily promotes energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and likely contributes to diet-related health disparities. Targeted marketing raises further public health concerns as Black and Latino youth are also exposed to greater amounts of unhealthy food marketing in the media and their communities. However, little is known about Black and Latino adolescents' attitudes toward brands and marketing that target them directly. Focus groups with Black and Latino adolescents (N= 51) explored their attitudes toward targeted and non-targeted brands of food, beverages, and restaurants. Pile sorting activities using cards printed with targeted and non-targeted brand logos were used as an elicitation technique. Overall, participants indicated more positive attitudes about the targeted brands discussed in the focus groups than the non-targeted brands, and participants often described targeted brands as being for someone most like them. Some participants expressed appreciation for marketing that recognized "someone like them" as potential consumers, while others raised ethical issues regarding targeting of unhealthy foods. Participants' strong affinity for targeted brands, and ambivalent attitudes about targeted marketing of unhealthy products, highlight an opportunity to increase awareness of food marketing targeting communities of color and address targeted marketing through countermarketing and grassroots advocacy campaigns.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the mediating role of problem-solving coping strategies in the relationship between thinking styles (legislative, executive, and judicial) and teachers' attitudes towards distance education (difficulties related to distance education and efficacy in distance education). The study sample consisted of 556 special education teachers, 122 males (21.9%) and 434 females (78.1%), with an average age of 37.90 years (SD = 7.12). The results confirmed the role of problem-solving coping as a mediator for legislative thinking style on difficulties related to distance education. Furthermore, the findings indicated a positive relationship between judicial style and efficacy in distance education. The results of this study highlight the importance of developing specific special education teacher trainings to promote positive attitudes towards distance education.

AB  - The arrival of digital native students and the omnipresence of Internet access and mobile devices have motivated professors to reflect on their teaching practices. The educational usage of Facebook includes communication, collaboration, and sharing. Different research designs and the lack of baseline data made it difficult to compare research findings and conclude students' perceptions of the educational usage of a Facebook group. The findings from this research showed even more positive attitudes towards the educational usage of a Facebook group after the experience. Specifically, positive significant differences were found in "improves communication between teacher and students", "provides rich multimedia resources and media support to improve the educational experience"; and a negative significant change in "encourages the creation of academic groups (communities) of people with the same interest and needs".

AB  - Objectives: Taking weight-loss supplements may create illusion of protection against weight gain and thereby loosen subsequent dietary self-control. The current study examined whether taking weight-loss supplement would increase food intake and further tested whether positive attitudes toward supplements would increase susceptibility to overeating.
   Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to take either a known placebo or a purported weight loss supplement (actually, the same placebo). After supplement provision, participants' actual food consumption at a reward buffet lunch was recorded.
   Results: Compared with controls, participants receiving a purported weight loss supplement ate more food at the reward buffet. Perceived progress toward the goal of weight reduction mediated the connection between use of weight loss supplements and subsequent food consumption. Participants with more positive attitudes toward weight loss supplements were more susceptible to the liberating effect of taking weight loss supplements on food intake.
   Conclusion: Using weight loss supplements may produce unintended consequences on dietary self-regulation. The public should pay more attention to the notion of psychological liberation when using weight loss supplements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The article is devoted to the questions of organizing English distant classes for future philologists and verifying the efficiency of the suggested approach. Distance learning was conducted at National Technical University of Ukraine "Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute" in the third and fourth semesters of the academic year 2020-2021. Second-year students (two groups) of the Faculty of Linguistics, specialty 035 "Philology", specialization 035.041 "Germanic languages and literature (including translation), primary - English" participated in the distance learning. The educational process in the distance mode encompassed distant classes, held through the video conferencing platform Zoom, and students' individual work, performed at the learning management system Canvas. The efficiency of teaching English distantly to future philologists was checked by conducting pre- and post-assessments with subsequent processing of the received data by methods of mathematical statistics. The efficiency of distance learning in general was verified using the statistical criterion phi* - Fisher z-transformation. The minimal sufficient achievement rate, used for Fisher z-transformation, was identified based on the fuzzy set theory by processing opinions of a group of experts. Lecturers at Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, Department of the English language Theory, Practice and Translation were chosen as experts (ten respondents in total). The efficiency of distance learning in each group was verified using paired sample t-test. The results of the data processing by statistical methods proved the efficiency of the suggested approach to organizing distant English classes for future philologists that ensured combination of synchronous (using video conferencing platform Zoom) and asynchronous learning modes (using the learning management system Canvas). The results of the survey conducted among the participants of the educational process showed a positive attitude to the organization of the distance learning using the service Zoom and the system Canvas.

AB  - The European economic crisis, the migratory crisis and the Brexit in the UK are the main causes of the increasing negative moods of the European Union citizens. The research offers a comparative analysis of pupils' and teachers' viewpoints on European citizenship and European identity in selected two Visegrad Group countries. The research held in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the fourth quarter of 2017 on the research sample of 1,973 respondents shows that the Slovak pupils and their teachers have in most cases more positive attitudes towards European citizenship and European identity than Czech pupils and their teachers. The responding Slovak pupils are more proud of being citizens of the European Union, less skeptic of the EU's activities and believe in the future of the European Union.
   On the other hand, the Czech pupils and teachers are more proud of the membership of the Czech Republic in the EU, as well as of the Czech activities in the European Union. In this context, the authors point out that a more intensive education relating to the European citizenship and Europeanism could increase positive attitudes towards European identity and membership in the European Union. The European dimension of education is still up to date not only in the old member states of the European Union but also in the new ones or future member states. Citizenship education unifies several social fields and disciplines including education to Europeanism, environmental, global, media, multicultural, personal and social education, and education relating to democracy and constitutionality.

AB  - As the use of digital technology becomes more widespread across the globe, older people remain among the group with the lowest access and usage. The digital divide may lead to double exclusion as the COVID-19 pandemic has led to limited physical social contact as experts' recommendation of continuous social distancing and lack of access and usage of internet communication will leave older people socially isolated. The aim of this study is to explore how older people in rural Nigeria may be digitally excluded and its impact during the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative data was obtained from 11 older people using interviews. The collected data was then transcribed and analyzed thematically. Findings show that older people in rural Nigeria were digitally excluded. However, the older people argued that the digital exclusion is not the reason for their social isolation and loneliness. The study concluded by suggesting how caregivers and social workers can assist rural older people through activity schedule and radio programs designed for older people.

AB  - Are philosophical arguments as effective as narratives in influencing charitable giving and attitudes toward it? In four experiments, we exposed online research participants to either philosophical arguments in favor of charitable giving, a narrative about a child whose life was improved by charitable donations, both the narrative and the argument, or a control text (a passage from a middle school physics text or a description of charitable organizations). Participants then expressed their attitudes toward charitable giving and were either asked how much they would hypothetically donate if given $10 (Experiment 1) or told they had a 10% chance of winning $10 and given the opportunity to donate from their potential winnings (Experiments 2-4). Across the four experiments, participants in all of the narrative conditions and in some of the argument conditions tended to express more positive attitudes toward charitable giving and donated about $1 more on average than did participants in the control conditions. These effects appear to have been mediated by the "narrative transportation" scale, which suggests that appeals to donate can be effective if they engage participants' emotions, imagery, and interest.

AB  - Objectives One effective approach of tobacco control is to encourage the role and the participation of healthcare workers in the prevention efforts against tobacco use. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of tobacco use among governmental healthcare workers in Qatar, to assess healthcare workers' knowledge, attitude and practice of tobacco cessation and to predict factors associated with above average tobacco cessation practice scores. Design A cross-sectional survey study was conducted among healthcare workers working in Hamad Medical Corporation and Primary Healthcare Centres in Qatar using a self-administered online questionnaire in 2019. Setting Hamad Medical Corporation and Primary Healthcare Centres in Qatar. Participants Governmental healthcare workers aged 18 years and above (n=7214). Results The response rate of our online survey was 20.6% (7214/35 000). Of the 7214 healthcare workers, 16.3% (n=1178) were current tobacco users. In particular, the prevalence of tobacco use among physicians was 11.0%. Fifty-two per cent of healthcare workers (n=2338) attained an average knowledge score (12-17), 71.8% (n=3094) attained positive attitude scores (8-12) and 57.1% (n=3052) attained above average practice scores (12-26). Among the different professions, physicians were having the highest mean knowledge (15.3 +/- 4.7), attitude (9.4 +/- 1.9) and practice (13.7 +/- 6.1) scores. Multivariate analysis showed that having good knowledge (adjusted OR (AOR)=2.8; p<0.0001) and training (AOR=2.4; p<0.0001) were the strongest factors associated positively with above average tobacco cessation practice scores. Conclusions Healthcare workers in Qatar have a relatively similar prevalence of tobacco use than earlier studies with no significant increase. Investing more in training programmes for healthcare workers are needed to root out this negative behaviour and to increase their skills to assist users to quit.

AB  - In U.S. society, Native Americans face invisibility, stereotypes, discrimination, and structural barriers. In this article, we employ a symbolic interactionist approach, embedded in critical analysis, to explore how this social context impacts the conveyance and interpretation of Native American identity among people who are not Native American. Participants, 213 White American and 104 Native American people, replied to open-ended questions about Native American identity conveyance and interpretation. We employed an inductive thematic approach to analyze their written replies. The majority of Native American participants discussed their identity in the context of limited public knowledge of, and/or oppression faced by, Native Americans. For most Native American participants, this context generated strain and struggle associated with conveyance and interpretation of their identities. Despite this, some Native American participants engaged in identity work to educate others and reduce oppression. Without prompting, some White participants expressed positive attitudes toward Native Americans and their identity revelation. These positive attitudes evidence both hope for social change and problematic fetishization based on romantic stereotypes of Native Americans. We argue that society-wide change is necessary to reduce strain in, and enhance the effectiveness of, identity work by Native American people.

AB  - We discuss some aspects of a pilot e-learning technical writing course addressed to 11th grade vocational high school students in Greece. The application of this alternative teaching intervention stemmed from the researcher-instructor's reflections relating to the integration of a problem based e-pedagogy that aims not just to familiarize students with some technical writing text-types, but to trigger a positive way of thinking and writing and thus enhance students' linguistic literacy. Can genuine interest to content learning (the school's vocational sectors and technical subjects) revert the negative attitude towards school writing activities? And what if the teachers, taking advantage of this interest, converted the conventional language lesson to a web mediated, e-learning problem based language course by engaging more energetic, student-centered teaching and learning approaches? The study showed that a job-related language course through the application of motivating e-pedagogy can revert the vocational students language literacy in a positive direction.

AB  - Background: Much of the research on African-Americans' HPV vaccine acceptance has largely focused on racial/ethnic differences related to cognitive, socio-economical, and structural factors that contribute to differences in HPV vaccine acceptance and completion. A growing body of literature suggest that cultural factors, such as mistrust of healthcare providers (HCPs) and the healthcare system, religion, and social norms related to appropriate sexual behaviors, also plays a prominent role in their HPV vaccine acceptance. However, these studies were limited in their use of theoretical approaches necessary to conceptualize and operationalize culture. Objective: To explore the influence of culture on African-American mothers' and daughters' HPV vaccine acceptance using the PEN-3, a culturally-centered conceptual framework. Methods: Grounded theory techniques were used to explore cultural factors that influenced the acceptance of the HPV vaccine among African-American mothers (n = 28) and their daughters (n = 34). Results: Positive attitudes towards vaccination stemmed from beliefs that the HPV vaccine has cancer prevention benefits and that vaccinations in general protected against infectious diseases. Negative attitudes stemmed from beliefs that the HPV vaccine was too new, not effective, daughters were too young, and that vaccines were not a one-size-fits-all intervention. Majority of mothers and daughters indicated that their religious doctrine did not impede their HPV vaccination decisions. For a few mothers, religious beliefs could not be separated from their HPV vaccination decisions and ultimately deterred HPV vaccine acceptance. HCP recommendations were valued however mothers were often dissatisfied with the detail of information communicated. Support networks provided both positive and negative types of social support to mothers and daughters. The media highlighted the cancer prevention benefits of the HPV vaccine and unintentionally communicated negative information of the HPV vaccine, which deterred HPV vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: Study findings can inform the development of culturally appropriate interventions that advances the evidence on cervical cancer prevention.

AB  - Social ostracism paradigm may represent a challenging task for subjects with pathological narcissism. In order to evaluate the associations between pathological narcissism and social ostracism, 1063 Italian University students were administered the Italian translation of the Five Factor Narcissism Inventory-Short Form (FFNI-SF). Participants who scored in the upper 97.5th percentile of the FFNI-SF Grandiose Narcissism (n = 27) and Vulnerable Narcissism (n = 27) scale score distributions, as well as a group of participants (n = 28) who were randomly selected from students scoring in the 33rd-66th percentile of FFNI-SF total score distribution were administered the Social Media Ostracism Paradigm (SMOP), a laboratory task designed to simulate social exclusion in social network interaction. FFNI-SF Vulnerable Narcissism scale showed almost none significant relationship with participants' experience on the SMOP task. Rather, Grandiose Narcissism seemed to protect participants from threats to self-esteem and to give them a sense of being in control of the situation when they had to face social exclusion. FFNI-SF Antagonism, Agentic Extraversion, and Neuroticism scales yielded meaningful, significant correlations with self-reports of participants' subjective states after the SMOP task. The current study expands our understanding of narcissism by exploring participants' hypersensitivity to social exclusion. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The reintegration of former members of violent extremist groups is a pressing policy challenge. Governments and policymakers often have to change minds among reticent populations and shift perceived community norms in order to pave the way for peaceful reintegration. How can they do so on a mass scale? Previous research shows that messages from trusted authorities can be effective in creating attitude change and shifting perceptions of social norms. In this study, we test whether messages from religious leaders-trusted authorities in many communities worldwide-can change minds and shift norms around an issue related to conflict resolution: the reintegration of former members of violent extremist groups. Our study takes place in Maiduguri, Nigeria, the birthplace of the violent extremist group Boko Haram. Participants were randomly assigned to listen to either a placebo radio message or to a treatment message from a religious leader emphasizing the importance of forgiveness, announcing the leader's forgiveness of repentant fighters, and calling on followers to forgive. Participants were then asked about their attitudes, intended behaviors, and perceptions of social norms surrounding the reintegration of an ex-Boko Haram fighter. The religious leader message significantly increased support for reintegration and willingness to interact with the ex-fighter in social, political, and economic life (8 to 10 percentage points). It also shifted people's beliefs that others in their community were more supportive of reintegration (6 to 10 percentage points). Our findings suggest that trusted authorities such as religious leaders can be effective messengers for promoting peace.

AB  - Exposure to a single report about terrorism in the mass media can trigger a range of emotional and political reactions. The consequences of exposure to several terrorism reports in row, however, are a matter of controversy. We examine the effects of prolonged terrorism coverage using an experimental design that combines self-report measures of emotions and political attitudes with instantaneous biometric data on emotions. Consistent with research on nonassociational learning, we find that exposure to multiple videos habituates people to depictions of terrorism: the longer people watch terrorism coverage, the less intense their reactions are to the images of terrorism they see. Some images and videos, however, contribute to this result more than others. This suggests that the ultimate effects of terrorism coverage depend on the interplay between the quantity and quality of reporting, not the quantity alone.

AB  - Microblog activity logs are useful to determine user's interest and sentiment towards specific and broader category of events such as natural disaster and national election. In this paper, we present a corpus model to show how personal attitudes can be predicted from social media or microblog activities for a specific domain of events such as natural disasters. More specifically, given a user's tweet and an event, the model is used to predict whether the user will be willing to help or show a positive attitude towards that event or similar events in the future. We present a new dataset related to a specific natural disaster event, i.e. Hurricane Harvey, that distinguishes user's tweets into positive and non-positive attitudes. We build Term Embeddings for Tweet (TEmT) to generate features to model personal attitudes for arbitrary user's tweets. In addition, we present sentiment analysis on the same disaster event dataset using enhanced feature learning on TEmT generated features by applying Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method by employing multiple classification techniques and comparative methods on the newly created dataset.

AB  - Nutrition care should be an integral part of general practitioners' (GPs') daily work with patients. The aim of this study was to assess the attitudes of Croatian GPs toward nutrition and nutrition care, and to evaluate the interconnection between their attitudes and implementation of nutrition care in GPs offices. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 17.0% of randomly selected GPs, from May to July of 2013, via a specially designed anonymous questionnaire. The study showed that 36.0% of the Croatian GPs had satisfactory number of positive attitudes (5 or more) toward nutrition and nutrition care. There was statistically significant difference in the median number of positive attitudes based on the additional education of GPs in nutrition and their ailment from chronic diseases (p < 0.001 and p = 0.022, respectively). The Spearman rank correlation between GPs' attitudes toward nutrition and nutrition care and their practice, i.e., the implementation of nutrition care in GPs' everyday work with patients was r(s) = 0.235 (p < 0.001). In order to provide nutrition care in GPs' offices in Croatia, strategies for changing GPs' attitudes toward nutrition and nutrition care are needed.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that the most important factor explaining opinions on European Union issues is attitudes towards immigrants. Two arguments are given to explain this effect. We contend that these arguments are both built on the idea that people with anti-immigrant attitudes frame other Europeans as an out-group. We then test the validity of these arguments by measuring how respondents in a voter survey frame the issue of Turkish membership. We find that framing the issue in terms of out-groups indeed mediates the effect of anti-immigrant attitudes on support for Turkish membership. This finding offers new insights into why levels of public support vary over different EU issues, because opposition is likely to increase when an issue is more easily framed in terms of out-groups.

AB  - Pornography and attitude change studies most often adopt a sexual scripting (SS) perspective. The moral incongruence (MI) perspective on pornography has gained prominence in recent years, however, and may lead to differential predictions from the SS approach. Specifically, a detailed reading of MI and SS papers reveals the potential for discrepant predictions about the effect of pornography on sexual permissiveness, one of the most studied outcomes in pornography research. From an SS perspective, pornography use increases sexual permissiveness, but the preexisting traditional sexual scripts of the religious lessen the magnitude of this effect. Alternatively, the MI perspective implies the possibility that religious persons become more opposed to permissive sexuality as a result of their pornography use, as a way to mitigate the cognitive dissonance they feel for engaging in a sexual behavior proscribed by their faith tradition. The present study explored these divergent possibilities using nationally representative U.S. data. Across four meta-samples and four indicators of sexual permissiveness, religious nonviewers of pornography were the least sexually permissive, followed by religious viewers, nonreligious nonviewers, and nonreligious viewers. These results were robust over time and maintained after adjusting for demographics. For theorizing about pornography, religiosity, and sexual permissiveness, these results suggest that an SS approach may be preferable to an MI approach. The importance of continued research using both the SS and MI perspectives is discussed, however, emphasizing that the present study extrapolated a potential prediction from MI rather than a formal postulate put forth by the model's creators.

AB  - This research used a path analysis model to explore the degree to which reliance on off-line and online media, off-line and online discussion of political issues, as well as political attitudes predict whether an individual will engage in selective exposure to political websites. The study also looked at selective avoidance of contradictory information on websites. The results indicate that respondents did indeed practice selective exposure when accessing information on political websites, especially among those who are politically active online and those who rely heavily on websites and blogs for political information. However, the results showed that selective avoidance did not occur, with those exhibiting increased political interest and online participation significantly less likely to avoid information that challenges their views.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of authentic assessment on student satisfaction and promoting behaviour. The sample comprised 120 students enrolled in an undergraduate business programme. A model was proposed and tested using conditional process analysis. It was found that authentic assessments are positively related to student satisfaction and promoting behaviour. It was found that student satisfaction mediated the relationship between authentic assessments and promoting behaviour. Moreover, the effects of authentic assessment are stronger among students who are highly career-oriented than those who are less career-oriented. The implications for higher education institutions are discussed. The key contribution of the research is in providing support for the precept that authentic assessments could drive students' positive attitudes and behavioural intentions.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to investigate the professional competence and attitude of library personnel towards digital services in selected university libraries in Nigeria. Despite the evolution of digital technologies in university libraries, as well as massive investment and research on digital libraries particularly in developed countries, it has been observed that many university libraries in Nigeria are still relatively reliant on traditional library services which no longer serve and satisfy the twenty-first-century users' needs.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The population of the study comprised all the 196 library personnel from the 5 purposively selected university libraries in Nigeria. The total enumeration sampling method was adopted; while the questionnaire was the main instrument for data collection.
   Findings
   The findings of the study revealed that internet service was the most available digital service in libraries. It further revealed that most of the library personnel have requisite proficiency skills in basic computer operations. However, inadequate power supply was the major problem affecting digital services in the university libraries.
   Research limitations/implications
   The study is limited to a specific geographical area and selected university libraries in Ogun State, Nigeria. Accordingly, further studies need to be carried out on the same or similar subject matter, in other states or regions in Nigeria.
   Practical implications
   The need for library personnel to acquire relevant information and communication technology skills and develop a positive attitude that will enable them to render effective digital library services in the university libraries. Apart from this, university libraries should also strive to train users on how to access digital services in the libraries.
   Originality/value
   This study is novel, in the sense that it is the first of its kind to examine the professional competence and attitude of library personnel towards digital services in university libraries in Nigeria. The paper reported the necessary skills that library staffs need to demonstrate to effectively use various digital resources in the libraries to meet the information needs of their users.

AB  - Rejection by parents is an important aspect of child maltreatment. Altered neural responses to social rejection have been observed in maltreated individuals. The current study is the first to examine the impact of experienced and perpetrated abuse and neglect on neural responses to social exclusion by strangers versus family using a multigenerational family design, including 144 participants. The role of neural reactivity to social exclusion in the intergenerational transmission of maltreatment was also examined. Exclusion by strangers was especially associated with increased activation in the left insula, while exclusion by a family member was mainly associated with increased activation in the ACC. Neural reactivity to social exclusion by strangers in the insula, ACC and dmPFC, was associated with experienced maltreatment but not with perpetrated maltreatment. In abusive parents, altered neural reactivity during exclusion was found in other brain areas, indicating different neural correlates of experienced and perpetrated maltreatment. Hence, no mechanisms could be identified that are involved in the transmission of maltreatment. Hypersensitivity to social rejection by strangers in neglected individuals underscores the importance to distinguish between effects of abuse and neglect and suggests that the impact of experiencing rejection and maltreatment by your own parents extends beyond the family context.

AB  - One important focus for science education researchers over many years has been the attempts to replace students' commonsense and non-scientific explanations of various phenomena by scientific explanations. The approach we adopted almost three decades ago was conceptual mediation, and this was shown to have a considerable level of success with both conceptual and attitudinal change. However, since that time, advances have been made in the application of both cognitive science and neuroscience to science learning. In particular, evidence has accumulated that, rather than the replacement of the commonsense view, the reality is that learners develop a conceptual profile which includes both the commonsense and the scientific. If this is the case, instead of focussing on conceptual replacement, science educators need to aim more actively at strengthening the learner's executive processes which select contextually appropriate responses and inhibit inappropriate ones. In this paper, the initial development, theoretical basis and the practical applications of conceptual mediation are introduced, following which, these are re-examined in the light of more recent findings. Within this discussion, several potential links to recent cognitive and neuroscientific research are drawn, and these raise issues for further research into the most appropriate teaching approaches for tackling existing non-scientific conceptions.

AB  - Past research indicates that being religious is frequently motivated by the need to avoid uncertainty and associated with prejudice against value-violating groups. The present research clarifies these previous findings and shows for the first time a causal link between a sense of uncertainty and group attitudes through religiosity and the perception of the target group's mindset. Study 1 demonstrates that belief in God is associated with uncertainty avoidance and increases prejudice against value-violating groups, but simultaneously increases positive attitudes towards value-consistent groups. Study 2 demonstrates experimentally that a sense of uncertainty shapes intergroup attitudes when the relationship is mediated through the belief in God and the perception that a target group actually violated perceivers' values. The results corroborate and broaden previous findings on religiosity, ambiguity avoidance, and prejudice and, for the first time, show a causal link between a sense of uncertainty and attitudes towards value-violating and value-consistent groups.

AB  - In current American political discourse, individuals tend to mistakenly conflate being an undocumented immigrant with being Latinx. This conflation puts Latinxs who are legal residents or citizens (Latinx-Americans) at risk of being negatively impacted by policies intended to deter undocumented immigrants. We examine whether being the target of anti-immigration policies would lead Latinx-Americans to politically engage on behalf of undocumented immigrants. Study 1 found that when Latinx-Americans were led to believe that what happens to undocumented immigrants will affect them personally (linked fate), those who were primed with greater conflation of the two groups expressed more positive attitudes toward undocumented immigrants and other Latinxs. Study 2 found that this pattern of effects extended to the willingness to engage in collective action on behalf of undocumented immigrants. Study 2 also examined the role of emotions (anger and fear) in mediating the relationship between the conflation of Latinxs with undocumented immigrants and collective action intentions. Together, the findings shed light on how current immigration policies affect relations among key subgroups within the Latinx community and the conditions under which Latinx-Americans will mobilize on behalf of undocumented immigrants.

AB  - This paper explores the role of mediated intergroup contact in improving intergroup attitudes between Italian speakers and German speakers in South Tyrol, Italy. Specifically, we examine how German-language television consumption affects attitudes towards the German-speaking group among Italian-speaking youth. The data (N = 229) were collected among Italian-speaking secondary school students in 2011. As expected, the results indicated that more German TV use was associated with more positive attitudes toward German speakers. A cognitive mediator (intergroup understanding) had a greater influence than an affective one (intergroup anxiety) in mediating the effect of TV use on attitudes. The effect of TV use on attitudes was greater among those who had less personal intergroup contact, but there were no differences in the effects of television based on variations in the local ethnolinguistic vitality of the two groups. Findings and implications are discussed, and suggestions for future research are made.

AB  - Loneliness may be a consequence of social distancing, a measure imposed by several governments to try to reduce the contagion of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite being necessary, this measure may have thus caused a rise in mental health issues, leading to higher psychological distress and symptomatology. Thus, it is also important to explore how loneliness relates to the regulation of psychological needs. This study aims to explore the relationships between loneliness, symptomatology, and the regulation of psychological needs. 142 individuals (Mage=32.7, SD=10.9), answered self-report questionnaires in a cross-sectional design. Results show that loneliness is positively correlated with symptomatology and difficulties in the regulation of psychological needs, with these relationships being mediated by psychological distress and psychological well-being. We discuss our results with a focus on loneliness and related psychopathological symptomatology, as they seem to be core factors in the regulation of psychological needs.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand how information revealed on organic food labels and perceived organic knowledge drive consumer trust and attitudes towards organic foods, which in turn together with subjective norm eventually influence subsequent purchase intentions.
   Design/methodology/approach - The questionnaire surveys were administered to customers at four urban large-scale supermarkets and three health food stores at three major cities in Taiwan. In total, 693 valid questionnaires were obtained, yielding a response rate of 81.5 per cent.
   Findings - Trust, serving as the antecedent of attitudes, significantly mediates the relationships between revealing information, perceived knowledge, and organic purchase intentions. Additionally, both attitudes towards organic foods and subjective norm significantly influence consumer organic food choices. However, the impact of perceived organic knowledge on consumer attitudes has been found to be insignificant, indicating that the increase in perceived knowledge cannot create positive attitudes towards organic foods. Thus, a focus on how to use knowledge to enhance consumer trust in organic foods is suggested as an effective marketing strategy for the organic food industry.
   Research limitations/implications - The research findings support that trust and attitudes play the mediating roles linking revealed information and perceived knowledge with organic food purchase intentions. This result is consistent with previous studies, indicating that better organic labeling information and related knowledge perceived by consumers have critical effects on consumer trust in organic foods, which in turn will influence their attitudes and intentions to purchase organic foods. However, this study also found that perceived knowledge can generate positive attitudes only when trust can be firmly built. This confirms the essential role of trust in the process of consumer organic buying intentions.
   Practical implications - First, providing credible labeling information by displaying how organic agricultural products are grown, processed, and handled, and the percentage of organic ingredients in a product is crucial to stimulate consumer trust and positive attitudes. Second, enhancing consumer trust by providing correct knowledge and credible information through diversified channels (e.g. TV, newspapers, magazines, web sites) to improve consumer organic knowledge has become the most important task for the government, organic food sectors, certifiers, and research institutions to develop positive attitudes towards organic foods. Finally, organic food sectors and marketers could use a word-of-mouth strategy and focus on promoting the benefits and accessibility of organic foods to the general public to raise the common acceptance of organic foods.
   Social implications - Organic labeling has been considered an effective measure to help consumers obtain valid and trustworthy information in the organic food market, particularly for those with limited knowledge. Therefore, the government agencies not only need to take the responsibility to set regulations for organic food/agricultural products, but also need to set labeling requirements for these products. Based on these labeling requirements, the organic certifying agents can certify organic food/agricultural products by offering organic labels that contain clear information and represent quality to consumers.
   Originality/value - This study incorporates critical factors based on related theories, including the antecedents and the outcome variables of consumer trust, to develop a more comprehensive model for better understanding of consumer organic choice behaviour. The research findings have provided implications and additional contributions to the existing theories as well as developed effective strategies for the development of the organic food market.

AB  - This article brings together analyses of the micro paradata 'by-products' from the 1967/1968 Poverty in the United Kingdom (PinUK) and 2012 Poverty and Social Exclusion in the UK (PSE) surveys to explore changes in the conditions of production over this 45 year period. We highlight technical, social and professional role continuities and changes, shaped by the institutionalisation of survey researchers, the professionalization of the field interviewer, and economisation. While there are similarities between the surveys in that field interviewers were and are at the bottom of the research hierarchy, we demonstrate an increasing segregation between the core research team and field interviewers. In PinUK the field interviewers are visible in the paper survey booklets; through their handwritten notes on codes and in written marginalia they can 'talk' to the central research team. In PSE they are absent from the computer mediated data, and from communication with the central team. We argue that, while there have been other benefits to field interviewers, their relational labour has become less visible in a shift from the exercise of observational judgement to an emphasis on standardisation. Yet, analyses of what field interviewers actually do show that they still need to deploy the same interpersonal skills and resourcefulness to secure and maintain interviews as they did 45 years previously.

AB  - The impact of knowledge on public attitudes toward scientific issues remains unclear, due in part to ill-defined differences in how research designs conceptualize knowledge. Using genetically modified foods as a framework, we explore the impacts of perceived familiarity and factual knowledge, and the moderating roles of media attention and a food-specific attitudinal variable (food consciousness), in shaping these relationships. Based on the differential effects on "negative attitudes" toward genetically modified foods, we provide further evidence that the measures of knowledge are separate concepts and argue against a one-dimensional view of scientific knowledge. We discuss implications for understanding the relationship between knowledge and science attitudes.

AB  - This study tests the effect of fake news awareness as an intervention strategy for motivating news verification behaviour among social media users in Nigeria. A quasi-experiment was utilized with 470 participants divided into two groups, comprising the control group, n = 235, and the treatment group, n = 235. Fake news awareness was found to be an effective intervention strategy used to intensify the urgency and need to verify news before sharing. Individuals exposed to fake news awareness campaigns reported a more positive attitude towards news verification, better self-efficacy towards verification and were more concerned about their reputation on social media.

AB  - This study explored the relationships between General Practitioners' (GPs) beliefs about People With Schizophrenia (PWS) and GPs' recommendations regarding restrictions for such people when in medical (nonpsychiatric) hospital, and whether these relationships were mediated by dangerousness perception. There were 322 randomly selected Italian GPs who completed a questionnaire measuring beliefs about PWS. Structural Equation Model (SEM) was used to explore the effects of these beliefs on the GPs' views about the need for restrictive rules in hospital. Thirty-1 percent of GPs firmly believed that, in medical wards, PWS should be supervised and 18% that they should be separated from other patients. SEM revealed that belief in such differential treatment was positively related to a belief that PWS need medication for the rest of their lives, and to perceptions of others' need for social distance, and of dangerousness. Dangerousness was, in turn, positively related to the belief that PWS need medication for their lives, and to a perception of the need for social distance, but negatively related to perceived capacity to report health problems. Analyses of indirect effects showed that the relationships of belief in discriminatory treatment with belief in medication for life and with perceived social distance were mediated by perceived dangerousness. GPs' attitudes about PWS appear closely with their beliefs on discriminatory behaviors in hospital, and the mediating role of dangerousness perceptions. Providing GPs with education about schizophrenia treatments and prognosis, and countering stereotypes about dangerousness, could be helpful to reduce GPs' beliefs in the need for discriminatory treatment of PWS.

AB  - With the real-time brand communications prevalent in Twitter, it has emerged as an increasingly important social technology that facilitates brand-focused electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) activities. The objective of the current research is to examine the factors which discriminate between Twitter brand followers' decisions to engage in eWOM behaviors on the site. Specifically, this study proposes that peer communication, brand-related factors, and Twitter usage motivate brand followers to share eWOM messages on Twitter. Results from an online survey showed that brand followers who serve as role-models to others, those with positive attitudes toward and relationships with brands on Twitter, those who most heavily use Twitter and follow many brands, were most likely to tweet brands. Similar patterns were found in terms of retweeting the links of brands. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating that Twitter is a socialization agent that facilitates eWOM and provides useful insights for social media marketers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Beginning with the analysis of the process of children's involvement in consumption, child's ability to understand and critically respond to an advertisement, parents' attitudes to children's advertising and possible directions and solutions to the problem of advertising to children the article empirically examines parents' attitudes towards television advertising. Research results include parents of children aged between 10-12 and indicate that parents in general have no positive attitude to advertising to children and show mild interest for the prohibition of television advertisements.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine how exposure to a presidential candidate's high engagement Instagram images influences a citizen's candidate evaluations. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected via Amazon MTurk. A 3 x 2 experimental design was employed to test the persuasive effect of exposure of the "most liked" and "most commented on" images of the top four 2016 US presidential primary candidates on a US citizen's candidate evaluation. Findings Results reveal that highly engaging Instagram images of unfamiliar presidential candidates positively influenced candidate evaluations. However, the same was not true for more well-known presidential candidates. Research limitations/implications This study was not conducted during a live campaign and only examined four of the top 2016 presidential primary candidates. Practical implications The research includes implications for marketers seeking to increase engagement and reach in Instagram marketing campaigns. This study shows that even brief exposure to a highly engaged post involving an unfamiliar person/product on social media can significantly alter evaluations of that person or product. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, no experimental designs have addressed how Instagram posts influence users' political attitudes and behaviors within the political marketing and communications literature.

AB  - Expected benefits of disruptive technologies such as self-driving vehicles may only materialize if they are publicly accepted. Acceptance increases when implementation is experienced as initial concerns become unfounded and individuals become familiar with the new technology. Fatal accidents, however, negatively affect acceptance. This paper examines citizens' acceptance of self-driving vehicles by contrasting pre-and post-implementation of a self-driving shuttle in Switzerland and before and after the first fatal accident involving a self-driving vehicle in Arizona (USA) in 2018 gaining high media attention. To gauge acceptance, a panel survey using a random sample of 1408 Swiss residents was used. The results indicate that news about the fatal accident abroad exerts a stronger effect on acceptance than experiencing a self-driving bus trial. Latent scepticism causes acceptance to decrease in the event of an accident but only lasts short term. However, acceptance levels are stable and at high levels, which also explains the comparably low familiarity effects. As public acceptance is necessary for technology transitions, this article provides policymakers practical insights on how citizens form preferences towards traffic automation and related policy regulations. More specifically, results show how attitudes change over time while residents experience a trial and the first fatal accident with the technology at hand.

AB  - Background Sex-specific and race-specific pooled cohort equations (PCEs) are recommended for estimating the 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease, with an absolute risk of more than 7.5% indicating a clinical decision threshold. We compared differences between Black and White individuals in PCE-estimated absolute cardiovascular disease risk across various plausible risk factor combinations with the aim of evaluating if using the PCE might result in different clinical decisions in Black versus White individuals with identical risk profiles.
   Methods We generated in silico patient risk profiles by combining numerical risk factors (age [5-year intervals], total cholesterol [20-mg/dl intervals], HDL cholesterol [5-mg/dl intervals], systolic blood pressure [10-mm Hg intervals]) and binary risk factors (smoking, diabetes, and antihypertensive treatment). We compared PCE-estimated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk in Black versus White individuals with identical risk profiles. We did similar comparisons using eligible participants in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) third generation cohort and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017-18.
   Findings For our in silico analysis, we evaluated 29 515 risk factor combinations for women and 30565 for men, after excluding profiles that generated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk estimates below 1% or above 30%. There were 6357 risk profiles associated with 10-year cardiovascular disease risk above 7.5% for Black men but not for White men (median risk difference [RD] 6.25%, range 0.15-22.8; median relative risk [RR] 2.40, range 1.02-12.6). There were 391 profiles with 10-year cardiovascular disease risk above 7.5% for White men but not Black men (median RD 2.68%, range 0.07-16.9%; median RR 1.42, range 1.01-3.57). There were 6543 risk profiles associated with 10-year estimated cardiovascular disease risk above 7.5% for Black women but not for White women (median RD 6.14%, range 0.35-26.8%; median RR 2.29, range 1.05-12.6). There were 318 profiles with 10-year cardiovascular disease risk above 7.5% for White women but not Black women (median RD 3.71%, range 0.22-204%; median RR 1.66, range 1.03-5.46). For the population-based samples, we calculated the PCE-based 10-year cardiovascular disease risk for 1272 eligible participants (378 women; median age 48 years [IQR 44-52]; 100% White) in the FHS third generation cohort and 550 participants (223 women [36.8% Black] and 327 men [40.4% Black]; median age 61 years [IQR 52-67]) in the NHANES cohort. The population-based samples showed similar risk differences to that of the in silico analyses.
   Interpretation The PCE might generate substantially divergent cardiovascular disease risk estimates for Black versus White individuals with identical risk profiles, which could introduce race-related variations in dinical recommendations for cardiovascular disease prevention.

AB  - It can be argued that multimodal digital literacy practices promote the development of literacy skills needed for today's world without being constrained to one mode of learning. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the employment of multimodal practices during instruction within EFL classrooms in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is minimal and fraught with obstacles to its effective utilization. It is, therefore, important to determine whether this is the case and, if so, to develop strategies that would ameliorate this situation. This study, therefore, sought to identify KSA postsecondary EFL instructors' self-reporting of their use of various types of technology, computer software, and online software; the different teaching/learning and assessment strategies that they employ; the obstacles they face with the use of technology in their classrooms; and their beliefs about the use of multimodal digital literacy practices for teaching and learning. The study, which was based on the premises of social semiotic theory, utilized a mixed-methods design from which survey and focus group interview data were triangulated. The findings demonstrated that while most postsecondary EFL instructors have a strong positive attitude towards multimodal digital literacy practices and make robust use of specific types of technology and software programs, obstacles prevent these practices from being more widely and frequently deployed in the KSA. Suggestions for how to make a transformation to a more pronounced use of multimodal practices happen and the limitations to the study are also presented.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although higher education and healthier practices are positively associated, the explanatory mechanisms for this association remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to better understand mechanisms underlying this association by examining maternal adherence to 2 health-promoting infant care practices: supine placement and breastfeeding.
   METHODS: We analyzed nationally representative data from the Study of Attitudes and Factors Effecting Infant Care, which surveyed US mothers after infant birth and 2 months thereafter. Using the Theory of Planned Behavior as a framework, we used structural equation models to elucidate mediational pathways from maternal education to supine infant placement or any breastfeeding.
   RESULTS: Data from 3297 mothers demonstrated 77.0% of infants usually were placed supine, and 57.8% received any breastfeeding. The overall direct effect of maternal educational level on supine placement and any breastfeeding was odds ratio (OR) 1.31 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11 -1.54) and OR 2.82 ( 95% CI 2.35-3.37), respectively. In pathway analyses, the strongest associations with both supine position and breastfeeding were seen with positive attitudes (supine: aOR 18.96, 95% CI 9.00-39.92; breastfeeding: aOR 3.86, 95% CI 2.19-6.82) and positive social norms (supine: aOR 6.69, 95% CI 4.52-9.89; breastfeeding: aOR 5.17, 95% CI 4.28-6.23). Mothers with more education had higher odds of both positive attitudes and positive norms for the 2 practices.
   CONCLUSIONS: The associations linking educational attainment with health practices are intricate, with multiple mediating pathways. Attitudes and social norms are powerful forces that mediate the association between maternal educational attainment and both infant supine positioning and breastfeeding, and may be important mediators for other health behaviors.

AB  - Despite empathy's importance for promoting social interactions, neuroimaging research has largely overlooked empathy during social experiences. Here, we examined neural activity during empathy for social exclusion and assessed how empathy-related neural processes might relate to subsequent prosocial behavior toward the excluded victim. During an fMRI scan, participants observed one person being excluded by two others, and afterwards sent emails to each of these 'people.' Later, a group of raters assessed how prosocial (e.g., helpful, comforting) the emails were. Observing exclusion (vs. inclusion) activated regions associated with mentalizing (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus), and highly empathic individuals activated both mentalizing regions and social pain-related regions (anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex). Additionally, the empathy-related activity in the anterior insula and medial prefrontal cortex was associated with later prosocial behavior toward the victim, and exploratory mediation analyses indicated that medial prefrontal cortex activity, in particular, may support the link between trait empathy and prosocial behavior. Overall, findings suggest that empathy-related neural responses to social experiences may promote spontaneous prosocial treatment of those in need. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite having numerous Chinese language varieties and non-Chinese ethnic minority languages, China is often considered a monolingual nation (Liang, Sihua. 2015.Language Attitudes and Identities in Multilingual China: A Linguistic Ethnography. London: Springer, 154). The country's strong monolingual language policy heavily promotes a single standard language - Putonghua. Recently, scholars have begun to investigate 'regional Putonghua' varieties, contact varieties that have emerged from standard language promotion and community second language acquisition (e.g. Xiao, Jinsong. 2007. "Putonghua Zhongjieyu Yanjiu Shuping."Journal of Yunyang Normal College27 (2): 119-122). This paper analyses data collected from Weibo, China's online microblogging site, to investigate the language ideologies surrounding these 'non-standard' regional varieties. Two cities (Ningbo and Shanghai) and their local Putonghua varieties are examined: the cities share a similar linguistic background but Shanghai is more economically advanced than its neighbouring city Ningbo, and the language varieties in Shanghai are also believed to have more prestige (Zhou, Minglang. 2001. "The Spread of Putonghua and Language Attitude Changes in Shanghai and Guangzhou, China."Journal of Asian Pacific Communication11 (2): 231-253). Discourse analysis on Weibo posts allows us to show how regional Putonghua varieties are portrayed and perceived by laypeople and how they exist as 'non-standard' varieties in the shadow of the strong standard language ideology. These 'non-standard' varieties are associated with rich language ideologies and social meanings and their links to both negative cultural stereotypes and positive local identities often associated with vernacular varieties are also discussed.

AB  - Social media is often used to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and engage the public, which can change the public's attitudes and behaviors and may be used to benefit conservation. Moreover, widespread social media use provides an alternative data sourcing platform to inexpensively access countless potential respondents. However, social media data have rarely been used in conservation regardless of the potential benefit to conservation science and practice. We administered a questionnaire via the #CougarOrNot Twitter game, a mountain lion-focused social media campaign, during 26 December 2016 through 16 February 2018, to access a large respondent sample (n = 1,481) and assess a subset of social media users' attitudes toward mountain lions in North America. We then used cumulative link models in an information theoretic approach to gauge the association between respondent level of engagement with #CougarOrNot and other sociodemographic predictors with user attitudes toward mountain lions. Respondent attitudes toward mountain lions were largely positive (83%), with frequent participants in #CougarOrNot, females, pet owners, nonconsumptive recreators, and households with fewer children exhibiting positive attitudes. #CougarOrNot participation had a stronger correlation with respondent attitudes toward mountain lions than commonly used predictors employed in prior studies (i.e. age, education level, livestock ownership). #CougarOrNot may promote positive attitudes toward mountain lions, though additional research is needed to determine the direct effects of playing the game. Stakeholders interested in mountain lion conservation or other conservation topics could be identified via social media networks attached to specific outreach campaigns and possibly mobilized to support conservation actions that aid mountain lions and conservation in general.

AB  - Some countries have replaced face-to-face education with distance education in response to the coronavirus. This form of distance education differs from conventional distance education: being suddenly, unreadily and forcefully implemented, invading schooling and constituting a globally discussed phenomenon. This article builds a conceptual framework for this education, addressing the question: What are the ramifications of implementing distance education amid coronavirus? It targets Arab culture, although globalisation and the media may have harmonised any substantial cross-cultural variations. Various ramifications have emerged through analysing social-media posts, online classes and interviews. Concerning social and cultural ramifications, some may, for ideological considerations, tolerate, support, reject or subvert this education through campaigning, rumour and humour. Regarding pedagogical and psychological ramifications, unreadiness and incompetence may compromise education. Additionally, staying home may entail problems (pandemic-related stress, anxiety, depression, domestic violence, divorce and pregnancy), preventing students and teachers from learning and teaching. Concerning procedural and logistical ramifications, some Arab contexts may be digitally readier than non-Arab contexts. Additionally, stakeholders may intensify efforts to profit, ethically or unethically, from the over demand for this education. Distance education is one of several social distancing initiatives, which Arabs have welcomed despite their well-rooted social closeness, bonding to debond, forming unorthodox 'distanceship'.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to develop a model that integrates self-conscious emotions (i.e. anticipated guilt and anticipated pride) alongside the theory of planned behavior's key explanatory factors to challenge the idea that recycling behavior is driven mainly by cognitive factors. The model is empirically validated in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a region where research are lacking despite generating one of the highest per capita solid waste and holding one of the lowest recycling rates.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The data was collected from the general public in the UAE using a two-wave survey (n = 287). The first wave of data collection measured the constructs except for the actual recycling behavior. The second wave assessed the respondent's self-reported recycling behavior for the previous fortnight.
   Findings
   Anticipated guilt, subjective norms, perceived effort and recycling knowledge are the main drivers of the intention to recycle. The latter impacts the actual recycling behavior positively. Attitude toward recycling and anticipated pride failed to predict the intention to recycle. Awareness of consequences triggers only anticipated pride, while the degree of concern is a significant predictor of both anticipated pride and guilt.
   Practical implications
   One key implication of this research is that governments in the Middle East have not only to focus on cognitive factors but also emotions to promote recycling behavior.
   Originality/value
   This study adds to the pro-environmental literature by showing that the decision to recycle is not only based on cognitive factors but also anticipated guilt. It is also one of the first that explore recycling behavior in the UAE.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of people and has forced businesses to develop different ways of doing businesses. Several businesses have implemented social responsibility activities. With social distancing keeping many people at home, online and digital platforms have become one of the most important mechanisms for businesses undertakings and implementing those social responsibility initiatives and activities - digital social responsibility (DSR). The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships of electronic wordof-mouth (eWOM) intentions and customer engagement with DSR in social media with attitude toward DSR as the antecedent during COVID-19 social distancing situation in Thailand. The study employs a quantitative research method where sampling method is followed by convenience sampling technique, and study data is collected through survey questionnaire with social media users who have experiences with firms' online social responsibility initiatives. Based the samples of 123 respondents, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) has been used for analysis. The results show that attitudes toward DSR in social media significantly influence electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) intentions and have a significant effect on customer engagement with DSR in social media. The mediation analysis also revealed that eWOM intention partially mediated the relation between attitudes toward DSR in social media and customer engagement.

AB  - This study attempts to find out the challenges students' face in learning English as a foreign language when using E-learning system at University of Bisha. It also investigates whether using E-learning is beneficial to EFL students in their learning English to the degree anticipated. There are many challenges face both teachers and students during use E-learning. These challenges include academic, technological; and administrative challenges. The study sample included 36 teaching staff and 261 EFL students at University of Bisha - English department. To collect data required, the researcher developed questionnaires that consist of three domains for both teaching staff and students separately. The study results show that there are no significant differences between EFL students (males and females) of E-learning activities. Therefore, it argued that all domains of teaching staff and students' challenges could not predict academic achievement. The findings reveal that some factors such as academic, administrative, and technical challenges regarding E-learning were the main challenges of E-learning at University of Bisha. The results also show that students aware of the benefits of using E-learning. They perceive themselves as having a highly positive attitude towards E-learning in English. However, the main advantage can be used anywhere, anytime, and the E-learning system can adapt to the aims of improving communication and enriching students' learning experiences

AB  - Although popular music and politics have been linked in various contexts, surprisingly little is known about whether and how popular songs can influence political attitudes. The present study provides initial empirical evidence that popular music affects public opinion by altering the standards for subsequent political judgments. Using an experiment of a national sample, the current study demonstrates that Lady Gaga's highly popularized song, "Born This Way," primes genetic explanations of homosexuality in citizens' ensuing evaluations of gay rights issues. The findings revealed that vocalized lyrics are the key element of the priming effect among other musical components.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the attitude to and perception of transvaginal sonography (TVS) among Nigerian women of mixed educational status in order to ascertain factors that may prevent them from submitting to TVS when recommended.
   METHODS: A Cross-sectional survey was adopted for the study. Subjects were enrolled from one missionary, one government and eight private hospitals. The instruments for data collection were visual analogue scale (VAS), to ascertain patients' pain/discomfort experience, and a researcher-developed semi-structured questionnaire. The level of pain/discomfort on the VAS was categorized into four on a scale of 100. The categories were: 0-5 (no pain), 6-40 (mild pain), 41-74 (moderate pain), and 75-100 (severe pain).
   RESULTS: The majority (50.6%) of the respondents who attained secondary education had positive attitude to TVS. The majority majority of the respondents (63.1%) preferred female sonographers. A majority of the respondents (54.1%) perceived TVS as not embarrassing, 78% did not consider it stressful, 96.9% reported that the sonographers were professional, 46.7% felt that a chaperon was needed, 98.4% reported there was enough privacy and 84.7% reported they needed prior information. Most of the respondents (82%) were willing to consent to TVS in future, 90.5% reported no pain, 8.6% reported mild pain/discomfort and 0.9% reported moderate pain.
   CONCLUSIONS: Majority of our respondents had a positive attitude to TVS and were willing to consent to TVS in future, hence it was acceptable to them. It was however observed that acceptability increased with increasing education.

AB  - Information and communication technologies enable migrants to maintain bonds with multiple communities. Little is known about the association between migrants' connections to their country of origin and different integration practices in online and offline communities in the receiving society. We draw on a survey conducted amongst migrants in Iceland (N = 2,139) and conduct three regression analyses to identify determinants of migrants' use of media and social media from their country of origin. Contrary to other studies, we do not find evidence of reactive transnationalism (i.e., migrants seeking out connections to their places of origin due to dissatisfaction with life in the receiving society) as a response to negative attitudes towards the receiving society. We identify distinct patterns of online and offline integration: Migrants with frequent contact with their countries of origin are less integrated locally in terms of offline activities. However, they are more integrated in digital communities of the receiving society, and use receiving-country media more frequently, thus following a strategy of digital biculturalism.

AB  - ObjectiveTo assess community practices related to COVID-19 prevention and its associated factors during the early introduction of the disease to the study area.Setting and participantsA community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region, Ethiopia. Ten zonal towns with high population density and mobility and 1239 participants were included in the study.Outcome measureA semistructured questionnaire was uploaded to SurveyCTO data collection system with security patterns. Mask usage was assessed by observation, while social distancing and handwashing were assessed by interview. Data were collected by health professionals who have Bachelor of Science degree and above and analysed using SPSS V.25. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were performed.ResultsFrom 1239 individuals, about half, 657 (53%), of respondents were women and about two-thirds, 795 (64.2%), were married. Nearly 9 out of 10 (90.3%) and about 8 out of 10 (82.0%) respondents reported that they frequently wash hands with soap and/or use sanitiser and keep social distancing as means to prevent COVID-19, respectively. Less than three-fifths (57.8%) of respondents wore masks during the interview. In summary, about half (48.9%) of respondents were practising the three recommended methods (social distancing, handwashing and wearing masks). Sex, educational status, family size and overall knowledge about COVID-19 were associated with practising COVID-19 prevention measures.ConclusionCOVID-19 prevention practice was low as only about half of participants were practising social distancing, handwashing and wearing masks. Although awareness creation has been implemented through different forms of media, it should be strengthened in different local languages. Concerned government bodies should strictly follow using masks in public gatherings.

AB  - Introduction There are significant differences in the phenotype of CRC by race in the U.S. A similar CRC phenotype-race relationship also appears to exist in South Africa (SA). However, there is a paucity of comparative data on the presentation and survival of CRC in sub-Saharan African by country of origin or race. This study compares clinicopathologic variables between CRC patients in Nigeria and SA. Methods From a prospective CRC database, consecutive patients diagnosed between September, 2013 and October, 2018 from the African Research Group for Oncology in South West Nigeria were compared to consecutive patients diagnosed from January, 2016 to October, 2018 from the Colorectal Cancer in South Africa database. Patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma were included. Patients were excluded if they had in-situ disease or no histological diagnosis. Clinical outcomes were calculated from the date of presentation. National census categories were used to define self-reported race in SA. Results The mean age at presentation in Nigeria (n = 347) was 54.1 years (SD 15.5) compared to 56.8 (SD 13.7) in SA (n = 534). The median age among Black SA (BSA) patients was significantly lower than the median age among White SA (WSA) patients (55 vs. 63, p < 0.001). Right-sided colon cancer was more common in Nigerian (27.4%) and BSA (21.2%) patients compared to WSA patients (15.2%, p < 0.001). Nigerian (39.1%) and BSA (16.7%) patients were also more likely to present with mucinous histology than WSA patients (4.9%, p < 0.001). There was a significant difference in the stage-at-presentation between the cohorts, with a large burden of stage IV disease in the Nigerian cohort (52.6%). Adjusting for stage-at-presentation, there was a significant difference in the median overall survival between country and racial cohorts. Conclusion There are significant differences in the phenotype of CRC between Nigeria and SA. Nigerian and BSA patients, appear to share characteristics that are different than those of WSA patients. Larger series with tissue banking and next-generation sequencing are needed to better delineate these observed differences.

AB  - For performing arts education, Sage on the stage and Learn from the Masters were halted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and so did everything else. All lectures, tutorials and other face-to-face skill-based training sections were cancelled and were replaced by the online model. Such a model was only seen as one of the supplementary components for performing arts education in the past. From January 2020, this online pedagogy was inevitably placed to surmount the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The social distancing measures demanded the blended pedagogy into a new online approach, in which the traditional face-to-face teaching to be replaced by synchronous online learning (facilitated by technologies such as Zoom, Cisco Webex, Google Class, Panopto etc.). Meanwhile, to offer opportunities for cognitive participation which allows students to process the learning and be reflective, webinar and innovative performance projects were launched from the concept of 'flipped classroom and outcome-based education.' This mixed approach (blended learning, flipped classroom, and outcome-based education) is described as 'hybrid learning' in this study.
   The 'hybrid learning' pedagogy is implemented at the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts (HKAPA) for all teaching activities in the 2nd semester 2020/2021 to overcome the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. A questionnaire survey about how it affected the performing arts education, and how the new pedagogy was implemented took place in July 2020. The survey results from both the teachers (76) and students (163) share lessons, insights, and new understandings on teaching and learning online. Hybrid learning has been widely investigated and researched, yet study on hybrid learning in performing arts such as creative art, theatre art and music, remains insufficient. This study fills the research gap.

AB  - Purpose. Despite a high prevalence of voluntary home smoking bans and laws protecting Californians from exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) in the workplace, many Hispanic/Latino (H/L) residents of multiunit housing (MUH) are potentially exposed to SHS from neighboring apartments. An advocacy/policy intervention was implemented to reduce tobacco-related health disparities by encouraging H/L living in MUH to implement voluntary policies that reduce exposure to SHS. This article presents findings from qualitative and quantitative data collected during development of the intervention, as well as preliminary results of the intervention.
   Design, Setting, and Subjects. MUH residents in Southern California participated in focus groups (n = 48), door-to-door surveys (n = 142), and a telephone survey (n = 409).
   Measures. Exposure to SHS, attitudes toward SHS, and attitudes toward policies restricting SHS in MUH were assessed.
   Results. H/L MUH residents reported high levels of exposure to SHS and little ability to protect themselves and their families from SHS. Respondents expressed positive attitudes toward adopting antismoking policies in MUH, but they also feared retaliation by smokers. The cultural values of familismo, respeto, simpatia, and personalism influenced their motivation to protect their families from SHS as well as their reluctance to ask their neighbors to refrain from smoking. Nonsmokers were more likely to favor complete indoor and outdoor smoking bans in MUH, whereas smokers were more likely to favor separate smoking areas. The Regale Salad advocacy/policy intervention, implemented to reduce SHS exposure, prompted the passage of seven voluntary policies in apartment complexes in Southern California to prevent smoking in MUH.
   Conclusions. H/L in California support voluntary policies, local ordinances, and state laws that prevent exposure to SHS in MULL especially those that are consistent with H/L cultural values and norms for interpersonal communication. (Am J Health Promot 2011;25[5 Supplement]:S82-S90.)

AB  - Background: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a serious public health concern facing adolescents and young adults worldwide. Despite growing concern that accessing NSSI content on the internet may negatively influence perceptions toward NSSI recovery, no studies have examined actual impacts.
   Objectives: This experimental pilot study assessed the impact of exposure to hopeless versus hopeful peer messages on perceptions toward NSSI recovery. It was hypothesized that exposure to hopeless messages would lead to more negative perceptions about NSSI recovery whereas the opposite would occur for hopeful messages.
   Methods: We developed fictional peer comments embedded in a screenshot of an NSSI-themed YouTube video and randomly assigned participants to either hopeless or hopeful recovery-oriented comments. Participants' attitudes toward NSSI recovery, recovery-oriented subjective norms, and recovery self-efficacy were measured pre- and post-exposure using an online questionnaire.
   Results: Sixty-one participants with a self-reported NSSI history (mean age 20.89 years) completed the online survey. There was a statistically significant effect for attitudes toward recovery. Within the hopeful comment condition, there was an increase in positive attitudes toward recovery and in recovery-oriented subjective norms. Participants exposed to hopeless peer messages did not report an increase in hopeless attitudes toward NSSI recovery.
   Conclusions: Our pilot study indicated that exposure to hopeful online messages improved positive attitudes toward recovery and recovery-oriented subjective norms, while exposure to hopeless messages did not increase hopeless attitudes. Future research on the impacts of online peer comments on one's attitude toward NSSI recovery and support-seeking behavior could further inform practices and policies.

AB  - Commercials influence our attitudes and consumer behavior. We investigated whether mimicking product presenters in commercials adds to positive effects on attitudes and behavioral consumer intentions. Participants watched TV commercials and were instructed to mimic or not to mimic the movements of the model presenting a product. Then we measured their attitude toward the products (Studies 1 and 2) and their behavioral intention to buy the products (Study 2). Results revealed that mimickers had a more positive attitude toward the presented products and had more intention to buy the products than non-mimickers. Furthermore we demonstrated that the mimicry effect on behavioral intention was mediated by attitudes. Thus mimicry makes products presented in a persuasive setting more attractive to us, which increases the intention to buy these products.

TI  - Pandemic infection rates are deterministic but cannot be modeled
T2  - AIP ADVANCES
LA  - English
AB  - The covid-19 infection rates for a large number of infections collected from a large number of different sites are well defined with a negligible scatter. The simplest invertible iterated map, exponential growth and decay, emerges from country-wide histograms whenever Tchebychev's inequality is satisfied to within several decimal places. This is one point. Another is that failed covid-19 pandemic model predictions have been reported repeatedly by the news media. Model predictions fail because the observed infection rates are beyond modeling: any model that uses fixed rates or uses memory or averages of past rates cannot reproduce the data on active infections. When those possibilities are ruled out, then little is left. Under lockdown and social distancing, the rates unfold daily in small but unforeseeable steps, they are algorithmically complex. We can, however, use two days in the daily data, today and any single day in the past (generally yesterday), to make a useful forecast of future infections. No model provides results better than this simple forecast. We analyze the actual doubling times for covid-19 data and compare them with our predicted doubling times. Flattening and peaking are precisely defined. We identify and study the separate effects of social distancing vs recoveries in the daily infection rates. Social distancing can only cause flattening but recoveries are required in order for the active infections to peak and decay. Three models and their predictions are analyzed. Pandemic data for Austria, Germany, Italy, the USA, the UK, Finland, China, Taiwan, and Sweden are discussed.

AB  - The exceptional levels of political polarization, party system fragmentation, and electoral volatility that Spain is currently experiencing, all recommend analysing the origins of these patterns. We employ a unique combination of individual-level survey and Twitter activity data pertaining to a sample of users of the Voting Advice Application we launched during the transformative 2015 Spanish general elections campaign to investigate the ideological determinants of individuals' online network building. Our results demonstrate that, among those following online parties/candidates' profiles, political promiscuity is the most common behaviour, though this behaviour depends heavily on users' broader online and offline political attitudes.

AB  - The rise of digital media has increased the opportunities for individuals to self-select political content online. This development has stimulated empirical research on how people select political information, especially when political beliefs are at stake. In the present paper, we tested a series of theory-derived assumptions about antecedents and consequences of selective exposure to confirmative political information and opinions in the digital arena. We conducted an online survey with German Internet users (N = 897, April 2016) and assessed political attitudes, media use and general beliefs in the context of the so-called "migration crisis". 28% of the participants in our sample reported exposure to a confirmative information environment. They are more likely to hear or read about political opinions on migration and political asylum that are similar to their own compared to cross-cutting content. We found no evidence for the assumption that the technological affordances of the Internet foster this form of selective political exposure. Instead, our analyses indicate that conservatism is a positive predictor of selecting confirmative information environments when it comes to migration and political asylum. We also gathered evidence that this relation is mediated by perceived threat and that selective political exposure is linked to truly false consensus beliefs. Our findings inform supply- and demand-side explanations of selective political exposure online. We discuss the relevance for psychological theories about the motivational underpinnings of selective exposure.

AB  - In their 2011 piece, Smith et al. argue that there is a set of fundamental or bedrock values that predict ideology and that are strongly influenced by genetics. These values are considered universal, stable, and less susceptible to environmental changes. Smith et al. propose a scale to measure such values: the Society Works Best Index (SWBI). This is an important contribution, but the SWBI requires further evaluation. Using novel panel data, we evaluate the measure, improve on the empirical application with a national panel, and suggest improvements in the scale. We find that the SWBI is no more stable than other measures of ideology and that the observed changes are attributed to measurement error and environmental factors. Furthermore, like many other political attitudes, its predictive power is mediated by levels of political interest.

AB  - Background: This study assessed psychosocial predictors of U.S. adults' willingness to get a future COVID-19 vaccine and whether these predictors differ under an emergency use authorization (EUA) release of the vaccine.
   Methods: A survey of 788 U.S. adults was conducted to explore the relationships between demographics and psychosocial predictors of intent to get a future COVID-19 vaccine as well as willingness to get such a vaccine under EUA.
   Results: Significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake intentions were education, having insurance, scoring high on subjective norms, a positive attitude toward the vaccine, as well as high perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, high perceived benefits of the vaccine, scoring low on barriers to the vaccine, and scoring high on self-efficacy. Predictors of willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine under EUA were age, race/ethnicity, positive subjective norms, high perceived behavioral control, positive attitudes toward the vaccine, as well as high perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, high perceived benefits of the vaccine, low barriers to the vaccine, and scoring high on self-efficacy for getting the vaccine. Concerns about rushed vaccine development appear to reduce vaccine uptake intent, as well as willingness to get the vaccine under EUA.
   Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine-related messages should both address concerns about the vaccine and its development and reinforce benefits of the vaccine (both factors significant in both models).
   Vaccine efforts may need to go beyond just communications campaigns correcting misinformation about a COVID-19 vaccine to also focus on re-establishing public trust in government agencies.

KW  - WOMEN
AB  - This paper examines whetherand if so howa 2002 European Directive on sexual harassment has changed the practice and content of sexual harassment law in France. It finds that the European Directive shaped how French courts address sexual harassment and informed the content of a new sexual harassment law France passed in 2012. Yet, its influence has been mediated by dominant national attitudes about: (1) the nature of sexual harassment, (2) which legal institutions are best suited to address it, and (3) the character of women who claim to have been harassed. This paper further suggests that news reporting on a 2011 arrest of a French politician for sexual assault led to more positive attitudes about sexual harassment victims.

AB  - Children of binational couples are often raised in the community of one of the parents and, thus, have limited exposure to the language of the other parent. This study focuses on a British/Moroccan family in the UK, where English is the dominant home language and Moroccan Arabic is the 'other' language. Analysis of 'live' family conversations at home in the UK and 'online' conversations with cousins in Morocco indicate that using Moroccan Arabic at home is often seen as a chore, whereas in online conversations it is seen as fun. The use of computer-mediated communication appears to have contributed to a more positive attitude towards using the language and developing a bilingual identity.

AB  - This mixed-methods study aims to examine the mediating role of attitude toward English varieties in the relationship between Informal Digital Learning of English (IDLE) and perceptions of using English as an International Language (EIL) materials in pre-service English teachers. We collected and analyzed survey data from 434 Indonesian EFL pre-service teachers, using the Jamovi programme. Survey results showed that both receptive and productive IDLE activities had a significant impact on attitudes toward different forms of English, which in turn had a significant impact on views of using EIL resources. Individual interviews (n = 10) and stimulated recalls (n = 7) revealed that participation in IDLE activities (e.g. watching YouTube videos with different English accents and users) aided in maintaining a more positive attitude toward different varieties of English. As a result, pre-service EFL teachers became more open to using EIL materials, such as listening materials that employ different English accents. This study suggests that IDLE is an important factor in developing positive attitudes toward English varieties, an approach that may enable today's pre-service EFL teachers to become more open toward and tolerant of integrating EIL pedagogy into practice.

AB  - This experimental study assessed whether alcohol television storylines impact youth drinking attitudes and intentions and whether corrective epilogues can potentially moderate this impact. Television episodes were professionally produced to depict heavy drinking leading to either positive or negative consequences. The pro- and anti-alcohol episodes were shown alone or with an epilogue where a main character discussed the deleterious effects of excessive drinking. Attitudes toward drinkers and drinking intentions were measured subsequently, along with reactions to the episode and demographic data, among participants aged 14-17 using an online study. Exposure to the pro-alcohol episode was related to more positive attitudes toward drinkers. Including an epilogue after a pro-alcohol episode was related to more negative viewers' attitudes toward drinkers and lower drinking intentions compared to a pro-alcohol episode with no epilogue. By contrast, including an epilogue after an anti-alcohol episode was unrelated to attitudes toward drinkers or drinking intentions. Viewing a single television episode with a pro-alcohol message may lead to more positive attitudes toward drinkers. The finding that a brief epilogue may reduce the impact of the pro-alcohol storyline suggests easily implemented preventive strategies to counter the adverse impact of substance use portrayals in entertainment programming.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to investigate how consumers react to corporate managers publicly espousing an ideological belief regarding a social issue. In particular, this paper investigates anger derived by consumers as a mediator explaining why consumer attitudes change.
   Design/methodology/approach - An experiment was used to present respondents with a scenario about managers espousing specific ideological beliefs. All independent and dependent variables were measured. Variable relationships were analyzed utilizing general linear models to understand direct effects and bootstrapping to understand mediation.
   Findings - When made public, managers' stances can make multiple, possibly competing, ideologies salient to consumers. Consumer reaction to a stance is most positive when held ideological beliefs are competing and consumers anchor on one ideology in agreement with the manager's stance, leading to less anger and enhanced brand attitudes. When competing beliefs exist, consumers minimize the importance of dissonant beliefs. Further, preexisting brand attitudes provide a halo effect which helps to determine the amount of anger derived and any potential shift in brand attitude.
   Practical implications - This paper offers insights into when a reparative brand strategy may need to be structured after a manager's ideological stance is made public. Not all of a company's targeted demographic will take offense, and any reparative communications may need to focus on the consumer relationship with the brand rather than an outright apology.
   Originality/value - This paper adds to the literature investigating the intersection of ideology and marketing. This paper shows that there is an opportunity for managers to strategically shape marketing messages to capitalize on situations where consumers hold multiple, possibly competing ideological beliefs. Thus, this paper highlights that understanding consumers' brand attitude shifts requires a more encompassing view of ideologies, as opposed to viewing them in isolation.

AB  - As nineteenth-century etiquette books remind their readers, the basic principles of social life meant maintaining a clear and insulating space around corporal forms. Amid such normative expectations, Wharton's characters move through material worlds richly populated with objects, many of which are alluringly textured. This essay argues that a number of these objects were charged with additional associative meanings, based on the persons with whom they are most closely aligned, often their owners. Such material items become what I describe as the "proximate objects" that fascinate Wharton's characters, not only because of their sensual appeal, but also because of their combined physical availability and association with other human forms. For characters in fictions such as The Age of Innocence, Ethan Frome, and The Reef, proximate objects have the capacity to mediate human desires by providing a sense of an appropriately distanced but nevertheless material intimacy with another person as they stand in for human forms that must remain socially distanced from one another. Revealing the dynamic and sensual dimensions of the material world, the haptic encounters experienced by Wharton's characters offer insight into the materiality interwoven with human desire.

A survey was conducted with Chinese students who had studied or who were currently studying at South Korean universities. Its results showed a significant positive association between Chinese student perceptions of their relationships with host universities and their attitudes toward South Korea. In addition, their positive attitudes led to (i) intentions to purchase Korean products and (ii) policy support for the Korean government. The theoretical and practical implications of study findings are discussed from the perspectives of public diplomacy and the university's role in a highly globalized education system.

Text messaging was the most common form of technology to initiate or receive a breakup. Greater attachment anxiety predicted being the recipient of a technology-mediated dissolution. Positive attitudes towards conflict resolution predicted having initiated a breakup via technology. There were no significant differences in attachment styles or conflict resolution skills for those using text messaging to receive or initiate conflict resolution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Other than a few responses solicited by the New York Times when it published the syllabus, however, there has been little attention to the material Obama assigned or to what it suggests about Obama's approach to the law and race.
   The class began with four weeks of foundational readings followed by four weeks of student-led class discussions. The readings started by discussing the malleability of racial categories and progressed to cases from the nineteenth century on Native Americans and on slavery. The second day's readings shifted to the Reconstruction era and changes in the Constitution and statutory law, as well as the rise of the "Jim Crow" system of segregation and the response of African American intellectuals. The third class covered the Civil Rights revolution and retrenchment. It included reading from such diverse figures as Robert Bork, Martin Luther King, and Malcolm X. The fourth class, "Where Do We Go From Here?," addressed some of the enduring issues of inequality facing our nation, the fragility of the African American middle class, continuing racism against African Americans, and a plea for more understanding. After the initial four class meetings, student groups selected additional readings and led class discussions on a variety of race-related topics. The syllabus has suggested topics for the presentations and brief discussion of those topics.
   The media has called attention to President Obama's public relationship with Derrick Bell; notwithstanding the option to read Bell's summaries of cases in lieu of the actual opinions, the readings have no overt endorsement of Derrick Bell, Critical Race Theory ("CRT"), or Bell's Interest-Convergence theory. Obama included many critics of CRT and offered readings that seemingly demonstrate his hope for substantially more dialog and perhaps, ultimately, economic uplift of those labeled by some of his readings "the truly disadvantaged." Obama's use of the Martin Luther King, Jr.'s essay Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? as the title of the last group of readings suggests that Obama did not share Bell's vision of the unalterable nature of racism.
   The readings, while instructive, are just the starting point of our analysis. Obama's suggested topics encourage students to wrestle with the modern consequences of racism and to question its malleability. Thus, we suggest that the readings and group presentation topics reveal Obama, the teacher, as interested in, but not necessarily aligned with, many of the key questions of CRT. The syllabus fits with the story that Obama focuses on issues that unite Americans while he seeks equal treatment. This may reflect the future of constitutional doctrine related to race.

AB  - Previous research has shown that negative attitudes towards immigrants and support for anti-immigrant parties are observed both among those experiencing relative deprivation and those experiencing relative gratification (so called v-curve). Whereas the effect of relative deprivation is intuitive, the effect of relative gratification is more difficult to explain. Why would economic prosperity provoke negative attitudes towards immigrants? We first present correlational (Study 1) and experimental (Study 2) support for the v-curve. In Study 1, in a national Swiss referendum, a higher percentage anti-immigrant voting was found in cantons with relatively lower and relatively higher relative disposable income. In Study 2, in a hypothetical society, more opposition to 'newcomers' joining society was found among poor or above average wealth group members than among those in a moderate wealth group condition. In Study 3, we replicate this finding and also show that opposition to immigration is higher for all wealth groups when societal inequality is growing rather than declining. In a final study, we examine different forms of relative gratification and mediators of the relationship between relative gratification and opposition to immigration (i.e., identification, collective self-definition as competent and cold, and fear about future wealth). Only fear about future wealth mediates this relationship. We conclude that, paradoxically, relative gratification effects are partly due to the fear of future deprivation.

AB  - Background: International literature reports that nursing students feel unprepared when facing patients and families within dying care. They consider their curricula inadequate in teaching end-of-life care and promoting the attitudes required to care for dying patients. Findings of recent studies exploring nursing students' attitudes towards care of the dying patient are often contradictory. Objectives: To explore Italian nursing students' attitudes towards caring for dying patients. Design: A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted. Settings: The Bachelor's Degree in Nursing courses of four Universities of the Lazio Region. Participants: The sample included 1193 students. Methods: Data were collected between September 2017 and March 2018 using the Italian version of FATCOD-B-I. The differences between the mean scores were compared through t-test or ANOVA. Associations between scores and participant characteristics were evaluated through generalized linear regression. Results: The mean score of FATCOD-B-I was 115.3 (SD = 9.1). Higher scores were significantly associated with training in palliative care (p < 0.0001) and experience with terminally ill patients (p < 0.0001). Students manifested more negative attitudes when they perceived patients losing hope of recovering, and patient's family members interfering with health professionals' work. Uncertainties emerged around knowledge of opioid drugs, decision-making, concepts of death and dying, management of mourning, and relational aspects of patient care. Conclusions: Italian nursing students seem to have more positive attitudes towards care of dying patients than most other countries. They believe that caring for a terminal patient is a formative, useful experience but they do not feel adequately prepared in practice. Deeper palliative care education, integrated with practical training, would prepare students better, enabling them to discover their own human and professional capacity to relieve suffering.

AB  - A growing body of research has shown that naturalized citizens' attitudes towards immigration worsen following citizenship acquisition. Accordingly, these socially mobile individuals tend to distance themselves from their former immigrant ingroup. The present contribution explains such self-group distancing coping strategy in terms of an "ironic" procedural fairness effect. Study 1 (N = 566), a survey conducted among naturalized Swiss citizens, showed that fairness perceptions with respect to the naturalization process were indeed associated with stronger anti-immigration attitudes, and that this relationship was mediated by identification with the host nation. Next, two experiments were conducted to demonstrate the causality of the hypothesized mediation model. In Study 2 (Experiment 1; N = 248), fairness of the admission procedure (accurate vs. inaccurate) increased identification with a desirable group. In Study 3 (Experiment 2; N = 141), administration of a national identity prime evoked stronger anti-immigration attitudes. Taken together, our findings highlight a somewhat "dark side" of procedural fairness.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to theorize the heightened exposure to information via the internet can lead citizens to be more critical about political conditions in their countries because using social media increases the likelihood of being exposed to dissident information. Further, the authors argue that the degree to which information is restricted, or internet access is limited, across countries can decrease this effect simply because the likelihood of exposure to a dissident flow is diminished.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors used survey data from the 2010 Latino Barometer to estimate a series of multilevel models to test whether citizens' attitudes about the political conditions and about democracy in their respective countries worsen, and whether this effect is stronger in countries with higher internet freedom.
   Findings - The results confirm that social media use has a negative influence on citizens' attitudes about their national political conditions. In addition, respondents from those countries with more internet freedom tended to have more positive attitudes about their democracy and political conditions, generally. However, as a result of more internet freedom, the negative effects of internet and social media use on these attitudes was more pronounced in countries with more internet freedom.
   Originality/value - These results suggest that the flow of information via the internet has substantial effect on how people feel about their government. This could be consequential for political stability, particularly in countries the conditions are not favorable. That said, these results also suggest that governments can actively decrease the odds of this dissidence building by controlling the flow of information.

AB  - The growing use of storytelling as an advertising strategy for brands online poses the question of their relative effectiveness compared to more factual types of ads. In this context, this article focuses on the role of character identification and character type in the effects of narrative transportation that occur from storytelling ads. Using four experimental studies in two different contexts, two brand types, and two character types (human versus animal), the findings present a cautionary tale for the use of storytelling. By generating higher levels of narrative transportation, storytelling video ads can reduce character identification, which results in an overall decrease in positive attitude toward the brand, when using animal characters. These main findings are nuanced in the presence of joyful emotions. Implication for research and practice are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Opinion leaders can be influential in persuading their peers about news and politics, yet their potential influence has been questioned in the social media era. This study tests a theoretical model of attempts at political persuasion within social media in which highly active users ("prosumers'') consider themselves opinion leaders, which subsequently increases efforts to try and change others' political attitudes and behaviors. Using two-wave U.S. panel survey data (W-1 = 1,816; W-2 = 1,024), we find prosumers believe they are highly influential in their social networks and are both directly and indirectly more likely to try to persuade others. Our results highlight one theoretical mechanism through which engaged social media users attempt to persuade others and suggest personal influence remains viable within social media.

AB  - In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries have sought to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission by restricting population movement through social distancing interventions, thus reducing the number of contacts. Mobility data represent an important proxy measure of social distancing, and here, we characterise the relationship between transmission and mobility for 52 countries around the world. Transmission significantly decreased with the initial reduction in mobility in 73% of the countries analysed, but we found evidence of decoupling of transmission and mobility following the relaxation of strict control measures for 80% of countries. For the majority of countries, mobility explained a substantial proportion of the variation in transmissibility (median adjusted R-squared: 48%, interquartile range - IQR - across countries [27-77%]). Where a change in the relationship occurred, predictive ability decreased after the relaxation; from a median adjusted R-squared of 74% (IQR across countries [49-91%]) pre-relaxation, to a median adjusted R-squared of 30% (IQR across countries [12-48%]) post-relaxation. In countries with a clear relationship between mobility and transmission both before and after strict control measures were relaxed, mobility was associated with lower transmission rates after control measures were relaxed indicating that the beneficial effects of ongoing social distancing behaviours were substantial. Social distancing policies aiming to reduce COVID-19 transmission have been reflected in reductions in human mobility. Here, the authors show that reduced mobility is correlated with decreased transmission, but that this relationship weakened over time as social distancing measures were relaxed.

AB  - Background The adoption of an electronic health record (EHR) in the healthcare system has the potential to make healthcare service delivery effective and efficient by providing accurate, up-to-date, and complete information. Despite its great importance, the adoptions of EHR in low-income country settings, like Ethiopia, were lagging and increasingly failed. Assessing the readiness of stakeholders before the actual adoption of EHR is considered the prominent solution to tackle the problem. However, little is known about healthcare providers' EHR readiness in this study setting. Accordingly, this research was conducted aiming at examining healthcare providers' readiness for EHR adoption and associated factors in southwestern Ethiopia. Methods An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted from September 1 to October 30, 2021. A total of 423 healthcare providers working in public hospitals were selected using a simple random sampling technique. Multivariable logistic regression was fitted to identify determinant factors of overall healthcare providers' readiness after the other covariates were controlled. Result In this study, the overall good readiness level of EHR adoption was 52.8% (n = 204) [95% CI of 47.9% to 56.6%]. Age, computer literacy, computer access at health facilities, attitude towards EHRs, awareness about EHRs, perceived benefit, and perceived technology self-efficacy were significantly associated with the overall health care providers' readiness for the adoption of EHR using a cut point of P-value less than 0.05. Conclusion Around half of the respondents had a good level of overall healthcare providers' readiness for the adoption of EHR which was considered inadequate. This finding implied that a huge effort is required to improve readiness before the actual implementation of EHRs. The finding implied that younger-aged groups were more ready for such technology which in turn implied; the older one needs more concern. Enhancing computer literacy, confidence building to raise self-efficacy of such technology, addressing the issue of computer availability at health facilities, building a positive attitude, awareness campaign of EHR, and recognizing the usefulness of such systems were the necessary measures to improve EHR readiness in this setting. Additionally, further studies are recommended to encompass all types of EHR readiness such as organizational readiness, technology readiness, societal readiness, and so on. Additionally, exploring the healthcare provider opinion with qualitative study and extending the proposed study to other implementation settings are recommended to be addressed by future works.

AB  - The inclusion of children with special educational needs is a major challenge. Amongst the factors linked to a successful inclusive education policy, teachers' attitude toward inclusion is particularly important. The present paper seeks to understand why general teachers exhibit less favourable attitude toward inclusion than special education teachers. We argue that general teachers' low sense of efficacy can act as a mediator. To investigate this hypothesis, general and special education teachers were asked to report their attitude and efficacy. Results confirm that general teachers have less positive attitude toward inclusion than special education teachers. In addition, a mediational analysis confirmed that this discrepancy is partly sustained by general teachers' lower sense of efficacy. Limits as well as future perspective are discussed.

AB  - Opinionated news targets communities of likeminded viewers, relies on dramaturgical storytelling techniques, and shares characteristics with political satire. Accordingly, opinionated news should be understood as a specific form of political entertainment. We have investigated the mechanisms underlying the effects of opinionated news on political attitudes using an experimental design that employed manipulated television news items. Findings confirm that opinionated news positively affects policy attitudes via its presumed influence on others and subsequent perceptions of the opinion climate. However, opinionated news also negatively affects attitudes via hostile media perceptions and evoked anger, especially for people with incongruent political preferences. Due to these opposing processes, we found no total effect of opinionated news on policy attitudes. Conditions are discussed under which either the positive or the negative indirect effect is likely to dominate.

AB  - Purpose Although crisis communication via social media has engaged academia's attention during the disease outbreak, information value for preventive behaviors is inadequately studied. The purpose of this paper is to cast light on how to strengthen the uptake of older people's coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) behavioral outcomes due to information value and perceived threat through social media. Design/methodology/approach This study designs a survey and applies structural equation modeling to examine a research framework. A sample comprises 334 Vietnamese older participants who have utilized social media. Findings The results illustrate that preventive behaviors are determined by perceived threat (i.e. severity and susceptibility). Furthermore, older people heighten risk perceptions based on information characteristics, including information relevance, informative support and source credibility. Lastly, information relevance is a strong predictor of source credibility. Practical implications The findings assist practitioners to enhance crisis communication effectiveness via social media by imparting valuable information to the public. Moreover, this paper offers overarching guidelines on the improvement in credibility with creators, risk consciousness and preventive behaviors. Originality/value Although earlier studies focused attentiveness on the power of social media for raising threat perceptions, this work seems the first to unveil informative motives for perceived COVID-19 threat across older individuals, which subsequently presents plausible reasons for behavioral disclosure, including facemask-wearing, hand-washing and social distancing.

KW  - IMPACT
AB  - Persuasive games are a subset of serious games that are getting increased attention from the gaming industry as well as researchers. Although their title implies they can be intuitively defined as having the primary intention of changing or reinforcing players' attitudes on certain topics, only a handful of studies have provided evidence that these games actually influence attitudes. After presenting a summary of previous studies' results, the current article expands on this evidence by reporting on a controlled online experiment that compared a currently playable persuasive game (My Cotton Picking Life) with a mobilizing YouTube clip covering the same topic. The study included a pre- and posttest and 2 media conditions. Two hundred thirty-seven individuals (mean age of 23) from an international population participated in this study. Because the persuasive game and comparable movie clip were concerned with forced labor in Uzbekistani cotton fields, attitude scales on empowerment, the workload of cotton picking, and denial of the issue, were composed for this study and subsequently validated. Results showed a greater increase on workload attitudes for individuals who played the game than for those who watched the clip. Enjoyment of the game as well as awareness of the game's intent also increased the attitude change from pre- to posttest. The paper offers insight into how persuasive games can be further validated with different methods, and concludes that there is mounting evidence for the viability of games as a medium for persuasive communication.

KW  - affective polarization
KW  - conflict orientation
AB  - Partisan media-typically characterized by incivility-has become a defining element of the American political communication environment. While scholars have explored the consequences of partisan media for political attitudes and behaviors, little work has looked at how variations in incivility moderate partisan media's effects. Using a population-based survey experiment, we show that incivility affectively depolarizes partisans when it comes from an in-party source (e.g., MSNBC for Democrats, Fox News for Republicans). Incivility on out-party sources affectively polarizes the audience, however, and we show that the respondent's degree of conflict aversion conditions these effects. Our results raise intriguing normative questions about the trade-offs between polarization and incivility and highlight how scholars must account for both levels of incivility and partisan slant when studying the effects of partisan media.

AB  - This study explores whether young people's propensity to take responsibility for the environment-and, consequently, to make pro-environment consumption choices-is negatively affected by living in a condition of social exclusion, such that of NEETs (i.e., Not in Education, Employment or Training). By adopting a mix of comparative methods, we used the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fs-QCA) to compare European countries to find which configurations of types of NEET can be associated with different levels of perceived individual environmental responsibility. In addition, we implemented a mediation model by using Generalized Structural Equation Modeling (GSEM) estimation, to find whether the association between the NEET condition and the level of perceived environmental responsibility is mediated by individual happiness-as a proxy of social exclusion's consequences on the individual's well-being. Fs-QCA results are integrated at the micro level to test context-related variation. Data come from the 2016 European Social Survey, the 2016 Eurofound report, and the 2018 Italian Youth Report. We found that the presence of more vulnerable NEETs is associated with lower levels of perceived environmental responsibility. At the micro level, only in some countries does the condition of NEET lead to attribute environmental responsibility to the institutions, rather than to the single individual, and it seems related to a general lower well-being.

AB  - This study investigates the negative influence of consumer's perceptions of online retailer's deceptive practices (perceived deception) on consumer's relational variables (satisfaction and loyalty intentions to the online retailer). Also, the moderating role of product type (goods versus services), consumer's attitude toward the Internet, and consumer's demographics in the deception-relational outcomes link is considered. Data from 398 online consumers revealed that satisfaction totally mediated the influence of deception on loyalty. Furthermore, the deception-satisfaction link was moderated by all the hypothesized variables. Interestingly, a direct effect of deception on loyalty was found among more educated consumers, consumers who had a more positive attitude toward the Internet and consumers who had purchased a physical product. Implications for theory and management are discussed.

AB  - Drawing from activation theory and the goal literature, this research explores how competing product-related goals influence attitudes and intentions and how advertised product claims (fortification and health claims) nudge competing consumer goals. Additionally, this research investigates how promotional cue alignment with a product-related goal can positively influence attitudes and intentions. Four studies reveal that when a promotional cue does not align with a focal product cue, there is no impact on attitudes and intentions. When an additional cue, such as a health message, is added to the promotional claim that is aligned with the product related cue, then multiple aligned cues can nudge a non-focal goal to better align with dominant product-related cues, leading to more positive attitudes and intentions, and this effect is mediated by changes in product health goals. This research has implications for goal literature and for advertisers, manufacturers and policy makers.

AB  - In recent years, growing communities of Muslim-Americans have faced tension in a series of debates over the construction of Islamic prayer spaces in American cities. Islamic community members have found themselves fighting for representation within the political process and for their philosophical right to exist within American society. This study presents a framing analysis of the debate in five US newspapers between 2010 and 2013 as a way of examining the position of Muslims within contemporary American society. The study examines five frames: Local Regulation, Legal Authority, Political Debate, Muslim Neighbors, and Islamic Threat. The first three were episodic frames, while the other two were thematic. Some of the discourse showed evidence of Islamophobia, or indiscriminate negative attitudes or emotions directed at Islam or Muslims. Other stories showed evidence of Islamophilia, which is the stereotypical presentation of good Muslims' who are model citizens in contrast to the bad Muslims' who serve as rhetorical enemies.

AB  - This paper aims to develop an instrument to measure Player-Avatar Identification (PAI) in video game playing. Survey studies were conducted with over 1000 students in Singapore primary and secondary schools. The results of the studies demonstrated that PAI can be conceptualized and reliably measured in terms of four-factors - feelings during play, absorption during play, positive attitudes toward the game avatar and importance of the avatar to one's self identity. The four-factor model showed acceptable model data fit and satisfactory reliability and validity. The construct validity was supported by the relationship between PAI and identity style. The result suggested that students with diffused identity style reported significant higher scores on absorption and importance to identity. The usefulness of the concept and the scale was discussed in relation to behavioral and developmental implications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify factors affecting consumers' intention to visit food trucks from both utilitarian and hedonic points of view and to identify the service attributes that consumers consider most important when visiting food trucks. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and an importance-performance analysis (IPA) were conducted with a sample of 467 responses. Hedonic values influence consumers' intention, not only directly but also indirectly, by arousing a favorable attitude toward visiting food trucks. Utilitarian values do not directly impact consumers' intention, but the values do trigger consumers' intention indirectly by boosting a positive attitude toward food trucks. The IPA showed that food truck vendors are doing a fairly good job in serving food quickly, promptly correcting mistakes, and providing both consistent and reliable service to consumers. However, operators need to focus on building teamwork so that they can maintain speed and high quality during busy hours.

AB  - Purpose Communication plays an important role in health decisions and behaviors. Friends and family exert influence through communication and, when considering smoking, this is particularly salient among those friends and family who smoke. Guided by primary socialization theory and integrated behavioral model, the present study examined the effects of having smoking friends and family on smoking beliefs (e.g. negative consequences, positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement), cultural normative beliefs, pro-smoking injunctive norms, smoking intentions and recent smoking behaviors. Design/methodology/approach Cross-sectional online survey data were collected from college students (N = 227). Multivariate analysis of covariance and path analysis were performed. Findings College students who reported having smoking friends were more likely to report higher levels of positive reinforcement, cultural normative beliefs, pro-smoking injunctive norms, positive attitudes, smoking intentions and recent smoking behaviors than those without smoking friends. Frequent communication with smoking friends was significantly related to cultural normative beliefs, pro-smoking injunctive norms, positive attitudes and smoking intentions. The analysis, however, did not yield statistical support for the associations between frequent communication with smoking family and smoking perceptions, norms and behaviors. Originality/value The present study highlights the vital roles of friends' influence for college students' smoking behaviors. Communication-based intervention can help better equip college students with communication strategies that prevent tobacco use by promoting more effective conversations with friends.

AB  - Introduction: The radiography profession is challenged by greater responsibilities and shortage of educated radiographers. Implementation of task shifting is one strategy to deal with the current situation in health care. The aim of this studiy was to evaluate radiographers' perception of assistant nurses and nurses carrying out tasks that traditionally were undertaken within the radiography profession in a Swedish context. Methods: An electronic questionnaire was distributed to radiographers at eleven hospitals in Sweden. The questionnaire included background questions and questions about radiographers' perception about task shifting to nurses and assistant nurses. The respondents rated their agreement level regarding task shifting on a five-point Likert scale. Data was statistically evaluated in SPSS using Mann Whitney U test. Results: Sixty-five radiographers participated in the study. Most radiographers responded negatively to task shifting to nurses (72%) or assistant nurses (65%). Most radiographers disagree that nurses should perform mammography screening or work within interventional radiography, while the attitude towards nurses calculating glomerular filtration rate was more positive. A majority disagree regarding assistant nurses performing conventional radiographs, informing the patient about contrast media administration or inserting peripheral intravenous catheters, while there was a positive attitude towards assistant nurses preparing patients for examinations. The attitude towards task shifting was not influenced by age, however radiographers with less working experience were more positive to task shifting in general. Conclusion: A majority of the radiographers had a negative attitude towards task shifting to nurses and assistant nurses. The radiographers were more positive to hand over tasks related to patient care and administrative tasks than technical related tasks within the profession. Implications for practice: Knowledge about radiographers' perception on task shifting within the profession is essential when planning and implementing strategies for task shifting in the clinical settings.

AB  - Background: Given the public health responses to previous respiratory disease pandemics, and in the absence of treatments and vaccines, the mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic relies on population engagement in nonpharmaceutical interventions. This engagement is largely driven by risk perception, anxiety levels, and knowledge, as well as by historical exposure to disease outbreaks, government responses, and cultural factors.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to compare psychobehavioral responses in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: Comparable cross-sectional surveys were administered to adults in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom during the early phase of the epidemic in each setting. Explanatory variables included demographics, risk perception, knowledge of COVID-19, anxiety level, and preventive behaviors. Responses were weighted according to census data. Logistic regression models, including effect modification to quantify setting differences, were used to assess the association between the explanatory variables and the adoption of social distancing measures.
   Results: Data from 3431 complete responses (Hong Kong, 1663; United Kingdom, 1768) were analyzed. Perceived severity of symptoms differed by setting, with weighted percentages of 96.8% for Hong Kong (1621/1663) and 19.9% for the United Kingdom (366/1768). A large proportion of respondents were abnormally or borderline anxious (Hong Kong: 1077/1603, 60.0%; United Kingdom: 812/1768, 46.5%) and regarded direct contact with infected individuals as the transmission route of COVID-19 (Hong Kong: 94.0%-98.5%; United Kingdom: 69.2%-93.5%; all percentages weighted), with Hong Kong identifying additional routes. Hong Kong reported high levels of adoption of various social distancing measures (Hong Kong: 32.6%-93.7%; United Kingdom: 17.6%-59.0%) and mask-wearing (Hong Kong: 98.8% (1647/1663); United Kingdom: 3.1% (53/1768)). The impact of perceived severity of symptoms and perceived ease of transmission of COVID-19 on the adoption of social distancing measures varied by setting. In Hong Kong, these factors had no impact, whereas in the United Kingdom, those who perceived their symptom severity as "high" were more likely to adopt social distancing (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] 1.58-3.01), and those who perceived transmission as "easy" were prone to adopt both general social distancing (aOR 2.00, 95% CI 1.57-2.55) and contact avoidance (aOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.41-2.30). The impact of anxiety on adopting social distancing did not vary by setting.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that health officials should ascertain baseline levels of risk perception and knowledge in populations, as well as prior sensitization to infectious disease outbreaks, during the development of mitigation strategies. Risk should be communicated through suitable media channels-and trust should be maintained-while early intervention remains the cornerstone of effective outbreak response.

AB  - This paper aims for a better understanding of the perspectives of contributors to Spanish academic journals regarding open access, open peer review, and altmetrics. Specifically, it explores how age, gender, years of professional experience, and perception and use of social media influence authors' opinions of these developments in scholarly publishing. A sample of 295 contributors to Spanish academic journals participated in a survey about the aforementioned topics. They were found to hold a favourable opinion of open access but were more cautious about open peer review and altmetrics. The responses of younger and female scholars indicated more reluctance to accept open peer review practices. A positive attitude toward social networks did not necessarily translate into enthusiasm for emerging trends in scholarly publishing. Despite this, ResearchGate users were more aware of altmetrics.

AB  - Recent research demonstrates that a wide range of political attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors can be explained in part by genetic variation. However, these studies have not yet identified the mechanisms that generate such a relationship. Some scholars have speculated that psychological traits mediate the relationship between genes and political participation, but so far there have been no empirical tests. Here we focus on the role of three psychological traits that are believed to influence political participation: cognitive ability, personal control, and extraversion. Utilizing a unique sample of more than 2,000 Swedish twin pairs, we show that a common genetic factor can explain most of the relationship between these psychological traits and acts of political participation, as well as predispositions related to participation. While our analysis is not a definitive test, our results suggest an upper bound for a proposed mediation relationship between genes, psychological traits, and political participation.

AB  - Objective This article explores how the Millennial Generation identity-the shared values and experiences of young adults (born between 1980 and 1997)-affects political polarization of climate change belief, specifically how it mediates the relationship between party affiliation and educational attainment. Method To test this, an interaction between Millennial*Republican*education is estimated, using data from an original national survey administered in 2015. Results Millennials are more likely to believe in the evidence of climate change and its anthropogenic causes than older adults of their same party affiliation. Unlike older adults, the most educated Millennials are not the most likely to adhere to political party stance; rather, it is among the least educated Millennials that party sorting is most evident. Conclusion The Millennial Generation identity is meaningful for understanding political attitudes. Important distinctions exist between Millennials and older adults in the evaluation of climate change opinion and related policies.

AB  - The flow of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected almost every aspect of human life around the globe. Being the emerging ground and early sufferer of the virus, Wuhan city-data remains a case of multifold significance. Further, it is of notable importance to explore the impact of unique and unprecedented public health response of Chinese authorities-the extreme lockdown of the city. In this research, we investigate the statistical nature of the viral transmission concerning social distancing, extreme quarantine, and robust lockdown interventions. We observed highly convincing and statistically significant evidences in favor of quarantine and social distancing approaches. These findings might help countries, now facing, or likely to face the wave of the virus. We analyzed Wuhan-based data of "number of deaths" and "confirmed cases," extracted from China CDC weekly database, dated from February 13, 2020, to March 24, 2020. To estimate the underlying group structure, the assembled data is further subdivided into three blocks, each consists of two weeks. Thus, the complete data set is studied in three phases, such as, phase 1 (Ph 1) = February 13, 2020, to February 26, 2020; phase 2 (Ph 2) = February 27, 2020 to March 11, 2020; and phase 3 (Ph 3) = March 12, 2020 to March 24, 2020. We observed the overall median proportion of deaths in those six weeks remained 0.0127. This estimate is highly influenced by Ph1, when the early flaws of weak health response were still prevalent. Over the time, we witnessed a median decline of 92.12% in the death proportions. Moreover, a non-parametric version of the variability analysis of death data, estimated that the average rank of reported proportions in Ph 3 remained 7, which was 20.5 in Ph 2, and stayed 34.5 in the first phase. Similar patterns were observed, when studying the confirmed cases data. We estimated the overall median of the proportion of confirmed cases in Wuhan as 0.0041, which again, is highly inclined towards Ph 1 and Ph 2. We also witnessed minimum average rank proportions for Ph 3, such as 7, which was noticeably lower than Ph 2, 21.71, and Ph 1, 32.29. Moreover, the varying degree of clustering indicates that the effectiveness of quarantine based policies is time-dependent. In general, the decline in coronavirus transmission in Wuhan significantly coincides with the lockdown.

AB  - This study evaluates the dynamic impact of various policies adopted by U.S. states, including social distancing, financial assistance, and vaccination policies. We propose a time-varying parameter multilevel dynamic factor model (TVP-MDFM) to improve the model's accuracy for evaluating the dynamic policy effect. The estimation is based on the Bayesian shrinkage method jointly with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines model selection and parameter estimation into the same iterative sampling process. The advantages and reliability of the TVP-MDFM are explored using simulation studies and robustness tests. The main empirical results highlight that the direct causal effect of the social distancing policy is more significant than the indirect effect mediated through human behavior. We also find income heterogeneity in financial assistance policies. Moreover, we provide evidence that banning vaccination certification by legislation is a stronger driver of the new case rate than executive orders during the Omicron dominance.

AB  - Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Computed Tomography (CT) departments have established additional acute capacity whilst maintaining essential services. The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in service delivery, working practices and decision-making role of diagnostic radiographers during the pandemic.
   Methods: We conducted an electronic cross-sectional survey of diagnostic radiographers working in CT during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was open for 6-weeks, with radiographers from all geographical regions encouraged to respond. The questionnaire explored social distancing, patient scheduling and departmental organisation; PPE usage; recognition and escalation of COVID-19 changes, patient management pathways and any training. Additionally, we sought the personal perspectives of radiographers through free text comments.
   Results: Following exclusions, 180 responses were analysed. Service delivery changes included social distancing (59.4%; n= 107), restriction of referrals to those considered time-critical (63.3%; n=114) and dedicated COVID-19 scanners (66.1%; n=119). Working practices were impacted by a need to implement PPE, although variation in PPE worn for different scenarios was seen. Half of the radiographers were routinely reviewing asymptomatic outpatient images for common COVID-19 signs, despite 63.5% of respondents not receiving formal training. Ad hoc patient pathways were in place in 90.5% of cases with 35% indicating that this was radiographer-led. CT staff had experienced anxiety, fatigue, and low morale, but praised teamwork.
   Conclusions: Radiographers were able to reduce the risk of transmission through social distancing, designated scanners, and PPE. This study has demonstrated that despite variance in practice, radiographers play a key role in identifying and triaging high-risk patients.

AB  - Background. The high prevalence of HPV infection among Kazakhstani women and the absence of an HPV vaccination program are directly reflected in increasing rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Kazakhstan made its first attempt at introducing the HPV vaccine in 2013, but was unsuccessful due to complications and low public acceptance. The attitudes of Kazakhstani women towards the vaccine were never measured. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the attitudes of women towards the HPV vaccine and determine factors associated with positive, negative, or neutral attitudes. Methods. A 29-item survey consisting of 21 demographic and contextual questions and 8 Likert-scale questions was distributed among women attending gynecological offices in four major cities of Kazakhstan from December 2021 until February 2022. Attitudes of women were measured based on their answers to the eight Likert-scale questions. Ordinal logistic regression was built to find associations between demographic characteristics and attitudes of women. Results. Two hundred thirty-three women were included in the final analysis. A total of 54% of women had positive attitudes towards the vaccine. The majority of women did not trust or had a neutral attitude towards the government, pharmaceutical industry, and traditional and alternative media. However, the trust of women was high in medical workers and scientific researchers. Women's age, education, number of children, effect of the 2013 HPV program, and trust in alternative medicine were included in the ordinal logistic model. Women with a low level of education, a high number of children, who believe in alternative medicine, and who were affected by the failed 2013 vaccination program were less likely to have a positive attitude towards the vaccine. Conclusions. Contrary attitudes towards HPV vaccination exist among Kazakhstani women, with approximately half having positive and almost half having negative or neutral attitudes towards the vaccine. An informational campaign that takes into consideration women's levels of trust in different agencies, as well as targets those who are the most uninformed, might help in a successful relaunch of the HPV vaccination program. However, more studies that cover a higher number of women are required.

AB  - This study investigates the residents' attitudes to tourism as a driver of regional development and the impact of digital technologies on these perceptions. This work considers a 'lagging behind' region of the EU and employs a generalised ordered logit regression. The main findings suggest that the positive attitude is affected by the digital technology use, education, non-job variables and touristic products such as landscape, food and wine and events. As a result, the digital technology and the enhancement of touristic products may serve as important factors for 'lagging behind' regions to meet a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.

AB  - This study analyzes media coverage of Census Bureau projections showing that the U.S. will become a majority-minority state by mid-century. I argue that the mismatch between the racial/ethnic categories used by the media in their coverage of Census projections, and the official government categories used by the Census, help construct social boundaries around "whiteness" that allows for growth of minority populations to be presented as a challenge for "American" society. I contend that media portrayals of Census projections can influence public perceptions of the racial/ethnic composition of the U.S., thus impacting political attitudes and voting behavior among the U.S. populace.

AB  - In Thailand, strict prevention and control strategies have been implemented to mitigate the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). "New normal" guidelines and a series of mobile health applications have been introduced by the healthcare sector and implemented to aid the disease control monitoring and prevention of widespread outbreaks. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding "new normal" guidelines and quality of life (QOL) among Thai people during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to determine the association between KA, QOL, and practices. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from 7 June to 12 September 2021 among Thai people in Public Health Region 6 aged >= 18 years old. Of the 506 survey participants, 80.3% were female, and 65.0% were 25-59 years old. The survey revealed that 52.2% of participants were classified as having more accurate knowledge, 58.9% were classified as having more positive attitudes, and 80.8% were classified as having more frequent practices regarding "new normal" guidelines, and 54.7% had high QOL. Of the participants, 93.7% agreed that "people who have been fully vaccinated should wear a mask while outside," and 95.5% wore a face mask outdoors in crowded places. However, 60.9% of participants misunderstood some details regarding online applications for contact tracing and vaccination services, 44.2% felt that these applications were difficult to use, and 33.4% rarely or never downloaded or used these applications. In logistic regression analyses, accurate knowledge of COVID-19 was associated with higher education, being a government employee, monthly family income > 30,000 Thai Baht, and regular use of social media. More positive attitudes regarding "new normal" guidelines and high QOL were associated with positive practices. High QOL was associated with older age, and higher education. Enhancement of attitudes and QOL is also important for improving practices in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant factors identified in KAP will be crucial for developing effective prevention and control programs to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. To implement mobile health applications effectively, more work is required to improve the ease of use and promotion strategies.

AB  - Background: Cervical Cancer (CC) is the only preventable cancer among all the female genital tract cancers when is detected in its pre-malignant stage, but it is a fatal disease once it gets its invasive stages. Early detection of it is performed by a medical screening procedure Pap smear (PS), which is an inexpensive and effectual procedure to look for any cervical cytological changes (pre-malignant or malignant). Objectives: The present study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) about PS, to identify the barriers that are an impediment to having it, to find out the association between KAP of PS, and find out the association between married women socio-demographic characteristics and their KAP of PS. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among 400 women at the time of data collection from 7th April 2015 to 30th May 2015. A structured questionnaire was administrated to gather the data related to the knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding PS, in addition to the barriers that impeded women to practice it. Result: Among all women who were interviewed, about 35.9% heard of the Pap smear and 57.1% heard about cervical cancer. Only 7.3% of women had good knowledge about Pap smear, 33% of them had a positive attitude, and 9.5% of them practiced it. The main reason for having the PS was the health provider's advice. Conclusion: The majority of women had low knowledge of PS, and a negative attitude and was not practicing it. Effective media and providing health education are required to improve the level of awareness towards it. A healthcare professional should be contributing to knowledge transfer whenever the opportunity arises.

AB  - Objectives To gain insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ongoing health research projects, using projects from a selected funding programme in Germany as an example. Design Online survey and validation workshop. Setting Lockdowns and social distancing policies impact on clinical and public health research in various forms, especially if unrelated to COVID-19. Research institutions have reduced onsite activities, data are often collected remotely, and during the height of the crisis, clinical researchers were partially forced to abandon their projects in favour of front-line care. Participants survey 120 investigators of health research projects across Germany, performed between 15 and 25 May 2020; workshop: 32 investigators, performed on 28 May 2020. Results The response rate (78%) showed that the survey generated significant interest among investigators. 85 responses were included for analysis, and the majority of investigators (93%) reported that their projects were affected by the pandemic, with many (80%) stating that data collection was not possible as planned, and they could not carry out interventions as intended (67%). Other impacts were caused by staff being unavailable, for example, through child or elder care commitments or because of COVID-19 quarantine or illness. Investigators also reported that publications were delayed or not feasible at all (56%), and some experienced problems with PhD or Masters theses (18%). The majority of investigators had mitigation strategies in place such as adjustment of data collection methods using digital tools (46%) or of project implementation in general (46%), others made changes in research design or research questions (27%). Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted on health research projects. The main challenge is now to mitigate negative effects and to improve long-term resilience in health research. The pandemic has also acted as a driver of innovation and change, for example, by accelerating the use of digital methods.

AB  - Despite drawing on a common pool of data, observers of the 2012 presidential campaign came to different conclusions about whether, how, and to what extent "October surprise" Hurricane Sandy influenced the election. The present study used a mixed correlational and experimental design to assess the relation between, and effect of, the salience of Hurricane Sandy on attitudes and voting intentions regarding President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in a large sample of voting-aged adults. Results suggest that immediately following positive news coverage of Obama's handling of the storm's aftermath, Sandy's salience positively influenced attitudes toward Obama, but that by election day, reminders of the hurricane became a drag instead of a boon for the President. In addition to theoretical implications, this study provides an example of how to combine methodological approaches to help answer questions about the impact of unpredictable, large-scale events as they unfold.

AB  - We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine if posting a "selfie" and receiving validation from others in the form of "likes" on social media can help narcissists reduce psychological distress. After all participants completed the narcissistic personality inventory (NPI) and experienced social exclusion, participants completed an auditory startle task that elicits the P3 to white noise-an ERP component that reflects emotional arousal and is sensitive to psychological distress. Participants were then randomly assigned to either view a personal "selfie" that quickly received a significant number of ostensibly real "likes" (selfie with likes condition), view a "selfie" with no feedback (selfie only condition), or view a neutral picture before (neutral picture condition) completing the auditory startle task again. Results revealed that participants high on the Leadership/Authority subscale of the NPI in the "selfie" with "likes" condition demonstrated a pre-post manipulation decrease in P3 mean amplitude, relative to participants in the other two conditions. These results suggest that approval via social media can help certain kinds of narcissists alleviate distress from social exclusion.

AB  - Political conservatism and threat salience have been consistently associated with intergroup bias. However, prior research has not examined potential effects of conservatism and/or threat on the attribution of relative in-group/out-group intelligence. In a cross-cultural study conducted in Spain and the United Kingdom, priming violent conflict with ISIS led participants to view an in-group ally as relatively more intelligent than an out-group adversary, in an effect mediated by feelings of anger (but not fear or general arousal). Conservatism similarly predicted biased perception of the ally's relative intellect, a tendency that was driven by militaristic (not social/fiscal) political attitudes but was not explained by associated increases in state anger following conflict cues. This overall pattern indicates that conflict cues and militaristic political orientation heighten assessments of relative intergroup intellect during warfare via distinct affective and attitudinal pathways.

AB  - Background: The brand equity pyramid is a theory that explains how people develop a relationship with a brand. Although the theory has received some support, few studies have tested it using a product brand, and no study has experimentally tested the theory. Research Question: The study tested whether brand equity pyramid variables pertaining to a health behavior promotion product brand (the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Children and Youth) can be experimentally manipulated. The first objective was to examine whether brand equity of the guidelines would be higher in the intervention group compared to the control group. The second objective was to explore whether parental attitudes and intentions toward support, support behaviors, and parent-perceived child behavior would be higher in the intervention group compared to the control. Method: Using an online survey platform in Canada, all participants first viewed the guidelines. Participants in the intervention group were then presented with a video targeting key brand equity variables, whereas the control group received no video. Participants were 161 Canadian parents (Mage = 38.17,SD= 7.33 years) with a child 5-12 years of age. Measurements of brand equity and behavioral variables were taken at Time 1 (immediately post-intervention) and 2 weeks later at Time 2. Results: The intervention group had greater brand awareness than the control group and also showed a more positive attitude toward ensuring their child is less sedentary. However, generally, the 1-time intervention had limited effects. Recommendations for Research or Practice: This study indicates that a single exposure to stimuli targeting brand equity constructs can enhance awareness and some proximal cognitions. Future studies should examine whether repeated exposures to brand advertisements result in change in more important, distal variables such as brand loyalty and actual behavior. Limitations: This study lacked a true baseline measurement time point, there was only one exposure to brand stimuli, and parent-perceived child behavior was measured rather than behavior reported by the children themselves.

AB  - A number of studies have shown that pupil size increases transiently during effortful decisions. These decision-related changes in pupil size are mediated by central neuromodulatory systems, which also influence the internal state of brain regions engaged in decision making. It has been proposed that pupil-linked neuromodulatory systems are activated by the termination of decision processes, and, consequently, that these systems primarily affect the postdecisional brain state. Here, we present pupil results that run contrary to this proposal, suggesting an important intradecisional role. We measured pupil size while subjects formed protracted decisions about the presence or absence ("yes" vs. "no") of a visual contrast signal embedded in dynamic noise. Linear systems analysis revealed that the pupil was significantly driven by a sustained input throughout the course of the decision formation. This sustained component was larger than the transient component during the final choice (indicated by button press). The overall amplitude of pupil dilation during decision formation was bigger before yes than no choices, irrespective of the physical presence of the target signal. Remarkably, the magnitude of this pupil choice effect (yes > no) reflected the individual criterion: it was strongest in conservative subjects choosing yes against their bias. We conclude that the central neuromodulatory systems controlling pupil size are continuously engaged during decision formation in a way that reveals how the upcoming choice relates to the decision maker's attitude. Changes in brain state seem to interact with biased decision making in the face of uncertainty.

AB  - Unlike China's other top leaders, Premier Wen Jiabao has presented his political views after the 17th CCP Congress. Wen's assertive attitude for further political reform has attracted attention from international as well as domestic media. This article utilizes both institutionalism and network analysis to explain this uncommon political phenomenon, while it illuminates the drawback of the attribute perspective which has been used popularly to infer the attitudes of China's political elites. This study argues that Wen's attitude with personality has been produced by some institutional and network factors. They include: the decline of a powerful rival, different functions of the party and state in China's policy-making and implementation, division of policy work among Politburo Standing Committee leaders.

AB  - Objective Organizational strategies have been shown to improve one's ability to recall items from a list. Specifically, use of semantic clustering, the tendency to group items by category when recalling them, predicts better free recall of word lists after short and long delays. The present study utilized a healthy adult sample to examine use of efficient memory strategies as a predictor of differences in neurocognitive findings between African American and white participants.
   Method Participants provided demographic information and completed the California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II) and Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence-Second Edition (WASI-2).
   Results Groups were matched across socioeconomic status and years of education. White participants used more semantic clustering and performed better on recall measures after short and long delays than their African American peers, and semantic clustering predicted recall in both groups. Regression analyses suggested that use of semantic clustering is a significant partial mediator of the relationship between race and free recall abilities. Intelligence scores from the WASI-2 were correlated with CVLT-II measures in white participants but not African American participants.
   Conclusions Despite quantitatively similar backgrounds, white and African American participants differed in recall performance. However, this study showed that African American participants' poorer recall may be partially attributed to less frequent use of semantic clustering as a strategy. These discrepancies may be rooted in inequalities in educational experiences and suggest that providing organizational strategies during early learning may be an area of intervention to mitigate racial differences seen in neuropsychological testing.

AB  - Social media may promote health and social connectedness, but its misuse and frequency of use may pose risks. Social media use during adolescence requires parental monitoring and mediation to mitigate potentially harmful effects such as depression, anxiety, and risk-taking behaviors. While parents and health care professionals convey concern surrounding exposure to inappropriate content, prolonged screen time, and cyberbullying, appropriate social media monitoring remains challenging. The purpose of this study was to explore parental monitoring and mediation of social media use in adolescents. Online recruitment yielded a nationwide sample (n = 836) of parents of adolescents. The results of the online survey indicated that parents are concerned about adolescent social media use and endorse positive attitudes toward monitoring. Yet parents perceived little control over monitoring. Findings from this study support the school nurse in promoting healthy social media use, media literacy among parents and adolescents, and the use of screening tools.

AB  - The use of corporal punishment (CP) is controversial despite the negative consequences of its use that have been documented. Consequences include the use of CP by those who experienced CP themselves, described in the theory of the cycle of violence. There are little data on the cycle of violence, especially on those who break it and in representative samples. This study examines the cycle of violence in a representative sample by analyzing experiences of and attitudes toward CP. Attitudes toward, and own experiences of, CP by their parents were assessed in a sample of 2,519 individuals (female 54.6%, age range = 14-99 years, M = 48.9 years). Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subgroups of participants who support and oppose CP. Breaking the cycle, defined as having experienced CP and opposing CP, was examined. Factors associated with positive and negative attitudes toward CP were identified using group comparisons and binary logistic regression. The majority of the sample opposed CP (56%), whereas one third supported less severe forms of CP and 8.2% also supported severe CP. Those supporting CP reported having experienced CP by their parents more often. Of those who had experienced CP, 47% were identified as breaking the cycle. Female gender, younger age, not being divorced, and being married and living together, as well as a higher level of education were associated with breaking the cycle. Even though CP was legally banned in Germany, a relatively high proportion still reports positive attitudes toward and experiences of CP. The ban of CP by the federal government seems to be an effective measure to change attitudes on a societal level as rates were lower in comparison with earlier studies. Future studies should examine interactions between different types of CP, attitudes toward its use, and additional mediating factors.

AB  - What are the socio-political consequences of infectious diseases? Humans have evolved to avoid disease and infection, resulting in a set of psychological mechanisms that promote disease-avoidance, referred to as the behavioral immune system (BIS). One manifestation of the BIS is the cautious avoidance of unfamiliar, foreign, or potentially contaminating stimuli. Specifically, when disease infection risk is salient or prevalent, authoritarian attitudes can emerge that seek to avoid and reject foreign outgroups while favoring homogenous, familiar ingroups. In the largest study conducted on the topic to date (N > 240,000), elevated regional levels of infectious pathogens were related to more authoritarian attitudes on three geographical levels: across U.S. metropolitan regions, U.S. states, and cross-culturally across 47 countries. The link between pathogen prevalence and authoritarian psychological dispositions predicted conservative voting behavior in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election and more authoritarian governance and state laws, in which one group of people imposes asymmetrical laws on others in a hierarchical structure. Furthermore, cross-cultural analysis illustrated that the relationship between infectious diseases and authoritarianism was pronounced for infectious diseases that can be acquired from other humans (nonzoonotic), and does not generalize to other infectious diseases that can only be acquired from nonhuman species (zoonotic diseases). At a time of heightened awareness of infectious diseases, the current findings are important reminders that public health and ecology can have ramifications for socio-political attitudes by shaping how citizens vote and are governed.

AB  - A fascinating hypothesis has been proposed by Woodley (2010, Intelligence, 38: 471-480) to explain why intelligence, in contemporary Western countries, appears to be positively associated with left wing political attitudes. According to the hypothesis, the current Western 'norm' is relatively left-wing values, the intelligent are better at norm-mapping and better at perceiving the benefits of conforming to the dominant set of values and this explains why they are more likely, in this context, to be relatively left wing. This article will critically examine this hypothesis. It will argue that the evidence for it is questionable and open to different interpretations, there is evidence that contradicts it, and it leaves key questions unanswered. The article will propose that a simpler explanation for the association is that intelligence is positively associated with openness-intellect, low time preference and agreeableness.

AB  - Scholars of electoral autocracies accord far more attention to post-election protests than pre-election ones, as the former have the potential to trigger a regime transition. We argue that pre-election protests can have a significant effect on election outcomes. In particular, they are likely to deepen social cleavages along two dimensions: age and immigrant status. The 2019 social unrest in Hong Kong provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the electoral impact of pre-election protests. Comparing public opinion data related to the 2019 and 2015 District Council elections, we find strong empirical support for our argument, as immigrant status and age are strong predictors of voting choices and voter turnout. Our findings imply that exposure to democratic protests may not help in bridging the gap in political attitudes between immigrants and natives.

AB  - We conducted a web-based survey to understand the impact of social distancing measures on Brazilian MSM and transgender/non-binary lives. A total of 3486 respondents were included in this analysis and the great majority were cismen (98%). The median age was 32 years (IQR: 27-40), 44% non-white, 36% low schooling and 38% low income. Most of participants reported HIV negative/unknown status (77%). Participants on-PrEP reported more condomless anal sex than those off-PrEP. Conversely, 24% off-PrEP were at substantial HIV-risk. PrEP/ART continuation were reported by the majority, despite reports of impediments to medication refill. Transgender/non-binary reported more mental health problems and challenges to access health care. Social and racial disparities were associated with unattainability of maintaining social distancing. Tailored social and economic support policies during COVID-19 pandemic should be made available to these populations. Challenges for PrEP/ART access will demand the implementation of innovative solutions to avoid the expansion of the HIV epidemic.

AB  - This cross-sectional survey study aims to investigate preschool teachers' usage of digital technologies (DT) in early childhood education. To investigate teachers' use of DT, a questionnaire was completed by 167 preschool teachers from 52 different preschools. Besides, the Attitude Scale for Technological Tools and Materials Use in Preschool Education was completed by the teachers. The results of the study revealed that the classrooms were equipped with a variety of DT such as television, DVD, computer, and smartphone. Teachers tended to use television and computers in the classroom activities. Although the teachers had a positive attitude towards using DT in early childhood education, they used ICT on a limited scale. They mainly utilized these devices in order for the children to watch cartoon films and listen to music. Gender, teaching experience, and attitudes of teachers towards using ICT did not significantly predict their DT usage in their classroom activities. The results imply that though teachers had enough DT sources and positive attitude towards using those devices in their classroom activities, their DT usage was limited to few types of activities. For improving the quality of DT use in the classrooms by teachers, barriers to teachers' successful technology integration in their classrooms should be determined.

AB  - Based on the communication mediation model, the third-person effect hypothesis was integrated to analyze the influence of the exposure to South China Sea news on its perceived effects on the self and others. In addition, the influences of such exposure on online discussions and political attitudes were examined, specifically in relation to nationalism and government evaluation. The survey (N=868) found that the respondents perceived a stronger media effect on others than on themselves, whereas exposure to traditional and news media exposure exhibited equivalent effects on the self and on others. Moreover, the perceived effects on oneself promoted online discussion and nationalism, whereas the perceived effects on others improved government evaluation. The findings of this study indicate that the effects of media exposure on nationalism and government evaluation are marginally mediated by perceived effects, online discussion, or both.

AB  - Studies indicate that physical and social pain may share some mechanisms and neural correlates. Nothing is known, however, on whether the neural activity in the nociceptive system, as indexed by laser-evoked potentials (LEPs), is modified when suffering the consequences of a conspecific violating social norms. To explore this issue, we created an interaction scenario where participants could gain money by performing a time-estimation task. On each win-trial, another player connected online could arbitrarily decide to keep the participant's pay-off for him-or herself. Thus, participants knew that monetary loss could occur because of their own failure in performing the task or because of the inequitable behavior of another individual. Moreover, participants were asked to play for themselves or on behalf of a third party. In reality, the win/loss events were entirely decided by an ad hoc programmed computer. At the end of the interaction, participants reported if they believed the game-playing interaction was real. Results showed that the loss due to the opponent's inequitable behavior brought about a reduction both in pain intensity self-reports and in the amplitude of LEPs' components (i.e. N2, N2/P2, P2a, P2b). Importantly, both the behavioral and neurophysiological effects were found in the participants who believed their deserved payoff was stolen by their opponent. Furthermore, reduction of vertex components was present only when the inequitable behavior was directed toward the self. These results suggest that, far from being a private experience, pain perception might be modulated by the social saliency of interpersonal interactions.

AB  - Objective: Despite long-standing social psychological research supporting the influence of injunctive norms (i.e., what is commonly approved or disapproved) on behavior, support for this influence on health behaviors is limited. We examined the utility of correcting misperceptions of injunctive norms for improving sun protection and whether changes in attitudes mediated the injunctive norm-intention relationship. Method: At baseline 263 community residing primarily White women, aged 37 to 77 years, reported their beliefs about sun protection and tanning and their perceptions of "typical women's" approval of sun protection versus tanning. Women underestimated approval of sun protection and overestimated approval of tanning. In a randomized trial, 189 of these women received either information about sun protection or information plus personalized normative feedback (PNF). PNF compared each woman's own perceptions of typical women's approval of tanning and sun protection with actual normative values, both measured at baseline. PNF communicated that most women approve of others who sun protect. Results: PNF led to more positive sun protection injunctive norms, attitudes, and intentions at immediate posttest and more positive intentions and self-reported behavior at 4-week follow-up. Baseline discrepancy between a woman's beliefs and actual normative values related negatively to changes in sun protection in the control condition but positively in the PNF condition. As hypothesized, changes in attitudes partially mediated the influence of PNF on changes in intentions. Conclusions: The present research demonstrates the utility of correcting injunctive norm misperceptions for promoting healthy behaviors. That attitudes changed in response to PNF and mediated the norm-intention relationship suggests a method for influencing attitudes that may limit reactance.

AB  - BackgroundAdherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be influenced by knowledge, perception and perception regarding ART. The purpose of this study was to assess knowledge, attitude/perception and practice regarding ART among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV).MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess knowledge, attitudes, perception and practices ART in PLHIV. The survey was suggested to all PLHIV of at least 18years old and who were on ART for at least 1 month. PLHIV who were unable to answer questions correctly and those who did not complete the survey for any reason were excluded.ResultsDuring the study period, 234 PLHIV were included. Participants were mostly men (75.2%). The median age was 33years (IQR: 27-41). The median time since HIV diagnosis was 25months (IQR: 9-56) and the median duration of ART was 18months (IQR: 8-48). 87.6% had an overall good knowledge of ART. However, only 3.2% knew the name of their ART, 31.2% were aware that ART should be taken at a fixed time and 17.1% knew how to take ART in relation to food intake. 75.6% of participants had an overall positive attitude/perception of ART. However, 10.7% were convinced that other methods were more effective than ART for treating HIV and 42.7% thought that taking ART was shameful. The assessment of practices showed that in case of missed dose, 48.3% of participants routinely skipped this dose instead of trying to take it as soon as possible. In multivariate analysis, good knowledge of ART was independently associated with high level of education (aOR: 4.7, IC95%: 1.6-13.7, p=0.004) and disclosure of HIV status (aOR: 2.7, IC95%: 1.1-6.6, p=0.029).ConclusionsThis study showed an overall good knowledge and a predominantly positive attitude/perception of ART. However, accurate knowledge of ART intake was insufficient and the stigma associated with taking ART remained very present. Furthermore, very heterogeneous practices may reflect lack of instruction given by the physician regarding ART intake.

AB  - Aim. To investigate and analyse the attitudes to tobacco prevention among child healthcare nurses, to study how tobacco preventive work is carried out at child healthcare centres today. To evaluate how the tobacco preventive work had changed in child health care since the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare's national evaluation in 1997.
   Background. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke has adverse health effects. Interventions aiming at minimising environmental tobacco smoke have been developed and implemented at child healthcare centres in Sweden but the long-term effects of the interventions have not been studied.
   Design. Survey.
   Methods. In 2004, a postal questionnaire was sent to all nurses (n = 196) working at 92 child healthcare centres in two counties in south-eastern Sweden. The questionnaire was based on questions used by the National Board of Health and Welfare in their national evaluation in 1997 and individual semi-structured interviews performed for this study.
   Results. Almost all the nurses considered it very important to ask parents about their smoking habits (median 9.5, range 5.1-10.0). Collaboration with antenatal care had decreased since 1997. Nearly all the nurses mentioned difficulties in reaching fathers (70%), groups such as immigrant families (87%) and socially vulnerable families (94%) with the tobacco preventive programme. No nurses reported having special strategies to reach these groups.
   Conclusions. Improvement of methods for tobacco prevention at child healthcare centres is called for, especially for vulnerable groups in society. However, the positive attitude among nurses found in this study forms a promising basis for successful interventions.
   Relevance to clinical practice. This study shows that launching national programmes for tobacco prevention is not sufficient to achieve sustainable work. Nurses working in child healthcare centres have an overall positive attitude to tobacco prevention but need continuous education and training in communication skills especially to reach social vulnerable groups. Regular feedback from systematic follow-ups might increase motivation for this work.

AB  - In the last few years, several initiatives based on extracurricular activities have been organized in many countries around the world, with the aim to reduce the digital gender gap in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) fields. Among them, the Digital Girls summer camp, organized every year since 2014 by two Italian universities with the aim to attract female students to ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) disciplines, represents quite a unique initiative for its characteristics of long-duration (3-4 entire weeks) and complete gratuitousness for the participants. The COVID-19 emergency imposed severe changes to such activities, that had to be modified and carried out in the online mode as a consequence of social distancing. However, on one hand, the general lack of high-quality evaluations of these initiatives hinders the possibility to understand the actual impact of extracurricular activities on the future academic choices of the participants. On the other hand, the availability of data collected over different editions of Digital Girls has allowed us to analyze the summer camp impact and to evaluate the pros and cons of in-presence and online activities. The main contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we present an overview of existing experiences, at the national (Italian) and international levels, to increase female participation in integrated STEM and ICT fields. Second, we analyze how summer camp participation can influence girls' future academic choices, with specific attention to ICT-related disciplines. In particular, the collection of a significant amount of data through anonymous surveys conducted before and after the camp activities over the two editions allowed us to evidence the different impacts of in-presence and online extracurricular activities.

T2  - CURRENT PROBLEMS IN DIAGNOSTIC RADIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - In early 2020, the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began to shake the world. As the resulting pandemic, quickly dubbed COVID-19, unfolded, we learned to enact public health safety measures to reduce or prevent its spread, particularly "social distancing," an expression once alien but now understood all too well. Consequently, many sought online resources when they would have previously accessed them in person. We have used Facebook Live for several years to discuss radiology topics and, on occasion, interview experts in the medical field and beyond. Much like live television, Facebook Live enables creators like us to share videos with followers in real time. Unlike live television, Facebook Live allows viewers to leave comments and questions in real time, rendering the platform much more interactive. Because Facebook Live has been a helpful tool for us to speak to radiology students and professionals around the world, we looked for another way to continue our interviews on Facebook Live while maintaining social distancing. We have managed to continue our interviews while socially distanced using the video communications software Zoom. With an increasing number of people migrating to online technology, the widespread use of social media for radiology education is imminent. We encourage others to consider mixing Facebook Live and Zoom to create more holistic educational experiences for radiology in the digital world. The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us that life can change unexpectedly and quickly, but online education is here to stay. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - "Education," notes Philip Converse, "is everywhere the universal solvent." Whatever the ill of the body politic, many believe that greater education improves the condition. Much scholarship explores the impact of education on political attitudes and behaviors, but scholars have not examined the relationship of education to support for political compromise. This is especially topical, as compromise between parties seems harder than ever to achieve, yet compromise is necessary for democratic governance. We examine whether higher levels of education lead to support for compromise and find that education does matter, but the relationship is conditional. For liberals and moderates, more education promotes greater support for compromise. For conservatives, those with more education are not more likely to support compromise than those with less education. We argue that for conservatives, education matters for compromise support, but it also leads to better understanding of bedrock ideological principles that inhibit approval of compromise.

AB  - Digital technology is changing nature conservation in increasingly profound ways. We describe this impact and its significance through the concept of 'digital conservation', which we found to comprise five pivotal dimensions: data on nature, data on people, data integration and analysis, communication and experience, and participatory governance. Examining digital innovation in nature conservation and addressing how its development, implementation and diffusion may be steered, we warn against hypes, techno-fix thinking, good news narratives and unverified assumptions. We identify a need for rigorous evaluation, more comprehensive consideration of social exclusion, frameworks for regulation and increased multi-sector as well as multi-discipline awareness and cooperation. Along the way, digital technology may best be reconceptualised by conservationists from something that is either good or bad, to a dual-faced force in need of guidance.

AB  - Party identification provides citizens with an anchor from which they derive many of their political attitudes and issue preferences. But what happens when people encounter political debates that place their partisan identities and policy attitudes into conflict with one another? This article draws on an original experiment designed to study the effect of debates that cut across people's partisan identities and policy attitudes. The results show that cross-cutting debates make people less likely to engage in selective exposure, more likely to feel ambivalent toward their political party, and less likely to rely on party cues when rendering a judgment.

AB  - Public Significance Statement Caregivers play a critical role in facilitating child adherence to COVID-19 preventative health guidelines. Public health interventions that help caregivers to see the value of preventative health guidelines and support parents around managing difficulties that arise in implementation may facilitate child adherence behaviors.
   Objective: To describe child adherence to four preventative-health guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigate caregiver-level correlates of adherence. Method: Two hundred thirty-six caregivers (75% female) of children ages 6-12 years (M-age = 8 years; 53% male) living in the United States rated child adherence to four preventative-health guidelines between 10/16/2020 and 11/14/2020. Caregivers also rated perceived importance of each guideline in limiting virus spread and perceived difficulty in obtaining child compliance. Results: Child adherence was highest for mask-wearing (median [Mdn] = 96%) and hand hygiene (Mdn = 95%). Adherence to social distancing guidelines was lower. Mdn adherence for social distancing with family outside the household was 80%, and Mdn adherence for social distancing with friends was 72%. Furthermore, for each of the four guidelines, fewer than half the sample reported 100% adherence (range = 20%-43%). Adherence was positively associated with caregiver perceptions of importance of a given behavior in limiting virus spread (rs = .38-.62) and negatively associated with perceived difficulty in gaining child compliance (rs = -.37--.25). Discussion: Current results indicated parents perceive child adherence to social distancing more challenging than child adherence to mask wearing or hand hygiene. Lower caregiver perceptions of importance of the behavior and greater perceived difficulty in gaining child compliance were associated with lower adherence to all tasks. Brief targeted interventions (e.g., motivational interviewing, parent behavior management training) may be well suited to enhance caregivers' perceptions of value of the behavior, while also addressing behavioral challenges that interfere with child adherence.

AB  - Background: Information and communication technologies are promising tools to increase the quality of life of people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment and that of their caregivers. However, there are barriers to their use associated with sociodemographic factors and negative attitudes, as well as inadequate knowledge about technologies.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze technophilia (attitudes toward new technologies) and the use of smartphones and tablets along with associated factors in people with dementia/mild cognitive impairment and their caregivers.
   Methods: Data from the first visit of the Support Monitoring and Reminder for Mild Dementia (SMART4MD) randomized multicenter clinical trial were used for this analysis. Data were obtained from two European countries, Spain and Sweden, and from three centers: Consorci Sanitari de Terrassa (Catalonia, Spain), Servicio Andaluz de Salud (Andalusia, Spain), and the Blekinge Institute of Technology (Sweden). Participants with a score between 20 and 28 in the Mini Mental State Examination, with memory problems (for more than 6 months), and who were over the age of 55 years were included in the study, along with their caregivers. The bivariate Chi square and Mann-Whitney tests, and multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used for statistical analysis.
   Results: A total of 1086 dyads were included (N=2172). Overall, 299 (27.53%) of people with dementia/mild cognitive impairment had a diagnosis of dementia. In addition, 588 (54.14%) of people with dementia/mild cognitive impairment reported using a smartphone almost every day, and 106 (9.76%) used specific apps or software to support their memory. Among the caregivers, 839 (77.26%) used smartphones and tablets almost every day, and 181 (16.67%) used specific apps or software to support their memory. The people with dementia/mild cognitive impairment showed a lower level of technophilia in comparison to that of their caregivers after adjusting for confounders (B=0.074, P=.02) with differences in technology enthusiasm (B=0.360, P<.001), but not in technology anxiety (B=-0.042, P=.37). Technophilia was associated with lower age (B=-0.009, P=.004), male gender (B=-0.160, P<.001), higher education level (P=.01), living arrangement (living with children vs single; B=-2.538, P=.01), country of residence (Sweden vs Spain; B=0.256, P<.001), lower depression (B=-0.046, P<.001), and better health status (B=0.004, P<.001) in people with dementia/mild cognitive impairment. Among caregivers, technophilia was associated with comparable sociodemographic factors (except for living arrangement), along with a lower caregiver burden (B=-0.005, P=.04) and better quality of life (B=0.348, P<.001).
   Conclusions: Technophilia was associated with a better quality of life and sociodemographic variables in people with dementia/mild cognitive impairment and caregivers, suggesting potential barriers for technological interventions. People with dementia/mild cognitive impairment frequently use smartphones and tablets, but the use of specific apps or software to support memory is limited. Interventions using these technologies are needed to overcome barriers in this population related to sociodemographic characteristics and the lack of enthusiasm for new technologies.

AB  - Binge-watching is becoming a new "norm" for viewers in the way they consume their favorite TV shows and movies, nevertheless, most scholarly research on binge-watching remains exploratory. This study investigated (1) the relationship between attitudes toward binge-watching and the extent of binge-watching and (2) the role of viewers' personality traits (i.e., immediate gratification [IG] and needs for cognition [NFC]) on this association. The results from the analysis of the survey data (N = 714) illustrated that there was a positive association between viewers' negative attitudes and the extent of their binge-watching, showing a signature indicator of attitude-discrepant behaviors. Furthermore, a significant interaction effect of a negative attitude toward binge-watching and IG on binge-watching behavior was found. High-IG respondents with a negative attitude toward binge-watching were more likely to binge-watch than their low-IG counterparts, marked by a greater negative attitude toward binge-watching as a guilty pleasure.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the perceptions, attitudes and behaviour of the youth market for internet banking services (IBS).
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey was carried out to acquire data from 164 respondents. The respondents were competent computer users and studying for a degree at a university. Three additional in-depth interviews were subsequently carried out on interesting cases.
   Findings - The authors find that young people (age 16-29) have more positive attitudes and behavioural intentions towards using IBS than other user-groups. It has also confirmed that there is a positive impact of IBS quality on satisfaction and loyalty.
   Research limitations/implications - The study focused on an isolated convenience sample of university students in the UK. The findings might not therefore have worldwide significance despite a large proportion of the students were international and from a good representation of minority ethic groups.
   Originality/value - The research focused on a specific segment of the internet banking services market - younger students at a UK university. The findings are useful for bank services marketing as the young are likely to become the most important segment of users as the worldwide web and banking services become more advanced in the future.

AB  - Background: Among the factors known to influence reading development and performance, attitude toward reading is shown to be particularly critical for developing learners. Reading attitude enhances independent reading, levels of engagement in classroom reading activities, and the amount and variety of topics in reading, which in turn influence reading skills and strategies. Reading attitude is an important element in students' active engagement and achievement in reading.
   Purpose: The first purpose of this study was to test whether Korean students' home literacy resources, parental support and parents' reading attitude, and teachers' use of instructional strategies in relation to reading could predict Korean students' reading attitude. The second purpose was to test a model linking family-and school-related factors, reading attitude, and reading behaviors and learning strategy use as outcomes. Specifically, we hypothesized that positive and negative attitudes toward reading would mediate the relationships between home, parent, and teacher variables and reading outcomes.
   Design: Using a nationally representative sample from the PISA 2009 database, we tested two structural equation models. Because there were two categories of outcomes examined in this study, we fitted the model separately for each outcome category. The first model (Reading Behavior Model) included reading activities such as reading for enjoyment, reading diversity, and online reading as outcome variables. The second model (Learning Strategy Model) shared the same model structure with the first one except that the outcome variables were use of learning strategies such as memorization, elaboration, and control. In both models, reading attitudes were hypothesized to mediate the relationship between contextual factors (i.e. gender, home resources, parental and teacher influences) and the reading/learning outcomes.
   Conclusions: Gender, books and other types of literacy resources in the home, and parents' attitudes toward reading functioned as consistent predictors of Korean students' positive and negative attitudes toward reading. Among the contextual factors, parents' reading attitude and parental support for reading directly as well as indirectly predicted students' reading behaviors via students' reading attitude. Parental support for reading and teachers' instruction and assignment strategies in reading directly predicted students' use of learning strategies as well. Positive attitudes toward reading also predicted students' use of memorization, elaboration, and control strategies. Thus, reading attitude was an important mediator between parent-and teacher-related contextual factors and reading/learning engagement of Korean adolescents.

KW  - MORALITY
AB  - Does sharing moral values encourage people to connect and form communities? The importance of moral homophily (love of same) has been recognized by social scientists, but the types of moral similarities that drive this phenomenon are still unknown. Using both large-scale, observational social-media analyses and behavioral lab experiments, the authors investigated which types of moral similarities influence tie formations. Analysis of a corpus of over 700,000 tweets revealed that the distance between 2 people in a social-network can be predicted based on differences in the moral purity content-but not other moral content-of their messages. The authors replicated this finding by experimentally manipulating perceived moral difference (Study 2) and similarity (Study 3) in the lab and demonstrating that purity differences play a significant role in social distancing. These results indicate that social network processes reflect moral selection, and both online and offline differences in moral purity concerns are particularly predictive of social distance. This research is an attempt to study morality indirectly using an observational big-data study complemented with 2 confirmatory behavioral experiments carried out using traditional social-psychology methodology.

AB  - The exponential increase in the number of Mainland Chinese tourists (MCTs) and their sudden influx to popular destinations worldwide have resulted in increasingly frequent media reports on their behaviours and encounters with hosts. However, the academic literature has inadequately analysed resident attitudes towards this surging and, in a few destinations, dominant group. The current study addresses this gap by examining the attitudes and mentalities of Hong Kong (HK) residents towards MCTs and revealing their underlying psychological mechanism. A total of 39 semi-structured interviews demonstrate that unfavourable attitudes towards MCTs have exceeded neutral or positive attitudes. Moreover, HK residents share two intertwined mentalities sense of superiority and feeling of deprivation. Findings are discussed under the social identity meta-theoretical framework, and a cyclic psychological mechanism of 'social categorisation social identity social comparison' is identified underlying resident attitude and community mentality formation.

AB  - New technologies' advances offer innovative automations to people's daily lives. More and more devices are continuously connected to the internet allowing people to control them remotely. The smart home is such a technological development. However, it is uncertain whether and to what extent the average consumer will accept smart home technology. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors that affect the intention of Greek consumers to use smart home technology. The results of this study show that Greek consumers are beginning to have a positive attitude towards smart home technology. Important factors that contribute to their intention to use smart home technology include their perceived usefulness, compatibility, and ease of use of smart home technology. On the contrary, they do not think that they are influenced by their social environment regarding their intention to use smart home technology. Finally, they think that the major benefits of using smart home technology include the health monitoring, home security, and cost savings.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing measures often result in individual isolation, which can lead to adverse mental outcomes. We collected online questionnaires from 3,952 US adults to examine the impact of "shelter-in-place" guidelines on mental health, and to explore potential disparities and modifiable factors. Selfreported anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms were associated with more restrictive quarantine. Younger adults, women, those with lower income, more insecurity, more media exposure, reduced physical activity, or worsened family relationships were particularly affected. Targeted prevention on susceptible subpopulations, including young adults and lower SES groups, might help mitigate disparities in COVID-19-related mental health problems.

AB  - Background and objectivesLittle is known about the psychological factors currently influencing blood donation in China. This study investigated the structure of psychological factors and their correlation with donation behaviour of adults in a transforming city in China over a 6-month period.
   MethodsParticipants were recruited in Nanjing from May 2013 to April 2014. Preliminary focus group interviews with 102 participants were conducted to generate new items for a Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) questionnaire. The questionnaires were completed by 300 participants, and responses were subjected to factor analysis. We confirmed the resulting factorial structure with 861 respondents and examined the associations between these factors and donation behaviour during the next 6 months using structural equation modelling.
   ResultsFactor analysis and structural equation modelling of the data supported an extended TPB model with self-reported past donation behaviour as a covariate. After controlling for past donation behaviour, attitudes towards blood donation (=0<bold></bold>288), subjective norm (=0<bold></bold>149), self-efficacy (=0<bold></bold>199), trust in third-party health professionals (=0<bold></bold>237), mistrust towards blood collection agencies (BCAs) (=-0<bold></bold>085) and traditional Chinese beliefs (=-0<bold></bold>046) were significantly related to donation intention, whilst donation intention was positively (=0<bold></bold>212) associated with donation behaviour.
   ConclusionThese findings confirm that psychological factors such as attitudes are predictors of blood donation. Recruitment efforts using public information campaigns and interpersonal communications should focus on strengthening positive attitudes, increasing trust in third-party health professionals, elevating self-efficacy, changing traditional Chinese beliefs and relieving mistrust in blood collection agencies (BCAs).

AB  - Research on non-hedonic entertainment suggests the experience of elevation as an important construct leading to beneficial outcomes such as prosocial motivation. This study builds on first findings in this realm by distinguishing between different meaningful media contents. In a 3x4 between-subjects online experiment, we varied type of video (beauty of the earth, unity of humankind, portrayals of human kindness, and funny control videos) and context of proliferation (presentation on an unknown video platform or on YouTube with low vs high number of views). Meaningful videos indeed led to greater elevation, more universal orientation, and prosocial motivationwith videos showing human kindness standing out against other forms of meaningful videos. Human kindness videos additionally fostered more positive attitudes toward stereotyped groupsmediated by the feeling of elevation and the subsequent feeling of universal orientation.

AB  - The tendency of world media to villainize of sharks has likely contributed to a disparity in the distribution of research and conservation resources among threatened marine megavertebrates, with elasmobranchs losing out. Increased public knowledge on elasmobranchs can shape public attitude and foster and gain support for elasmobranch conservation. Through an online survey, this study aimed to evaluate the drivers of public knowledge and examine linkages between awareness of elasmobranchs and attitude toward their conservation. To explore the relationships and effects between the different predicting variables and public elasmobranch knowledge and attitude indices, bi-and multi-variate analysis and a partial least squares path model were used. The results indicated that the average public elasmobranch knowledge of the Cypriot population was moderate and the average public attitude towards elasmobranchs was relatively low. Marine-related activities and marine-related education were highly correlated with increased public elasmobranch knowledge and were the strongest predictors of the partial least squares path model which explained a high degree of variation in elasmobranch knowledge. Public elasmobranch knowledge was highly correlated with public attitude towards elasmobranchs. The findings of this study highlighted the importance of ocean literacy and education and provide insights into the mechanisms for developing and designing successful advocacy actions for elasmobranch conservation.

AB  - This study examined the effects of a mass-media video intervention on expectations, attitudes, and intentions to seek help from professional mental health care services. A public service announcement style, mass-media video intervention was developed, with prior empirical research on help-seeking behaviors organized according to the theory of reasoned action/planned behavior. In total, 228 participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions: (a) the media-exposed intervention group, who watched programming in which the media intervention was inserted, and (b) the control group, who watched the same programming without the media intervention. The media intervention was not influential on expectation and belief-based barrier variables. However, the media intervention was effective at increasing positive attitudes toward help seeking. Findings regarding the intervention's ability to increase help-seeking intentions for interpersonal problems were complex. Implications of these findings for future research are discussed.

AB  - This study was designed to investigate the effect of victimization experiences and peer influence on delinquency via one's attitude toward the police. It was hypothesized that negative attitudes toward the police would mediate the prospective relationships between victimization and offending and between peer delinquency and offending. Participants were 2,623 early adolescents from the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) study, a 6-wave longitudinal survey conducted between 1995 and 1999. The research design consisted of 2 independent variables (victimization and peer delinquency) measured at Wave 2, 1 mediator variable (negative attitudes toward the police) measured at Wave 3, and 1 dependent variable (participant delinquency) measured at Wave 4. Multiple regression and negative binomial path analyses revealed significant indirect effects running from violent victimization to negative attitudes toward the police to participant delinquency and from peer delinquency to negative attitudes toward the police to participant delinquency. The results of this study indicate that both violent victimization and peer delinquency contribute to participant delinquency, in part, by encouraging the formation of negative attitudes toward the police. It is speculated that violent victimization may increase negative attitudes toward the police by arousing distress and feelings of vulnerability, whereas peer delinquency may increase negative attitudes through instruction, observation, and other forms of social learning.

AB  - This article presents original user-based research concerning a Mexican European Diaspora?s use of Social Networking Sites (SNSs) for making racial and classed distinctions through the course of sharing and viewing content on their networked profiles. Bourdieu?s theoretical framework is used to address the ways in which SNSs usage fosters social capital, exclusion and displays of prejudice and discrimination. We also found useful the analysis of racial distinctions based on participants? references to physical attributes. To illustrate the use of racial and classed distinctions, we specifically consider the use of Facebook and also of A Small World (ASW), an exclusive SNS, regarded as one of few designed for use by ?the wealthy? [Ruiz, 2008. ?Five Social Networking Sites for the Wealthy.? Forbes. Accessed June 11, 2010. ]. We analyse the term ?naco?, a pejorative Mexican term commonly used to refer to vulgarity or inferiority amongst Mexican European and privileged diaspora with strong racial, classed and gendered connotations. The empirical material for this study is based on ethnographic research. Through the analysis of displayed images and text as well as well questionnaires and interviews we found tacit or explicit exclusion, discrimination and segregation through close-knit SNS networks engaged in by our participants, a Mexican privileged European diaspora.

AB  - Although research has demonstrated that an increased rapport between instructors and learners can positively relate with increased learning gains, perhaps mediated by the positive attitudes toward the course and self-efficacy beliefs in the coursework, little has been done to test what instructional strategies might increase this rapport in online video-based instruction. This study compared online video-based instruction that made use of relationship-building strategies with online video-based instruction that did not use those strategies. The two instructions were identical in every other way. The results show that the attitudes of the college students were positively affected by the relationship building strategies in a statistically significant way (p=.025) and that learning gains were also positively affected at a very near-significant level (p=.052). The implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Research suggests that social engineering attacks pose a significant security risk, with social networking sites (SNSs) being the most common source of these attacks. Recent studies showed that social engineers could succeed even among those organizations that identify themselves as being aware of social engineering techniques. Although organizations recognize the serious risks of social engineering, there is little understanding and control of such threats. This may be partly due to the complexity of human behaviors in failing to recognize attackers in SNSs. Due to the vital role that impersonation plays in influencing users to fall victim to social engineering deception, this paper aims to investigate the impact of source characteristics on users' susceptibility to social engineering victimization on Facebook. In doing so, we identify source credibility dimensions in terms of social engineering on Facebook, Facebook-based source characteristics that influence users to judge an attacker as per these dimensions, and mediation effects that these dimensions play between Facebook-based source characteristics and susceptibility to social engineering victimization.

KW  - Stigma
AB  - Background: Society's attitude towards patients with mental illness has been evolving over the past century and the speed of this evolution has particularly accelerated since the advent of modern ways of communication and media. As with other areas of development, attitude change may be expected to be slow-paced in our country but local evidence is lacking in this regard.
   Objective: To measure the level of stigma towards mental illness in medical students along with its association with their prior exposure to Psychiatry.
   Method: This is across-sectional study conducted between May to August 2019 at a private medical college. Consecutive sampling was used to include a total of 247 (71% female and 29% male) students of the fourth and final year MBBS after written informed consent. A specially designed form was used to collect relevant socio-demographic details along with data regarding exposure to Psychiatry. The scores from self-reported Mental Illness: Clinicians' Attitudes scale (MICA)were also recorded. Chi-Square test was used to assess the association of exposure to psychiatry to stigmatizing attitudes. Data were analyzed using SPSS20.
   Results: Prior exposure to mental illness in family or friend was reported by 60.5% of the students, 70% described an exposure through media and only 32% had undergone a clinical psychiatry rotation. Average stigma scores on MICA were found in 41% of our sample, while 32% had above-average scores and 27% had lower than average stigma. Pearson' schi-square test showed that the previous exposure to mental illness via media sources was found to be significantly associated with lower levels of stigma in medical students (p= <0.05).
   Conclusion: A significant proportion of medical students hold negative views about psychiatric illness. Familiarity with mental health issue through media sources is linked to lower stigmatizing attitudes.

Data were collected by a face-to-face survey instrument in Turkey from 594 smartphone owners who actively participated in brand engagement activities. Structural equation modeling and Hayes Process macro analyses were used to examine the research hypothesis. Findings showed perceived enjoyment is the most important stimuli to increase positive attitudes toward consumer engagement behaviors. In particular, self-brand connection plays a vital role in this mechanism and indirectly influences attitudes via enhancing involvement, perceived enjoyment, and benefit.

AB  - Recent research has demonstrated that mentally simulating positive intergroup encounters can promote tolerance and more positive intergroup attitudes. We explored the attributional processes underlying these effects. In our study participants who imagined intergroup contact subsequently reported greater intentions to engage in future contact, a relationship that was mediated by participants' attribution, to themselves, of a more positive attitudinal orientation towards outgroup contact. Consistent with this attributional account, the perspective taken when imagining the encounter qualified this effect. Participants who imagined the encounter from a third-person perspective reported heightened intentions to engage in future contact relative to control participants, while this was not the case when the encounter was imagined from a first-person perspective. These findings suggest that attributional processes are key to observing the benefits that accrue from imagining intergroup contact. We speculate that these attributions may distinguish the approach from extended and actual forms of contact and help researchers to further capitalize on the benefits of mental imagery for improving intergroup relations.

AB  - Migration influx in Western countries resulting in increasingly diverse societies results in more complex situations for bureaucrats in their client interactions in welfare organizations. The role of discretion for services to clients has received much attention in the public administration research and therefore this study explores the relation among perceived workload, anti-immigration attitudes, perceived discretion, and perceived difficulty in working with migrants. The paper examines the function of perceived discretion as moderator or mediator variable in this constellation. The relations are examined by using structural equation modelling based on a survey among Swedish welfare bureaucrats (N = 1,319). The results show that heavier perceived workload increased the likelihood of experiencing work with migrants as difficult and that greater perceived discretion decreased the likelihood of experiencing work with migrants as difficult. The results suggest that perceived discretion functions as a mediator for the relation between perceived workload and difficulty in work with migrants: potentially functioning as a 'buffer' for organizational pressure. We also found that bureaucrats who hold negative attitudes towards migrants were more likely to express their work with migrants as more difficult. This paper contributes to the public administration literature by increasing our knowledge on how discretion has significance in relation to when bureaucrat's behaviour is determined by specific organizational and personal factors.

AB  - Purpose Grounded in the concept of signaling theory and instrumental-symbolic framework, the purpose of this paper is to develop a model to examine the impact of print job advertisement (ad) dimensions (message contents) and organizational familiarity on job seeker's perception of attitude, organizational attractiveness, and application intention.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper is a theoretical exploration based on existing literature.
   Findings The presence of instrumental and symbolic attributes in print job advertisement such as job and work characteristics, aesthetics, employee testimonial/picture, corporate image enhancing statements, organizational culture-enhancing statements, and human resource offerings are more likely to play influential roles in creating favorable attitude, organizational attractiveness, and application intention in a job seeker. Apart from this, organizational familiarity plays a moderating role on job seeker's attitude formation and in gaining organizational attractiveness.
   Practical implications The study offers a clear guideline to recruiting organizations, HR managers, recruitment agencies, or consultants on how to design a recruitment advertisement to pool a large number of potential applicants. The study also throws light on testing the effectiveness of a recruitment advertisement, similar to commercial ads. Moreover, the outcome of testing would help the recruiters understand the pulse of the job seeker toward the ad, job, and organization.
   Originality/value This study theoretically clarifies the role of instrumental and symbolic attributes or dimensions of job ads and the role of organizational familiarity in inducing positive attitude formation and organizational attractiveness, in the process that cultivates application intention in a potential job seeker.

AB  - In 2009, the United States Air Force aired a series of science fiction-themed recruitment commercials on network television and their official YouTube channel. In these advertisements, the superimposition of science fiction imagery over depictions of Air Force operations frames these missions as near-future sci-fi adventure, ironically summarized by the tagline: "It's not science fiction. It's what we do every day." Focusing on an early advertisement for the Air Force's Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle, this essay explores how themes essential to the science fiction genre play a role in influencing contemporary attitudes about autonomous and semi-autonomous robotic weapons, as well as the way in which the aesthetic and functional qualities of these advanced technologies are used to frame moral arguments about their use. As a reconfiguration of the near-future battleground in the guise of science fiction, the "Reaper" ad reveals the way in which science fiction has come to serve as a functional-aesthetic benchmark and cultural sounding board, against which "every day" technologies can be measured and claims about their value, ethos, and social appeal are made. This essay explores the ethical entanglements between science fiction film and video games, and military technology, and the complex role science fiction plays in influencing public attitudes towards military technologies.

AB  - This research examines the mediating role of the tendency for Internet addiction, fear of missing out (FOMO), and psychological well-being in the relationship between online exposure to movement-related information and support for radical actions. A questionnaire survey that targets tertiary students was conducted during the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill (Anti-ELAB) Movement (N = 290). The findings reveal the mediating effect of Internet addiction and depression as the main relationship. These findings enrich the literature of political communication by addressing the political impact of Internet use beyond digital architecture. From the perspective of psychology, this research echoes the literature that concerns depression symptoms driven by a protest environment. Radical political attitudes driven by depression during protests should also be concerned based on the findings of this survey.

AB  - BackgroundThe anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been shown to be involved in emotional distress induced by social exclusion and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) in the regulation or inhibition of the distress. Here, we examined modulation of effective connectivity between the regions in response to emotional feedback in children with experiences of ostracism in their everyday life.
   MethodsIn functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments, 10 ostracized children and 11 control children were provided emotional feedback inducing negative or positive affective states. We employed effective connectivity analysis to explore connectivity models comprising the VLPFC and ACC, and to estimate connectivity parameters over the models.
   ResultsIn spite of psychological impacts on the ostracized children, behavioral data showed that their emotional responses did not deviate from the control children in response to the emotional feedback. The VLPFC to ACC connectivity was modulated only in the ostracized children, such that the modulation may help them regulate their emotional responses.
   ConclusionsThe findings suggest that the effects of ostracism experiences on affective processing can be revealed in terms of modulation of prefrontal-cingulate connectivity.

AB  - Background: Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are one of the vital and persuading means of information, prevention and control, and incentive of vaccination to content a pandemic. Therefore, knowing the status of HCPs' perception about symptoms, transmission, preventive measures, and attitudes towards a vaccine against COVID-19 is crucial. Methods: This multi-center cross-sectional descriptive study was one of the first and foremost ones in Bangladesh among the HCPs -doctors, nurses, and other subordinates (MLSS) engaged at COVID-dedicated hospitals. The study was conducted from February 5, 2021, to March 7, 2021, using a convenience sampling method among 550 HCPs using structured questionnaire with twenty-five questions on a three-point scale of responses. Results: The age range of the respondents were 18 to 64 years with the mean 36.17 +/- 10.94 years of 524 HCPs, of which the majority of the respondents were female 323 (61.6%) and 201 (38.4%) were male with the 95.27% response rate. Almost all participants had "high" or more than sufficient perception (94.34%) about the symptoms of COVID-19. But all categories of HCPs expressed their poor or fair practice about restraining from shaking hands, and only 6.84% of nurses, 8.33% doctors, and 11.59% of MLSS avoided crowded public gatherings as a practice of prevention. A majority (95.99%) of the HCPs showed positive attitudes about the availability of vaccines free of cost, and 87.40% showed trust in the efficacy and safety of the vaccine against COVID-19. Conclusion: The majority of the HCPs from the COVID-dedicated hospitals have a good perception and positive attitude towards vaccination; nevertheless, have a poor practice of prevention toward COVID-19. This may play a vital role in motivation and wide acceptance of vaccine among the general population and contribute in comprehensive strategic planning to fight back against the pandemic in the country with the restricted resource.

Results demonstrated a statistically significant but substantively weak association between greater pornography viewing and more positive attitudes toward transgender people. Additionally, results demonstrated that viewers' experience of shame about their sexual attractions to transgender people did not moderate the relationship between porn viewing and attitudes. However, analysis revealed an unhypothesized direct influence of sexual shame on attitudes toward transgender people such that higher levels of shame were associated with greater prejudice. Results are discussed in the context of sexual scripting and the revived porn debates. Further longitudinal research focusing on how the feelings viewers have about the pornography they view impacts erotic media's effects is encouraged.

AB  - There are benefits and challenges related to the recent worldwide Covid-19-driven surge of social-media collaborative learning in higher education. This research examines the antecedents influencing this 'new normal' phenomenon among university students to provide a causal model of understanding. This study was based on a purposive sample; a questionnaire was completed by 371 university students. The analysis of the data obtained using applied structural equation modelling of the partial least-squares technique, it was found that the most influential antecedents included collaborative capability and perceived enjoyment. Based on the results, we recommend that, owing to the turbulent and changing requirements of social distancing and distance learning, educational institutions and stakeholders invest in the improvement of implied social-media collaboration and learning platforms.

AB  - Aim/Purpose Improving public schools is a focus of federal legislation in the United States with much of the burden placed on principals. However, preparing principals for this task has proven elusive despite many changes in programming by institutions of higher learning. Emerging technologies that rely on augmented and virtual realities are posited to be powerful pedagogical tools for closing this gap.
   Background This study investigated the effects of immersive simulation technologies on principals' self-efficacy after treatment and the perceived significance of the design of the immersive simulation experience as an effective tool for adult learners.
   Methodology The investigator employed a multiple-methods study that relied on a purposive sample of graduate students enrolled in educational leadership programs at two small universities in the southeastern United States. Participants completed a two-hour module of immersive simulation designed to facilitate transfer of knowledge to skills thereby increasing their self-efficacy.
   Contribution This paper contributes to a small body of literature that examines the use of immersive simulation to prepare aspiring principals.
   Findings The findings indicate moderate effect sizes in changes in self-efficacy, positive attitudes toward immersive simulation as a pedagogical tool, and significance in the design of immersive simulation modules. This suggests that immersive simulation, when properly designed, aids principals in taking action to improve schools.
   Recommendations for Practitioners Educational leadership programs might consider the use of immersive simulations to enhance principals' ability to meet the complex demands of leading in the 21st century.
   Impact on Society Principals may be more adept at improving schools if preparation programs provided consistent opportunities to engage in immersive simulations.
   Future Research Future research should be conducted with larger sample sizes and longitudinally to determine the effectiveness of this treatment.

AB  - Background Risk evaluation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases can guide the decision-making on various preventive measures, such as initiating or deferring statin therapy. Pharmacists can play an active part in the risk evaluation and primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Thus, our study aimed to assess the pharmacists' knowledge, attitude, perceived barriers, and practices regarding risk assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 500 pharmacists using a structured validated questionnaire between November 2020 and February 2021. The Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyze the data. Results A total of 456 pharmacists completed the questionnaire out of 500 distributed (91.2% response rate). Over 60% of participants responded with never or rarely for two out of five cardiovascular diseases (CVD) prevention practices. The lowest pharmacist-patient counseling practices were for side effects of statin medication (14.5%) and reviewing the patient's medications to avoid potential statin-drug interactions (31.8%). Participants had a high positive attitude (median = 34 out of 40). The three major barriers for risk assessment were the lack of support (74.8%), the lack of resources (70.6%), and inadequate training (48.7%). Interestingly, having <= 75 customers a day, community pharmacies, PharmD degree, age >= 30 years, and experience >= 6 years were significantly associated (p < .05) with higher CVD prevention activities and counseling practices. Conclusion Pharmacists have a high positive attitude toward CVD risk assessment. However, they had insufficient knowledge and only provided limited activities and counseling services for CVD prevention and statin therapy. Participants perceived several barriers to CVD risk assessment services in pharmacies. Therefore, it is necessary to remove these impediments for pharmacists to be more involved in CVD risk assessment and prevention. Also, continuing medical education and adequate training for pharmacists are required.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to investigate the effect of metaphor "Digital India-Power to Empower" on citizens' intention to adopt the e-governance while taking citizens' attitude and emotional attachment with Digital India as mediating variables between citizens' involvement and intention to adopt e-governance. Design/methodology/approach After reviewing the extant literature and using the learning from Technology Acceptance Model-Extension (TAME), a conceptual model has been proposed. The model is empirically tested on 224 respondents from India using structural equation modeling technique. Findings The paper suggested that the metaphoric promotion of E-Governance leads to a higher intention to adopt E-Governance. Metaphoric promotion has a positive influence on citizen involvement with E-Governance, which leads to positive attitude toward E-Governance. This positive attitude leads to citizens' emotional attachment with E-Governance, which in turn leads to citizens' positive behavioral intention to adopt E-Governance. In addition, there is a significant difference in attitude toward E-Governance with respect to education level and metro city dwelling, but there is no difference in intention to adopt E-Governance with respect to education and metro city dwelling.
   Research limitations/implications - As there is a dearth of research on the usage of metaphor by government and its effect on citizens' adoption of E-Governance, a conceptual model has been prepared by using learning from metaphor studies majorly in non-government services.
   Originality/value - As marketing and metaphors are rarely spoken words in E-Governance research, present study starts the much-needed conversation. In the past, adoption of E-Governance is studied in terms of technology attributes using TAM Model. The present study is first to explore the behavioral impact of E-Governance metaphoric promotion on citizens' intention to adopt E-Governance based on TAME model. It raises the issue of marketing foundation of E-Governance in mobilizing the citizens' intention to adopt the E-Governance.

AB  - The role of organizational attitude for an effective knowledge sharing (KS) in IT outsourcing (ITO) relationships has not been adequately addressed. In this paper, the authors investigate the relationship between KS and ITO success as well as the potential moderating effect of organizational attitude on the relationship between KS and partnership quality in ITO. By leveraging structural equation modeling (SEM) on survey data from 153 ITO projects, results show that organizational attitudes significantly influence knowledge sharing and partnership quality, which in turn results in successful ITO project. Moreover, the relationship between knowledge sharing and partnership quality is more pronounced when the partner firms have positive attitudes to KS. The authors further showed that partnership quality mediates the relationship between knowledge sharing and the success of an ITO project. Finally, the results of this study indicate that positive organizational attitude improves knowledge sharing between the client and service providers (i.e., vendors) and creates stronger outsourcing partnerships.

AB  - Objective: Patients beliefs determine their response to an illness and its management especially if it is chronic. Studies assessing patient's knowledge of their epilepsy are scarce. We report the first objective study evaluating knowledge, attitude and practices of epilepsy patients referred to a tertiary care centre in East Coast of Malaysia. Materials and Methods: A cross sectional study using pre-tested, semi-structured questionnaire among consenting epilepsy patients. Results: The demographic details and responses to a questionnaire assessing their insight towards epilepsy were recorded. Among 132 respondents, 51.5% were male and 48.5 % were female. Their age ranged from 14 to 70 years (mean = 31.63 +/- 13.41). Majority (53.8%) of them aged equal or less than 30 years. The median number of years they had epilepsy was 8.0 (4.0, 18.8) years and average duration of seizure prior to seeking medical attention was 1.0 (0.3, 4.5) years. The average number of years they were receiving treatment from a hospital was 5.50 +/- 5.84. Most (90.9%) did not know the cause of epilepsy; however 93.9 % were aware that it can be treated with modern drugs. While only 22.7 % believed that faith healers can treat epilepsy, 74.2% had tried other forms of treatment. Negative attitude was reflected in the belief that epilepsy is due to supernatural powers (1.5%) and that epilepsy is contagious (17.4 %). Positive attitude included that PWE can take a job (66.7%), allowing a child with epilepsy to study (80%), not objecting children to play with a child with epilepsy (54.5%), marry (65.9%) and having children (58.3%). Conclusions: Patients with epilepsy are not knowledgeable about their disorder. This is true regardless of age, educational background, or number of years with epilepsy. The results suggest that there is a critical need to enhance epilepsy education and improve attitudes towards epilepsy beyond seizure control.

AB  - Background: Burn prevention and first aid knowledge amongst medical students is a neglected subject. Objectives: 1. Assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices of medical students regarding burn prevention and first aid 2. Identify their sources of knowledge. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional survey of KKU medical students documented their sociodemographic data, knowledge, attitudes and practices of burn prevention and first aid, and their sources of information. Data was analysed using SPSS 17. Descriptive information was presented as frequency and percentages, while Chi square test was used to find association of knowledge with sociodemographic factors. Results: A total of 273 students, from preclinical and clinical level were enrolled in the study. With an average of 9.3 correct responses, the median score of knowledge regarding burn prevention and first aid was 56.2 %. About half of the respondents (50.9%) achieved a fair knowledge score i.e. between 50-75%. College curriculum emerged as the major source of information for burn prevention (34.06%) and first aid (25.27%). About 42 % students suggested that inclusion in college curriculum would be the best way to increase awareness. You Tube emerged as the most common extra-curricular learning method (67.7%). Students in clinical years of medical education demonstrated significantly higher knowledge than those in pre-clinical years (p=0.01, COR=1.82). Fire prevention practices were not widely in place; however students revealed a positive attitude towards the same. Conclusion: Medical students have a fair knowledge in burn prevention and first aid and carry a positive attitude towards training. Incorporating social media for health awareness shows promise.

AB  - The term political extremism is commonly used to refer to political attitudes considered to be outside the ideological mainstream. This study leverages computational content analysis of big data to longitudinally examine (1970-2019) the prevalence of terms denoting far-right and far-left political extremism in more than 30 million written news and opinion articles from 54 news media outlets popular in the United States and the United Kingdom. We find that the usage of terms denoting right and left political extremism has been increasing across news media outlets in both countries. This trend is particularly stark for far-right-denoting terms, which have been growing in prevalence since at least 2008. Most U.S. and U.K. news media outlets tend to use far-right-denoting terms substantially more often than they use far-left-denoting terms. The rising prevalence in news media of terms denoting political extremism is strongly correlated with similar growing usage of terms denoting prejudice and social justice discourse.

AB  - Background: There have been few studies on the stigma associated with mental disorders among non-mental health professionals in general hospitals in China. This study seeks to explore mental health-related stigma and the desire for social distance among non-mental health professionals in general hospitals in Hunan Province in China. Methods: The study was carried out with 1123 non-mental health professionals in six general hospitals in Hunan Province by using a questionnaire with a case vignette describing either schizophrenia, depression, or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Questions were asked about the attitudes of participants and other people towards individuals with mental disorders and the willingness to come into contact with them. Results: The people described in the vignette were considered dangerous by 84.4% of participants for schizophrenia, 72.0% of participants for depression, and 63.1% of participants for GAD. Besides being dangerous, people with schizophrenia were perceived as unpredictable and as the least suitable for voting for as a politician or employing. Around 50% of participants believed the problems described in the vignette were due to personal weakness. Over 70% of the non-mental health professionals were not willing to have the people described in the vignette marry into their family. The participants had gained their mental health-related knowledge mainly through the media, mostly from newspapers. Conclusions: The current study found a significant stigma towards individuals with mental disorders and a desire for social distance from such people among non-mental health professionals in general hospitals in Hunan Province. Anti-stigma interventions should focus on addressing non-mental health professionals' beliefs on dangerousness and unpredictability.

AB  - Technology-delivered psychological interventions, particularly online and telephonic counselling, have flourished in recent years, with the need for such a flexible delivery method increasing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While empirical research on technology-delivered psychological interventions is limited, findings indicate that therapists have a positive attitude towards online counselling. There is a particular lack of research on therapists' perceptions and experiences of using technology-delivered interventions. The primary aim of this study was to explore therapists' experiences of providing online counselling, thereby gaining insight into the therapeutic experience, processes and efficacy from the therapists' perspective. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with five therapists, registered with organisations providing professional counselling and psychotherapy, with experience of providing synchronous/real-time online video, audio or chat-mediated counselling sessions. The interviews comprised open-ended questions. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to analyse the data, through which two superordinate themes were identified: (a) environmental adaptation and (b) practice enhancement. Our findings suggest that therapists' online counselling experiences incorporate several factors related to environmental adaptation and practice enhancement that impact the therapeutic process, outcomes, progress and relationship. The findings could inform the development of training, awareness-raising and skills-enhanced interventions for psychotherapists already using and hoping to use online therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Youth involved in the juvenile justice system are at elevated risk for HIV as a result of high rates of sexual risk taking, substance use, mental health problems and sexually transmitted infections. Yet few HIV prevention programs exist for young offenders. This pilot study examined change in juvenile offenders' sexual activity, drug/alcohol use, HIV testing and counseling, and theoretical mediators of risk taking following participation in preventing HIV/AIDS among teens (PHAT Life), an HIV-prevention program for teens on probation. Participants (N = 54) were 13-17 year-old arrested males and females remanded to a detention alternative setting. Youth participated in a uniquely tailored HIV prevention intervention and completed a baseline and 3-month follow up assessment of their HIV and substance use knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. At 3-month follow up, teens reported less alcohol use, more positive attitudes toward peers with HIV, greater ability to resist temptation to use substances, and for males, improved HIV prevention self-efficacy and peer norms supporting prevention. Teens were also more likely to seek HIV counseling and males were more likely to get tested for HIV. Effect sizes revealed moderate change in sexual behavior. Findings support PHAT Life as a promising intervention to reduce HIV-risk among youth in juvenile justice.

AB  - Despite the emerging trend of adopting co-creative approaches in public and non-profit advertising, research has overlooked participatory approaches in non-commercial settings. This research extends current knowledge on consumer-generated advertising to communications fostering positive social change. The results of an experimental study show that the disclosure of consumer participation in the ad creation process results in positive ad evaluations and reduces positive attitudes towards unhealthy eating. The main effect of source disclosure on ad evaluations is mediated by sympathy towards the ad creator. In addition, floodlight analyses show that the main effect of source disclosure on ad evaluations and attitudes is amplified when the audience is highly involved with the advertised issue. Implications for theory, practice and public policy are discussed.

AB  - Jails and prisons have become hotbeds of COVID-19 outbreaks. Various policies, such as improving access to medical care for inmates, providing soap and hand sanitizer to improve hygiene, and releasing some inmates to facilitate social distancing, have been proposed as ways to mitigate the spread of the virus in these facilities. Across 2 studies, we examined the factors underlying support for policies aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 in jails (n = 132) and prisons (n = 125) and yielded 3 key findings. Factors found in prior research to be associated with desire for punitive responses-namely, negative attitudes toward offenders and, to a lesser extent, lack of trust in the criminal justice system-were found to underlie lack of support for all types of COVID-19 mitigation policies. Concern related to COVID-19-namely, perceptions of personal risk of contracting the virus-was related to increased support for policies to curb the spread of the virus among inmates. Social media consumption and reliance on social media for news regarding COVID-19 demonstrated inconsistent relationships with support for policies. These findings suggest that factors related to support for harsh treatment of offenders and concerns related to the present situation both contribute to support for criminal justice policy during a crisis situation like a pandemic. The recommended policies offer hope for reducing the negative impact of COVID-19 among justice-involved people. We offer suggestions on tailoring messaging to improve public support for these policies.

KW  - DEBATE
AB  - From early 20th century headlines to presidential tweets, immigration is described frequently in terms of waves, floods, and tides. Although usage of this inundation metaphor has been widely documented, its potential influence on immigration attitudes has not been assessed empirically. Building from conceptual metaphor theory's claim that abstract ideas can be grounded in simpler, concrete concepts, we hypothesized that using the inundation metaphor to understand immigration contributes to support for a U.S.-Mexico border wall as a figurative means to block immigrants. Accordingly, social media posts supporting a border wall contained more inundation-metaphoric expressions than messages opposing a wall and messages opposing immigration without reference to a wall (Study 1; N = 4,067). Converging experimental tests show, when controlling for political attitudes, exposure to the inundation metaphor increases support for a border wall (Studies 2a and 2b; N = 737). These findings add to the growing body of evidence that political cognition and policy attitudes are partly motivated by metaphoric comparisons to concrete ideas that are irrelevant in a literal sense.

AB  - Some antibullying interventions have shown positive outcomes with regard to reducing violence. The aim of the study was to experimentally assess the effects on school violence and aggressiveness of a program to prevent and reduce cyberbullying. The sample was comprised of a randomly selected sample of 176 adolescents (93 experimental, 83 control), aged 13-15 years. The study used a repeated measures pre-posttest design with a control group. Before and after the program, two assessment instruments were administered: the "Cuestionario de Violencia Escolar-Revisado" (CUVE-R [School Violence Questionnaire- Revised]; Alvarez Garcia et al., 2011) and the "Cuestionario de agresividad premeditada e impulsiva" (CAPI-A [Premeditated and Impulsive Aggressiveness Questionnaire]; Andreu, 2010). The intervention consisted of 19 one-hour sessions carried out during the school term. The program contains 25 activities with the following objectives: (1) to identify and conceptualize bullying/cyberbullying; (2) to analyze the consequences of bullying/cyberbullying, promoting participants' capacity to report such actions when they are discovered; (3) to develop coping strategies to prevent and reduce bullying/cyberbullying; and (4) to achieve other transversal goals, such as developing positive variables (empathy, active listening, social skills, constructive conflict resolution, etc.). The pre-posttest ANCOVAs confirmed that the program stimulated a decrease in: (1) diverse types of school violence teachers' violence toward students (ridiculing or publicly humiliating students in front of the class, etc.); students' physical violence (fights, blows, shoves... aimed at the victim, or at his or her property, etc.); students' verbal violence (using offensive language, cruel, embarrassing, or insulting words... toward classmates and teachers); social exclusion (rejection or exclusion of a person or group, etc.), and violence through Information and Communication Technologies (ICT; violent behaviors by means of electronic instruments such as mobile phones and the Internet); and (2) premeditated and impulsive aggressiveness. Pre-posttest MANCOVA revealed differences between conditions with a medium effect size. This work contributes an efficacious intervention tool for the prevention and reduction of peer violence. The conclusions drawn from this study have interesting implications for educational and clinical intervention.

AB  - Tourist satisfaction is a key factor in tourism sustainability. A multiple mediation model is proposed to analyze the relationship between ecotourism knowledge and ecotourist satisfaction, assisting our understanding of the generative mechanism by which ecotourism knowledge influences ecotourist satisfaction. Ecotourists at the Natural Park Saltos de la Damajagua (Dominican Republic) were administered a questionnaire. The results (PLS-SEM) show that ecotourism site perceived value and attitudes towards ecotourism fully mediate the influence of ecotourism knowledge on ecotourist satisfaction. Ecotourism knowledge will therefore only have positive effects on ecotourist satisfaction when the ecotourism site is of high perceived value and there are positive attitudes towards ecotourism.

AB  - In a series of experiments, a retraining paradigm was used to test the effects of attitudes and stereotypes on individuals' motivation and cognitive capacity in stereotype-threatening contexts. Women trained to have a more positive math attitude exhibited increased math motivation (Study 1). This effect was not observed for men but was magnified among women when negative stereotypes were either primed subtly (Study 2) or indirectly reinforced (Study 3). Although attitudes had no effect on working memory capacity, women retrained to associate their gender with being good at math exhibited increased working memory capacity (Studies 3 and 4), which in turn mediated increased math performance (Study 4) in a stereotype-threatening context. Results suggest that although positive attitudes can motivate stigmatized individuals to engage with threatening domains, stereotypes need to be retrained to give them the cognitive capacity critical for success. Implications for interventions to reduce stereotype threat are discussed.

AB  - Background: As a neglected cross-species parasitic disease transmitted between canines and livestock, echinococcosis remains a global public health concern with a heavy disease burden. In China, especially in the epidemic pastoral communities on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the harsh climate, low socio-economic status, poor overall hygiene, and remote and insufficient access to all owned dogs exacerbate the difficulty in implementing the ambitious control programme for echinococcosis. We aimed to design and implement a remote management system (RMS) based on internet of things (IoT) for control and surveillance of echinococcosis by combining deworming devices to realise long-distance smart deworming control, smooth statistical analysis and result display. New methods and tools are urgently needed to increase the deworming coverage and frequency, promote real-time scientific surveillance, and prevent transmission of echinococcosis in remoted transmission areas.
   Methods: From 2016 to 2019, we had cooperated and developed the smart collar and smart feeder with the Central Research Institute of Shanghai Electric Group Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and Shenzhen Jizhi Future Technology Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China). From September 2019 to March 2020, We had proposed the RMS based on IoT as a novel tool to control smart deworming devices to deliver efficient praziquantel (PZQ) baits to dogs regularly and automatically and also as a smart digital management platform to monitor, analyse, and display the epidemic trends of echinococcosis dynamically, in real time in Hezuo City, Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, China. Starting from January 2018, The RMS has been maintained and upgraded by Shanghai Yier Information Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). The database was based on MySQL tools and the Chi-square test was used to probe the difference and changes of variables in different groups.
   Results: The smart collars are fully capable of anti-collision, waterproof, and cold-proof performance, and the battery's energy is sufficient, the anti-collision rate, water-proof rate, cold-proof rate and voltage normal rate is 99.6% (521/523), 100.0% (523/523), 100.0% (523/523) and 100.0% (523/523), respectively. The RMS can accurately analyse the monitoring data and parameters including positive rates of canine faeces, and the prevalence of echinococcosis in the general population livestock, and children. The data of dogs deworming and surveillance for echinococcosis is able to be controlled using RMS and has expanded gradually in townships to the whole Hezuo region. The automatic delivering PZQ rate, collar positioning rate, deliver PZQ reminding rate, and fault report rate is 91.1% (1914/2102), 92.1% (13 580/14 745), 92.1% (1936/2102) and 84.7% (1287/1519), respectively. After using the RMS from 2019, the missing rate of monitoring data decreased from 32.1% (9/28) to 0 (0/16). A total of 48 administrators (3, 3, 8, 11, 23 at the provincial, municipal, county, township, village levels, respectively) participated in the questionnaire survey, with 93.8% of its overall satisfaction rate.
   Conclusions: The existing difficulties and challenges in the way of prevention and control for echinococcosis can partially be resolved using the innovative, IoT-based technologies and tools. The proposed RMS advance the upgrade of existing manual prevention and control models for echinococcosis, especially in the current ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as social distance and community blockade continue.

AB  - Background This study aimed to evaluate the associations among oral health-related knowledge, attitudes, practice (KAP), self-rated oral health and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) among Chinese college students. Methods Of the 2000 participants, 1751 (87.55%) students answered an online questionnaire between October 2019 and January 2020. The questionnaire included demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, and practice related to oral health, self-rated oral health, and OHRQoL. Structural equation modelling was applied to assess the associations among study variables. Results Among the total students, oral health-related knowledge and attitudes were satisfactory, while the oral health practice was not optimistic. The final model showed satisfactory fitness to the data. Oral health knowledge was associated with attitudes directly and positively. Attitudes toward oral health had a direct and positive effect on practice. Oral health knowledge had an indirect effect on practice through attitudes. Oral health practice was directly associated with self-rated oral health. Oral health knowledge, practice, and self-rated oral health all affected OHRQoL directly and positively, while attitudes had a direct negative impact on OHRQoL. Conclusions OHRQoL was influenced by oral health knowledge, attitudes, practice, and self-rated oral health. Our findings support the KAP theory. Limitations of the KAP model were also found.

AB  - While previous research on entertainment-education has assessed its effectiveness, primarily at the conscious level (e.g., free recall and self-reported change in knowledge), few studies have explored its effect on viewers' implicit knowledge. To fill this gap, this study examined the mechanism through which viewers form implicit memory of short health messages inserted in a primetime TV show and its preconscious effects on viewers' health attitudes and intentions. An experiment was conducted using a 3-group (health message: present vs. absent vs. control), posttest-only design with additional planned analyses of differences by subject variables (past experience and involvement). Overall, findings supported the hypothesized effects of implicit memory of a brief antialcohol message embedded in an ER episode on college students' attitudes and intentions against binge drinking. Results showed that participants who were exposed to the health message reported less positive attitudes toward binge drinking and lower intentions to binge drink, compared with those who were not exposed; the causal relations among viewers' implicit memory, attitudes, and intentions were also validated. Results also showed that individuals' past experience and involvement moderated the effects of the health message on attitudes and intentions. Theoretical explanations and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - According to the cognitive perspective, the generation of counterarguments is a key obstacle to persuasion. Following the metacognitive view, however, the experience of difficulty that accompanies increased counterarguing may benefit persuasion. These two contrasting predictions were evaluated in two experiments (N-1 = 392; N-2 = 210) by manipulating the instructions of thought-listing tasks following exposure to a testimonial that advocated for Physician-Assisted Suicide. Results for participants low-in-NfC supported the cognitive prediction, whereby generating many counterarguments (7) led to less favorable attitudes toward PAS, whereas fewer counterarguments (2) engendered more positive attitudes. In contrast, among participants high in NfC, increased counterarguing (7) resulted in more favorable attitudes toward PAS, while fewer counterarguments (2) were translated into greater opposition.

AB  - This study attempted to investigate the effects of perceived organizational support (POS) and role clarity on volunteer satisfaction, the mediating role of attitudes toward volunteering in the relationship between volunteer satisfaction and attitudes toward civic participation, and the moderating role of self-efficacy toward service in the relationships between POS, role clarity, and volunteer satisfaction among mandatory volunteers. Using data conducted at a major event in Wuhan, China, results showed that POS and role clarity predicted volunteer satisfaction. Volunteer satisfaction positively influenced attitudes toward volunteering, which is linked to attitudes toward civic participation. Self-efficacy toward service moderated the associations between POS, role clarity, and volunteer satisfaction, highlighting its essential role in strengthening the effects of organizational climate factors on volunteer satisfaction. Our findings underline the important role of organizations in increasing mandatory volunteers' satisfaction that affects positive attitudes toward volunteering, leading to enhanced attitudes toward civic participation.

AB  - For many decades, the Argentinean travesti (transvestite) community has suffered appalling life conditions due to discrimination, social exclusion and (until the enacting of the Gender Identity Law) official denial of their identities. Using qualitative methodology and from the frame of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), this article studies how some Argentinean television programmes from 1993 to 2010 constructed discursive representations about travestis. The analysis reveals two opposing combinations of linguistic resources (strategies) regarding the State abuses suffered by the travestis, their need for social inclusion and their collective fight for their human rights: while the travestis who participate in the programmes reinforce these aspects, the television presenters systematically mitigate them. The discursive representations thus built by the programmes tend to maintain a postmodern' status quo, which could explain why the Argentinean Gender Identity Law was not accompanied, in 2012, by a public debate as resounding as the one that accompanied same-sex marriage in 2010.

AB  - This study explored grade and gender differences of secondary school students' attitudes toward life and well-being, as well as relationships between these two variables in Taiwan. One thousand and seventy-seven students from seventh to twelfth grades were randomly selected to complete a questionnaire to measure their attitudes toward life and well-being. It was found that the seventh grade students had significantly higher scores on attitudes toward life and well-being than their counterparts. Compared with their male counterparts, female students had significantly higher attitudes toward life scores on the factors of caring for others and clarifying life goals, and on the well-being factors of successful interpersonal communications and satisfaction with personal life. Students' attitudes toward life were strongly and positively associated with their well-being (r = .90). The structural equation modeling results revealed that students' attitudes toward life on the subscale of satisfied about one's performance was the strongest predictor of their well-being (beta = .38); that students' well-being on the subscale of Self-satisfaction was the strongest predictor of their attitudes toward life (beta = .50). The above findings provide valuable insights into Taiwanese secondary school students' grade and gender differences of attitudes toward life and well-being as well as relationships between the two. These might further offer empirical evidences for planning and implementing effective pedagogical strategies or career counseling aimed at increasing students' positive attitudes toward life and well-being.

AB  - Purpose The first year of college is a stressful life period connected with the experience of loneliness, isolation and depression since the majority of freshmen can no longer maintain an equally close relationship with school friends and family. Social networks have become a significant part of students' daily lives and might be an effective tool for maintaining relationship and reducing loneliness. There are contradictory results concerning the relationship between social networks sites (SNS) use and feelings of loneliness. Design/methodology/approach A four-week experiment was conducted to study the effect of SNS on feelings of social and emotional loneliness across freshmen. The treatment group (n = 40) took a break from SNS, while the control group (n = 37) used SNS as usual. Findings Comparison of the treatment and control groups showed that quitting SNS does not change either feeling of social/emotional loneliness. This paper also found that feelings of social and emotional loneliness did not depend on freshmen's positive/negative attitudes toward being alone. Originality/value This study is one of the few that uses experimental design to study the effects of using social networks on the psychological state of students in the context of higher education. The results showed that refusing SNS use can have a positive potential for psychological well-being of freshmen since solitude can be used by them as time for self-discovery and self-development. According to the results, social networks neither increase nor decrease the feeling of loneliness, and offline learning and communication environment plays a more significant role in the adaptation of freshmen. These results allow to take a new look at the studies related to the relationship between SNS use and loneliness and the role of social networks in the adaptation of freshmen.

AB  - Viral influence of consumer reviews can change the strategic intent of co-branding relationships between minority entrepreneurial startups and established corporations. When social justice positioning is involved, the intent is often to support minority businesses. We acknowledge this strategy as social justice branding. However, such alliances can trigger vitriolic responses. This backlash is an expression of free speech, and social media provides an obscure facilitative environment. The challenges of social justice branding are complex. We examine consumer online reviews of The Honey Pot and Target Corporation partnership, to understand the implications of social justice branding in practice. Using Leximancer analysis, we find that social justice branding elicits multiple emotions that empower action. Some consumers accepted the collaboration while others resisted. Analyzing the basis of the resistance revealed some consumers expressed racist and shameful behaviors displaying disagreement. Backlash reflected willful ignorance releasing pent up prejudices and disseminating viral-like negative information as weapons of retaliation against brands and marginalized communities. We contribute a conceptual model integrating theoretical frames of social justice, social marketing, brand activism and free speech elucidating the impact of consumer response to social justice branding. The findings and model add a lens to further explore race in the marketplace.

AB  - Objective: To describe and compare how three dental schools from different countries (Australia, Brazil, and the USA) have managed experiences in dental education during the COVID-19 crisis. Material and Methods: It is a descriptive study reporting the experience that three distinct dental schools faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. They represent countries that adopted different measures to tackle the pandemic and were undergoing different stages of the disease. Results: After the WHO declared the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal University of Paraiba suspended all on-site teaching, research, and service activities. For the return to teaching activities, the use of information and communications technology resources for distance learning was recommended. At the School of Dental Medicine (University of Pittsburgh), all research activities were suspended or, otherwise, could not be interrupted because of the employment of unique materials or supplies. When the pandemic started, Australia was one of the first countries to introduce strong regulations related to social distancing, travel restrictions, testing and tracking of infected patients. As such, the universities started to be closed from mid-March, cancelling all clinical and preclinical activities, maintaining online theoretical activities, such as seminars, lectures, and journal clubs. Conclusion: Numerous and critical difficulties have arisen as a result of the pandemic for individuals, communities and institutions that will have long-lasting effects. Our students face disruption to their education and career; our professional colleagues will be challenged rebuilding their practices, while staff at all Dental Schools are experiencing various hardships.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly growing outbreak, the future course of which is strongly determined by people's adherence to social distancing measures.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the knowledge level, attitudes, and practices of the Iranian population in the context of COVID-19.
   Methods: A nationwide study was conducted from March 24 to April 3, 2020, whereby data were collected via an online self-administered questionnaire.
   Results: Responses from 12,332 participants were analyzed. Participants' mean knowledge score was 23.2 (SD 4.3) out of 30. Most participants recognized the cause of COVID-19, its routes of transmission, its symptoms and signs, predisposing factors, and prevention measures. Social media was the leading source of information. Participants recognized the dangers of the situation and felt responsible for following social distancing protocols, as well as isolating themselves upon symptom presentation. Participants' mean practice score was 20.7 (SD 2.2) out of 24. Nearly none of the respondents went on a trip, and 92% (n=11,342) washed their hands before touching their faces.
   Conclusions: Knowledge of COVID-19 among people in Iran was nearly sufficient, their attitudes were mainly positive, and their practices were satisfactory. There is still room for improvement in correcting misinformation and protecting people from deception. Iranians appear to support government actions like social distancing and care for their and others' safety.

AB  - Background: Ukraine is experiencing one of the most volatile HIV epidemics globally, fueled primarily by people who inject drugs (PWIDs), and a parallel incarceration epidemic. Opioid substitution therapy (OST) is internationally recognized as one of the most effective forms of treatment for opioid dependence and is among the most effective HIV prevention strategies available, yet efforts to adopt it in Ukraine's Criminal Justice System (CJS) have been thwarted.
   Methods: To understand the reluctance of the Ukrainian CJS to adopt OST despite the overwhelming evidence pointing to its health benefits and improved criminal justice outcomes, we conducted the first survey of Ukrainian prison administrative, medical and custodial staff (N=243) attitudes towards addiction in general, OST, and people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in representative regions of Ukraine.
   Results: Results revealed that Ukrainian CJS workers' attitudes toward OST, PLWHA, and drug addiction were universally negative, but differed substantially along geographic and occupational lines. Whereas geographic and cultural proximity to the European Union drove positive attitudes in the west, in the southern region we observed an identifiability effect, as workers who worked directly with prisoners held the most positive attitudes. We also found that knowledge mediated the effect of drug intolerance on OST attitudes.
   Conclusion: In Ukraine, adoption of OST is more influenced by myths, biases and ideological prejudices than by existing scientific evidence. By elucidating existing attitudes among CJS personnel, this study will help to direct subsequent interventions to address the barriers to implementing evidence-based HIV prevention treatments.

AB  - Purpose The shift to remote work brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically limited spontaneous workplace interpersonal interactions. For one interpersonal relationship in particular, the work spouse, the sudden physical distance may impact the energy work spouses draw from one another. Drawing on interactional ritual theory, this study aims to investigate the relationship between interaction frequency and organizational outcomes mediated by relational energy amid the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach During the COVID-19 pandemic, working adults who indicated they had a work spouse were recruited via Qualtrics to participate in a two-part online study. Findings Complete data from 120 participants across both time periods revealed that more frequent interaction between work spouses is associated with increased job satisfaction and affective commitment mediated by relational energy. Originality/value This study represents the first empirical examination of individual and organizational outcomes of a unique interpersonal workplace relationship. Additionally, this study enhances our understanding of the impact of relational energy in socially distanced situations between employees in a close, intimate (non-sexual) pair bond.

AB  - Like the Tigris-Euphrates rivers in the Middle East, Yellow-Yangtze rivers in China, and Mississippi-Colorado rivers in the United States, our brain has two neural pathways (or rivers) where we perceive two distinct values in marketing exchange processes. We identify two neural pathways of reward and information value (RIV) perceptions in the consumer brain leading to engagement, recommendation, and sharing (ERS) behavior in social media marketing. Using fMRI, we show that the first river in the brain (i.e., reward value area of the nucleus accumbens) is activated when consumers are shown visually aesthetic and appealing (versus unappealing) ob-jects in social media advertisements. The second river in the brain (i.e., information value area of the prefrontal cortex) is activated when consumers are shown new (versus outdated) products in social media advertisements. This paper is the first attempt in marketing to provide an integrative brain map for customer value perception in SNS marketing. The conceptual model presented in this paper can be traced back to the traditional consumer attitude change theory as dual processing models of persuasion, yet it can explain the underlying mechanisms of consumer value in the social media context. Using this two rivers brain map, marketers can better identify how their offerings can satisfy the diverse and unique needs of consumers based on RIV.

AB  - Sharks are among the oldest residents of the planet, they possess a unique value as top predators and constitute irreplaceable elements of marine ecosystems. Unfortunately, contemporary narratives widely presented in popular mainstream media have attached an utterly negative connotation to sharks, propagating an unsubstantiated and fabricated image of them as implacable and voracious predators. Recently a lot of attention is devoted to understanding the public perception towards sharks in order to promote their conservation given that a quarter of all shark species are facing extinction. This work assessed the current attitude of the public towards sharks on a global scale, utilizing modern technology through a single protocol that explored the importance of factors like culture, history, or educational level in shaping attitudes. We collected 13,800 questionnaires from 137 countries, with 25 countries presenting more than 100 answers each, representing in total 92% of the filled questionnaires. A generally positive attitude towards sharks emerged from our study, influenced significantly by several factors including knowledge and participation in marine conservation projects. Interestingly, shark

AB  - Background/Aim. Over the recent years customer satisfaction program as a tool for patient satisfaction has been recognized as an important issue in healthcare services. The aim of this preliminary study was to explore an influence of healthcare institution managers' approach and attitudes to marketing and public relations activities (communication activities), in the context of implementation of customer satisfaction programs, on patient satisfaction. Methods. The study was conducted among managers from different state-owned healthcare institutions (healthcare centres, clinics, hospitals) in Serbia. The structured questionnaire form, comprising both open and closed questions, was used as a main research tool. The total number of sent questionnaires was 120; 56 questionnaires were sent back, while 49 of them were valid. Results. It was shown that 42.9% of healthcare institutions apply proactive media approach, and that 35.7% of the organizations have a person who, besides his/her basic engagements, performs activities connected with marketing and public relations. Using Chi-square likelihood ratio test it is confirmed that these activities have a significant role in supporting customer satisfaction program implementation (p < 0.05). The results showed that in 69.4% cases, positive attitude of healthcare institutions managers toward marketing and public relations activities had positive influence on patient satisfaction (p < 0.05). Conclusion. Managers in healthcare sector in Serbia who used proactive approach toward media and who had already institutionalized communication activities with external stakeholders have a positive attitude to implementation of customer satisfaction program. Furthermore, managers' attitude toward communication activities has influence on patient satisfaction.

AB  - This research aimed to examine (1) the effect of domain overlap between CSR activity and Corporate Social Irresponsibility (CSI) (i.e., CSR strongly or weakly associated with CSI) on attitude toward the sponsor via CSR perception of sponsor and (2) the moderating effects of perceived firm-serving motive for CSR activity. The authors conducted two experiment studies: Study 1 tested the mediation model; Study 2 assessed the moderated mediation model. Participants reported a less positive attitude toward the sponsor when CSR was strongly associated with CSI (i.e., in the high CSR-CSI domain overlap) than when CSR was weakly associated with CSI (i.e., in the low CSR-CSI domain overlap). CSR perception of sponsor mediated the relationship between the CSR-CSI domain overlap and attitude toward the sponsor. The positive effect of the low CSR-CSI domain overlap was weakened when participants attributed firm-serving motives to the sponsor. The findings provided scientific contributions to sponsors with CSI.

AB  - Purpose - This paper investigates if the existing degree of students' acceptance and use of mobile or m-learning may face the online shift determined by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), a new comprehensive model, SD-UTAUT (social distancing-UTAUT), is developed to better understand relationships between the original constructs, plus personal innovativeness (PI) and information quality (IQ). It identifies the key factors affecting behavioral intention (BI) and use by examining the influence of revaluated hedonic motivation (HM) and learning value (LV) importance as mediators.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory study involving 311 learners, using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM).
   Findings - SD-UTAUT can be a new m-learning model in higher education. It has high predictive power and confirmed 15 out of 16 hypotheses. The most powerful relationship is between performance expectancy (PE) and HM. IQ affected LV the most, since HM the behavioral use (BU). HM impacts the use behavior (UB) more than LV, but habit (HT) affects it the most.
   Research limitations/implications - Because of the pandemic context, output may lack generalizability and reproducibility.
   Practical implications - To improve usage, staff must provide better support, course creators emphasize the objectives and competencies and developers integrate innovation. The joy and pleasure of m-learning use may stimulate the LV through interesting and interactive content, like incorporating gamification.
   Originality/value - The model set-up and circumstances are previously unseen. SD-UTAUT confirms ten new hypotheses and introduces the student's grade point average (GPA) as a moderator.

AB  - A web-based experiment (n = 960) examined how debunking of publicly shared news on social media affects viewers' attitudes toward the source who shared the fake news, their agreement with the news position, and perceived credibility of social media as a news platform. Exposure to debunking information did not lower participants' agreement with the news position, but led them to derogate (1) the source who shared the misinformation and (2) social media as a news platform. However, participants who initially favored the source were less likely to attribute the sharing of fake news to the source's dispositions, rather than situational factors, thereby maintaining their positive attitudes toward the source.

AB  - The goal of this investigation was to determine whether various cultural stressors (bicultural stress, perceived discrimination, and perceived negative context of reception [PNCR]) predict positive and negative substance use attitudes, directly and indirectly through personal identity, in a sample of immigrant Hispanic adolescents. Data on cultural stressors, substance use attitudes, and covariates were collected from 302 Hispanic immigrant adolescents (152 from Miami [61% Cuban] and 150 from Los Angeles [70% Mexican]) at 3 time points. PNCR was associated with identity confusion (=.175, p=.033). Identity confusion significantly predicted higher positive attitudes toward alcohol and other drug (AOD; =.216, p<.001) and cigarette use (=.191, p=.015) and mediated the relationship between PNCR with unfavorable AOD attitudes (=-.019, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.052,-0.001]) and favorable AOD attitudes (=0.038, 95% CI [0.003, 0.086]). Perceptions of a negative context of reception may hinder successful personal identity formation and impact health outcomes for immigrant youth.

AB  - Gain-framed messages are more effective at promoting physical activity than loss-framed messages. However, the mechanism through which this effect occurs is unclear. The current experiment examined the effects of message framing on variables described in the communication behavior change model (McGuire, 1989), as well as the mediating effects of these variables on the message-frame behavior relationship. Sixty low-to-moderately active women viewed 20 gain- or loss-framed ads and five control ads while their eye movements were recorded via eye tracking. The gain-framed ads attracted greater attention, ps < .05; produced more positive attitudes, p = .06; were better recalled, p < .001; influenced decisions to be active, p = .07; and had an immediate and delayed impact on behavior, ps < .05, compared with the loss-framed messages. Mediation analyses failed to reveal any significant effects. This study demonstrates the effects of framed messages on several outcomes; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear.

AB  - Background: In China, people living with HIV (PLWH) are aging. The study compared prevalence of probable depression between older PLWH and their HIV-negative counterparts, and tested the hypothesis that the between-group difference in depressive symptoms would be mediated by attitudes toward aging.
   Methods: With informed consent, a cross-sectional survey was conducted via anonymous face-to-face interviews to 337 and 363 HIV-positive and HIV-negative people aged >= 50, respectively, in Yongzhou City, Hunan, China from December 2017 to August 2018. Depression was measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale. Attitudes toward aging were measured by the Attitudes to Aging Questionnaire (subdomains: psychosocial loss, physical change, psychological growth). Bootstrapping analyses were performed to test the mediation hypothesis.
   Results: The prevalence of probable depression (CES-D >= 16) was significantly higher in the HIV-positive group than the HIV-negative group (44.8% versus 20.4%). The HIV-positive participants presented more negative attitudes toward aging (in psychosocial loss and physical change) than their HIV-negative counterparts. Negative attitudes toward aging were associated with more depressive symptoms. Overall attitudes toward aging (effect size=41.3%) and the subdomains of psychosocial loss (effect size=38.5%) and physical change (effect size=16.3%) partially mediated the association between HIV status and depressive symptoms, respectively.
   Limitations: The cross-sectional design limited the ability of causal inference. Selection bias, information bias, and confounding bias might exist.
   Conclusions: Older PLWH might be more depressed than their HIV-negative counterparts in mainland China, partially because they possessed more negative attitudes toward aging. Interventions for depression may include components of improving attitudes toward aging.

AB  - The present study investigated the effects of framing the European Union (EU) as a common project vs. a common heritage on participants' attitude towards EU integration (Experiment 1) and EU enlargement (Experiment 2). An additional aim was exploring whether the different frames affected the strength of identification with the EU, and if the framing effect on attitudes was mediated by participants' identification with the EU and/or by their message evaluation (Experiment 3). Results showed that a common project-based frame was more effective than a common heritage-based frame in promoting positive attitude toward EU integration and enlargement, as well as participants' identification with the EU, which mediated the framing effect on both attitudes; the mediation of participants' message evaluation was not significant. The procedure of the last experiment was replicated on a British sample (Experiment 4), showing a similar pattern of results.

TI  - CoMix: comparing mixing patterns in the Belgian population during and after lockdown
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how a newly emergent communicable disease can lay considerable burden on public health. To avoid system collapse, governments have resorted to several social distancing measures. In Belgium, this included a lockdown and a following period of phased re-opening. A representative sample of Belgian adults was asked about their contact behaviour from mid-April to the beginning of August, during different stages of the intervention measures in Belgium. Use of personal protection equipment (face masks) and compliance to hygienic measures was also reported. We estimated the expected reproduction number computing the ratio of R0 with respect to pre-pandemic data. During the first two waves (the first month) of the survey, the reduction in the average number of contacts was around 80% and was quite consistent across all age-classes. The average number of contacts increased over time, particularly for the younger age classes, still remaining significantly lower than pre-pandemic values. From the end of May to the end of July , the estimated reproduction number has a median value larger than one, although with a wide dispersion. Estimated R0 fell below one again at the beginning of August. We have shown how a rapidly deployed survey can measure compliance to social distancing and assess its impact on COVID-19 spread. Monitoring the effectiveness of social distancing recommendations is of paramount importance to avoid further waves of COVID-19.

AB  - Objective: Breast cancer (BC) is an important disease for women. BC influences both patient's and relatives lives. Especially, husb:uals/boyfriends/lovers are the ones that are affected mostly. In this study, it was aimed to introduce knowledge and attitudes of men toward BC and their sources of information about BC.
   Materials and Methods: This descriptive study was conducted with men applied to a University Hospital in Istanbul (Turkey-2018). The ethics per- mission was obtained form The Clinical Research Ethics Committee. Data regarding socio-demographic characteristics with the knowledge and attitudes towards BC were collected with a questionnaire specific to the research. Statistical significance level was accepted as p<0.05.
   Results: In the study, 240 men (mean age: 36.2 +/- 10.6 years,min: 18.0, max: 63.0) were interviewed. Fifty four percent of men declared that they would nor marry someone with BC and/or someone who had mastectomy. Thirty four percent of participants thought that a woman with BC should conceal the disease. The mean BC knowledge score was 234.1 +/- 128.0 (median: 227.5, min: 0, max: 571.0) among the cocal which was 600.
   Conclusion: A significant proportion of men did not haw sufficient and accurate knowledge about BC. If the BC knowledge scores increase, there was an association with more positive attitudes. Negative attitudes of men related with BC of a woman may be an indicator of stigmatization. If it is aimed to increase support of men for women dealing with BC, it is recommended that BC awareness activities should be prepared to include men in order to increase their knowledge and to change their attitudes into a more positive way.

AB  - This study explores the bleed-over effect of tourism advertising by measuring a sample of international respondents' attitudes toward Bangladesh, its people, and its government before and after watching a television commercial. The commercial, "School of Life," is part of the Bangladesh Tourism Board's "Beautiful Bangladesh" campaign to promote the country as an international destination. Results indicate that this commercial did "bleed over" to create a more positive attitude among respondents in all three areas measured. It shows that a developing country like Bangladesh can successfully implement tourism advertising and destination branding as public diplomacy tools to better brand and promote itself among a variety of international stakeholders. These results support similar research that applied the bleed-over effect of tourism advertising among more developed and well-known countries.

AB  - Background/Objective: To review published pediatric trauma research from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries so as to identify research fields that need to be enhanced.
   Methods: A MEDLINE search for articles on pediatric trauma from GCC countries during the period 1960 to 2010 was performed. The content of articles was analyzed, classified and summarized.
   Results: Fifty-three articles were found and retrieved of which 18 (34%) were published in the last 5 years, 42 (79.2%) were original articles. The first author was affiliated to a university in 29 reports (54.7%), to a community hospital in 13 (24.5%) and to a military hospital in 10 (18.9%). All articles were observational studies that included 18 (34%) case-control studies, 18 (34%) case reports/case series studies, 8 (15.1%) prospective studies, and 7 (13.2%) cross sectional studies. The median (range) impact factor of the journals was 1.3 (0.5-3.72). No meta-analysis studies were found.
   Conclusion: A strategic plan is required to support pediatric trauma research in GCC countries so as to address unmet needs. Areas of deficiency include pre-hospital care, post-traumatic psychological effects and post-traumatic rehabilitation, interventional studies focused on a safe child environment and attitude changes, and the socioeconomic impact of pediatric trauma.

AB  - Informed by the findings in prior research, the current study experimentally tested the effects of empathy responses to different types of media characters on attitudes and support for people with depression. In a between-subjects experiment, participants (N = 80) were assigned to one of three conditions. Participants in the first condition read an article about a high-similarity character with severe depression, those in the second condition read an article about a low-similarity character with severe depression, and those in the control group did not read an article. Participants in all three conditions were then shown a stimulus website for a faux peer-support organization. The results indicated that the level of empathic responses, positive attitudes, and the likelihood of joining the organization and engaging in supportive behaviors increased for those who read about a socially similar person with depression.

AB  - Prison staff are vital for enforcing order in prisons. However, order is not only maintained by what prison staff do, but also relies on prisoners willingly following the directives of prison staff and complying with prison rules and procedures. This article puts forward the idea that how prison staff treat prisoners can affect the social distancing prisoners put between themselves and prison staff, potentially making defiance and non-compliance more difficult to manage. Social distancing is operationalised in this article as motivational posturing. Using survey responses from 177 Australian prisoners, the article shows a strong association between prisoners' perceptions of procedural justice in prison and their self-reported compliance with prison rules. It also shows for the first time that motivational postures exist in a corrections context, and are associated with both procedural justice perceptions and self-reported compliance behaviour. Postures are also found to mediate the procedural justice/compliance relationship.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate whether and how a picture book preventing child sexual abuse can improve children's self-protection skills. The study was conducted in China with Chinese children. In a 2 x 2 between-subjects design, character in the book (human versus animal) and message framing (gain versus loss) were manipulated. Compared to a baseline group who were not exposed to the prevention book, children in the experimental groups significantly enhanced their ability to recognize a potential abuse situation and refuse an inappropriate touch request. Results suggest that the prevention picture books are more effective when using a human character and a gain-framed message. The explanation for this was that human characters simulated children's perceived norm and gain-framed messages increased children's message recall, perceived self-efficacy and positive attitude toward the message, all of which in turn positively affected children's self-protection skills.

AB  - This study investigated how persuasive messages integrated in an online game affects children's cognitive, affective, and conative responses to the brand, as well as their attitude toward the game itself. An experiment conducted among 2453 girls between the ages of 11 and 17 demonstrated that confrontation with interactive brand placement in the game resulted in more positive attitudes toward the game, higher top of mind awareness of the brand, more positive brand images, and more favorable behavioral intentions. In addition, consistent with persuasion literature and theories on child development, this study showed that there was a three-way interaction effect between exposure to the brand placement, age, and prior brand use for behavioral intentions. The youngest girls who had no prior experience with the brand were more strongly influenced by the brand placement than the oldest girls who had no prior brand experience. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Social distancing measures adopted in various countries to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic can lead to unwanted effects on their populations' health and behaviors. This study aimed to investigate smoking behavior in the Brazilian adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyze factors associated with the increase in cigarette consumption. An online survey was performed, and the final sample included 45,160 individuals. The study used post-stratification weights and calculated crude prevalence ratios (PR) and adjusted by sex, age, and schooling, and respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Poisson regression models with robust variance were applied to analyze associations between increased cigarette consumption and sociodemographic variables and adherence to social distancing, quality of sleep, state of mind, and changes in work and earnings. Prevalence of smokers was 12% (95%CI: 11.1-12.9), 34% of whom reported an increase in cigarette consumption. The increase was greater among women (PR = 1.27; 95%CI: 1.01-1.59) and individuals with incomplete secondary schooling (PR = 1.35; 95%CI: 1.02-1.79). The increase in cigarette consumption was associated with worse quality of sleep, feeling isolated from family members or sad, depressed, or anxious, loss of earnings, and worse self-rated health. Health promotion strategies, smoking prevention, and encouragement for smoking cessation, as well as mental health interventions, should be continued and reinforced in the context of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The subject of homosexuality remains taboo in contemporary China, given that the public maintains a considerably negative attitude toward the subject. Recent Pew Research indicates that, on average, 21% of Chinese respondents believe that homosexuality should be accepted. However, parallel surveys of Internet users paint a different picture, as online surveys found a more liberal atmosphere toward homosexuality and same-sex marriage. The online and offline discrepancy in attitudes toward homosexuality begs the question of whether the Internet carries a stigma-reducing function in terms of views on sexual minority groups. Guided by the contact hypothesis and parasocial contact theory, the current study investigates the de-stigmatizing effect of the social media on homosexuality in China. A web-based survey with 980 social media users with a heterosexual orientation confirmed the positive role of interpersonal-mediated contact with lesbian and gay celebrities via social media venues in stigma reduction; but findings did not lend support to the parasocial-mediated contact hypothesis.

AB  - COVID-19 is a global health emergency that has fundamentally altered human life. Public perception about COVID-19 greatly informs public policymaking and charts the course of present and future mitigation strategies. Existing approaches to gain insights into the evolving nature of public opinion has led to the application of natural language processing on public interaction data acquired from online surveys and social media. In this work, we apply supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches on global Twitter data to learn the opinions about adoption of mitigation strategies such as social distancing, masks, and vaccination, as well as the effect of socioeconomic, demographic, political, and epidemiological features on perceptions. Our study reveals the uniform polarity in public sentiment on the basis of spatial proximity or COVID-19 infection rates. We show the reservation about the adoption of social distancing and vaccination across the world and also quantify the influence of airport traffic, homelessness, followed by old age and race on sentiment of netizens within the US.

However, social and economic development in recent decades has induced the rise of Chinese consumerism and changes in public attitudes towards overspending. Focusing on overspending stigmasGouwukuang(GWK) andDuoshoudang(DSD) and stigma-relevant attitudes, the present study investigates the effect of perceived stigma on consumers' attitude towards overspending through the mediating effect of anticipated consumer guilt. The moderating role of message framing in this relationship is also examined. Results of two analyses indicate that (a) between the two stigmas, DSD is less stigmatising and preferred in comparison to GWK in social interaction and self-identification; (b) participants' perception of the stigma associated with overspending predicts their anticipation of guilt associated with this behaviour, which in turn predicts negative attitude towards overspending; (c) message framing moderates the relationship between perceived stigma and anticipated guilt, and hence facilitates destigmatisation of the traditionally stigmatised behaviour of overspending. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Entertainment consumption is often shared with others, whether friends or strangers. Whereas most co-viewing scholarship has examined parent-child viewing, few have examined viewing among in-group and out-group members. The present study explores in-group and out-group responses to racial comedy featuring disparaging information about the in-group. Findings suggest that Blacks report a more positive attitude, greater perceived similarity, and identification when viewing racially charged comedy with Black in-group members than when viewing with White out-group members. White viewers display no differences in their responses to television comedy based on whether they were viewing with in-group members or out-group members. Implications are discussed.

AB  - Taiwan withdrew from the United Nations in 1971, which led to missed opportunities for participating in global HIV/AIDS programs and made Taiwan more vulnerable to HIV. Employing a questionnaire of 996 college students in Taiwan, the authors assessed and compared female and male HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, attitudes, and sources of HIV/sexually transmitted infections (STI) information. Students reported moderate knowledge and attitudes. Females had more positive attitudes toward people with HIV/AIDS than males. Most participants reported learning about HIV and STIs from traditional media, school teachers, and the Internet. We suggest evidence-based educational interventions for students should include targeted electronic and cultural awareness strategies.

AB  - Purpose:To evaluate the satisfaction of diabetic patients and its determinants of telescreening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) in Saudi Arabia. Methods:This cross-sectional survey was conducted in December 2018 in a diabetes center of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Ten questions were asked by the interviewer. A 5-point Likert scale was used to grade patient responses for each question. Rasch analysis was conducted to evaluate the response of the participants. The main outcome variable was the sum of the Logit values of the responses. The Rasch score was also compared among subgroups. Results:Two hundred (n = 200) diabetic patients were interviewed. The median Rasch score of client-perceived benefit of DR telescreening was +14.6 (25% quartile +3.09, minimum; -23.2, maximum; +35.7). A positive attitude of patients regarding DR telescreening was recorded in 159 (79.5%) participants. The perception of telescreening was better in younger diabetic patients than in older diabetic patients (Friedmanp< 0.001). The perception was similar in both genders (Mann-Whitneyp = 0.3). Diabetic patients from Riyadh and the southern region of Saudi Arabia had significantly more positive perception than those from north and eastern regions (Freedmanp< 0.001). Conclusion:Diabetic patients have positive attitude toward tele-DR screening. Their cooperation is likely to be high if large scale tele-DR screening is implemented in the Kingdom.

AB  - ObjectiveWe investigated family caregivers' awareness of disease status and attitude toward disclosure of disease progression compared with those of cancer patients and explored the potential association between family caregivers' attitudes and patients' quality of life (QOL).
   MethodsWe carried out a survey using self-administered questionnaires answered by pairs of family caregivers and patients diagnosed with advanced cancer (n=136 pairs). To assess patients' QOL, we used the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire.
   ResultsMore than half of family caregivers (54%) did not have full knowledge of patients' advanced stage and goal of therapy. Positive attitudes toward disclosure were less common in family caregivers than in patients (59.4% and 85.4%, respectively; p<0.01). The family caregivers' positive attitudes toward disclosure were inversely associated with patients' low functional scores (emotion [p=0.04] and cognition [p=0.02]) and high symptom scores (nausea and vomiting, pain, and insomnia; p<0.05). However, in most QOL scales, patients' attitudes were not significantly associated with functioning and symptom scores.
   ConclusionsA large portion of family caregivers may not know the patients' exact status. This study also suggests that the family caregivers' attitudes may differ from patients' and may be associated with patients' QOL. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Field experimentation is a promising but seldom used method for studying the effects of media messages on political attitudes and behavior. The practical challenges of conducting media experiments in real-world settings often come down to securing cooperation from research partners, such as political campaigns. To do so, researchers must be prepared to adapt their experimental designs to satisfy the constraints imposed by research partners and the media environment in which they operate. This article provides an overview of some alternative field experimental designs that allow researchers to maintain the advantages of random assignment while addressing practical considerations. Examples are drawn from the growing field experimental literature examining the effects of television, radio, and online communication.

AB  - One's generosity to others declines as a function of social distance, which is known as social discounting. We examined cultural similarities and differences in social discounting and the mediating roles of the two aspects of interdependence (self-expression and distinctiveness of the self) as well as the two aspects of independence (harmony-seeking and rejection avoidance). Using the same procedure that previous researchers used to test North Americans, Study 1 showed that compared to North Americans, Japanese discount more steeply a partner's outcomes compared to their own future outcomes, whereas the decrease in the subjective value of the partner's outcomes accelerates less as a function of social distance. To examine the cultural similarities and differences in social discounting in more detail, Study 2 tested Japanese and Germans and found that the hyperbolic with exponent model fitted the participants' discounting behaviors better than the other models, except for the loss condition in Germans where the utility of the q-exponential model was indicated. Moreover, although the social discounting rate was higher in Japanese than in Germans, the cultural difference was limited to the gain frame. However, the decline in a person's generosity accelerated less as a function of social distance in Japanese than in Germans. Furthermore, the cultural difference in the social discounting in gains was mediated by the level of harmony-seeking, which was higher in Germans than in Japanese. Implications for individuals' generosity against the backdrop of cultural characteristics are discussed.

AB  - Aims This study aimed to determine the prevalence of, factors associated with, and to build a theoretical framework for understanding Internalsed HIV-related Stigma Mastery (IHSM). Methods A cross-sectional study nested within a 2014 Stigma Reduction Cohort in Uganda was used. The PLHIV Stigma Index version 2008, was used to collect data from a random sample of 666 people living with HIV (PLHIV) stratified by gender and age. SPSS24 with Amos27 softwares were used to build a sequential-mediation model. Results The majority of participants were women (65%), aged >= 40 years (57%). Overall, IHSM was 45.5% among PLHIV, that increased with age. Specifically, higher IHSM correlated with men and older women "masculine identities" self-disclosure of HIV-diagnosis to family, sharing experiences with peers. However, lower IHSM correlated with feminine gender, the experience of social exclusion stress, fear of future rejection, and fear of social intimacy. Thus, IHSM social exclusion with its negative effects and age-related cognition are integrated into a multidimensional IHSM theoretical framework with a good model-to-data fit. Conclusion Internalised HIV-related Stigma Mastery is common among men and older women. Specificially, "masculine identities" self-disclose their own HIV-positive diagnosis to their family, share experiences with peers to create good relationships for actualising or empowerment in stigma mastery. However, social exclusion exacerbates series of negative effects that finally undermine stigma mastery by young feminine identities. Thus, stigma mastery is best explained by an integrated empowerment framework, that has implications for future practice, policy, and stigma-related research that we discuss.

AB  - Background: In August 2007, the President's Cancer Panel urged the leadership of the nation to "summon the political will to address the public health crisis caused by tobacco use" (President's Cancer Panel, N, 2007, Promoting healthy lifestyles: Policy, program, and personal recommendations for reducing cancer risk. http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/advisory/pcp/pcp07rpt/pcp07rpt.pdf). While some research has examined predictors of public support for tobacco control measures, little research has examined modifiable factors that may influence public attitudes toward tobacco control.
   Methods: We used the American Legacy Foundation's 2003 American Smoking and Health Survey 2 to examine the contribution of smoking status, knowledge of the negative effects of tobacco, and tobacco-specific media exposure (antitobacco messages, news coverage of tobacco issues, and protobacco advertising) on U. S. adults' attitudes toward tobacco control. In addition, we assessed whether smoking status moderates the relationship between tobacco-specific media exposure and policy attitudes. Weighted multivariable logistic regression models were employed.
   Results: Results suggest that knowledge of the negative effects of tobacco and smoking status are associated with attitudes toward tobacco control and that exposure to tobacco-specific information in the media plays a role only in some instances. We found no evidence of effect modification by smoking status on the impact of exposure to tobacco-specific media on attitudes toward tobacco control.
   Discussion: Understanding the impact of readily modifiable factors that shape policy attitudes is essential if we are to target outreach and education in a way that is likely to sway public support for tobacco control.

AB  - Although research has shown that different types of prejudice are highly correlated, the existence of prejudice hierarchies indicates that individuals differentiate between target groups. Here we examine the relationship between television news coverage and differences in attitudes toward minority groups. We rely on intergroup threat theory, tone, and framing theories to formulate our hypotheses and conduct a multimethod study: All prime-time television news items in Flanders (N=1,487) reporting on five minority groups (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender; Jews; Eastern Europeans; North Africans; Roma) were coded in terms of tone and framing and subsequently combined with individual-level survey data. Patterns in news coverage reflect differences in prejudice: Groups that are most negatively/positively evaluated by the public receive the most negative/positive coverage. Prejudice is especially high for minority groups associated with problems and criminal threat frames in the news. We conclude that news content is an important characteristic of the intergroup context reflecting differences in minority group appraisals in society.

AB  - Background: Media coverage of the Germanwings plane crash intensely focused on the co-pilot's mental illness and was criticized for potentially increasing depression stigma. We explored whether stigma beliek towards persons with depression changed in April 2015 (about one month after the crash) compared to 2014.
   Method: Telephone surveys among the adult population were conducted in Munich, Germany (N=650 in 2014 and N=601 in 2015). In both surveys, four components of stigma were assessed: (1) characteristics ascribed to persons with a depression, (2) belief in a continuum of symptoms from mental health to mental illness, (3) emotional reactions to people afflicted by depression (fear, anger, and pro social reactions), and (4) desire for social distance.
   Results: Some stigmatizing attitudes have increased after the crash. More specifically, we found more pronounced changes in the attributes ascribed (stereotypes) and in the perceived separation from persons afflicted (continuum beliefs) than in the emotional reactions and the desire for social distance. However, overall increase in depression stigma was smaller than expected as changes were not statistically significant in the majority of the analyzed items.
   Limitations: Due to the study design no causal interpretation of results is possible. Moreover, evidence presented is confined to a regional German sample.
   Conclusions: A single devastating event and related media coverage seem to have a limited impact On public stigmatizing attitudes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All tights reserved.

AB  - The paper describes the experience of flipped classroom application in teaching ESP. The study was held at the National Aviation University and involved 46 undergraduate students majoring in "Automation and Computer-Integrated Technologies". In-class learning was organized according to the university schedule and out-of-class activities were conducted by using Google Classroom and a set of digital learning tools. Our observations during teaching with their further analysis and a designed questionnaire were used to reveal the benefits and drawbacks of the flipped classroom. The analysis of the students' responses has shown that it allows students to study at their own pace, meet their needs, develop their organizational, communication and time management skills and increase their independence and creativity. The paper specifies three main phases of the flipped classroom and determines what skills are developed at each of them. Remembering and understanding are developed at the first phase and the freed classroom time is devoted to developing the skills of applying and analyzing. The higher-order thinking skills of evaluating and creating can be formed both in the classroom and during the post-class phase. The authors have selected digital learning tools which can be recommended for learning ESP in order to facilitate students' out-of-class activities. Their use can help to shift the emphasis from the teacher to the student, increase students' engagement in learning and make the course versatile and appropriate to students' needs. A student survey was conducted at the end of the academic year, and the analysis of students' responses revealed that they had a positive attitude to implementing the flipped classroom in teaching ESP. As shown by the results of the study, the use of the flipped classroom for teaching ESP is effective as it saves much in-class time for communicative tasks enhancing the development of higher-order thinking skills, unites in-class and out-of-class learning, controls students' achievement not only in the classroom but outside it and makes the learning process more engaging.

AB  - Objective: To assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices of Imams (Islamic clerics) concerning fluoride toothpaste and fluoridated water to improve oral health in Kelantan. Basic research design: Cross sectional study of Imams in 65 registered mosques in Pasir Puteh district, Kelantan. Method and participants: Face-to-face interview, using structured questionnaire and some open ended questions. Results: Most of the 83 interviewees (82% participation rate) were unsure whether their toothpaste contained fluoride (64%), only 25% were sure. More than one-third (37%) were using fluoridated piped water. Most (87%) had little knowledge of fluorides and more than two-thirds (69%) had lacked positive attitudes towards its use. Television (54%) was the most common source of information about fluorides, followed by newspapers (9%). The main reasons given among the few who opposed fluoride use were i) fear of dangerous side effects (4%) and ii) uncertainty about the halal status of fluoride (2%), Attitudes were not associated with the use of fluoridated water supply (p=0.999), age (p=0.103), income (p=0.540) and location (p=0.999). Conclusion: Over two-thirds of Imams had little knowledge of and lacked positive attitudes towards fluoride use in toothpaste and piped water supplies.

AB  - Strategic perspectives on moral and political attitudes suggest that people often tailor such attitudes to serve the current or future needs of themselves and their families. Given the critical importance of parenting in human life, we were interested in whether parenthood was associated with individual differences in political and moral attitudes, and whether parenthood and parenting motivation might partly explain age differences in these attitudes. Given that a key element of social conservatism is vigilance towards uncertainty and threat and, given that parenting is often associated with risk aversion, we predicted that parents (and those high in parenting motivation) would be more morally vigilant and more socially conservative. Across four studies including over 1500 participants, both objective parenthood and subjective parenting motivation independently predicted both outcomes. Further analyses revealed that both parenthood and parenting motivation mediated the relationships between age and both social conservatism and moral vigilance.

AB  - Aims of the study: The purpose of this study was to assess pharmacists' knowledge and attitude towards early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) in Jordan and to explore potential predictor variables of such knowledge and attitude.
   Methods used to conduct the study: An electronic, self-reported questionnaire was used to collect data about demographics, knowledge and attitude regarding early detection of CRC. Both content and face validity were tested in a panel of experts. The participants' responses were analysed using descriptive statistics and multiple linear regressions.
   Results of the study: The 352 pharmacists (78% females, 94% Jordanian) had a median age of 28 years and graduated mostly (83%) from public universities. Surprisingly, 90% were not able to identify carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a non-accurate diagnostic method and almost one-third did not identify the correct screening tests. On a scale of 5, the majority of participants (59%) had moderate knowledge scores (3 or 4) in case scenarios. The median knowledge Percent of Maximum Possible (POMP) score was 67% and higher scores were associated with more years since graduation, pharmacists with MSc degree and higher, working in urban areas, studying oncology course and received oncology training (P < .05). Most participants showed a positive attitude towards early detection of CRC (median attitude POMP score was 78%). However, none of the analysed variables predicted their level of attitude.
   Conclusions drawn from the study and clinical implications: Although the majority of pharmacists demonstrated a positive attitude towards early detection of CRC, their knowledge was inadequate. The study highlighted the importance of optimising the education programmes to improve the pharmacists' knowledge about CRC early detection and preparing the pharmacists for participating in future national screening initiatives.

AB  - Contact with the dominant group can increase opposition, among the disadvantaged, to social policies that would benefit their group. This effect can be explained in terms of contact promoting support for an ideology of meritocracy, which privileges the distribution of societal resources based on individual merit, rather than group-level disadvantage. We tested this ideological mechanism in a large, nationally representative sample of Maori (a disadvantaged group in New Zealand; N = 1,008). Positive intergroup contact with the dominant group (New Zealand Europeans) predicted increased opposition to a topical reparative policy (Maori ownership of the foreshore), and this was fully mediated by increased support for the ideology of meritocracy. Intergroup contact may enable the ideological legitimation of inequality among members of disadvantaged groups, engendering political attitudes that are detrimental to their group's interests. Contact with ingroup members had the opposite effect, increasing support for reparative policy by reducing subscription to meritocratic ideology.

Drawing attention to literatures within carceral geography and cybergeography, and presenting an empirical case study of the simulation computer game Prison Architect, it suggests that rather than being necessarily ephemeral, fleeting and transient, digital cultural production can also be carefully created, curated and manipulated in ways which involve both deep reflection on, and profound shaping of, political attitudes.

AB  - Social exclusion, especially when prolonged over time--has a strong impact on the individuals' health and wellbeing. According to the Temporal Need-Threat Model (Williams, 2009), the experience of chronic social exclusion inescapably leads to a condition ofresignation, characterized by feelings of alienation, depression, helplessness, and unworthiness. However, few empirical studies have tested this prediction and its potential moderating factors. In this research, we identified the prison as a prototypical condition of chronic social exclusion, and aimed at (a) empirically testing the link between chronic exclusion and the resignation stage, (b) investigating whether situational factors-such as attending a support group in prison-can reduce the adverse outcomes of the resignation, and (c) exploring the role of individual differences (e.g., psychological flexibility) in mediating the effect of the support group on the resignation. The study involved 136 participants-68 detainees (31 of them participated in a support group) and 68 free citizens. Results showed that prisoners without the support group showed the highest levels of feelings of resignation. By contrast, prisoners in the support group were no different from nonprisoners in terms of resignation stage outcomes, and this beneficial effect of the support group was mediated by higher levels of perceived social support and psychological flexibility. Overall, this study suggests that the link between chronic exclusion and the resignation stage could be moderated by intervening social factors, highlighting the potential benefits of group-based interventions to tackle the negative consequences of chronic exclusion in chronically excluded populations.

AB  - The current work validated the decomposed theory of planned behaviour (DTPB) with working adults to assess its ability to predict intentions to participate in microlearning and also identify the significant factors that drive microlearning usage decisions. We found that positive attitudes towards microlearning (Attitude), stronger beliefs in others' opinions regarding microlearning use (SN), and stronger perceptions about one's capability to engage in microlearning (PBC), are associated with stronger intentions to participate in microlearning. All decomposed constructs were found to be significant predictors of the respective factors, except superior influence (SI) and resource facilitating conditions. We discuss potential targeted interventions focused on what works best to encourage microlearning adoption. For instance, while reporting superiors have no significant influence over one's microlearning use decisions, the opinions of peers and colleagues positively influence microlearning use. Hence, focusing on embedding community--related aspects into a microlearning design may effectively encourage the use of microlearning.

AB  - Pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors show substantial individual differences, and exploring their predictors can help reveal the origins of pro-environmental behavior. Basic personality traits may provide a partial explanation, but it is unclear which personality traits are reliably associated with pro-environmental behaviors. This article uses a specific type of environmental behavior, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, to clarify which personality correlates are most robustly associated with behavior, and to test mediation of those effects through attitudes. A large (N = 345) sample of United States adults representative in age, gender, and ethnicity completed the 100-item HEXACO personality inventory, a novel self-report measure of behaviors that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and scales of environmental and political attitudes. Accounting for demographics, emissions-reducing behaviors were most strongly predicted by Openness, Conscientiousness, and Extraversion, and these effects of personality were mediated by attitudes toward the natural environment. These observations broaden the understanding of the etiology of environmental attitudes and behavior.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Racial discrimination has a clear impact on health-related outcomes, but little is known about how discriminatory experiences are associated with neural response patterns to emotionally salient cues, which likely mediates these outcomes.
   OBJECTIVE To examine associations of discriminatory experiences with brainwide response to threat-relevant cues in trauma-exposed US Black women as they engage in an attentionally demanding task.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 1, 2014, to July 1, 2019, among 55 trauma-exposed US Black women to examine associations of racial discrimination experiences with patterns of neural response and behavior to trauma-relevant images in an affective attentional control task. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and trauma exposure were entered as covariates to isolate variance associated with experiences of racial discrimination.
   EXPOSURES Varying levels of trauma, PTSD symptoms, and experiences of racial discrimination.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Experiences of Discrimination Questionnaire (EOD) (range, 0-9) for count of the number of situations for which each participant reported having unfair treatment for a racial reason. Experiences of trauma and PTSD symptoms were assessed with the Traumatic Events Inventory (TEI) (number of times the person was exposed to trauma; score range, 0-112) and PTSD Symptom Scale (PSS) (score range, 0-51). Response to trauma-relevant vs neutral distractor cues were assessed via functional magnetic resonance imaging during performance of an affective Stroop (attentional control) task. Statistical analyses were conducted at a whole-brain, voxelwise level with familywise error correction. RESULTS In this study of 55 Black women in the US (mean [SD] age, 37.7 [10.7] years; range, 21-61 years), participants reported a mean (SD) TEI frequency of 33.0 (18.8) and showed moderate levels of current PTSD symptoms (mean [SD] PSS score, 15.4 [12.9]). Mean (SD) EOD scores were 2.35 (2.44) and were moderately correlated with current PTSD symptoms (PSS total: r = 0.36; P=.009) but not with age (r = 0.20; P =.15) or TEI frequency (r = -0.02; P =.89). During attention to trauma-relevant vs neutral images, more experiences of racial discrimination were associated with significantly greater response in nodes of emotion regulation and fear inhibition (ventromedial prefrontal cortex) and visual attention (middle occipital cortex) networks, even after accounting for trauma and severity of PTSD symptoms (brainwide familywise error corrected; r = 0.33 for ventromedial prefrontal cortex; P =.02). Racial discrimination was also associated with affective Stroop task performance; errors on trials with threat-relevant stimuli were negatively correlated with experiences of racial discrimination (r = -0.41; P =.003).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that experiences of racial discrimination associate with disproportionately greater response in brain regions associated with emotion regulation and fear inhibition and visual attention. Frequent racism experienced by Black individuals may potentiate attentional and regulatory responses to trauma-relevant stressors and lead to heightened modulation of regulatory resources. This may represent an important neurobiological pathway for race-related health disparities.

AB  - It is commonly said that the lockdowns and social distancing necessary to control coronavirus pandemics will only work if the general population trusts its government, believes the information it provides, and has confidence in its policies. This article traces the British government's record in providing information about its policies and performance, and compares this with the public's use of the mainstream news media. It then considers how these two sources of information affected trust in government and public compliance with social distancing and lockdown rules. Lastly, it compares Covid-19 with Brexit and draws conclusions about how beliefs and behaviour are formed when individuals are personally faced with a serious threat.

AB  - Purpose. Screening rates for colorectal cancer (CRC) lag for low-income, minority populations, contributing to poorer survival rates. A model of storytelling as culture-centric health promotion was tested for promoting CRC screening.
   Design. A two-group parallel randomized controlled trial.
   Setting. Primary care, safety-net clinics.
   Subjects. Low-income patients due for CRC screening, ages 50 to 75 years, speaking English or Spanish.
   Intervention. Patients were exposed to either a video created from personal stories composited into a drama about "Papa'' receiving CRC screening, or an instrument estimating level of personal cancer risk. Patients received a health care provider referral for CRC screening and were followed up for 3 months to document adherence.
   Measures. Behavioral factors related to the narrative model (identification and engagement) and theory of planned behavior.
   Analysis. Main effects of the interventions on screening were tested, controlling for attrition factors, and demographic factor associations were assessed. Path analysis with model variables was used to test the direct effects and multiple mediator models.
   Results. Main effects on CRC screening (roughly half stool-based tests, half colonoscopy) did not indicate significant differences (37% and 42% screened for storytelling and risk-based messages, respectively; n = 539; 33.6% male; 62% Hispanic). Factors positively associated with CRC screening included being female, Hispanic, married or living with a partner, speaking Spanish, having a primary care provider, lower income, and no health insurance. Engagement, working through positive attitudes toward the behavior, predicted CRC screening.
   Conclusion. A storytelling and a personalized risk-tool intervention achieved similar levels of screening among unscreened/underscreened, low-income patients. Factors usually associated with lower rates of screening (e.g., no insurance, being Hispanic) were related to more adherence. Both interventions' engagement factor facilitated positive attitudes about CRC screening associated with behavior change.

AB  - Drawing from the stereotype content model, we examine how people respond to likeminded and counter-attitudinal political comments appearing after a news article. We experimentally test how citizens behave when they are able to click on one of three different buttons posted next to others' commentsLike, Recommend, or Respect. In the experiment, political attitudes predicted button clicking, but the button label affected the strength of the relationship. In some instances, people clicked on fewer buttons associated with likeminded comments and more buttons associated with counter-attitudinal comments when the button was labeled with Respect as opposed to Like or Recommend. The pattern of results for the Recommend button differed across two issues. The results suggest that political comments can trigger stereotypical reactions. Although the Like button is well known, news organizations interested in promoting less partisan behaviors should consider using a Respect button rather than the Like or Recommend button in comment sections.

AB  - Introduction: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global health problem with high morbidity and mortality in patients who are mostly still economically active. The growing incidence and health implications for those affected make T2DM a major public health issue. Objectives: To compile a demographic, anthropometric and knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) profile of adult patients with T2DM in the public health sector of the Free State province, South Africa. Design: A descriptive observational study was conducted. Setting: A total of 255 participants attending public health facilities in the Free State were interviewed. Outcome Measures: Questionnaires were completed in an interview to determine demographics and KAP. Anthropometric measurements were obtained by standard techniques. Results: The majority of the participants (n = 222; 87.1%) were black women from urban areas, who were overweight and obese. The median age at diagnosis was 48 years (range 15?80 years), and 25 participants (9.8%) lacked formal schooling. In 212 participants (83.1%), a waist circumference above cut-off points was observed. Only half of the participants knew the normal range for blood glucose. Approximately 80% felt that they would be a different person if they did not have diabetes. Although 96.1% of participants were knowledgeable about the benefits of physical exercise, only 31.0% reported exercising on a daily basis. A statistically significant association was found between knowledge and attitudes, indicating that better knowledge about diabetes could be associated with a more positive attitude towards diabetes. Conclusion: Poor knowledge, a negative attitude and poor practices related to diabetes were observed in a very high percentage of participants, which may contribute to morbidity and mortality. The fact that knowledge was associated with attitude indicates that interventions aimed at improving knowledge could benefit patients in more than one way. Interventions to equip patients to successfully manage their condition are urgently required.

AB  - Much political communication research examines the effects of media on political attitudes and behavior. But what of the contributions of political behavior toward selective exposure? This study draws on literature from selective exposure and political socialization to explore whether one's likelihood of engaging in selective exposure may originate in part during the "crystallization period" of young adulthood. After controlling for demographic and political variables in adolescence and midadulthood, an analysis of data from a four-wave longitudinal panel of "baby boomers" from 1965 to 1997 indicates that selective exposure can be traced to political protest activity during this time and, very marginally, in subsequent years. The implications for the future of selective exposure among emerging generations are discussed.

AB  - This study focuses on social media use of citizens from two groups that are often associated with the rise of social media: populist and postmaterialist citizens. Considering their ideological underpinnings, we theorize that they will make more political use of social media and that this further reifies their political attitudes into voting for populist and postmaterialist parties, respectively. Using unique survey data including the relatively new populist attitudes and political use of social media, we test this theory on the Dutch case. We find that both groups do not read political news or connect to politicians more, but both are more likely to react to political content. Moreover, social media use does not seem to lead to a retention in one's own ideological funnel signified by populist or postmaterialist voting. Among more postmaterialist citizens, passive social media use even makes it more likely to vote for other parties.

AB  - Research on political psychology has benefitted from using individual-difference measures to predict political attitudes and behavior. And, previous research has further identified a number of specific variables that enhance the predictive utility of individual-difference scales. However, a potentially important factor that has been overlooked is the certainty with which people make their responses. The present research establishes that the certainty with which people respond to scales is associated with stability of the scale responses over time and correspondence between the scale and related outcomes. In addition, the effects of certainty in political ideological identification in predicting politically relevant outcomes hold when controlling for a number of previously established moderators. This research suggests that measuring certainty in answers to individual-difference scales can be a useful and efficient way to increase the predictive utility of those scales within the political domain and beyond. This benefit is demonstrated with need for cognition (Study 1), need to evaluate (Study 2), and ideological identification (Studies 2 and 3).

AB  - Background: In developed countries, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver condition. The disease raises the risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality, as well as associated comorbidities. The general public's knowledge and attitude are critical in developing countermeasures to prevent the spread of the disease. Purpose: This study was done to determine the knowledge and attitude of the general public of Taif city, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: A validated self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data for the study, which covered knowledge (04 items) and attitude (04 items) (7 items). In addition, demographic questions were included to see how they influenced knowledge and attitude. The data was examined using descriptive statistics in SPSS-IBM 25. Results: Out of 454 participants, more than 72% were female and 55% were in an age group of 18-30 years and only 11% had known NAFLD cases in their family. The number of participants who had family members with NAFLD had a significantly higher level of knowledge (P=0.012). The vast majority of those polled in this study had a favorable or satisfactory attitude toward NAFLD. The age group of 31-40 years showed a significantly (P=0.048) higher proportion of participants with a positive attitude when compared to other age groups. It is also important to note that females with a good knowledge and positive attitude toward NAFLD outnumber male participants. Conclusion: Generally, Taif residents have less knowledge of NAFLD, but their attitude is encouraging. The link between chronic illnesses and NAFLD remains poorly understood. It is critical to find mechanisms and ways to halt the disease's rapid progression in the community.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic generated a number of changes in the functioning of urban areas all over the world and had a visible impact on the use of green infrastructure, including city parks. The study discusses and compares operation and use of two such parks located in Wellington, New Zealand and Warsaw, Poland by adopting "pandemic urban ethnography", an approach that includes autoethnography, interviews with users, non-participant observation, and analysis of social media content. As indicated by the findings of the study, the importance of less rigidly designed, multifunctional spaces that give their users freedom of "tactical" adjustments, significantly grows during times of lockdown and "social distancing". During such a crisis, the management and everyday use of urban parks are highly related to urban policies. The article provides insight into how those policies impact the functional values of green infrastructure confronting it with user-generated adaptations and the landscape design itself. The global health emergency showed how access to green areas becomes a crucial determinant on environmental justice while proving the significance of "tactical pandemic urbanism" as both a design and management method.

AB  - In the last decades, theoretical and empirical work has been devoted to implicit attitudes toward a large range of food items. Despite the increasing development of green labels in the food market, to our knowledge no study has investigated implicit attitudes toward organic food nor has tried to change them. Capitalizing on the important role of the self in consumer or pro-environmental behavior, we aim to change or form implicit and explicit attitudes toward organic food brands using the self. Moreover, we investigate the possibility of changing hypothetical shopping behavior, brand identification, and attitude change persistence. Targeting two fictitious brands of organic food in two studies, we use the Self-Referencing (SR) task, an evaluative learning paradigm that relies on both the use of the self as a positive source of evaluation and the common action to classify the self and a target. We assess its effects on implicit attitudes, using one of the most common indirect measure (Implicit Association Test), as well as on explicit attitudes. We show that the SR manipulation results in more positive implicit attitudes, explicit attitudes, and to more frequent hypothetical choice of products for the eco-brand paired with the self compared to the other eco-brand. SR manipulation also results in higher level of brand identification. Moreover, changes in implicit attitude mediate changes in explicit attitude, identification, and hypothetical choice. Finally, we provide evidence for the persistence of the effect: Participants liked and identified more with the brand originally paired with the self even after removing the pairing with the self. The discussion is organized around the importance of taking into account implicit attitudes toward organic food brands and the usefulness of the self in changing or forming these attitudes.

AB  - Social distancing is a central (un)word of the pandemic year 2020. Now, music culture thrives on performative 'liveness'-even in classical music, where live experience has become the core of the musical artwork in the age of its mechanical reproduction. At the same time, the history of music can be read as a history of the dissolution of boundaries: from the body (voice), to mechanical instruments, to electronic extensions. Accelerated by regulations in response to the COVID-19 crisis, music culture passes another media transformation, entering new virtual stages. In fact, crisis always implies changes and chances too: economists call it 'creative destruction', artists call it innovation. And indeed, 'social distancing' in interaction with accelerated digitalisation also holds media-aesthetic potential. With the support of new media, and this is the hypothesis of this essay, the contemporary music scene in particular can form new dramatic forms that go far beyond the classical one-way stream: by enabling virtual participation instead of physical co-presence.

AB  - Society increasingly demands ethical motives from investors. Like other judgments, however, the moral evaluation of investments can be influenced by stereotypes. We investigate whether subjects' evaluation of investments as immoral violates the commonly accepted principle of moral impartiality- the view that moral evaluations of actions must not depend on the actor's arbitrary personal characteristics. Recently, the media discussed such a violation when criticizing an internal remark of a German financial regulator (BaFin), which stated that most short sellers of Wirecard stocks came from Israel was "striking". Through a between-subjects experiment, we find that young German MTurkers with generally centrist political attitudes display behavior consistent with an anti-Semitic stereotype: They are much more likely to evaluate the very same investment as immoral if it is made by an investor with a name perceived as Jewish. The triggering of this stereotype should prompt us to consider the moral evaluation of investors with caution. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We propose a difference-in-differences approach for disentangling a total treatment effect within specific subpopulations into a direct effect and an indirect effect operating through a binary mediating variable. Random treatment assignment along with specific common trend and effect homogeneity assumptions identify the direct effects on the always and never takers, whose mediator is not affected by the treatment, as well as the direct and indirect effects on the compliers, whose mediator reacts to the treatment. In our empirical application, we analyze the impact of the Vietnam draft lottery on political preferences. The results suggest that a high draft risk due to the draft lottery outcome leads to an increase in mild preferences for the Republican Party, but has no effect on strong preferences for either party or on specific political attitudes. The increase in Republican support is mostly driven by the direct effect not operating through the mediator that is military service.

The study revealed the following results: At the planning stage, the involvement of senior executives determined the positive attitude toward change. At the getting started stage, employees' clear recognition of change objectives determined the change effectiveness. At the letting go stage, department heads got involved, understood, and provided both support and mediating activities to achieve the actual benefits. At the completion stage, performance was used as a measurement tool to help internalize the change into new capabilities.

AB  - Background: Nowadays, mobile technologies are part of everyday life, but the lack of instruments to assess their acceptability for the management of chronic diseases makes their actual adoption for this purpose slow. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a survey instrument for assessing patients' attitude toward and intention to use mobile technology for diabetes mellitus (DM) self-management, as well as to identify sociodemographic characteristics and quality of life factors that affect them.
   Methods: We first conducted the documentation and instrument design phases, which were subsequently followed by the pilot study and instrument validation. Afterward, the instrument was administered 103 patients (median age: 37 years; range: 18-65 years) diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 DM, who accepted to participate in the study. The reliability and construct validity were assessed by computing Cronbach's alpha and using factor analysis, respectively.
   Results: The instrument included statements about the actual use of electronic devices for DM management, interaction between patient and physician, attitude toward using mobile technology, and quality of life evaluation. Cronbach's alpha was 0.9 for attitude toward using mobile technology and 0.97 for attitude toward using mobile device applications for DM self-management. Younger patients (Spearman's rho=-0.429; P<0.001) with better glycemic control (Spearman's rho=-0.322; P< 0.001) and higher education level (Kendall's tau=0.51; P<0.001) had significantly more favorable attitude toward using mobile assistive applications for DM control. Moreover, patients with a higher quality of life presented a significantly more positive attitude toward using modern technology (Spearman's rho= 0.466; P<0.001).
   Conclusion: The instrument showed good reliability and internal consistency, making it suitable for measuring the acceptability of mobile technology for DM self-management. Additionally, we found that even if most of the patients showed positive attitude toward mobile applications, only a moderate level of intention to indeed use them was observed. Moreover, the study indicated that barriers were truthfulness and easiness to use.

KW  - RECALL FREQUENCY
KW  - INDUCTION
AB  - In recent years, the interest in lucid dreaming (dreaming with the conscious knowledge that one is dreaming) was stimulated by blockbuster films like "Inception" and the media interest in studies indicating that lucid dreaming can be beneficial. However, systematic studies regarding the attitude toward lucid dreams are lacking. An online survey was completed by 1,380 persons (777 women and 603 men), whose mean age was 51.63 +/- 14.13 years. The six-item scale measuring attitude toward lucid dreams showed high internal consistency. The attitude toward lucid dreams was highly correlated with the general attitude toward lucid dreams and decreased with age; women reported a more positive attitude. However, the attitude toward lucid dreams was markedly lower than the attitude toward dreams in general. It would be interesting to study what the bases of the attitude toward lucid dreams are, for example, information in the media, personal experience, and reports of friends.

AB  - Female gender has been consistently associated with positive psychological help-seeking attitudes and behaviors; however, surprisingly few empirical studies have examined how femininity-related variables impact women's help-seeking decision making. Informed by the theory of reasoned action (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980), the purpose of this study was (a) to investigate the associations between two femininity constructssubjective femininity stress and gender solidarityand psychological help-seeking intention, and (b) to explore the mediating roles of help-seeking attitudes and social stigma using structural equation modeling. Participants were 451 college-enrolled women in Southern California. Results revealed that all the mediation relationships involving help-seeking attitudes and stigma were significant. Subjective femininity stress was positively related to help-seeking intention via help-seeking attitudes, but was negatively related to intention via social stigma. Gender solidarity was positively related to help-seeking intention via positive attitudes and reduced social stigma. Implications for future research, prevention programs, and practice are discussed.

AB  - Background: Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (such as wearing masks and social distancing) have been implemented by governments around the world to slow the spread of COVID-19. To promote public adherence to these regimes, governments need to understand the public perceptions and attitudes toward NPI regimes and the factors that influence them. Twitter data offer a means to capture these insights.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to identify tweets about COVID-19 NPIs in six countries and compare the trends in public perceptions and attitudes toward NPIs across these countries. The aim is to identify factors that influenced public perceptions and attitudes about NPI regimes during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: We analyzed 777,869 English language tweets about COVID-19 NPIs in six countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States). The relationship between tweet frequencies and case numbers was assessed using a Pearson correlation analysis. Topic modeling was used to isolate tweets about NPIs. A comparative analysis of NPIs between countries was conducted.
   Results: The proportion of NPI-related topics, relative to all topics, varied between countries. The New Zealand data set displayed the greatest attention to NPIs, and the US data set showed the lowest. The relationship between tweet frequencies and case numbers was statistically significant only for Australia (r=0.837, P<.001) and New Zealand (r=0.747, P<.001). Topic modeling produced 131 topics related to one of 22 NPIs, grouped into seven NPI categories: Personal Protection (n=15), Social Distancing (n=9), Testing and Tracing (n=10), Gathering Restrictions (n=18), Lockdown (n=42), Travel Restrictions (n=14), and Workplace Closures (n=23). While less restrictive NPIs gained widespread support, more restrictive NPIs were perceived differently across countries. Four characteristics of these regimes were seen to influence public adherence to NPIs: timeliness of implementation, NPI campaign strategies, inconsistent information, and enforcement strategies.
   Conclusions: Twitter offers a means to obtain timely feedback about the public response to COVID-19 NPI regimes. Insights gained from this analysis can support government decision making, implementation, and communication strategies about NPI regimes, as well as encourage further discussion about the management of NPI programs for global health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Purpose Indonesia has the largest Muslim population in the world and represents a significant global-market opportunity for halal food producers. Surprisingly, halal-food consumption in Indonesia remains under-researched. Thus, this study aims to investigate the factors influencing consumers' halal-food consumption, using an extended theory of planned behaviour (TPB) model.
   Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire distributed among 418 consumers in Surabaya, Indonesia. Multiple regression analysis was used to describe the TPB relationship and halal-food consumption.
   Findings This study successfully extended the TPB to include additional predictors: perceived awareness, habit, religious self-identity (RSI), moral obligations and trust to determine consumers' intention in halal-food consumption. Attitudes, RSI and moral obligations were significant predictors of intention to consume halal food.
   Practical implications The findings can be used by the government and food producers to target specific factors, especially positive attitudes, RSI and moral obligations. Indonesia Ulama Council (Majelis Ulama Indonesia), the food industry and the media play a critical role in sustaining consumers' positive attitude towards halal-food consumption. It is critical for food manufacturers to tailor their marketing strategies and consider promoting Islamic dietary rules when promoting their food products.
   Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is one of the first attempts to investigate the determinants of halal-food consumption, using an extended TPB in Indonesia.

AB  - This study explores the perplexing role of the Internet in authoritarian settings. We disentangle the political impact of the Internet along two distinct dimensions, indirect effects and direct effects. While the direct effects of the exposure to the Internet shape political attitudes in a manifest and immediate way, the indirect effects shape various political outcomes via instilling fundamental democratic orientations among citizens. In authoritarian societies such as China, we argue the indirect effects of the Internet as a value changer tend to be potent, transformative, and persistent. But the direct effects of the Internet as a mere alternative messenger are likely to be markedly contingent. Relying on the newly developed method of causal mediation analysis and applying the method to data from a recent survey conducted in Beijing, we find strong empirical evidence to support our argument about the two-dimensional impacts of the Internet in authoritarian countries.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 vaccine is considered to be the most promising approach to alleviate the pandemic. However, in recent surveys, acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine has been low. To design more effective outreach interventions, there is an urgent need to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines.
   Objective: Our objective was to analyze the potential of leveraging transfer learning to detect tweets containing opinions, attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward COVID-19 vaccines, and to explore temporal trends as well as automatically extract topics across a large number of tweets.
   Methods: We developed machine learning and transfer learning models to classify tweets, followed by temporal analysis and topic modeling on a dataset of COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets posted from November 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. We used the F1 values as the primary outcome to compare the performance of machine learning and transfer learning models. The statistical values and P values from the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test were used to assess whether users' perceptions changed over time. The main topics in tweets were extracted by latent Dirichlet allocation analysis.
   Results: We collected 2,678,372 tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines from 841,978 unique users and annotated 5000 tweets. The F1 values of transfer learning models were 0.792 (95% CI 0.789-0.795), 0.578 (95% CI 0.572-0.584), and 0.614 (95% CI 0.606-0.622) for these three tasks, which significantly outperformed the machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine). The prevalence of tweets containing attitudes and behavioral intentions varied significantly over time. Specifically, tweets containing positive behavioral intentions increased significantly in December 2020. In addition, we selected tweets in the following categories: positive attitudes, negative attitudes, positive behavioral intentions, and negative behavioral intentions. We then identified 10 main topics and relevant terms for each category.
   Conclusions: Overall, we provided a method to automatically analyze the public understanding of COVID-19 vaccines from real-time data in social media, which can be used to tailor educational programs and other interventions to effectively promote the public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.

AB  - Uptake of prenatal genetic testing (PGT) is low among those with sickle cell disease (SCD). This study evaluated the association of knowledge and attitudes towards prenatal genetic counseling (PGC), awareness of posttesting intervention options and omission bias with attitudes towards PGT. In addition, we explored changes among knowledge, attitudes, and awareness of options following exposure to an educational, clinical vignette among parents of children with SCD. Parents (n=44) completed a questionnaire and an educational, clinical vignette presenting a detailed account of a pregnant woman with sickle cell trait seeking PGT and PGC was read to each participant. t Tests, Spearman correlations, multivariable regressions, and moderation/mediation analyses were used. More positive attitudes towards PGC (P=0.01), lesser tendency of omission bias (P<0.01) and private insurance (P=0.04) were significant correlates of more positive attitudes towards PGT. Omission bias mediated the relationship of attitudes towards PGC and attitudes towards PGT (95% confidence interval: 0.13, 3.03). Awareness of options (P=0.02), knowledge of PGC (P=0.01) and knowledge of PGT (P=0.01) significantly improved after exposure to the clinical vignette. Patients and families with SCD can benefit from education about the importance of prenatal diagnosis to improve attitudes, address omission bias and promote more informed decisions of PGT.

AB  - Background: Positive attitudes for end-of-life (EOL) care along with adequate education are key factors for the provision of quality EOL care. This national study was conducted to identify the factors that influence attitudes toward EOL care on medical students. Method: An anonymous survey was designed and administered to fourth-year medical students at all 41 medical schools in Korea. Topics related to EOL care were assessed in classroom teaching, bedside teaching, and feedback experiences during clinical clerkships. Seven questions for self-rated attitudes and affecting factors were analyzed toward EOL care. Results: With a response rate of 49.2%, the median number of topics recognized by the students as having been delivered was 5 of 11 topics in classroom lectures and 1 of 8 topics in clinical experience. Although few (21.2%) participants indicated that they felt ready for EOL care practice, nevertheless, most felt that they should have adequate knowledge of and preparation for clinical competency in EOL care. Several parameters including respondent's demographics and exposure to EOL care topics in classroom and in bedside teaching influenced the responses to all 7 attitude questions. However, having more than 1 bedside experience was the only factor positively affecting all attitudinal measures. Conclusions: Clinical experience related to EOL care seems to be the utmost priory in fostering positive attitudes and competency among medical students.

AB  - Despite the increasing popularity and advantage of native advertising on social media, advertisers are concerned about the possibility of native ads misleading consumers, resulting in boomerang effects. This study attempts to address this concern by comparing the predictive role of native ad nonintrusiveness with that of native ad manipulativeness in consumers' attitude toward and sharing intention of native advertising. Findings from an online survey of 550 U.S. adult consumers showed that native ad nonintrusiveness was positively related to attitude toward and sharing intention of native advertising, whereas native ad manipulativeness was not. Consumers' ad skepticism and persuasion knowledge were negatively related to attitude toward and sharing intention of native advertising; but persuasion knowledge became nonsignificant when native ad nonintrusiveness and manipulativeness were included in regression models. Additionally, those with stronger information-seeking motivation showed more positive attitudinal and behavioral responses. This study advances the knowledge of native advertising by examining the possibility of its being a double-edged sword. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - This paper explores the causal influence of media content on voting behavior. We exploit a natural experiment involving access to West German TV within the German Democratic Republic. Focusing on federal and state election outcomes in the post-reunification decade (i.e., a time at which TV content was harmonized), we find that municipalities that had access to Western TV broadcasts before reunification have lower vote shares for left-wing and right-wing extremist parties. With regard to potential channels, we provide evidence based on survey data that GDR citizens with access to West German TV were less loyal to the socialist regime, less hostile toward foreigners, and exhibited higher levels of social capital. Our findings thus support the notion that access to free media influences political attitudes and facilitates the consolidation of democracy.

AB  - In spring 2020, COVID-19 and the ensuing social distancing and stay-at-home orders instigated abrupt changes to employment and educational infrastructure, leading to uncertainty, concern, and stress among United States college students. The media consumption patterns of this and other social groups across the globe were affected, with early evidence suggesting viewers were seeking both pandemic-themed media and reassuring, familiar content. A general increase in media consumption, and increased consumption of specific types of content, may have been due to media use for coping strategies. This paper examines the relationship between the stress and anxiety of university students and their strategic use of media for coping during initial social distancing periods in March-April 2020 using data from a cross-sectional survey. We examine links between specific types of media use with psychological well-being concepts, and examine the moderating roles of traits (hope, optimism, and resilience) as buffers against negative relationships between stress and anxiety and psychological well-being. Our findings indicate that stress was linked to more hedonic and less eudaimonic media use, as well as more avoidant and escapist media-based coping. Anxiety, on the other hand, was linked to more media use in general, specifically more eudaimonic media use and a full range of media-based coping strategies. In turn, escapist media was linked to negative affect, while reframing media and eudaimonic media were linked to positive affect. Avoidant coping was tied to poorer mental health, and humor coping was tied to better mental health. Hedonic and need-satisfying media use were linked to more flourishing. Hope, optimism, and resilience were all predictive of media use, with the latter two traits moderating responses to stress and anxiety. The findings give a nuanced portrait of college students' media use during a pandemic-induced shutdown, showing that media use is closely intertwined with well-being in both adaptive and maladaptive patterns.

AB  - Viewing images of terrorism can have a powerful impact on individuals' emotional and political responses, yet little is known about the psychological processes underlying these effects. We hypothesized that the content of terrorism images will shape viewers' appraisals of the event, which will elicit specific emotions and political attitudes. British citizens viewed photographs of the 2005 London bombings, either focusing on victims or terrorists. Exposure to images of victims increased appraisals of victim suffering, which predicted feelings of sympathy. Exposure to images of terrorists increased appraisals of terrorists as dangerous, which predicted fear; and of the attack as unjust, which predicted anger. Each emotion predicted support for a distinct counterterrorism policy. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Mobile internet (M-internet) has developed rapidly in recent years. Under this environment, the spillover effect of corporate negative publicity may have a further impact on brand extension evaluation. This study examined the effects of two types of corporate negative publicities on brand extension evaluation. Further, the possible moderation effects on the above relationship in the M-internet environment were also studied. Compared to ethics negative publicity, the results show that product-harm negative publicity leads to a lower brand extension evaluation. Furthermore, both spatial distance and social distance produce a significant moderation effect on the relationship between corporate negative publicity and brand extension evaluation. In the case of near spatial distance and social distance of familiarity type, a lower brand extension evaluation is shown by product-harm negative publicity. Lastly, negative emotion can significantly mediate the relationship between corporate negative publicity and brand extension evaluation.

AB  - We conducted 3 studies to investigate the effect of money priming on consumers' need for uniqueness. In Study 1, we found that when choosing products, consumers who were primed with money had a stronger need for counterconformity, compared to those who were not. In Study 2, we found that the meaning of money linked to the amount of money moderated the effect of money concept on consumers' choice of innovative products, and that the likelihood that individuals primed with a large amount of money would choose unique products was significantly higher than that of both those primed with a small amount of money and the non-money-primed control group. In Study 3, we found that social distance mediated the influence of money concept on the consumers' need for uniqueness. Overall, the results showed that consumers who are primed with money perceive greater social distance and have a stronger need for uniqueness.

AB  - In this study, the spreading of the pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is formulated mathematically. The objective of this study is to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19. In fact, to stop the spread of COVID-19, the vaccine of the disease is needed. However, in the absence of the vaccine, people must have to obey curfew and social distancing and follow the media alert coverage rule. In order to maintain these alternative factors, we must obey the modeling rule. Therefore, the impact of curfew, media alert coverage, and social distance between the individuals on the outbreak of disease is considered. Five ordinary differential equations of the first-order are used to represent the model. The solution properties of the system are discussed. The equilibria and the basic reproduction number are computed. The local and global stabilities are studied. The occurrence of local bifurcation near the disease-free equilibrium point is investigated. Numerical simulation is carried out in applying the model to the sample of the Iraqi population through solving the model using the Runge-Kutta fourth-order method with the help of Matlab. It is observed that the complete application of the curfew and social distance makes the basic reproduction number less than one and hence prevents the outbreak of disease. However, increasing the media alert coverage does not prevent the outbreak of disease completely, instead of that it reduces the spread, which means the disease is under control, by reducing the basic reproduction number and making it an approachable one.

AB  - Aim/Purpose The current study examines the impact of an intervention program to train teachers to collaborate with their students while creating digital games. Background Teachers seem unable to leverage the potential of ICT to present students with a rich learning environment. ICT integration is usually at a relatively simple and concrete level without changing the traditional teacher-student paradigm.
   Methodology The study is both quantitative and qualitative. Participants were 63 active teachers studying in the M.Ed. program at a teacher education college. The teachers responded to a series of pre- and post-questionnaires and wrote a concluding reflection.
   Contribution Teaching based on creating digital games, combined with teacher-class collaboration, is a viable and real alternative of constructivist teaching, adapted to different learners.
   Findings The SEM path analysis showed that it was only after the intervention that the lower the teachers' resistance to changing teaching patterns, the higher their intrinsic motivation to learn an innovative pedagogical-technological program and likewise the sense of mastery of 21st-century skills, resulting in a positive attitude towards classroom collaboration. The qualitative findings reveal eight categories dealing with two main themes: the first is professional development, including conceptual, behavioral and emotional change, and the second is the teachers' perception of the learners.
   Recommendations for Practitioners Teacher training should be ongoing in order to change teaching-learning processes and promote an active approach based on constructive principles, 21st-century skills and collaboration between teachers and students in a computer environment.
   Recommendation for Researchers Future studies should start by sampling teachers and education professionals who have convenient access to technology in their teaching-learning environment.
   Impact on Society Collaboration between teachers and students in creating learning games in a computer environment and teacher-class collaboration, in general, require very different training than that which exists today. Hence there should be some rethinking of teacher training. The proposed pedagogical model is one such idea in the right direction.
   Future Research A larger study with a greater number of participants, including a control group, should be conducted.

AB  - Few older people benefit from advance care planning (ACP), due to several barriers related to primary care professionals, such as insufficient knowledge, negative beliefs and a lack of time. Information on overcoming these barriers is limited. We assumed primary care professionals experienced in ACP with older patients are likely to have learned how to overcome these barriers.
   To investigate how Dutch primary care professionals experienced in ACP with older patients overcome these barriers.
   A qualitative study, based on semi-structured interviews, among a purposive sample of 14 Dutch primary care professionals experienced in ACP with older people. Transcripts were thematically analysed.
   We interviewed eight general practitioners (GPs), three nurses and three elderly care physicians, experienced in ACP with older people. Respondents overcame their own insufficient knowledge and skills, as well as their negative attitudes and beliefs by gaining experience through practicing ACP in their daily practices, exchanging and reflecting on those experiences with peers, pursuing continuing education, teaching and participating in research. To overcome patients and families lack of initiative and openness to ACP, respondents prepared them for further steps in ACP. To overcome a lack of time, respondents used tools and information communication technology, delegated parts of ACP to other primary care professionals, acquired financing and systematized documentation of ACP.
   Primary care professionals can overcome barriers to ACP with older patients by practicing, reflecting on experiences and pursuing continuing education, by preparing patients and involving family and by investing in support to approach ACP more efficiently.

AB  - People living with HIV (PLWH) may be at higher risk for adverse outcomes indirectly associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). When comparing responses to questionnaires administered when social distancing and quarantine guidelines were first implemented, we found that PLWH were more likely to have restricted access to medical care, increased financial stress, increased symptoms of anxiety and depression, and increased substance use compared to demographically-similar people without HIV.

AB  - BackgroundTo date, little is known about the association between the use of online social network sites and social isolation among individuals in the second half of life. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine this association among older adults.MethodsCross-sectional data was drawn from a nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized individuals aged 40 and above (n=7837) in Germany (German Ageing Survey). Online social network use was assessed using the frequency of social network use (e.g., Facebook) in the preceding 12months (daily; several times a week; once a week; 1-3 times a month; less often; never). Perceived social isolation was measured using an established scale created by Bude and Lantermann.ResultsAdjusting for covariates, linear regressions revealed that daily online social network users reported lower social isolation scores compared with those with less frequent or no social media use.ConclusionsData suggest that daily users of online social networks aged 40 and over tend to feel less socially isolated than less frequent users or non-users. Future research should concentrate on identifying the direction of this association. Moreover, the reasons underlying this finding should be examined.

KW  - Balkan region
KW  - COVID-19 pandemic
AB  - Background: Until recent times, healthcare specialists lagged behind other fields in terms of computer networks and software usage, partly because they were uncomfortable with information and communication technologies. The rapid development of personal wearables, their easier connections with smartphones and other similar devices, and the possibilities of online or cloud storage of personal medical data led to improvements of eHealth services in terms of ease of access and reduced costs of delivery.
   Subjects and methods: The current research aimed to fill a research gap regarding attitudes towards eHealth during the COVID-19 pandemic in three Balkan countries: Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania. A total number of 775 adult participants (healthcare professionals and students in the field) were contacted in the winter of 2020 and asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their eHealth attitudes.
   Results: The Greek participants had the most negative attitudes toward eHealth services. This may be due to forced use of eHealth applications during the pandemic crisis and the need for mastering the necessary technical skills to use them.
   Conclusions: It should be noted that in the scientific literature no research is found on this topic, therefore it is the first study aimed to assessing and comparing attitudes towards eHealth in these countries.

AB  - Within Europe, and, indeed, globally, it would seem that for many people a renewed significance now attaches to their national identities. Although ongoing tendencies of re-nationalization and national protectionism are observable in many countries worldwide, management research and organization studies have largely overlooked this phenomenon until now. While previous research on origin-based exclusion in the workplace has primarily focused on "culture" and "race", this article for the first time, centers on the political concept of "nationality". Broadening the unidimensional understanding of diversity climates, we derive and validate a two-dimensional nationality-based organizational climate inventory (NOCI), consisting of the distinct dimensions "social exclusion" and "job- and career-related exclusion". While "social exclusion" has a direct positive impact on the foreign employees' intention to leave, the positive impact of "job confinement" is mediated by the affected individual's decline in "organizational commitment".

AB  - Intergenerational contact can promote positive attitudes towards elders. However, contact with older adults often fosters multiple stereotypes, which may contribute to ambivalence about aging and poorer health in late life. Online survey data from 457 young adults (M age = 19.4 years; 74% female) were used to explore the relationship between intergenerational contact and ambivalence about self as a future elder. Multiple mediator path analysis was used to test the hypothesis that anxiety, knowledge, and empathy would mediate the impact of intergenerational contact on aging self-ambivalence. Ratings of intergenerational contact predicted ambivalence, but anxiety and empathy mediated the relationship (knowledge did not). Higher ratings of intergenerational contact, lower aging anxiety, and higher empathy predicted lower aging self-ambivalence, which reflected positive expectations for late life in our sample. Intergenerational contact can influence expectations for old age; exchange that fosters empathy and reduces anxiety may encourage individuals to exercise strategies that positively impact health in late life.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this qualitative study was to improve understanding of family caregivers' use of Web-based intervention support by integrating three theoretical models. The study applied the Anderson's model of health service utilization, Venkatesh's theory of technology acceptance, and Chatman's and Wilson's information behavior theories.
   Methods: This qualitative study is part of a larger study. An interpretive grounded theory approach was used to conduct in-depth interviews with Chinese caregivers of family members with dementia. The caregivers received Internet-based information support and personalized e-mail intervention. A purposive sample of fourteen caregivers was selected to participate in the interviews. Constant comparison, analytic memoing, case analysis, and concept mapping were used to conduct theoretical triangulation analysis.
   Results: Three main factors influenced the use of the intervention: (a) caregiver needs, which are influenced by personal capacity, social support available, and caregiving belief; (b) information communication technology (ICT) factors, including accessibility barriers and perceived efforts to use the technology; and (c) style of using the technology, such as preference for using e-mail or the customized Website. The personal capacity of caregivers was influenced by many factors, including computer and language proficiency, health service knowledge, caregiving competence and competing roles and responsibilities. Social support available for caregivers included available computer, language or caregiving support and health service knowledge. Caregiving belief included traditional belief of giving care, and health belief of the illness. New caregivers needed a different kind of support intervention compared with experienced caregivers. Caregivers with different amounts of experience tended to have different learning styles, with new caregivers preferring interactive intervention and more experienced caregivers preferring more reflective learning.
   This study reinforced the findings of the larger quantitative study that it is important to address both care-giving needs and technology factors in Internet-based intervention. The quantitative study found that less competent caregivers with more positive attitudes towards technology tended to use the intervention more frequently. In this qualitative research, the findings revealed that caregiver needs, ICT factors, and style of use explained the pattern of intervention use. This new conceptualization has integrated information acceptance, health service utilization, and information behavior theories. More studies will be needed to confirm if the proposed concept can explain or predict the usage behavior in other Web-based interventions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: In order to support evidence-based policies for reduction of stigma, a better understanding of its components: ignorance (knowledge), prejudice (attitude) and discrimination (behaviour) is necessary. This study explores public perceptions and quantifies stigma for three chronic mental disorders: autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders in France.
   Methods: Survey of 1000 adults selected from an established market research panel. The 21-item questionnaire explored knowledge, attitudes and behaviours toward each disorder.
   Results: Although 95% respondents recognized the names of each disorder fewer than 70% could report specific characteristics and only 33% considered that publically available information was adequate; most respondents identified the media as their main resource. Labeling of conditions in a negative way was frequent (61%) when referring to mental disorders in general, but fell significantly (18%) when linked to an individual with a disorder. Individuals with schizophrenia are assumed to be dangerous; 65% respondents would engage in social distancing from such an individual, versus 29% for bipolar disorders and 7% for autism (p < 0.001). In contrast to other disorders, discrimination against schizophrenia was only partly attenuated in those with familiarity with mental disorders (through personal or family illness).
   Conclusion: This first population-based survey in France shows that attitudes towards bipolar disorders and autism are less prejudicial than towards schizophrenia. However, most public attitudes and behaviours towards different disorders appear to be based on assumptions rather than knowledge or evidence suggesting a generic information or anti-stigma programme is unlikely to be effective.

AB  - Through undertaking a longitudinal study with 474 consumers over a 12-month period and conducting structural equation modelling, this research provides insight on the determinants and outcomes of consumer engagement with a retailer's m-commerce application. Critical outcomes of positive attitudes towards the brand and loyalty towards the brand derive from consumer engagement with a retailer's m-commerce app. Drawing upon the TAM, TIT and SDT, the research established perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, convenience and enjoyment influencing engagement with an m-commerce application, while customisation of the app has an enhancing influence on engagement. The findings assert that utilitarian variables of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and convenience become even more influential on engagement with a retailer's m-commerce application following continued retention, while enjoyment becomes less important. However, the research finds that the location of use has an effect on the variables influencing engagement with an m-commerce application. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Probiotics have numerous health benefits to the digestive system, one of them being clinically able to prevent and treat diarrhea. The growing scientific evidence of probiotic benefits has led to increased production of probiotic products. Health science students, as future healthcare professionals (HCPs), should have more knowledge about probiotics to be able to give the right recommendation to their future patients and the larger community. This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice towards probiotics of health science students in Universitas Padjadjaran, Indonesia.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 87 students from Medical Studies, Midwifery, Pharmacy, and Nursing majors in 2020. Proportional cluster random sampling was used to select the study subjects, and an online survey was used to collect the data. Final data were exported to statistics software for analysis. Scores of each variable were categorized. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze the statistical differences among the four groups. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to analyze the relationship between knowledge, attitude, and practice variables.
   Results: Of all respondents, 80% had adequate knowledge. More than half (52.9%) had a positive attitude, and most (62.1%) had a positive practice. There were significant correlations between knowledge-attitude and attitude-practice variables. Most respondents gained information on probiotics from the Internet (26%) and their lecturer (24%). P-value from Kruskal-Wallis test for knowledge, attitude, and practice are 0.466, 0.801, and 0.324, respectively.
   Conclusion: Most respondents had an adequate level of knowledge, a positive attitude, and a positive practice towards probiotics. Incorporating scientific evidence regarding probiotics from various studies into all health science majors' academic curricula and media may help equip the students with a better understanding of probiotics, therefore improving probiotics usage to prevent and treat digestive system diseases in the future.

KW  - LAW
AB  - This article explores a high-profile review of cases of alleged historical investigatory police bias in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, referred to inThe New York Timesarticle, "When Gangs Killed Men for Sport: Australia Reviews 88 Deaths." The title of the article contains the terms of a well-known feature of moral panic-a discovered crime fact and demand for an enforcement response disproportionate to the fact. Our analysis explores the response to the review of the list of cases,Strike Force Parrabell, as an illustration of runaway constructionism. Demand group-interest in the positive designation of the cases (as bias crime) was a means of acknowledging the prejudicial conduct of police during a time of wider attitudinal change. In spearheading the verification of this list of cases, demand groups and crusaders placed a high semiotic burden beyond its capacity as a comparable objective measure. The fitness of the list of 88 cases as a totem for police and societal wrongdoing requires evidence regarding disproportionality based on valid and reliable measures. Despite worldwide interest in NSW for its comparative high ranking in gay bias homicides, however, such ranking does not exist. Nonetheless, despite the impossibility that it stands in as proof of decades long prejudice, corruption or criminal negligence, the list of cases appears to do so anyway. As such, it is illustrative of the occupation of media frames and formats by weak data or of the runaway character of crime stories in an era of "fake news."

AB  - While effective in reducing infections, social distancing during the COVID-19 outbreak may carry ill effects on the mental health of older adults. The present study explored the efficacy of a short-term digital group intervention aimed at providing seniors with the tools and skills necessary for improving their coping ability during these stressful times. A total of 82 community-dwelling adults aged between 65 aged 90 (Mage = 72 years, SD = 5.63) were randomized to either an intervention group (n = 64) or a wait-list control group (n = 18). The intervention comprised online guided sessions in small groups in which behavioral and cognitive techniques were learned and practiced via the ZOOM videoconferencing platform. Loneliness and depression levels were measured pre- and post-participation. The results demonstrated a significant improvement in the intervention group in terms of both loneliness and depressive symptoms, compared with the control group. Results of mixed effect models indicated a medium ameliorative effect on loneliness (d = 0.58), while that for depressive symptoms was only marginally significant and smaller in size (d = 0.43). Our intervention presents a relatively simple and effective technique that can be efficiently utilized to support older adults both during emergencies such as the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as in more routine times for older adults who live alone or reside in remote areas.

AB  - The landscape of health in South Africa has changed dramatically with the unprecedented rise in the burden of disease. Public health care facilities struggle to provide quality, patient-centered care to patients with complex health needs. Interprofessional teamwork is strongly advocated to improve the quality and patient-centeredness of care. This study explored the barriers and facilitators of interprofessional teamwork amongst health professionals working at a tertiary level public hospital in South Africa. The study employed a qualitative, descriptive, exploratory design. Data were collected during three focus group discussions with 14 purposively selected participants from several health professions. Barriers such as high patient turnover, lack of human resources, time, hierarchy, referral process, lack of knowledge of the roles and scopes of practice, negative attitudes, communication inefficiencies, language barriers, and professional jealousy were found to impede interprofessional teamwork. Facilitators of interprofessional teamwork included increased human resources, communication technology, respect, and relationship building. Although health professionals understand the barriers and facilitators of interprofessional teams in the provision of patient care, this study concludes that interprofessional capacity building is needed for successful interprofessional teamwork at a tertiary level public hospital setting.

KW  - FIT INDEXES
AB  - Background In our proposed model, family members' perceptions of service quality in organisations improve communication about self-determination. In turn, family perceptions of communication openness have a positive relationship with self-determination attitudes of family members. Finally, these attitudes predict self-determination behaviours of individuals with intellectual disability, as reported by family members.
   Method We tested this model with a sample of 625 family members (196 using 'day care services' and 429 using 'occupational services').
   Results Multi-sample structural equation modelling (SEM) supported the model. Communication and attitudes fully mediated the link from service quality to self-determination behaviours.
   Conclusions Improving family members' perceptions of service quality and opening channels of communication between professionals and family members are useful strategies to facilitate parents' positive attitudes and increase the frequency of self-determination behaviours at home.

AB  - The implementation of environmental standards can be facilitated by motivating workers with pro-social preferences. Therefore, we study if employees working for firms achieving registration for environmentalrelated standards are more likely to display positive attitudes towards their job, to be actively involved in their jobs and to donate effort. Using a French matched employer-employee database, we find that these "green employees" report a significantly higher perception of usefulness and equitable recognition at work. Besides, they are more likely to work uncompensated overtime hours. Finally, if the adoption of environmental standards is shown to have no direct influence on job involvement, we expose how it indirectly impacts job involvement through the mediation of employees' reported perception of usefulness and equitable recognition at work.

AB  - Purpose Little is known about how welfare technology (WT) is used in welfare services for people with intellectual disabilities. This study aimed to explore expectations, experiences, and challenges concerning the use of WT for people with intellectual disabilities among bachelor-level intellectual disability nursing students during clinical placement. Materials and methods A written reflection assignment (four open questions about using WT) was collected from 100 intellectual disability nursing students (30 males, 70 females). Four focus group discussions were also performed with 13 intellectual disability nursing students before and after their clinical placements. Results Analysis of the assignments showed that "security and safety" technology was the most frequently used WT category for people with intellectual disabilities in the clinical placement settings in municipal welfare and day services. The students reported "Compensation and wellness" technology as the top category to promote the quality of services for people with intellectual disabilities. However, people with intellectual disabilities mostly used WT for "Social contact". Students were mainly positive towards WT and believed it could improve the service quality and the everyday lives of this group. However, the students requested to learn more about WT and ethical issues regarding WT before clinical placement. Additionally, they experienced a lack of knowledge, focus, and awareness about technology in services for this group. Conclusion The findings suggest that although intellectual disability nursing students have a positive attitude towards using WT for people with intellectual disabilities, they require more skill training and ethical knowledge before entering clinical practice.

AB  - Although the importance of nurses' service behaviors has been increasingly emphasized, few studies accounted for how organizational or individual antecedents affect nurses' psychological processes to implement service behaviors. Additionally, they mainly focused on the one side of role-prescribed service behavior and ignored the effect on extra-role service behavior. This study seeks to explore the relationship between ethical climate and nurses' service behaviors from a comparative view, of the role-prescribed and extra-role service behavior and examine the mediating effect of nurses' professional wellbeing (as characterized by positive attitudes toward work, specifically harmonious work passion and obsessive work passion). Survey data from 378 nurses in China indicate that nurses' harmonious work passion mediated the effects of ethical climate on both their role-prescribed and extra-role service behavior; however, obsessive work passion only mediated the effect of ethical climate on role-prescribed service behavior. Managerial implications and future research directions are discussed in this study.

AB  - Brand websites provide opportunities for levels of interactivity that increase the potential for innovative co creation between consumers and firms. However, little is known about predicting consumer interaction levels on brand websites in markets outside of North American and Europe. Adult consumers in the U.S., China, and South Korea responded to a survey measuring theory-based social and brand-based antecedents of brand website interaction frequency. In all countries, respondents who viewed brands as integral parts of self-concept also interacted more on brand websites. This relationship was mediated by consumers' strength of identification with brand websites as communities. Susceptibility to social normative influence and a positive attitude toward materialism were important predictors of consumer interactions in all countries. Overall, this study found stronger cross-national similarities than differences. Implications emphasize recommendations related to the potential challenge and value of increasing consumer interactions on brand websites in Western and East Asian markets.

AB  - This study explores knowledge about hereditary breast cancer, attitudes about BRCA testing and referral pattern to a family cancer clinic among medical specialists. A total of 92 questionnaires were completed by surgeons (38), medical oncologists (29), radiation oncologists (13) and radiologists (12). The response rate was 51%. A substantial (11-56%) proportion of medical specialists do not refer patients who meet current criteria for BRCA testing. Although questions on inheritance were less well answered, overall knowledge was good. They had a positive attitude, but were concerned about the distress DNA testing might cause to family members. The majority (75%) stated that the best time for referral is after adjuvant therapy or during follow-up, but another important determinant was the patient's wish or need (12%). Further studies are needed to gain insight into the actual referral process, while ongoing training of medical specialists about genetic aspects of breast cancer is also necessary.

AB  - We study the causal effect of school curricula on students' political attitudes, exploiting a major textbook reform in China between 2004 and 2010. The sharp, staggered introduction of the new curriculum across provinces allows us to identify its causal effects. We examine government documents articulating desired consequences of the reform and identify changes in textbooks reflecting these aims. A survey we conducted reveals that the reform was often successful in shaping attitudes, while evidence on behavior is mixed. Studying the new curriculum led to more positive views of China's governance, changed views on democracy, and increased skepticism toward free markets.

KW  - SETTINGS
AB  - Purpose To research whether the ability to earn continuing education (CE) credit for time spent teaching motivates radiologic science professionals to teach students in clinic and to assess whether sonographers, who earn CE credit for time teaching, have more positive attitudes toward teaching than those in modalities who do not earn CE credit for time spent teaching.
   Methods Researchers developed a 2-track digital survey and delivered it electronically and on paper to clinical instructors working at hospitals affiliated with Department of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences programs at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. Responses were collected for 2 weeks and then compared quantitatively using chi-square tests and logistic regression models. Qualitative results were examined for themes, and proportions among themes were reported.
   Results A total of 239 people responded, with 166 responses coming from individuals working in radiography, radiation therapy, nuclear medicine, and medical dosimetry, and 73 responses from sonography. Receiving CE credit did not result in a difference in teaching attitudes (X-2 = 0.0004, DF = 1, P = .985). However, the non-CE credit-earning population showed a 12% increase in positive attitudes if allowed to earn CE credit in the future (95% CI; 0.08, 0.17).
   Discussion Student learning and performance in clinic directly are related to experiencing a positive learning environment. Factors other than CE credit appear to motivate instructors to teach students. Although the results of this study did not support the hypotheses, this study furthers the need to discuss whether offering CE credit for clinic instruction is something the profession should consider.
   Conclusion Clinical instructors who are willing to teach are the most desirable to students. Further evaluation of CE credit as an extrinsic motivating factor for clinical instructorship is important for providing the best positive learning environment for students.

AB  - The research examines politically entertaining media through a mass communication lens, applying the disposition theory of humor toward the study of political parody appreciation and the effects of exposure to varied humor types on political attitudes. The analyses rely on experimental data (N = 269) collected in 2013. The results of the first analysis suggest that the interaction of disposition and exposure to different types of humor significantly influences variation in political parody appreciation. The findings from the second analysis show that negative affect toward the opposing candidate, or the presumed victor of a humorous situation, can dampen attitudes toward the victim given exposure to critical humor. The strategic implications for campaigns looking to engage with humor are discussed.

AB  - Recreational fishing has taken place for centuries and is a globally popular activity, yet a lack of monitoring data means historical trends in recreational fisheries are often little understood compared to their commercial counterparts. We examined archival sources and conducted fisher interviews to examine changes in the Queensland recreational snapper (Chrysophrys auratus) fishery throughout its documented history. We extracted data spanning the past 140 years on technological innovations, catch rate trends, and social and regulatory change. Technological innovations were evident throughout the history of the recreational fishery. During the 1960s, 1990s and 2000s, several periods of rapid technological transition occurred, where a technology was adopted by > 50% of recreational fishers within 10 years of its introduction. Since the 1960s, the timing and rate of adoption of fish-finding technology by recreational fishers has kept pace with the commercial sector. These technological advances have profoundly increased recreational targeting ability, but despite these advances, recalled recreational catch rate trends demonstrated significant declines over the course of the 20th century. While minimum size limits have been imposed on the snapper fishery for over a century, in contrast, the introduction of recreational in-possession limits only commenced in the 1990s. At this time, the beginnings of a societal transition was also observed, where longstanding lake-all' attitudes towards fishing began to be replaced by a more conservation-minded ethic. This shift was driven in part by the changing regulatory landscape, as well as wider attitudinal change influenced by the media and shifting societal norms, although whether this led to a reduction in total recreational catch remains unclear due to a lack of fishery-wide monitoring data and the open access nature of the recreational fishery. This study demonstrates that in the absence of systematic data collection, archival sources and fisher interviews can contribute an interdisciplinary knowledge base for understanding and interpreting historical fishery trends.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze which components of the social learning theory are associated with adolescents' engagement in sexting among a sample of 357 respondents. Additionally, we distinguish between two types of online sexual self,disclosure: sexting within and outside of a romantic relationship. The results indicate that the extent to which adolescents hold positive attitudes towards the behavior and the extent to which they perceive that their peers approve of sexting, are associated with their engagement in sexting both within and outside of a romantic relationship, when controlling for age, gender, school track and internet use. Sexting outside of a romantic relationship was also influenced by the thrill that young people get out of engaging in this behavior. The discussion addresses the implications of these findings for prevention programs, practice and future research, such as the necessity for future studies to ask with whom participants have engaged in sexting.

AB  - Objectives We aimed to assess social patterns of handwashing, social distancing, and working from home at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, and determine what proportions of the overall prevalence and social inequalities in handwashing and social distancing are related to inequalities in the opportunity to work from home, to guide pandemic preparedness and response. Methods Using cross-sectional data from the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series, collected between March 29 and April 3, 2020, among Canadian adults (N=4455), we assessed prevalence of not working from home, social distancing in public, or practicing frequent handwashing, according to age, sex, marital status, immigration, education, chronic disease presence, and source of COVID-19 information. Multivariate regression, population attributable fraction estimation, and generalized product mediation analysis were applied. Results Absence of frequent handwashing and distancing was more common among those working outside than within the home (prevalence differences of 7% (95% CI: 4, 10) and 7% (95% CI: 3, 10), respectively). Inequalities in handwashing and distancing were observed across education and immigration status. Over 40% of the prevalence of non-uptake of handwashing and distancing was attributable to populations not being able to work from home. If all worked from home, over 40% (95% CI: 8, 70) of education-based inequalities in handwashing and distancing could be eliminated, but differences by immigration status would likely remain. Conclusion For pandemic response, both workplace safety initiatives and mechanisms to address the inequitable distribution of health risks across socio-economic groups are needed to reduce broader inequalities in transmission risk.

AB  - Background: To build complex digital skills and capability required by digitally-driven work environments, we must first understand nursing students' baseline digital literacy if educators are to develop a fit for purpose curriculum underpinned by digital health technologies.
   Objective: To determine first-year pre-registration nursing students' perceived baseline digital literacy before their first clinical placement.
   Design: Prospective cohort study.
   Settings: Two universities in Australia in 2020.
   Participants: Students enrolled in pre-registration nursing programs at Bachelor's and Master's level.
   Methods: Participants (N = 205) completed an online 27-item survey composed of a Likert-type scale, forcedchoice items, and open-ended questions. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics.
   Results: Participants engaged with digital technology early in life, with 49.75% students using some form of digital technology before ten years of age. Students reported the highest daily use of technology to search the internet for information (92%), online social networking (68.3%) and watching videos (67%). Most students expressed the least confidence in identifying different types of portable storage devices (24.1% Master's students; 41.7% Bachelor's students), describing the advantages of a digital camera (39.3% Master's students; 48.3% Bachelor's students), and totaling numbers in spreadsheets (22.8% Masters students; 48.3% Bachelor's students). No statistical differences were observed between the two universities or the two cohorts in terms of perceived confidence in using technology and software applications to support their learning. Interestingly, 24.7% of participants expressed high confidence in using electronic medical records without prior training, which may reflect positive attitude towards engaging with unknown digital technologies.
   Conclusions: Nursing students are frequent internet and social media users. However, despite positive attitudes to digital technology and widespread presence of digital technology in students' lives, deficits in students' confidence in using digital technology and software required for learning persist. Targeted digital literacy education interventions are needed as part of foundational nursing studies to improve nursing students' baseline digital literacy before commencing clinical placement. These should be scaffolded across the program to ensure an effective transition to nursing practice in evolving digitally-driven healthcare environments.

AB  - This paper provides an up-to-date overview of the current role of English among Spanish young students. To that end, an analysis of three important issues has been carried out. First, this research focuses on the different opportunities of the students to be in contact with English outside the classroom. Secondly, the attitudes of the participants have been examined using three different indicators; students' likeability, the importance of English, and the advantages for them of knowing English. Thirdly, the participants have self-assessed their level of proficiency in English in the four different skills. The outcomes reveal that young participants have a limited contact with English, and it is basically through music, radio, books, computers and television. As regards the students' attitudes towards English, the results prove the positive attitude of the respondents. Finally, the participants' self-assessment of their proficiency in English is positive, though some questions that require a reflection are included in the discussion.

AB  - Breast cancer survival disparities by race are likely multifactorial. In a small pilot cohort, we demonstrated a statistical interaction between age and race. The purpose of this study was to validate earlier findings in a larger, more diverse cohort and to test the hypothesis that breast cancer survival is influenced by the dependent relationship of age and race.
   We conducted a retrospective analysis of a multi-institutional breast cancer database for patients treated between 1999 and 2009. Study variables included age and disease stage at diagnosis, race, treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy) and overall survival. Statistical analysis and regression models were performed by Stata software.
   A total of 9,249 patients were included in this study. African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients were more likely to present at a younger age with metastases. African American and Hispanic race were associated with increased mortality after adjusting for stage, age, and treatment. A 2-way interaction between age and race was identified in the Cox regression model (p < 0.001). To further define this interaction, a postestimation analysis was performed to determine the predicted relative hazard for each race with age fixed at 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 years. At younger ages, the predicted relative hazard was significantly higher for both African American and Hispanic race.
   Despite adjusting for stage and treatment differences, African American and Hispanic race predicted poor survival. The effect of age and treatment on breast cancer survival differs across races. Additional research is needed to accurately determine the reasons for worsened survival.

AB  - Cross-sectional research has shown that frequency of self-disclosure to outgroup members mediates the positive relationship between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes. The current research investigated the relationship between self-disclosure and attitudes in more depth. New undergraduate students were asked to nominate an ingroup or outgroup friend and then report the intimacy of their disclosures to them, their anxiety and attitudes towards a series of social groups, in the first week of the semester and 6 weeks later. Intimacy of disclosure predicted more positive attitudes towards outgroups over time, but this association was only found among participants who nominated an outgroup friend. In the ingroup friend condition, a negative association was found. These associations were mediated by general intergroup anxiety. These relationships highlight the importance of integrating theories of interpersonal and intergroup relations when investigating intergroup contact. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This article presents two studies conducted with an affective dialogue system in which text-based system-user communication was used to model, generate and present different affective and social interaction scenarios. We specifically investigated the influence of interaction context and roles assigned to the system and the participants, as well as the impact of pre-structured social interaction patterns that were modelled to mimic aspects of "social exclusion" scenarios. The results of the first study demonstrate that both the social context of the interaction and the roles assigned to the system influence the system evaluation, interaction patterns, textual expressions of affective states, as well as emotional self-reports. The results observed for the second study show the system's ability to partially exclude a participant from a triadic conversation without triggering significantly different affective reactions or a more negative system evaluation. The experimental evidence provides insights on the perception, modelling and generation of affective and social cues in artificial systems that can be realized in different modalities, including the text modality, thus delivering valuable input for applying affective dialogue systems as tools for studying affect and social aspects in online communication.

AB  - Covert forms of authoritarian control remain an understudied strategy of authoritarian survival. This article uses the infiltration of the Catholic Church with secret collaborators in communist Poland to study the drivers and consequences of such covert forms of control. We theorize that subnational variation in communist infiltration is driven by differences in organizational vulnerability following World War II. In turn, we argue that the uneven degree of infiltration with proregime agents shaped the subsequent effectiveness of the Church to foster anticommunist attitudes. We test these predictions against competing explanations (including imperial legacies and modernization) by analyzing seven Polish surveys from the late communist period (1985-89). Our results confirm the importance of organizational vulnerability in driving the success of communist infiltration efforts and suggest that infiltration with secret agents was effective in undermining the Church's ability to shape the political attitudes of frequent churchgoers.

AB  - Star ratings play major roles in informing consumer decisions on major e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com. When people evaluate political books, for example, they might gauge whether star rating favorability scores align with their pre-existing political attitudes. The attitudinal stance of these online cues could invariably trigger responses that worsen the affective divide between partisans. However, few studies have identified and explained the mechanisms underlying affective polarization. Using two online experiments, we examine the mechanisms through which ratings induce affective polarization. Findings support warranting theory by consistently showing that counter-attitudinal ratings indirectly drive up affective polarization by increasing positive inparty affect via perceived manipulation. By contrast, pro-attitudinal star ratings polarize by increasing positive in-party affect through perceived in-party prototypicality. These findings challenge assumptions that affective polarization is solely characterized by negative out-party affect, and driven mainly by exposure to counter-attitudinal information.

AB  - This article deals with the tendency within the field of social work practice to create inter-organisational networks for welfare provision. We highlight the opportunities that then arise for social work to tackle social exclusion, and to perform its mediating role between the public sphere of government and the private sphere of individuals and families. We argue that the advantages of inter-organisational networking and collaboration can be realised by overcoming fragmentation of care at the micro level of welfare provision to citizens, but also by using these networks as a forum for debate to challenge dominant conceptualisations of complex social problems across organisational and sectorial boundaries. However, we also point to the danger of a so-called 'network euphoria', and discuss some of the risks associated with working together through networks. Therefore, the central argument of the article implies that those involved in these networks need to develop a common framework, or value base, with reference to human rights and principles of social justice.

AB  - Background: Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) stigma (ie, negative attitudes toward PrEP users) has been widely documented and is considered a significant barrier to implementation. However, few studies have examined PrEP stigma using implicit measures designed to reduce demand characteristics in responding. This study examined implicit PrEP-and HIV-related stigma among gay and bisexual men using geospatial social networking applications (ie, "hookup apps").
   Methods: Participants were presented with 4 simulated online profiles (pretested for comparability) paired with each of the following characteristics: HIV negative, HIV positive, on PrEP, or substance user. Participants rated the profiles on attractiveness, desirability, trustworthiness, likelihood of condom use, and riskiness of sex.
   Results: There was no evidence of PrEP-related stigma, ie, participants did not rate profiles of PrEP users more negatively than profiles of HIV-negative individuals not disclosing PrEP use. However, profiles of HIV-positive individuals were rated significantly less attractive and desirable than HIV-negative or PrEP profiles. When the sample was split by history of PrEP use, negative ratings of HIV-positive profiles remained only among participants who had never taken PrEP. Participants with any history of PrEP use demonstrated no difference in ratings by HIV status.
   Conclusion: These data provide the first empirical evidence for lower HIV stigma among PrEP users. Individuals who have used PrEP may "see" HIV-positive individuals differently than those without a history of PrEP use. The lack of evidence for PrEP-related stigma is encouraging and suggests that negative stereotypes about PrEP users may not extend to negative implicit judgments about them on social networking sites.

AB  - This paper investigates the antecedent factors of consumers' perceived values and attitudes towards digital signage advertising in a structural model. The results of this study revealed that four key antecedents (i.e. informativeness, involvement, entertainment and targeting) affect consumers' attention to digital signage advertising and perception of advertising values. This study shows that attitudes towards digital signage and perceived interactivity with it also affect consumers' attitudes towards digital signage advertising. This, in turn, influences positive attitudes towards a brand and higher purchase intentions.

AB  - The state of boredom presents a conundrum: When bored, we want to engage with an activity, but we don't want to engage with whatever is currently available. This conflict is exacerbated when external factors impose restrictions on the range of behaviors we can engage in, which is precisely the scenario we are currently facing, at a global level, during this period of social isolation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected data from 924 North American participants (530 Male, Mean age = 37.7 years) using the internet-based Mturk platform to examine the relation between self-reports of boredom proneness (using the Short Boredom-Proneness Scale) and individual responses to questions about compliance with social-distancing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our sample replicated recent findings in boredom research, including a negative correlation between boredom proneness and self-control. We also provide novel evidence that highly boredom prone people have been more likely to break the rules of social isolation in a variety of ways (e.g., fewer hours spent in social isolation, poor adherence to social distancing as evidenced by increased likelihood of holding a social gathering and coming into proximity with more people than recommended). We further demonstrated that boredom proneness substantially mediates the association between self-control and rule-breaking. These results indicate that boredom proneness is a critical factor to consider when encouraging adherence to social isolation.

AB  - Children with special educational needs often feel lonely in classrooms, are less accepted by their classmates and have fewer friendships. Their classmates' positive attitudes towards them are important for their social participation in inclusive classrooms. According to the theory of social referencing, children's attitudes towards peers with special educational needs are influenced by the role model behaviour of their parents. Therefore, we examined the relevance of children's perceptions of parental behaviour in terms of their attitudes towards peers with learning disabilities. This was done by investigating N = 753 children's attitudes, depending on their perceptions of parental behaviour towards peers with special educational needs, their contact experiences and their self-efficacy beliefs concerning their interpersonal skills. The results indicate that their attitudes are predicted by their perceptions of parental behaviour, their contact experiences and their self-efficacy beliefs. The effect of perceived parental behaviour on children's attitudes is mediated by their self-efficacy beliefs.

AB  - Research has shown that vicarious contact can help to reduce prejudice. We tested the effect of a controlled, video-based vicarious-contact intervention on straight men's (implicit and explicit) attitudes toward gay men. Findings of Experiment 1 (n = 99 German participants) failed to show direct effects but were in line with the idea that negative (situation-specific) emotions mediate the intervention effect. Experiment 2 (n = 108 U.S. participants) expanded findings: straight men with antigay preattitudes reported less negative intergroup emotions toward gay men after watching the vicarious-contact video (compared to the control condition); and less negative intergroup emotions were related to more positive attitudes toward gay men. For straight men with positive preattitudes, findings were in line with the hypothesis that positive intergroup emotions toward gay men were the relevant mediator. We discuss the moderating role of preattitudes to explain processes underlying vicarious-contact effects.

AB  - The article first examines the contrast between popular remembering and the official presentation of Yugoslav socialist past in Slovenia. We examine the discursive patterns in political dignitaries' declarations and reconstruct popular remembering as it emerges from the existing research. We focus on theories that conceptualize positive popular attitudes towards socialist past with the notion of 'nostalgia'. Following the ways how researchers overcome the difficulties of the 'Yugonostalgia' approach, we note that they do not take into account the embeddedness of the positive achievements of socialism into the overall fabric of socialist system. According to our hypothesis, this omission induces the researchers to overestimate the present social and political impact of positive attitudes to socialist past. Furthermore, social struggles in which researchers are engaged seem to raise barriers to scientific practice. This study attempts to contribute to the project of Yugoslav memory studies.

AB  - In this paper, I trace social mechanisms for the development and continuation of citizens' trust in e-voting. My research focuses on the processes that give rise to trust-related behavior, and identifies mechanisms that explain trust in e-voting. I distinguish between initial formation and recurrent manifestation of trust, and propose models of causal processes to explain them. I frame the research on trust in e-voting as a case of political trust in the socio-technical entity of the electoral authorities and the e-voting system, and draw from general socio-technical theories and literature on trust to construct relevant concepts and relationships. Empirically, this theory-building exercise traces the process of the initial development of trust in e-voting in Brazil in the 1990s and the maintenance of this trust in the conduct of Brazilian elections since then. The social mechanisms of trust that I derive from this study are associated with the process of democratization and continuing care towards adjusting the e-voting system to serve legitimate objectives for the conduct of elections, the interdependence of citizens' perception of the trustworthiness of the technology system and the trustworthiness of the electoral authorities, and the fostering of a positive attitude towards IT by government policy.
