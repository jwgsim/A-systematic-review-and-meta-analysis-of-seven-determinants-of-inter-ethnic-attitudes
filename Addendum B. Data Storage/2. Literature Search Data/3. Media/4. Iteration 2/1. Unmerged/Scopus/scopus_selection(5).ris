AB  - Objective: To assess the attitude of people living with type 1 diabetes toward the use of information and communication technology (ICT) to facilitate access to diabetes healthcare professionals (HCPs). Research design and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in two European tertiary diabetes care centers in London, UK, and Vienna, Austria, and from online diabetes platforms. Participants were asked about general options of online diabetes care and were presented with three scenarios (teleconference, online chat and telemonitoring of continuous glucose monitoring traces). Results: In total, 294 people (59% female; 78 British, 164 Austrians, 47 Germans, 5 from other countries; 45±15 years) who had been living with type 1 diabetes for 26±14.5 years participated. The vast majority of participants were insulin pump (and/or glucose sensor) users (84%) and reported good glycemic control (31% with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <7% and 51% with HbA1c 7%-8%). ICT was generally acceptable for counseling, with email/online messaging services and online health platform the most preferred options (74% and 53%). Study participants expressed a neutral to positive attitude toward the combined theme scores (relationship with HCP; confidence using technology; trust in data protection; intrusion of patient privacy; general acceptance of ICT in healthcare). UK participants showed more positive attitudes toward ICT across all theme scores than participants from Austria and Germany, but there were no gender-related differences. Conclusions: This online survey identified a highly ICT-astute group of people with type 1 diabetes, already using technology for insulin delivery, for whom online supported clinical diabetes care would be a viable and welcomed option. © 2019 Author(s).

AB  - Background: Since 2009 Time to Change has included among its strategies a social marketing campaign to tackle the stigma surrounding mental health problems. At the start of its third phase (2016-2021) the target group of the campaign was kept as people aged between mid-twenties and mid-forties but changed to middle-low income groups and the content was focused on men. Methods: Participants (n = 3700) were recruited through an online market research panel, before and after each burst of the campaign. They completed an online questionnaire evaluating knowledge (Mental Health Knowledge Schedule, MAKS); attitudes (Community Attitudes toward Mental Illness, CAMI); and desire for social distance (Intended Behaviour subscale of the Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale, RIBS). Socio-demographic data and awareness of the campaign were also collected. Results: For each of the 3 bursts, significant pre-post awareness differences were found (OR = 2.83, CI = 1.90-4.20, p < 0.001; OR = 1.72, CI = 1.22-2.42, p = 0.002; OR = 1.41, CI = 1.01-1.97, p = 0.043), and awareness at the end of the third burst was 33%. Demographic factors associated with awareness for one or more bursts included having children, familiarity with mental illness, male sex, being Black, Asian or other ethnic minorities and living in London or the East Midlands regions. An improvement across bursts in the "living with" subscale item of the RIBS, and in the "recover" and "advice to a friend" MAKS items were found. Familiarity with mental illness had the strongest association with all outcome measures, while the awareness of the campaign was also related with higher scores in MAKS and RIBS. Conclusions: These interim results suggest that the campaign is reaching and having an impact on its new target audience to a similar extent as did the TTC phase 1 campaign. While over the course of TTC we have found no evidence that demographic differences in stigma have widened, and indeed those by age group and region of England have narrowed, those for socioeconomic status, ethnicity and sex have so far remained unchanged. By targeting a lower socioeconomic group and creating relatively greater awareness among men and in Black and ethnic minority groups, the campaign is showing the potential to address these persistent differences in stigma. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The present article analyzes the rising discourses in the Orlando shooting discursive event, which took place on June 12, 2015 in the United States. Deemed constitutive of the American Muslim identity, the new rhetoric of estrangement emerging during the media coverage of the shooting is probed into using Critical Discourse Analysis. Ideological Square theory is adopted to shed light on the mental representations between the notion of the positive, in-group ‘Us’ and that of the negative, out-group ‘Them,’ hence an ideological split between Muslim and non-Muslim Americans. In addition to Van Dijk’s CDA-based tool, the study avails itself of Quantitative Content Analysis as an auxiliary approach to lay the numerical foundation, which consists in providing the occurrences of the statements imbued with the prevailing discourses. The data analyzed were collected from CNN and Fox News via LexisNexis Online Academic Database, and coded and analyzed using Atlas.ti Data Mining software program. The study has resulted in revealing discourses of estrangement subverting America’s proclaimed character religious pluralism and the constitutional ground on which the country is erected. The results and implications can be viewed in the discussed frames serving as a discursive extension of what is labeled ‘war on terror,’ of which the American Muslim community is the major recipient. The analysis is also done against the backdrop of religious pluralism and its suggested notions of tolerance, respect, and integration. © 2019, Academy of Islamic Studies, Dept of Islamic History and Civilization, University of Malaya.

AB  - We developed the Informed Health Choices podcast to improve people's ability to assess claims about the effects of treatments. We evaluated the effects of the podcast in a randomised trial. Objectives We conducted this process evaluation to assess the fidelity of the intervention, identify factors that affected the implementation and impact of the intervention and could affect scaling up, and identify potential adverse and beneficial effects. Setting The study was conducted in central Uganda in rural, periurban and urban settings. Participants We collected data on parents who were in the intervention arm of the Informed Health Choices study that evaluated an intervention to improve parents' ability to assess treatment effects. Procedures We conducted 84 semistructured interviews during the intervention, 19 in-depth interviews shortly after, two focus group discussions with parents, one focus group discussion with research assistants and two in-depth interviews with the principal investigators. We used framework analysis to manage qualitative data, assessed the certainty of the findings using the GRADE-CERQual (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research) approach, and organised findings in a logic model. Outcomes Proportion of participants listening to all episodes; factors influencing the implementation of the podcast; ways to scale up and any adverse and beneficial effects. Results All participants who completed the study listened to the podcast as intended, perhaps because of the explanatory design and recruitment of parents with a positive attitude. This was also likely facilitated by the podcast being delivered by research assistants, and providing the participants with MP3 players. The podcast was reportedly clear, understandable, credible and entertaining, which motivated them to listen and eased implementation. No additional adverse effects were reported. Conclusions Participants experienced the podcast positively and were motivated to engage with it. These findings help to explain the short-term effectiveness of the intervention, but not the decrease in effectiveness over the following year. © © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB  - Background: In a transition period of prevention strategy against HPV infection and cervical cancer in Saudi Arabia, it becomes necessary to appraise physicians' preparedness to undertake the inherent actions and responsibilities, by evaluating their knowledge and opinions regarding HPV infection and vaccine. Methods: A cross-sectional study carried out between Jan 2017 and Nov 2018, included 2000 physicians working in 21 public centers from the five regions of Saudi Arabia. A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess physicians' perception about HPV infection prevalence (1 item), knowledge about HPV infection and vaccine (9 items), and opinions and attitudes toward vaccine (4 items). A knowledge score (range 0-9) was calculated and adequate knowledge was assumed for a score ≥ median. Factors associated with opinions and attitudes were explored and multivariate regression was used to analyze independent factors of inadequate knowledge (score < median). Results: Majority of the participants replied correctly to all knowledge questions, and 63.0% perceived HPV infection as a frequently encountered infection. Median knowledge score was 8 and 62.0% had adequate knowledge (score ≥ 8). Inadequate knowledge was independently associated with Saudi nationality (OR = 1.51, p = 0.003), practice level (resident: OR = 3.53, p < 0.001; junior OR = 1.67, p = 0.002), and non Ob-Gyne specialty (OR = 5.40, p < 0.001); in addition to disparities across region and age. Among the participants, 7.6% were immunized and 41.2% accepted to receive the vaccine, while majority were favorable to have their children vaccinated (77.6%) and to include HPV vaccine in the local immunization program (69.6%). Self-perceived underexposure to HPV infection (58.5%), lack of knowledge about the vaccine (21.1%) and being sexually inactive (14.7%) were the most frequently reported reasons for refusing the vaccine. Overall negative attitude regarding vaccine was typically associated with male, older, Saudi, senior consultant in other than Ob/Gyn specialty. Inadequate knowledge level as well as lowly perceived prevalence of HPV infection were associated with less favorable attitude to vaccination. Conclusions: More specific educational interventions are warranted to trigger physicians' active engagement in the fight against HPV infection and cervical cancer. Such interventions should demystify the HPV vaccine by exposing its efficacy, availability and safety, along with providing practical information about the vaccination procedure and goals to achieve successful prevention strategy. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the most common serious complications after surgery and associated with preventable morbidity, mortality, and increased health care costs. The use of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (SAP) is an effective measure that helps to protect against SSIs. This study aims to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice of surgical staff towards preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery department at an academic tertiary hospital in Sudan. Methodology: An observational descriptive study was conducted among doctors in the surgery department at an academic tertiary hospital in Sudan in order to assess their knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) towards surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP). A four-section multiple-choice questionnaire was designed and hand-delivered to registered doctors in the surgery department at an academic tertiary hospital in Sudan. The WHO guidelines were used to evaluate the answers of the participants. Results: Out of 56 doctors requested to participate in this study, only 49 responded and their response rate was 87.5%. Six (12.5%) surgeons had good knowledge about appropriate SAP. However, 16.3 and 24.5% of the respondents were aware of appropriate SAP in the case of Ig E-mediated reaction to penicillin and risk of Gram-negative infections, respectively. The surgeon's attitude score about the need for local and national guidelines for SAP was 98 and 100%, respectively. Accordance of the physician's practice with ASHP guidelines regarding timing of the first dosage of SAP was 35.4% while correct administration of an intraoperative dose was 42.9% in agreement with the guideline. 53.1% knows when to stop SAP after surgery correctly. Conclusion: Although the participants in this study showed a positive attitude towards antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines, their knowledge and strict adherence to a protocolized practice per WHO checklist should be improved in order to reduce the incidence of preventable surgical site infections. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper examines discourses of liberal Islamophobia in Austria, analysing interviews with journalists from national newspapers, magazines and TV station. Using a theoretical framework that combines a Gramscian analysis with methods of discourse analysis, it identifies “temporalization” as an effective discursive mechanism in the construction of the Muslim “Other” as a “folk devil”. It argues that liberal Islamophobia works as a historicist racism, which allows differently positioned subjects to invest into, and reproduce, a mythical space of representation where the Muslim “Other” figures as a “devil from our past”, embodying everything Austrian society has supposedly done away with in the years of political reform after 1968. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to understand Indian tourists’ perceptions of Airbnb compared to other hospitality options, and the factors driving their purchase intentions. Design/methodology/approach: An integrated model for purchase intention was conceptualized based on the theory of planned behavior and social exchange theory. Constructs such as trust, authenticity, travel innovativeness, price sensitivity and effort expectancy were included based on a survey of the literature. Structural equation models were built using survey data. Respondent ranking of different criteria for Airbnb vs its competitors were aggregated using Borda count method. Findings: Price is the most important criteria across hospitality choices, including Airbnb, except high-end hotels. Facilities, home-like feeling, trust and friendly service were important for Airbnb. Consumer expectations from Airbnb are similar to homestays, mid-range and budget hotels and different from resorts and high-range hotels. In the theory of planned behavior model, trust in Airbnb and perceived authenticity had large significant positive effects on purchase intention, mediated by attitude. Social norms and effort expectancy had direct positive effects on behavioral intentions. Price sensitivity had a direct small negative effect on purchase intention. Overall, fit of the model was within acceptable parameters. Originality/value: Despite being an important emerging market, Airbnb in India has not been covered by studies of consumer behavior. This paper fills that research gap. Airbnb’s main competitors are home-stays and mid-range hotels. Building trust, creating authentic experiences and ensuring price competitiveness will drive adoption. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Urban green space is believed as a beneficial landscape for mental restoration in the urban settings. This study aims to examine the restorative quality of the urban green space from a multi-sensory perspective, focusing on both direct and indirect connections between visual, auditory, and tactile sensations and mental restoration. Two hundred and fifty park users of Tianhe Park in Guangzhou, China, were surveyed. Data were collected regarding their three types of sensations, i.e., the perceived mental restoration, health-related behavioral activities and emotional responses in the urban park. As a result, visual and auditory sensation were found to be linked with mental restoration directly and indirectly, while the tactile sensation was only associated with mental restoration indirectly; and health-related behaviors and emotional response mediated the relations between the three sensations and mental restoration significantly. It is concluded that the greater effects of auditory sensation and the under-studied potential effects of tactile sensation on mental restoration should be more emphasized in the future design of urban park. This is expected to contribute to the high restorative quality of the urban green space and promote public health. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the framing and re-framing of activism efforts enacted by LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, Chris Paul, and Carmelo Anthony during the 2016 ESPYS through the theoretical lens of critical race theory. Specifically, comments made to three posts on ESPN’s Facebook page pertaining to these calls for activism were analyzed. Qualitative coding of 10,658 comments led to the discovery of four primary themes including (a) discussing race; (b) law enforcement accountability; (c) realities of violence; and (d) debating crime. While the athletes (i.e. the messengers) engaging in activism received attention via Facebook comments, users focused significant attention on the messages being disseminated. Ultimately, this social media discourse illuminated the complex nature of race relations in the United States today, highlighting the persistence of deeply ingrained cultural stereotypes and beliefs that are often left unshaken by athlete activism. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article elaborates on Jean Baudrillard's ideas about the moral effects of the rise of the consumerist society, and also on Patrick Stokes. conceptual distinctions between different reactions individuals can display when faced with moral decisions. I start from Baudrillard's viewpoint that in the consumerist society, characteristic for the occidental post-modern world, the need (necessity) itself has been replaced by the desire to consume per se. The Western individual perceives abundance as a natural right, and this is transforming both the meaning of work and the value of its products. In essence, Baudrillard describes a form of alienation, with effects that transcend the commercial realm of commodity consumption, and which is better understood within the moral domain. Patrick Stokes exploits the Kierkagaardian concept of interesse while expressing his view of moral vision. He is designing a thought experiment that reveals a fundamental distinction between radically different moral reactions of hypothetical individuals, even when they are sharing the same cultural, educational, political or religious background. Starting from these two positions, I analyze a few situations and events from the world of contemporary tennis, revealing how universal values get to be ignored, or contextualized under the influence of social prejudice and schemas. My conclusion is that, nowadays, we are witnessing a reshaping of the way people regard and act on their values, especially in the realm of social media. Thus, situations that should be approached by the appeal to values such as truth, justice, and humanity, in fact get to be interpreted in a biased way, due to the existence of some pre-existing patterns of understanding. © 2019 Universitatea "Alexandru Ioan Cuza" din Iasi.

AB  - In recent years, we have witnessed an online backlash against feminism (Menzies 2008). This backlash is mobilizing a loose confederacy of interconnected communities from more traditional men's rights activists (MRAs) to the new misogynistic techno-cultures of the Manosphere (Nagle 2015). Despite their differences, in all of these groups, feminism is reconfigured as intrinsically prejudicial and threatening towards men (Blais, Dupuis-Déri 2012) and labelled as nothing more than misandry (Marwick, Caplan 2018). The use of misandry as synonym for «man-hating» serves both misogynist subcultures and more moderate men's rights interests, in that it allows these groups to appropriate the language of identity politics in order to place men as the silenced victims of a reverse discrimination in every political, economic, and social arena (Savran 1992; Farrell 1993) and reinforce their sense of aggrieved entitlement (Kimmel 2015). Situating their belief system in a social vacuum that fails to consider intersecting social dynamics, MRAs construct an over-simplified cultural model of the social world that isolates practices and phenomena that they believe are uniquely harmful to men (Schmitz, Kazyak 2016). In this way, their anti-feminist rhetoric takes the form of a neoliberal and seemingly neutral strategy that avoids any analysis of structural inequalities in favour of a common-sense celebration of individual choice for women and men (Nicholas, Agius 2018). This «pro-male» anti-feminism (Ging 2017) is indicative of a wider complex backlash (McRobbie 2004) that both accepts some of the precepts of feminism such as the principle of liberal equality, alongside a strong rejection of feminism as a label and political project. Given the theoretical framework outlined above, the general aim of this study is to explore the Italian MRA and Manosphere online network to take stock of the current situation and the risk it represents for feminism. More precisely, the study aims to unveil some of the key drivers of anti-feminist ideologies and will be guided by the following questions: which representations of feminism and feminists emerge in Italian online communities and how they spark criticism of feminism? Is neoliberal feminism a specific target of this criticism? Are MRA and manosphere communities both represented online and, if so, how are they bound together? How does the Italian situation differ from the international one?. © 2019 Societa Editrice il Mulino. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study uncovered the influence of an airport's green physical environment on visitors' psychological responses, affective responses, and loyalty behaviors as well as to build a sturdy theorization that related to the psychological resilience, attitude, satisfaction, brand-self connection and loyalty for the airport. Based on a quantitative approach, our findings provided insight that a green physical environment affected the psychological resilience considerably. Moreover, such association increased a visitor's positive attitude, satisfaction, and brand-self connection with the creation of loyalty intentions. The prominent role of attitude in building loyalty intentions was unearthed. Our finding from a metric invariance test further showed that gender moderated the magnitude of the effect of satisfaction and brand-self connection on loyalty intentions. The study variables' role of mediating effect was also recognizable. Overall, the present study demonstrated the criticality of a green built environment and its role in explicating visitor responses/behaviors in the airport context in a successful manner. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The current era has brought about major changes in the way people connect to each other, and social media is a major pillar of this change. In this new communication and connecting environment, companies are under pressure to constantly adapt and become present on platforms where their customers are while being sustainable and profitable in the long run. On the other hand, traditional marketing research challenges have led to the expansion of new research approaches like neuromarketing as a means to gather the most accurate data ever from customers. When referring to how we can use neuromarketing research within the social media context, the current paper aims to fill a gap in the current literature: Using neuromarketing research in social media while taking into consideration both companies' purposes and customers' sought-after benefits. This aim is achieved through two pieces of research that shed light on a model where these purposes are matched with the corresponding benefits, showing the degree of acceptability of four major neuromarketing applications. This model is a stepping stone towards discovering how social media neuromarketing research can be a pillar of sustainable business communication as part of the broader perspective of sustainability in terms of business growth. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The rapid increase in recent years of Chinese outbound foreign direct investment (FDI) has prompted growing scholarly interest in its economic and political implications for host countries. However, relatively little attention has been paid to how concerns over the rise of China may shape public attitudes towards such investment. This article tests the link between threat perception and preferences for FDI in the United States. We argue that, due to heightened geopolitical concerns and nationalism, perceptions of the China threat negatively affect how the American public views the impact of incoming Chinese FDI. Using a survey experiment, we show that respondents are indeed less likely to support Chinese FDI when primed with information that highlights the security and economic threats posed by China than when they receive no such priming. Furthermore, causal mediation analyses reveal that the treatment effects of security and economic threats are mediated by respondents' concerns about the challenges that Chinese FDI poses to national security as well as to American economy. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper analyzes the awareness and attitudes of the Chinese public toward genetically modified (GM) foods with different types of labeling and evaluates the impact of public confidence in the government management of GM food labeling has on their attitude. From 2015 to 2016, we conducted a series of surveys to collect data from 1730 respondents, which included consumers, farmers, media, and local agricultural officials in agricultural departments. The results show ~60% of the Chinese public do not know that they usually consume or purchase GM products or products containing GM ingredients. Nearly 80% of the Chinese public are accepting foods labeled as not containing GM ingredients, 57% are accepting foods without labeling, and ~40% are accepting GM-labeled foods. The respondents with a lack of confidence in the government are less likely to embrace GM foods. Those that are more aware of GM products are more likely to accept GM labeled foods. The group having the most positive attitude toward GM-labeled foods is the media, followed by agricultural officials, while the group having the most negative attitude toward GM labeled foods is farmers. Our findings provide an empirical basis to inform GM food labeling policy discussions and possible revisions, which may promote the development of GM foods in China. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Using data from a national sample of parent and family educators in the US (n = 697), this comparative study examines professionals’ practices and technology-related attitudes, skill and workplace conditions. Overall, professionals report positive attitudes about the value of using technology in practice and view themselves as proficient. They most frequently use technologies like the email and document preparation software, and less frequently social media and even virtual reality. Workplace resources vary significantly, educators are not motivated by employer expectations and most report self-training as more valuable than formal sources. Mean comparisons by family educator type validate differences by context. Parenting educators, occasional family educators (e.g., teachers, counselors) and Family Life Educators vary from those in Higher Education/Administration. Those in Higher Education/Administration have more technology resources, report more positive attitudes, are more confident about their skills, and view formal technology training as useful. Conclusions suggest the need for the field of parent and family education to join other educational professions (e.g., licensed classroom teachers) to embrace technology use as a critical competency and advocate for the necessary resources in the preparation and ongoing service training of professionals. © 2019 by the author.

AB  - Objective The objective of this study was to assess the attitude and behaviour of Dutch ENT surgeons and ENT residents towards Evidence Based Medicine. Introduction Evidence Based Medicine is the cornerstone of modern clinical care. It is considered of crucial importance for optimal patient care and health care quality. Practicing it requires positive attitude and behaviour. Little is known about the attitude and behaviour towards Evidence Based Medicine in otorhinolaryngology. Methods We performed a web-based questionnaire among 607 Dutch Ear- Nose &amp; Throat surgeons of whom 106 residents (cross-sectional study). The questionnaire consisted of 3 parts; (1) personal characteristics, (2) questions regarding Evidence Based Medicine attitude (McColl questionnaire, scale 0-100%) and (3) questions regarding Evidence Based Medicine behaviour (barriers and information seeking behaviour). Data were collected between March 26th 2018 and June 1st 2018. Results The median score on the overall McColl questionnaire was 50 (IQR 35). The main barriers respondents experienced were time related. Limited time in the outpatient clinic was considered a more important barrier for residents to practice EBM compared to ENT surgeons. Respondents' gut feeling and their own preference were identified as the main contributing factors in clinical decision making. Conclusion In conclusion Dutch ENT surgeons have a moderate attitude on the McColl questionnaire. The main barriers to practice Evidence Based Medicine they experience are time related. © 2019 Rademaker et al.

AB  - This paper examines the ways in which current affairs related to diversity and difference, nationally and globally, are represented to Australian children in children’s digital news media and through family discussions. The discussion is based on qualitative research that explores parents’ views and practices in addressing news media and diversity and difference issues with their children. In addition, this project includes a discursive analysis of stories found in Behind The News (BTN), the primary digital news media source for Australian children, aged 8–13 years, from 2015–2018. The news stories are related to three significant topics: the marriage equality debate, refugees and terrorism. Within feminist post-structuralist, post-developmentalist and critical theorist frameworks, a focus is given to examining the dominant discourses that prevail in the stories, which provide insight into how childhood and children’s access to certain types of knowledge is viewed and regulated through media and family practices. Drawing on thematic and Foucaultian discursive analyses, the pilot study findings demonstrate that children’s news media is closely scrutinised and regulated, with major news stories framed within dominant discourses of childhood innocence, as well as the agenda and particular interests of the producers of children’s new media. These topics, which have dominated news in recent years, are frequently considered by some adults as inappropriate or difficult topics to discuss with children. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The lives of Indonesian waria (transgender women) are substantially shaped by spatial dynamics. As a result of social and spatial exclusion, subsequent migration and economic needs, a lifestyle pattern around daily work in beauty salons and street nightlife tied to transactional sex has evolved in many parts of urban Indonesia. Drawing on ethnographic research in the Indonesian regions of Java and West Papua, I demonstrate that despite tremendous spatial abjection, salons and street nightlife are also productive, transformative and conjoining spatialities that foster waria subjectivity in affective relations with their intimate partners, the community, the phantasmic promise of the transnational mediascape and Indonesia as a nation. The places that waria occupy may spark moral prejudice and targeted violence, but simultaneously they are sites of agency at which waria experience self-affirmation and a sense of belonging while embodying through gendered performance the envisioned mobility at both national and transnational scales. The paper thus foregrounds how spaces and subjectivities are mutually constitutive, forging one another, as well as how certain spatialities hold potential to disrupt the sense of marginality. © 2019 Terje Toomistu, published by Sciendo.

AB  - In the face of a wide range of consumer electronic products, how can consumers take into account the sustainable development of the ecological environment during their purchase and consumption? This study established a new product aesthetics classification, divided it into interface aesthetics and product form aesthetics, and proposed a new conceptual model to test the impact of interface aesthetics and product form aesthetics on sustainable perceived value and purchase intention. In this study, smartwatches were used as the subject and a two-stage survey was carried out to collect samples from common consumers of consumer electronic products. Partial least squares (PLS) was employed to test the conceptual model and corresponding hypotheses on data collected from 425 survey samples. The research results suggested that interface aesthetics and product form aesthetics must be mediated by sustainable perceived value so as to have a positive impact on consumers' purchase intention. Therefore, sustainable perceived value is a mediating variable for adjusting product aesthetics and purchase intention. In addition, sustainable perceived value greatly affects consumers' green consumer behavior. Increasing the emotional durability established between consumers and products through sustainable perceived value to prolong the life of products reduces resource consumption and wave costs, and promotes sustainable development of ecological resources. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This study highlights transportation service quality (including that of the core transportation service and the physical environment of transportation) and investigates its impact on satisfaction as well as attitude toward and image of a sustainable city. Additionally, this study also addresses the mediating role of satisfaction in the relationships between transportation service quality, and both attitude toward and image of a sustainable city, as well as the moderating role of involvement in the links between satisfaction and this attitude and between satisfaction and this image. The findings confirm that both core transportation service and the physical environment of transportation significantly and positively influence satisfaction and, in turn, significantly and positively influence attitude toward and image of a sustainable city. Satisfaction also plays a mediating role in the links between transportation service quality and this attitude and image. In addition, the effect of satisfaction on attitude toward and image of a sustainable city becomes greater as the level of involvement increases. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This study applies the theory of planned behavior and value-attitude-behavior hierarchy model to examine the influence of green product consumption values on the green product buying attitude and green product purchase behavior. Additionally, unlike the previous studies, the current study explores the moderating effects of the role of government and media exposure in the relationships. Data was collected by an online survey from 238 green product consumers in China. Structural equation modeling was applied for testing the hypothesized relationships. The results of the study have indicated that ecological value and economical value have not significantly influenced the green product buying attitude. In contrast, the health and safety values of green product have positively influenced the green product buying attitude. Moreover, the buying attitude of consumers has a significant positive effect on green product purchase behavior. Furthermore, the results showed that the role of government and media exposure have significantly moderated the relationship between safety value and buying attitude of green product. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The research on organizational behaviors has primarily focused on the promotion of employees’ productive behaviors through positive attitudes and behaviors related to their organization and job and, ultimately, on the improvement in organizational effectiveness. This study was designed upon taking into account the situation in which the relationships based on a psychological contract between an organization and an employee weakened, as well as the issue of the decline in employment with the introduction of the concept of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Specifically, it aimed to confirm the association between withdrawal, which is typical of unproductive behavior inhibiting organizational consolidation, and career growth opportunities in a situation characterized by increasing anxiety about job security and employability. It also verified the mediating effects of ego-resilience as a positive result of adjustment by employees perceiving the risk in the association between these two variables. A survey was conducted in 400 employees at public and private enterprises in South Korea and 293 questionnaires were analyzed. The career growth opportunities perceived by employees were found to be significant variables. In contrast, their ego-resilience partially mediated between career growth opportunities and physical withdrawal but had insignificant mediating effects on the association between career growth opportunities and psychological withdrawal. Lastly, the theoretical and practical implications and limitations of this study were indicated and the issues for further research were discussed. © Rushing Water Publishers Ltd. 2019.

AB  - With the rapid development of information and communication technology, a variety of new industries and services are rapidly evolving based on the convergence between existing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and heterogeneous industries. In the meantime, the FinTech market, created by the convergence of financial and ICT areas, is emerging and growing rapidly. The new market of virtual transaction based on digital money is growing faster than any other FinTech area. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the perceived difference in the virtuality of a consumer's transaction affects the consumer's purchasing behavior and how the behavior changes. Specifically, this study revealed that consumers' perceived virtuality differs according to the type of transaction method. Consumers felt that the money was more virtual when they had digital (virtual) currency for a service than when they had cash. This virtuality of money controls the psychological distance of the consumer's money, which is closer to cash than virtual currency. This difference in psychological distance affects consumers' information processing, such that when psychological distances are far (vs. close), consumers prefer products that are described as abstract (vs. concrete), and have a more favorable attitude toward products with more variety. © 2019 by the author.

AB  - The Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, once the symbolic center of national commemoration of war dead in pre-War years, is now regarded as one of the critical conservative symbols of Japan’s imperial past. While the Yasukuni study is expanding, not much has been explored on the nature of public reactions to the controversy. This study explores Prime Minister Abe Shinzo’s Yasukuni pilgrimage in 2013 and delves into Japanese public opinion on and around it. Overall, the Japanese public is relatively composed and prefers cautious approach; yet, at the same time, more people now support the official Yasukuni visits in general. This study also reveals discernible, yet nuanced, disagreements among PM Abe’s Yasukuni policies, the public perceptions of them, and the narratives of major newspaper editorials on this issue. The coverage of public opinion polls by the major national newspapers uncovers the public opinion on (1) the official Yasukuni visit, (2) the idea of building an alternative non-religious national memorial, and (3) the Japanese public’s decreasing sense of affinity toward China and South Korea (and their implications on understanding the Yasukuni issue and the sense of nation). The study will also examine the newspaper narratives on the controversy, which should help exemplify the overall public mood over the years. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Latina women at risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) have lower awareness, knowledge, and use of genetic counseling and testing services (GCT) than non-Latina Whites. Few interventions have been developed to reduce these disparities among at-risk Latinas. This pilot study assessed the impact of a culturally targeted narrative video developed by our team. The study included 40 Latina immigrants living in the United States who were at risk of HBOC, including affected and unaffected women. We assessed pre-post differences in psychosocial outcomes. Participants were 47.35 years old on average (SD = 9.48). Most (70%) were unaffected with cancer, had an annual income of $40,000 or less (65%), an education of High School or less (62.5%), and were uninsured (77.5%). The video significantly enhanced knowledge (p < 0.001), positive attitudes (p < 0.05), anticipatory positive emotions (p < 0.05), and intentions to participate in counseling (p < 0.001). Importantly, the video also significantly reduced negative attitudes (p < 0.05), and attitudinal ambivalence (p < 0.001). The culturally targeted video shows preliminary evidence in improving psychosocial outcomes related to GCT uptake in Latinas at risk for HBOC. This intervention is a promising easily-disseminable strategy to address disparities in GCT utilization. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - As infectious disease outbreaks emerge, public health agencies often enact vaccination and social distancing measures to slow transmission. Their success depends on not only strategies and resources, but also public adherence. Individual willingness to take precautions may be influenced by global factors, such as news media, or local factors, such as infected family members or friends. Here, we compare three modes of epidemiological decision-making in the midst of a growing outbreak using network-based mathematical models that capture plausible heterogeneity in human contact patterns. Individuals decide whether to adopt a recommended intervention based on overall disease prevalence, the proportion of social contacts infected, or the number of social contacts infected. While all strategies can substantially mitigate transmission, vaccinating (or self isolating) based on the number of infected acquaintances is expected to prevent the most infections while requiring the fewest intervention resources. Unlike the other strategies, it has a substantial herd effect, providing indirect protection to a large fraction of the population. © 2019 Herrera-Diestra, Meyers.

AB  - To evaluate awareness of the Eat Well Campaign (EWC) among parents and assess perceptions about its effectiveness.Design: Post-campaign evaluation study with a cross-section of parents recruited through random digit dialling. Participants completed an online survey about EWC awareness, its perceived effectiveness among parents and their meal planning practices (attitudes, behaviours and self-efficacy).Setting: A federal mass-media campaign disseminated by Health Canada (2013-2014) to promote meal planning to Canadian parents.Participants: Parents (n 964) of children aged 2-12 years from all Provinces and Territories.Results: Of respondents, 41 % (390/964) were aware of the campaign; Quebec City and rural Quebec had the highest rates of awareness, whereas Vancouver, Winnipeg and Toronto had the lowest. Awareness was greater among parents with lower income, basic education and French-speakers. Campaign intensity was significantly associated with greater odds of reporting positive attitudes towards the EWC and meal planning (P < 0·05). Campaign awareness was significantly associated with greater odds of believing that meal planning helps maintain a healthy diet (OR = 1·68, 95 % CI 1·03, 2·74) and planning meals (OR = 1·66, 95 % CI 1·03, 2·54), but not self-efficacy, in adjusted models.Conclusions: The present study is the first to evaluate an initiative that promoted meal planning with mass media. The EWC demonstrated evidence of success in terms of equitable access to a nutrition initiative by reaching lower-income and less-educated parents. Understanding behavioural factors among different segments of the population will be important to target appropriate audiences and develop tailored interventions that support healthy eating practices. © The Authors 2019.

AB  - Background: Breast diseases in women, whether benign or malignant, are very commonly encountered. The breast is the commonest site for female cancer in Egypt (38.8%). Breast cancer screening can reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the survival rate for this malignancy. Mammogram can be used as a screening technique beside its role as diagnostic, especially in women over 40 years of age. Objectives: To assess knowledge, attitude and practice regarding breast cancer and awareness about mammogram as a screening method among a group of females attending Ain Shams University outpatient clinics. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed from August to September 2017. A systematic random sample was taken from attending females (18–70 years) in Ain Shams University outpatient clinics (Internal Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics Hospital, and Maternity hospital). They were interviewed using a questionnaire inquiring about sociodemographic background, participants’ knowledge, attitude, and practice towards breast cancer and its screening. Results: The mean age ± SD of attending females (18–70 years) was 37 ± 11 years. Most study participants had correct information about mammography. They showed poor knowledge level about risk factors. Mass media such as TV and internet were identified as the main source of information on breast cancer by 43% and 23.9%, respectively. In general, participants had positive attitude towards breast cancer screening by mammography. Around 90% agreed that mammogram was the best way to find a very small lump in the breast, and 91.4% agreed that women who have regular screening by mammogram have better disease outcome than those who do not screen. Regarding mammography practice rate, a small percent of participants (8.1%) was advised by their doctors to conduct a screening mammography. The level of knowledge was significantly and positively correlated with their attitude towards breast cancer screening. Conclusion: The poor knowledge and practices of women illustrate the need for health education program directed to Egyptian females to improve their knowledge about breast cancer—especially its risk factors—and its screening. Using TV and Internet as media for spreading information about this disease is crucial. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - This research investigates situations in which frontline employees deliberately restrict customers’ access to touch products on display (active interpersonal haptic blocking), and how this understudied form of sensory blocking may increase customers’ downstream purchasing. While previous research examines the benefits of increased product touch, we temporarily block touch for specific products in display areas and then investigate the subsequent impact on customer behavior. Through four studies, including a retail field experiment, we find that when an employee asks a customer not to touch a product on display, this initiates a serial mediation process which: (1) engenders feelings of psychological reactance that result in (2) increased compensatory touching of subsequently encountered products to counterbalance a loss of sensory freedom, and (3) increased spending and purchasing once the customer leaves the reactance-inducing encounter. Effects are moderated by socioeconomic status (SES) and need for touch (NFT) whereby psychological reactance was significantly stronger for high SES customers with a moderate or high NFT when actively blocked. Results also demonstrate that active interpersonal haptic blocking does not result in more negative attitudes toward retailers, thus retailers might consider implementing this counterintuitive practice to encourage downstream sales. © 2019 New York University

AB  - Good quality of life is important for healthy ageing. Studies have shown that although information and communication technology can improve older people’s quality of life, their technology acceptance level is rather low. Tangible user interfaces (TUIs) enable people to interact with the digital world through everyday physical objects, thus offering more intuitive digital environments for older people. In this study, we employ a TUI prototype to investigate the relationship between older people’s technology acceptance and quality of life, the changes in these outcome measures after using TUI, and the associations between them. The TUI prototype, Tangible Cup was used by 20 older participants over a period of three months. Data were collected using the technology acceptance model (TAM) questionnaire, the older people’s quality of life (OPQOL) questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The results showed some positive changes in technology acceptance after the use of Tangible Cup. However, no change in the quality of life was found. While statistically significant correlations between the change in technology acceptance and the change in quality of life were observed, limitations such as small sample size and participants not accurately representing the target population should be noted. Thus, further research is needed to better understand the associations between the change in technology acceptance and the change in quality of life. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - A wide variety of social media platforms have become integral to contemporary forms of social engagement, including mass protests. Twitter is considered specifically indicative of public attitudes in this regard. This study attempts to examine the feasibility of using Twitter sentiment analysis to predict the 2014 revolution in Ukraine. Tweets representing public opinion are clustered by means of the ‘StreamKM++’ algorithm into three classes (likely, neutral and unlikely). The resulting prediction model for the three classes (using Naïve Bayes) was 96.75 per cent. As such, this study offers a promising way to perform an online prediction of social movements. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the release of cardiac damage biomarkers jointly with cardiac autonomic modulation after a mountain ultramarathon. Such knowledge and the possible relationship of these markers with race time is of primary interest to establish possible recommendations upon athletes' recovery and return to training following these competitions. Forty six athletes enrolled in the Penyagolosa Trails CSP115 race (118 km and a total positive elevation of 5439 m) took part in the study. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-TNT) concentrations as well as linear and nonlinear heart rate variability (HRV) were evaluated before and after the race. NT-proBNP and hs-TNT significantly increased post-race; fifty percent of the finishers surpassed the Upper Reference Limit (URL) for hs-TNT while 87% exceeded the URL for NT-proBNP. Overall and vagally-mediated HRV were diminished and cardiac autonomic modulation became less complex and more predictable following the race. More pronounced vagal modulation decreases were associated with higher levels of postexertional NT-proBNP. Moreover, rise in hs-TNT and NT-proBNP was greater among faster runners, while pre-race overall and vagally-mediated HRV were correlated with finishing time. Participation in a 118-km ultratrail induces an acute release of cardiac damage biomarkers and a large alteration of cardiac autonomic modulation. Furthermore, faster runners were those who exhibited a greater rise in those cardiac damage biomarkers. In light of these findings, an appropriate recovery period after ultraendurance races appears prudent and particularly important among better performing athletes. At the same time, HRV analysis is shown as a promising tool to assess athletes' readiness to perform at their maximum level in an ultraendurance race. © Journal of Sports Science and Medicine.

AB  - Depression has become a major public health concern in Kerala, South India. Media and mental health professionals often attribute the rise of depression and suicide to a discontent around modern transformations and the flipside of the “Kerala model of development”. Kerala’s primary health care system of health governance, surveillance and care with its backbone of community and multi-purpose health workers is currently being expanded to target inner feelings, emotional suffering and existential despair, as a result of complex global, national and local processes of making visible and stabilizing depression as a public health category. Rather than relying on NGOs and foreign funding, mental health policy planners in Kerala engage the state of Kerala. Using the case of a junior health inspector’s counseling, I argue that the reconfiguration of suffering from an existential part of life and symptom of adversity into a medical condition can also lead to mobilization of (gendered) care in a context of familial marginalization and neglect. In this context, individual bodies are healed by restoring social bodies. Medicalization does not necessarily silence social inequalities and marginalization but can become productive in providing an idiom to critique a family’s moral economy. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Aim: Socioeconomic marginalization and inequalities in well-being and health in adults have been shown to be rooted in the early childhood experience. In particular, childhood poverty and parental income may influence children’s well-being in multiple and diverse ways, as it is known that parental poverty impedes cognitive function. Subjects and methods: The 1987 Finnish Birth Cohort includes a complete census of children born in a single year. The children were followed up from birth until end of 2012 using official registers maintained by the Finnish authorities. Cohort members who survived till the end of follow-up were included in the study (N = 58,818). Path modelling was used to analyze relations of theoretical constructs; parental adaption (PA), parental psychiatric involvement (PPI), family socioeconomic status (SES) as mediator, and child life outcomes (CLO) as outcome. Three models were made; a full model, a mediational model (where PA and PPI only have a direct effect on CLO through SES), and a non-mediational model with only direct effects of PA and PPI on CLO. A multiple group analysis was undertaken by cohort members’ different educational outcomes. Results: The best-fitting model suggested that as parental psychiatric involvement increases and parental adaptation failures increase, the socio-economic status of the family is compromised; in turn, poverty predicts increased adverse life outcomes for children. The restricted mediational model fits best on the data, and equally well for all educational outcomes. Childhood poverty remains the most significant determinant of early adult outcomes, regardless of school performance. Conclusion: More policy effort needs to be enacted to reduce childhood poverty and its consequences in Finland. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive and systematic understanding of cognition and attitude in medical tourism in Korea. Especially, considering the international characteristics of medical tourism, we compared the motives and risk perception of tourists from Russia, Japan, and China who are most active in medical tourism in Korea. The overall attitude toward medical tourism in Korea was 5.00 on the 7-point average, indicating that all three countries were positive. The most favorable attitude toward medical tourism in Korea was surveyed as Russian tourists. Japanese patients who showed the most negative attitudes toward medical tourism in Korea showed a negative perception level below the midpoint of the scale for all 19 items measuring health service and convenience factors. The overall perception of Chinese tourists in Korea is median between Russia and Japan. This study can not completely explain the cultural influence on the perception and attitude of medical tourism, but at least Hofstede (1980) found the effect of communityism / individualism and avoidance tendency of uncertainty. © Rushing Water Publishers Ltd. 2019.

AB  - Muslim communities have frequently been the victim of vilification and discrimination in Australia and the broader Asian region. This article discusses and compares the narratives around Muslim vilification in Australia and Sri Lanka. Despite the fact that these two nations are vastly different in size, demographics and cultural history, I will argue that there are remarkable similarities in how Muslims are subject to attack in both nations. The hate speech occasioned against Muslims in Sri Lanka and Australia is shaped by almost identical narrative structures and is cultivated in similar online environments. In both cases, anti-Muslim animus is fuelled by a fear of displacement and perceived contamination of what nativists regard as ethnically sovereign territory. I will argue that the underlying sub-text in both cases is owed to a repulsion to the physical presence of Muslims which can be understood in terms of Mary Douglas' concept of the moral pollutant. © 2019 Australian Social Policy Association

AB  - This paper explores the productive role of radiological overflows in the historical evolution of the 100 mSv assumption—a technopolitical tool used to frame human–radionuclide relationality in the aftermath of Tokyo Electric Power Company's (TEPCO's) Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant disaster in 2011. Pairing Callon's (1998: 264) “logic of framing/overflowing” with sensibilities from the field of feminist material semiotics, the analysis illuminates how a desire to contain public unrest incited by radiological overflows while simultaneously advancing nuclear weapons and nuclear energy programs has led to the formation of the transnational nuclear assemblage—a vast assemblage of scientists, institutional actors, texts, technopolitical tools, etc.—which translates radiological overflows into dominant scientific frameworks for quantifying and regulating human–radionuclide relationality. Exploring the technopolitical nature of the transnational nuclear assemblage's 100 mSv assumption, the analysis highlights how this assumption participates in enacting a firm, yet flexible frame for containing the messy heterogeneity of ‘low-level’—under 100mSv—human–radionuclide relationality, as well as in marginalizing democratic and scientific debate. The paper ends with a reflection on the contingency of the transnational nuclear assemblage's framing project, and on other opportunities for attending to the complex socio-materiality of human–radionuclide relationality, particularly at low-levels of exposure. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aimed to understand the contributions of active ADHD symptoms and the diagnostic label of ADHD in yielding negative attitudes and social distance ratings. Using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (n = 305), respondents were assigned to read a vignette about: (a) a typically developing child, (b) a child with active ADHD symptoms and (c) a child with active ADHD symptoms + diagnostic label. Participants were then asked to answer questions about their beliefs and feelings about the child in the vignette. The active ADHD symptom condition predicted higher levels of social distance, and this link was mediated by negative and animalistic adjective ratings, and by angry emotions felt by the participants after reading the vignettes. Our findings suggest that ADHD symptoms drive negative views and social distance and that an ADHD label may serve as a protective factor to help people overcome biases related to childhood ADHD. ADHD symptom literacy and contact with children with varying levels of ADHD symptoms may be an important target to help reduce negative attitudes. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - When the leader of a firm commits a professional transgression, how would customers’ judgments of the transgressor's professional performance and immorality differ from those of noncustomers’? This research answers this question by investigating factors that explain the discrepancy in moral judgments between noncustomers and customers affiliated with the firm of a transgressing leader. Drawing on construal level theory, our two experimental studies consistently demonstrate that relative to high social distance (i.e., noncustomers), low social distance (i.e., customers) leads to more positive judgments of the transgressor's professional performance, but differences in the social distance do not directly lead to disparities in judgments of immorality. Social distance, however, affects both performance and immorality judgments when mediating mechanisms (conscious and nonconscious moral reasoning) are accounted for, such that low social distance indirectly influences customers to be more lenient in not only their performance judgments but also their immorality judgments. This research contributes to the topic of morality that permeates the current discourse on ethical business transgressions and, in particular, to an understanding of specific mechanisms that guide consumers’ moral judgments. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Trust may be important in shaping public attitudes to genetics and intentions to participate in genomics research and big data initiatives. As such, we examined trust in data sharing among the general public. A cross-sectional online survey collected responses from representative publics in the USA, Canada, UK and Australia (n = 8967). Participants were most likely to trust their medical doctor and less likely to trust other entities named. Company researchers were least likely to be trusted. Low, Variable and High Trust classes were defined using latent class analysis. Members of the High Trust class were more likely to be under 50 years, male, with children, hold religious beliefs, have personal experience of genetics and be from the USA. They were most likely to be willing to donate their genomic and health data for clinical and research uses. The Low Trust class were less reassured than other respondents by laws preventing exploitation of donated information. Variation in trust, its relation to areas of concern about the use of genomic data and potential of legislation are considered. These findings have relevance for efforts to expand genomic medicine and data sharing beyond those with personal experience of genetics or research participants. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - In an effort to bridge the scientist–practitioner gap in the employee selection, some researchers have advocated telling stories to better communicate the value of evidence-based hiring practices to human resource (HR) professionals. In this paper, we conducted two experiments that examine the efficacy of storytelling for overcoming managers’ resistance to use structured job interviews. In two experiments, we found that participants who read a story regarding the effectiveness of structured interviews, as opposed to receiving evidence-based advice, reported more favorable attitudes toward structured job interviews. Serial mediation analysis revealed that the observed attitude change was mediated by an increase in narrative transportation and reduction in counterarguing. Implications for using stories in communicating the value of evidence-based HR practices are discussed. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: The current study addresses how sexualizing online media practices, i.e., exposure to sexually explicit internet material and receiving negative appearance feedback on social media, relate to the acceptance of sexist attitudes among adolescents. Specifically, it extends previous research on the acceptance of rape myths by exploring a construct related to these beliefs, i.e., resistance towards the metoo-movement. Methods: The study is based on a cross-sectional paper-and-pencil survey among 568 Flemish adolescents (15–18 years old, Mage = 16.4, SD = .98, 58.3% girls) that measured adolescents’ sexualizing online media use, sexist attitudes and objectification processes. Results: The results showed that exposure to sexually explicit internet material, but not receiving negative appearance feedback on social media, was related to more resistance towards the metoo-movement and the acceptance of rape myths through notions of women as sex objects. Self-objectification did not function as a valid mediator in the examined relations. Gender and self-esteem did not moderate the proposed relations. Conclusions: The findings underline the role of media use in how adolescents develop sexist beliefs and, more precisely, beliefs about contemporary actions to combat sexism, i.e., the metoo-movement. The present study showed that sexual objectification fueled by sexually explicit internet material may result in less positive attitudes and, thus, more resistance towards this movement. © 2019 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents

AB  - This research investigated associations between socially prescribed and self-orientated perfectionism, and the social functioning of 510 preteens (Mage = 11.2). The study focused on predictions from the Perfectionism Social Disconnection Model (PSDM) by determining whether rejection sensitivity and social isolation, in that sequence, mediated the associations between both perfectionism types and mental health outcomes. Employing both survey and experimental methods, findings indicated that both types of perfectionism in preadolescence were associated with increased interpersonal difficulty, rejection sensitivity and feelings of social isolation, as well as higher levels of eating disorder symptoms, depression, and anxiety. Results from serial mediation analyses found general support for the theoretical predictions of the PSDM for socially prescribed perfectionism, and extending upon previous research, for self-orientated perfectionism. The age of the sample suggests that both forms of perfectionism may be important targets in programs to prevent the development of mental health problems. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The study was conducted in Macau, a sociolinguistically diverse context with sixty-two first-year and second-year university students. Semi-structured interview was used as an instrument for data collection for this exploratory study. The students were asked questions regarding their willingness to communicate (WTC) using different varieties of English in face-to-face communication and communication in the social media contexts. The results indicate that the participants are aware of the status of English as an international language and can identify the different English varieties in Kachru's (1986) concentric circles. The participants have reported a high willingness to communicate in two standard English varieties; that is, American English and British English for face-to-face communication and social media contexts. The study has also revealed an emergence of the Chinese variety of English in that the participants hold a positive attitude towards Chinese English and are willing to use it in monolingual classrooms and in the case of out-of-class events in which the speakers share the first language and culture that Chinese English is used. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Communication plans are fundamental for the success of conservation programs, especially when dealing with alien species. In a media-saturated society the effectiveness of communication could be evaluated through the information reported by the media, as an indicator of public attitudes towards a particular issue. We evaluated the effectiveness of a communication campaign by analysing the perception of the media towards management activities to control grey squirrel populations. A media content analysis was performed to classify the news in categories regarding their attitude towards the project. A total of 166 articles were analysed, which corresponds to a mean of one article every 9 days along the 4-years project. News followed peaks of interest in specific periods, generally related with milestones of the project. Half of the negative news regarded management activities in an urban area, despite the softer management approach adopted, with surgical sterilization of animals instead of their euthanasia after live-trapping. A reinforcement of the communication focused in Liguria inverted the trend of negative news which decreased over time, indicating the effectiveness of communication activities. Public support is fundamental for the successful implementation of eradication and control plans. Considering the role of media in informing and driving public opinion, media monitoring is routinely included in the development of management projects. We suggest that a media content analysis can be used as a performance indicator to evaluate the communication effectiveness of conservation projects, helping to identify negative trends so to proactively react. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In lay perception, dirty work is a type of labor that degrades human dignity. Work can be perceived as dirty on three bases: social (related to the subordinate position or associated with contact with stigmatized people), physical (related to direct contact with garbage and waste), and moral (related to jobs considered sinful, dubious, or defying social norms). “Dirty” stigma makes workers objects of dehumanization and discrimination, in particular, people distance themselves from dirty workers and are not ready to help and support them. In the experimental study (N = 340), we investigated how certain types of dirty workers are dehumanized compared to nondirty workers and the indirect effect of the type of dirty work on attitudes toward the social support of dirty workers via animalistic (attribution of uniquely human traits) and the mechanistic (attribution of human nature traits) dehumanization. The results show that individuals are willing to offer more social support to a low status but not dirty worker rather than to social or moral dirty workers. At the same time, less social support is provided to nondirty than to physical dirty worker. Animalistic and mechanistic dehumanization mediates the relationship between the types of dirty work and the attitudes toward social support. In particular, less dehumanization leads to more positive attitudes toward social support. The limitations and future directions of the obtained results are discussed. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background and objectives: The fast detection of and response to threatening stimuli is an important task of the human visual and motor systems, and is especially challenging when stimuli are ambiguous. This study investigates the perception, evaluation and fast response to ambiguous natural spider stimuli in spider-fearful and non-anxious participants. Methods: Stimuli were created by gradually morphing natural images of spiders and non-spiders (a crab, a starfish, a bunch of keys, and a flower). In Study 1, participants rated the images on perceptual and emotional dimensions and responded to them in a response priming task to measure rapid information processing. In Study 2, results were validated and extended in a different paradigm by using a go/no-go task. Results: As expected, spider-fearful participants showed an interpretative bias for ambiguous stimuli (i.e., perceived them as more similar to spiders) and rated spider(-like) stimuli as more unpleasant, arousing, and disgusting. In Study 1, spider stimuli were preferentially processed in spider-fearful participants as observed in faster responses to spider targets–however, responses were not different to comparison participants for ambiguous stimuli. Study 2 suggests that this finding can be explained by differences in stimulus duration. Limitations: No participants with positive attitudes towards spiders or a second fearful comparison group were included. Conclusions: We suggest that these findings can be explained by the nature of the applied tasks that tap into early phases of visual processing, thereby relying on feedforward-mediated low-spatial-frequency information extracted via the fast, subcortical path to the amygdala. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Patient safety is regarded as a global problem by which both developed and developing worlds are affected. It is defined as avoidance and prevention of patient injuries or adverse events, which could result during health care delivery. This study aimed to identify physicians’ knowledge, influence, and attitude toward patient’s safety in the faculty of medicine, Cairo university. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 187 postgraduate physicians of different specialties working in the faculty of medicine, Cairo University. Anonymous self-administered questionnaires were distributed. The questionnaire is one of a series of tools designed for evaluation of the pilot implementation of the World Health Organization patient safety curriculum for medical schools. Results: Calculated attitude score was relatively higher than influence, then knowledge score (median scores were 4.25, 3.1, and 2.5 respectively). There was no difference in knowledge, attitude, and influence scores by different personal characteristics as gender, specialty, workplace, graduation year except for higher influence score among physician who received in patient safety (p = 0.016). There was a weak positive significant correlation between knowledge and influence scores and between influence and attitude scores (r = 0.25, p = 0.002; r = 0.27, p < 0.001 respectively). Conclusion: Higher patient safety positive attitude than influence and knowledge is pinpointed in physicians of different specialties in the faculty of medicine, Cairo University. This raises the attention to the importance of implementation of continuing patient safety education programs. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The ageing population is increasing, and negative attitudes towards older people are all too common and largely overlooked. However, little research has examined how ageist, prejudice, and discrimination, that often occur in healthcare settings, impact the community's perceptions of entering Residential Aged Care (RAC) in the future. In particular, studies have not investigated how contact with RAC influences individuals’ attitudes towards RAC facilities, residents and staff. This study is the first to examine individuals’ resistance towards living in RAC using the contact hypothesis, a theory of prejudice reduction. Aims: To explore how positive or negative contact with RAC residents and staff impacts individuals’ behavioural intentions towards entering RAC in the future. To examine whether perceptions of trust, independence and RAC staff mediate the relationship between contact and behavioural intentions towards entering RAC in the future. Design: A cross-sectional survey design. Method: Data were collected via online surveys using contact (positive or negative), trust, independence, perceptions of RAC staff and resistance levels (mild refusal or extreme refusal) measures. Participants (n = 373) from Australia and USA were recruited using social media, word of mouth and Amazons Mechanical Turk. Findings: Individuals who experienced negative contact with RAC residents and staff were more likely to report intense resistance to RAC, “I would rather die than enter RAC”. Whereas, positive contact with RAC residents and staff was associated with reductions in the adverse appraisal of RAC staff; a diminished perception that individuals lost their independence, and an increased trust in RAC residents, facilities and staff. Participants from USA reported greater levels of resistance towards RAC in comparison with participants from Australia. This study demonstrates how interactions with RAC residents, facilities and staff are critical in shaping attitudes towards RAC. Implications for practice: It is recommended that the public are exposed to opportunities where they can experience positive contact with RAC. RAC facilities can promote interaction between the public and RAC residents through encouraging participation in community partnership programs/intergenerational programs. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - We apply a mixed-method design centred on the deployment of metaphors to explore the role that language plays in the structuring of the public discourses of unconventional hydrocarbon development (UHD) across three major developed economies. We analyse UHD-related metaphorical devices deployed in broadsheet newspapers in Australia, the UK and the USA between January 2006 and May 2018. We develop an innovative Type Hierarchy Approach to metaphors by mapping through directed graph hierarchies. These allow concept-mapping analysis in terms of supertypes and subtypes, i.e. concepts ordered in terms of generality and inclusion as in “rapid expansion” → “explosion”. We find two broad discourses, each containing metaphorical constructions: economic gain across temporal horizons (incorporating boom, bonanza, revolution and death metaphors); and risk tolerance and decision-making (incorporating gamble and insanity metaphors). At the level of individual metaphors, deployment trends and patterns can be mapped along country borders rather than for example political alignment. Boom and bonanza appear most widespread in the USA, whereas UHD as a revolution is more closely associated with UK newspapers. Over time, UHD-related metaphor use decreases in all three countries, potentially reflecting an increasing public acceptance of UHD and moving shale gas from unconventional to conventional hydrocarbon development. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Smart mobile devices are widely used for dealing with information on education and provide entertainment at home and school. Mobile applications (apps) directed towards young aged children have changed the digital media landscape for infants and toddlers. Parents’ preferences and beliefs towards technology has a major role in toddlers’ and infants’ use of technology as they directly affect the quality and the quantity of digital media available to them especially at home. It is, therefore, crucial to understand how parents perceive the changes imposed by smart screen technologies upon their children's development; their diverse beliefs, and practices. To date, in Greece, few studies have examined the use of smart screen technologies among young children especially at home. This study presents the main findings from a research conducted with 293 families in Greece between September 2018 and November 2018. It reports on parents’ perceptions regarding children's usage of smart mobile technologies both at the home and the kindergarten context. The study results show that most of the parents have positive attitudes towards the use of these technologies. Parents want to support their children's learning and seek to provide a stimulating home learning environment for them. Parents’ answers seem to differentiate depending on socioeconomic background, age and education. Older and less-educated parents seem unable to adapt appropriately to rapid technological progress and thus cannot effectively exploit the advantages that mobile learning technologies have to offer to children. On the contrary, younger parents or parents with a higher education level seem to more easily adapt to the new conditions striving to develop a better learning environment at home. However, the positive parents’ attitudes about mobile learning are hampered by the lack of the knowledge about the choice of apps with ‘substantial educational value’ as well as their use, particularly in the domestic environment. We anticipate that the findings from this study would provide valuable information for early childhood researchers, stakeholders and teachers leading to better learning digital experiences and even better outcomes for young aged children. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Exemplification research has consistently shown effects of vox pops’ exemplars on audience judgments, whereby people tend to follow the opinion of a few fellow citizens. In this study, we gain some insight into why—and especially for whom—ordinary citizens are such influential “opinion-givers.” Importantly, we look at populist attitudes as a potential moderator for exemplification effects by comparing news reports containing vox pops with purely journalistic news reports providing the same arguments. In a web-based experiment, we show that both perceptual and persuasive effects are moderated by participants’ populist attitudes, and thus, their resonance with the “voice of the people.”. © 2019 AEJMC.

AB  - In this study, we explored vagally-mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV) responses, a psychophysiological index of cognitive self-regulatory control, to map the dynamics associated with empathic responses for pain towards an out-group member. Accordingly, Caucasian participants were asked to judge the experience of African and Caucasian actors touched with either a neutral or a harmful stimulus. Results showed that (1) explicit judgment of pain intensity in African actors yielded higher rating score and (2) took longer time compared to Caucasian actors, (3) these behavioural outcomes were associated with a significant increment of RMSSD, Log-HF-HRV and HF-HRV n.u., (4) resting HF-HRV n.u. predicted the participants’ lag-time to judge painful stimulations delivered to African actors. Interestingly, these dynamics were associated with a measure of implicit racial attitudes and were, in part, abolished when participants performed a concurrent task during videos presentation. Taken together our results support the idea that a cognitive effort is needed to self-regulate our implicit attitude as predicted by the ‘Contrasting Forces Model’. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Social exclusion is a painful experience associated with a variety of psychosocial and behavioral outcomes from childhood to adulthood. The purpose of the current study is to explore the mediation role of resilience and self-esteem in the relationship between social exclusion and life satisfaction in high school adolescents. The sample comprised 1172 students enrolling in grades of 9–12 in four public schools in an urban city of Turkey. Of the 52.7% participants were female and 47.3% of them were male with ages ranged between 14 and 19 years (M = 15.91, SD = 1.25). Results of the analyses showed negative and significant relationships between social exclusion and life satisfaction, self-esteem and resilience. Moreover, there were positive and significant relationships between resilience, life satisfaction and self-esteem. Findings of structural equation model revealed that social exclusion directly predicted resilience and self-esteem. Social exclusion predicted life satisfaction by the mediation of resilience and self-esteem. These outcomes indicated that resilience and self-esteem mediated the relationship between social exclusion and life satisfaction in adolescents. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Neuroscientists who have studied bullying have primarily focused on the psychopathology of diagnosable offenders or the resulting symptomatology of victimization. Less attention has been given to theories that suggest that bullying may be an interpersonal strategy. In an exploratory study, we recruited a sample of adolescents (N = 24) who engaged in high rates of delinquent behavior and collected self-report ratings of bullying behaviors. During an fMRI scan, adolescents observed instances of social exclusion and social inclusion. The adolescents’ self-reported bullying was associated with greater ventral striatum, amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and insula activation when viewing social exclusion > social inclusion. Activation in these regions is commonly associated with reward-learning, salience monitoring, and motivational processes, suggesting that bullies show altered processing of interpersonal cues and social dynamic experiences in their environment. Our findings highlight the need for developmental neuroscientists to further explore the role of social motivation in processing socio-affective information, with a particular focus on goal-directed antisocial behavior. © 2019, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.

AB  - This study was designed to investigate the effect of victimization experiences and peer influence on delinquency via one's attitude toward the police. It was hypothesized that negative attitudes toward the police would mediate the prospective relationships between victimization and offending and between peer delinquency and offending. Participants were 2,623 early adolescents from the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) study, a 6-wave longitudinal survey conducted between 1995 and 1999. The research design consisted of 2 independent variables (victimization and peer delinquency) measured at Wave 2, 1 mediator variable (negative attitudes toward the police) measured at Wave 3, and 1 dependent variable (participant delinquency) measured at Wave 4. Multiple regression and negative binomial path analyses revealed significant indirect effects running from violent victimization to negative attitudes toward the police to participant delinquency and from peer delinquency to negative attitudes toward the police to participant delinquency. The results of this study indicate that both violent victimization and peer delinquency contribute to participant delinquency, in part, by encouraging the formation of negative attitudes toward the police. It is speculated that violent victimization may increase negative attitudes toward the police by arousing distress and feelings of vulnerability, whereas peer delinquency may increase negative attitudes through instruction, observation, and other forms of social learning. © 2019 American Psychological Association.

AB  - The greatest proportion of new HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) is occurring among young Black MSM (YBMSM) ages 13–24. Consequently, research is needed to understand the psychosocial pathways that influence HIV risk and resilience in YBMSM. Minority Stress Theory proposes that the stigma, prejudice, and discrimination facing sexual and racial minorities are chronic stressors that lead to increased engagement in risk behaviors. The present study examined whether minority stress is associated with stimulant use and sexual risk behaviors by depleting psychosocial resilience. We recruited 1817 YBMSM, ages 18–29, from multiple venues in two major cities in Texas for participation in a brief survey. Results from structural equation modeling indicated that decreased resilience partially mediated the association of minority stress with sexual risk behavior. Resilience was also negatively associated with stimulant use. Interventions focused on cultivating psychosocial resilience could mitigate the deleterious consequences of minority stress and reduce stimulant use in YBMSM. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Feeling alone and not connected to other people where you live affects many people and especially people with a learning disability. The government and the newspapers are talking a lot about this, they want to understand who is affected and what can be done. Our group did a research project to find out some of the things that stop us getting involved in local places with local people where we can make and keep friends. The people in the research project mainly lived independently and did not use learning disability services, so needed to use local community organisations. Pictorial cards, made by one of the group members, using photographs were used to sort out all the things we talked about into groups. These included transport, fear and anxiety, limits on our choice and control, risks and personal safety. We then talked about what could be done, this included more easy read information, so people know what is available locally, more support to go to places and advocacy to get involved. There also needs to be better community safety including more Safe Places in the community. Abstract: Background Social isolation is an issue that affects many people and especially people with a learning disability. There is an association between social exclusion and feeling lonely, an issue currently highlighted as a growing concern which needs to be addressed both in the media and by the government. Methods The Building Bridges Research Group do inclusive research projects about the issues that are important to them. Over the summer of 2018, the research group undertook an inclusive research project to identify some of the specific barriers that prevent community inclusion and the opportunity to develop friends. The people involved mainly lived independently and did not use learning disability services, with the exception of evening clubs, so needed to use universal services. Results Pictorial cards, made by one of the group, using photographs were used to organise the data into themes. These included transport, fear and anxiety, limits on choice and control, risks and personal safety. Conclusion The inclusive research design enabled people with a learning disability to contribute to all stages of the research project, from identifying the issue, gathering data, the analysis and writing up. They also made suggestions of ways to increase social networks, friendships and well-being and so decrease loneliness. These include more access to easy read information, more support and advocacy and measures to address community safety including a wider roll-out of the Safe Places scheme. There also needs to be further research undertaken with other people with a learning disability in different areas to widen the understanding of the impact of these barriers on people's lives. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Issues related to ethnic-cultural diversity often make the news headlines in popular media and have attracted extensive attention in the political arena, as well as in academic research in psychology, political sciences, and sociology. Political scientist Robert Putnam reported that increased diversity is associated with a range of negative outcomes, including less trust, a decreased sense of community, more prejudice, and more cynicism and mistrust toward politics and politicians. Yet given that follow-up studies have often revealed mixed results, a novel approach to understanding the effects of diversity is needed. Here, we address the impact of diversity from a Person × Context interaction perspective, demonstrating that diversity aggravates the negative attitudes that already exist among certain individuals. Specifically, we review the accumulated evidence showing that people high in authoritarian attitudes are particularly sensitive to diversity and prone to react with increased negativity to out-groups, politicians, the political system, and democracy. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - In current American political discourse, individuals tend to mistakenly conflate being an undocumented immigrant with being Latinx. This conflation puts Latinxs who are legal residents or citizens (Latinx-Americans) at risk of being negatively impacted by policies intended to deter undocumented immigrants. We examine whether being the target of anti-immigration policies would lead Latinx-Americans to politically engage on behalf of undocumented immigrants. Study 1 found that when Latinx-Americans were led to believe that what happens to undocumented immigrants will affect them personally (linked fate), those who were primed with greater conflation of the two groups expressed more positive attitudes toward undocumented immigrants and other Latinxs. Study 2 found that this pattern of effects extended to the willingness to engage in collective action on behalf of undocumented immigrants. Study 2 also examined the role of emotions (anger and fear) in mediating the relationship between the conflation of Latinxs with undocumented immigrants and collective action intentions. Together, the findings shed light on how current immigration policies affect relations among key subgroups within the Latinx community and the conditions under which Latinx-Americans will mobilize on behalf of undocumented immigrants. © 2019 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - Fitbits may be useful in tracking changes in physical activity during chemotherapy. Sixty-five patients with breast cancer were given Fitbits at the start of chemotherapy, but adherence to wearing the Fitbit was low, with mean number of valid days across the 9-month study period of 44.5%. Interventions to increase wear are likely necessary in the active treatment setting. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
Background: Many patients’ activity levels decrease during chemotherapy. Wearable devices, such as Fitbits, track activity patterns and may encourage behavior change. This study aimed to determine the utility of using Fitbits to measure physical activity and sleep throughout chemotherapy. Patients and Methods: Patients with early stage breast cancer were enrolled prior to starting chemotherapy. Patients received a Fitbit Charge HR and were instructed to wear it and sync at least weekly throughout chemotherapy and up to 6 months post therapy. Patients completed baseline surveys, and treatment information was collected from their medical records. Fitbit data was downloaded from the Fitabase data management platform. To assess utility, we evaluated how many days patients wore their Fitbit for at least 10 hours. Results: Adherence to wearing the Fitbit was low, with 16.9% of patients never syncing their device. For those who did sync, the mean number of valid days (> 10 hours of use) across the 9-month study period was 44.5% (SD, 36.9%), and the median was 39.6%, with a range of 0% to 100% of the total study days. Adherence was higher among participants receiving adjuvant chemotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy (51.9% vs. 29.6% valid days, respectively [P = .037]). Baseline questions indicating positive attitudes toward technology were significantly correlated with higher adherence. Conclusions: Fitbit use during breast cancer chemotherapy was poor in the absence of prompts to encourage wear. Interventions including phone calls, texts, or other reminders to maintain adherence are likely necessary to increase wear in active treatment settings. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The aim of the article is to contribute to an understanding of the attitudes of post-communist Europe’s inhabitants towards gambling, and of their opinions concerning which activities can be regarded as gambling. The Attitudes Towards Gambling Scale (ATGS-8) questionnaire was used in the survey, ensuring the international comparability of the results. For the subsequent in-depth analysis of attitudes we mainly used multidimensional statistical methods. The survey, conducted in 2017, had 1092 respondents. The least negative attitudes to gambling were found in the younger age groups, while the attitudes of senior citizens were the most negative. Concerning participation in gambling, 68.4% of the respondents had taken part in at least one of the range of gambling activities offered as choices. Participation in gambling is an important factor influencing the overall attitude of the respondents to gambling. Of equal importance was the range of intensity in their perceptions of which games can be considered to be gambling, with four similarly perceived types of gambling identified. The research shows that gambling is perceived negatively by the population of the Czech Republic. The explanation may be found in the substantial media coverage of gambling related to changes in the legislation and the tightening of restrictions. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Precise coupling of spatially separated intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) producing and ATP-consuming exerts a key role in bioenergetic balance, and the phosphoryl transfer network, catalyzed by creatine kinase (CK), adenylate kinase (AK), and pyruvate kinase (PK), is fundamental in energetic homeostasis of tissues with high-energy requirements, as the branchial tissue. This whole system is very sensitive, and our hypothesis is that it can be altered in cases of infectious diseases in fish, such as that caused by the oomycete Saprolegnia parasitica. The effects of S. parasitica infection on gills remain poorly understood and limited only to histopathological studies. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether natural infection by S. parasitica impairs the enzymes of the phosphoryl transfer network in gills of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), as well as the pathways involved in this inhibition. In this study, we used sick carp and compared to healthy carp, fish of similar age and receiving the same feed, but allocated in different tanks. Branchial CK (cytosolic and mitochondrial) activity and ATP levels decreased in infected fish compared to uninfected on day 7 post-infection (PI), while no significant difference was observed between groups regarding branchial AK and PK activities. Branchial sodium-potassium ion pump (Na+, K+-ATPase) activity decreased in infected carp compared to uninfected on day 7 PI, while reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels were higher. Gill histopathology revealed massive necrosis, loss of branchial epithelium, and detachment of the epithelium interlayer with structural loss of secondary lamellae. Based on these data, the impairment of CK activity elicited by S. parasitica caused an impairment in branchial energetic homeostasis, reducing the ATP availability in the gills and provoking an impairment on Na+, K+-ATPase activity. Moreover, the inhibition on CK activity appears to be mediated by ROS overproduction and lipid peroxidation, which contribute to disease pathogenesis linked to branchial tissue. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This article introduces a special issue critically investigating contemporary formations of digital game labor, with a focus on the political-economic forces, social inequalities, and technological dynamics mutually shaping these formations. Accounts of game industry practices have been at the forefront of efforts within media studies to document and theorize conditions and transformations of labor under digital capitalism. The study of digital game labor has tended to cluster around four areas of inquiry: below-the-line labor, the creative labor of game development, player-production, and game labor politics. Providing empirically informed portraits of diverse contexts and experiences of gamework, this issue interrogates multiple dimensions of precarious work and social exclusion within an industry whose playful self-image can make it a resistant object of labor-centered analysis. The contributors to this issue promote a research orientation that is attentive to how work in the digital game industry might be made more accessible and sustainable. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Introduction: While the popularity of pedal-assist electric bikes (eBikes) generally is growing, electric-mountain bikes (eMTB) have not received a warm welcome by many within the mountain biking community. Anecdotally, a variety of concerns have been raised concerning eMTB use, including trail damage, trail conflict, decreased trail access, and the perception that eMTB use is not “real” mountain biking or is “cheating.” Method: This qualitative study involved extracting and thematically analyzing discussion thread comments about eMTBs among nine mountain biking Facebook pages, Results: Three predominant themes emerged: What is an eMTB?, Trails, and How should eMTBs be used? There was general confusion about the features and capabilities of eMTBs except by those who had previously used one. Commenters expressed concern over a variety of trail-related issues, including that eMTBs will damage trails similar to the way motorized vehicles do and that they could cause restricted access to some trail systems. There were inconsistent opinions on the use of eMTBs, where some comments saw riding mountain bikes as a “rite of passage” and that using an eMTB was “cheating”. There was some level of acknowledgement that eMTBs may be useful for promoting exercise, but this was mediated by the “rite of passage” belief. Discussion: These findings confirm general attitudes around eMTBs including fears, concerns, and prejudices. This study includes insights that will be useful in efforts to promote eMTBs for recreation, a tool to increase levels of physical activity, and in discussing potential conflicts about trail use. © 2019, Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Two research objectives underlay the present research. First, we tested how frustrated psychological needs caused by the refugee-influx influence the endorsement and selection of refugee-relevant information. Second, we tested how information selection processes contribute to the development of exclusionary attitudes that counteract the integration of refugees into host countries. In a laboratory study (n = 181), frustrated psychological needs decreased participants’ endorsement of a refugee-friendly essay (vs. a control essay). Additionally, frustrated needs led to a biased selection of refugee-hostile over refugee-friendly information and such selection biases, in turn, predicted higher levels of ingroup defense and prejudice toward refugees. The findings imply that host societies’ receptiveness to refugees is influenced by the maintenance of basic psychological needs. © 2019 The Authors European Journal of Social Psychology Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The media plays a crucial role in highlighting the important facts the public should know by selecting, broadcasting, and emphasizing what events the public should classify and comprehend as important and what the public should assess as a threat (Slone Journal of Conflict Resolution 44(4): 508-522, 2000, Papacharissi and de Fatima Oliveira The International Journal of Press/Politics 13(1): 52-74, 2008). This paper explores the notion that the media reinforces a false synonym between Muslims and terrorism. I begin with a description of news framing bias and how this bias impacts the portrayal of terrorism and Muslims through politically and emotionally charged discourse. Then, through a content analysis of local and national news articles, I examine selected terrorist events in France and Turkey, analyzing the U.S media’s portrayal of these events to uncover what elements journalists select, emphasize, and deemphasize in countries with predominantly Muslim and non-Muslim populations. This analysis is useful in uncovering the mechanisms allowing U.S perception of perceived threat to rise in tandem with U.S national security’s placement on the current policy agenda, while the actual risks posed by terrorism and Muslim populations are marginal in comparison and continue to decline (Powell Communication Studies 62(1): 90-112, 2011). The findings suggest that news media framing utilizes biased, negative imagery, portraying the events in these countries in a way that reinforces current prejudices against Muslims, even when Muslims are themselves the victims. This unequal reporting increases viewership while simultaneously allowing current perceptions about terrorism and Muslims to continue. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Recent advancements in the development of information and communication technologies have revolutionized risk and crisis communication. This research explored how social media facilitates information seeking, interpretation, and dissemination during extreme weather. Using Twitter data collected during a tornado-warned storm, this study explored the activity of different actor groups. The findings demonstrate that weather professionals and weather enthusiasts acted as “key stewards” who facilitated discussion during the event. Citizens engaged in the dialogue predominately by retweeting and by sharing personal observations of the storm. The results highlight the usefulness of Twitter for the propagation of both official and unofficial storm-related information. This study also supports previous research that suggests that tweet activity may be a reliable indicator of public attention. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - This study investigated the influence of television consumption patterns on changes in attitudes toward depicted social out-groups. Participants were randomly assigned to view six episodes of Amazon’s Transparent, a comedy-drama program about a family whose father comes out as a transgender woman, in either one 3-hr (“binge-watching”) session or six weekly half-hour (“appointment-viewing”) sessions. Across both groups, we found exposure to the narrative reduced anti-transgender prejudice. Counter to the predictions of the extended elaboration likelihood model and the entertainment overcoming resistance model, however, improvement in prejudice toward transgender people was not predicted by narrative or character involvement. Rather, reduction in prejudice was an outcome of viewing condition, such that those who viewed the program on a schedule of one episode per week exhibited lower levels of postexposure prejudice than those who binge-watched, and their attitudinal changes were more persistent 3 weeks later. Results are discussed in the context of the original elaboration likelihood model, proposing mechanisms for further testing. © 2019 AEJMC.

AB  - Objective: This article explores how the Millennial Generation identity—the shared values and experiences of young adults (born between 1980 and 1997)—affects political polarization of climate change belief, specifically how it mediates the relationship between party affiliation and educational attainment. Method: To test this, an interaction between Millennial*Republican*education is estimated, using data from an original national survey administered in 2015. Results: Millennials are more likely to believe in the evidence of climate change and its anthropogenic causes than older adults of their same party affiliation. Unlike older adults, the most educated Millennials are not the most likely to adhere to political party stance; rather, it is among the least educated Millennials that party sorting is most evident. Conclusion: The Millennial Generation identity is meaningful for understanding political attitudes. Important distinctions exist between Millennials and older adults in the evaluation of climate change opinion and related policies. © 2019 by the Southwestern Social Science Association

AB  - We use data from SHARE (The Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe) in Austria to investigate attitudes towards new technologies in information and communication technology. The technologies can significantly facilitate the daily lives of an ageing population. In Austria, in wave 6 in 2015, an additional paper-and-pencil questionnaire was implemented which asked details about attitudes towards different technological innovations. From these questions, we develop a binary attitude score which indicates positive attitudes towards new technologies. In probit estimations, the attitude score is related to different demographic and health variables. Our main results indicate that strong gender differences in attitudes towards new technologies exist: men value communication and entertainment devices more, whereas women’s attitudes are more positive towards devices that include a specific health or support value. Furthermore, while older cohorts value entertainment devices less than younger ones, no such pattern exists for health and support systems. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - With news pushed to smart phones in real time and social media reactions spreading across the globe in seconds, the public discussion can appear accelerated and temporally fragmented. In longitudinal datasets across various domains, covering multiple decades, we find increasing gradients and shortened periods in the trajectories of how cultural items receive collective attention. Is this the inevitable conclusion of the way information is disseminated and consumed? Our findings support this hypothesis. Using a simple mathematical model of topics competing for finite collective attention, we are able to explain the empirical data remarkably well. Our modeling suggests that the accelerating ups and downs of popular content are driven by increasing production and consumption of content, resulting in a more rapid exhaustion of limited attention resources. In the interplay with competition for novelty, this causes growing turnover rates and individual topics receiving shorter intervals of collective attention. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - This article will address two major related issues regarding Arab culture as an integral part of the globalization ethos. In order to expand the conceptual parameters of globalization and cultural studies, the exclusivity of political and economic globalization will be interrogated in favor of a more diverse, humanitarian definition of the term. At the heart of this argument, inflected by interdisciplinarity and the literature and theory of postcolonial studies, is tolerance, respect, and recognition of difference and for the marginalized voices of the "other." The theoretical framework challenges the stereotyping, homogenization, and misrepresentation of Arabs, colonialist ideas that have been carried over into the practice of globalism and the marginalization of Arab history and culture within world heritage. It is my hope to correct the negative perceptions about the Arab people, mainstream misperceptions of politicians, the media, and public discourse. The article will underscore the diversity and complexity of the identity and history of people in the Middle East and North Africa. Although in the West Arabs are usually synonymous with Muslims, a discussion of Islam and/or Islamophobia will not be addressed in this article. The first part will elaborate on the historical context of the creation of the modern Arab world. Next, various definitions of the main domains of globalism and their correlation to the contemporary Arab world will be summarized. Integrated into both sections are two major issues: The creative resistance that has accompanied the founding of the modern Arab world and the impact of globalization on Arab society, concepts that have played out in the containment of this region. © 2019 Arab Studies Quarterly.

AB  - The current research focuses on the role of both physical and virtual environments in facilitating subtle and blatant prejudice reduction of the Jewish majority toward the Arab minority in Israel. This research was conducted through an online survey of 450 Jewish students who use digital media daily. Virtual contact and exposure to negative content about Arabs on digital media were found to reduce subtle prejudice. We found that face-to-face contact reduces both types of prejudice, whereas the effect of traditional media was not found. © 2019 AEJMC.

AB  - This study examines how frequently committed ethical misconduct regarding values closely aligned to an organizational mission affects stakeholders’ pro-organizational responses to an offending nonprofit. Using a 2 × 2 experimental survey, findings showed that ethical misconduct in primary values resulted in significantly decreased positive attitudes toward and donation intentions to the organization. Also, the patterns of unethical behaviors significantly increased stakeholders’ negative attitudes toward the organization and willingness to assign the organization responsibility for unethical behavior. Perceived organizational responsibility for ethical misconduct and deteriorating organization–public relationships (OPRs) were significant mediators for the effects of primary ethical violations. © 2019 AEJMC.

AB  - Five experiments (N = 2,251) and a meta-analysis examine how group labels shape Americans’ levels of prejudice, behavioral intentions, and policy preferences toward immigrants living in the US without authorization. These studies extend research documenting how the perceived negativity of group labels (e.g., those describing gay people) affects people’s downstream attitudes. To this end, Study 1 examines the perceived negativity of the five most commonly used labels to describe unauthorized immigrants. Study 2 found that relatively negative (vs. neutral) labels (e.g., illegal aliens vs. noncitizens) engendered more prejudice, punitive behavioral intentions, and greater support for punitive policies. Study 3 replicates these effects and examines the role of familiarity. People who personally knew members of the group were more positive towards them overall, but were nevertheless susceptible to the labels’ influence. Studies 4 and 5 provide additional replications and explore prejudice as a mediator of behavioral intentions and policy preferences. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - This study assessed consumers' initial reactions to in-feed native ads appearing as news content. In particular, it focuses on consumers' recognition of advertising when they realize that content they had thought were news stories had in fact been advertising. Recognition of advertising made consumers infer that advertisers had deliberately manipulated them. Consequently, consumers engaged less with the message, had less positive attitudes toward the brand, and were less likely to purchase and share. The results demonstrated the mechanisms through which the two mediators, manipulative intent and message engagement, lowered brand attitude, purchase intention, and sharing intention. In addition, ad disclosure made more people recognize the ad when they were exposed to it than when it was not disclosed as an ad. Copyright 2018 by The American Council on Consumer Interests

AB  - This study examines factors related to willingness to host refugees. We examined the role of national attitudes (patriotism, nationalism), out-group attitudes (classic and modern prejudice), and zero-sum thinking: Belief in a Zero-Sum Game and psychological entitlement in attitudes towards hosting refugees. We proposed including zero-sum thinking as possible mediator between national attitudes and attitudes towards refugees based on assumption that nationalism is a competitive attitude towards out-groups, while patriotism does not. Structural equation modelling based on a Polish national sample (N = 1092) revealed that patriotism is positively associated with willingness to host refugees, through its negative association with prejudice via decreasing zero-sum thinking. Nationalism was negatively associated with willingness to host refugees, through prejudice via increasing zero-sum thinking. Findings are discussed in the context of current refugee policies. © 2019 International Union of Psychological Science

AB  - The imprisonment rate in New Zealand ranks seventh among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Yet the imprisonment of Indigenous people is on par with the United States, which has the world’s highest incarceration rate. Almost 70% of the prison population in New Zealand is comprised of people racialized as non-White. In 2016, the National Government proposed to spend $2.5 billion over a 5-year period to build new prisons (1,500 prison beds) to accommodate a growing prison population. This study assessed public attitudes toward the need for more prisons and the equity of treatment of individuals within the criminal justice system. Findings from a 2016 and 2017 quantitative survey of 5,000 respondents each year revealed that roughly half of the respondents believed the proposed spending for new prisons to be extremely to somewhat necessary. A large proportion of respondents also believed Māori and Pākehā, if convicted of the same crime, are treated similarly within the criminal justice system. New Zealand scholars have critiqued news media coverage of contentious sociopolitical issues, such as crime and prisons, for employing tactics that have worked to construct a morally and culturally deficit “Other” while normalizing whiteness, rendering it invisible and raceless. This article concludes that this process masks racial disparities of individuals located within the criminal justice system and preserves the ideal that prisons are a normal function of the social landscape. © 2018 Georgia State University.

AB  - In the past few years the Western world has witnessed a rise in the popularity of right-wing political discourse promoting nationalistic and exclusionary world views. While in many countries such rhetoric has surfaced in mainstream politics only recently, in Israel, right-wing ideology has been popular for almost two decades. Explanations for this phenomenon focus on Israeli citizens' attitudinal change in the face of exposure to terrorism but largely do not account for why such ideas remain popular over the long term, even after violence subsides. In this study I examine whether the long-lasting prominence of right-wing nationalistic politics in Israel is linked to the perpetuation of right-wing ideology in popular media. Analyzing the content of more than 70,000 published books, I find that content related to the political right has increased in Israeli books after periods of terrorism, a change that has become more pronounced over the years. © 2018 The IO Foundation.

AB  - The present study explores the effects of product-focused virtual reality (VR) media type (termed virtualgraph) such as still and motion pictures, on product attitudes in terms of user attitudes, and telepresence. Two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, all 51 participants were shown product images produced by each type of media type, and the users' attitudes and telepresence were measured. Virtualgraph had the highest recorded telepresence and was associated with the most positive attitudes toward the products compared to still pictures and motion pictures. In experiment 2, which was designed to assess the delayed effects, participants were contacted via cellular phone four weeks following experiment 1. The results demonstrated that participants in the virtualgraph group maintained a more stable attitude toward the products over time compared to those in the still picture and motion picture groups. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to identify factors behind the intention to sign e-petitions, focusing on three aspects, i.e. information (argument quality), the source of information (source credibility) and personal perspective (personal relevance and altruism). Design/methodology/approach: Data collection is done by using a quantitative approach through an online questionnaire. This study involved 211 respondents who were internet users in Indonesia who had signed an e-petition. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling approach with IBM Amos version 22.0. Findings: The findings revealed that there are three factors shaping internet users’ attitudes toward e-petitions, namely, altruism, AQ and personal relevance, of which altruism was the strongest factor. Those who have a positive attitude toward e-petitions seemed to have higher intention to sign e-petitions. Additionally, we discovered that internet users believe credible e-petition initiators deliver better arguments, which drive them to sign e-petitions. Research limitations/implications: The finding related to elaboration likelihood model has revealed that not only the dual processing of central routes and peripheral routes but also the possibility of peripheral routes influencing the factors in the central route. Hence, future studies need to include the examination of this relation. Finally, altruism is identified as the major factor that influences people to sign e-petitions. Therefore, people should be aware of this factor while examining the environment that likely has voluntary aspects. Practical implications: To improve the adoption of the e-petition system, it is important for the e-petition websites to maintain attitude factors to achieve the e-petition goals. It is also important that e-petition websites provide credibility information of the e-petition initiators and make it visible to everyone. The e-petition sites must be able to be personalized so that users can be categorized based on their profiles or interests. Finally, as altruism is the most influencing factor in shaping internet users’ attitude toward e-petitions, e-petition initiators need to write a persuasive and arousing information and images for their e-petition. Some templates, tips or even online training to persuasive public petitions also need to be provided. Originality/value: This study attempts to fill the research gap by examining factors from three domains, i.e. information source (the e-petitioners), information/AQ and personal perspective (personal motivation) of the e-petition signers. The authors enrich the research model with altruism factors that influence attitude in signing petitions. This study illustrates the characteristic of Indonesian internet user’s and provides important implications for how the e-petitions site should improve the functionality of the sites. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Previous studies have suggested that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is involved in the social cognition that plays an important role in gender stereotypes, but the specific causal effect of the mPFC remains controversial. In this study, we aimed to use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to identify a direct link between the mPFC and gender bias. Implicit stereotypes were measured by the gender implicit association test (IAT), and explicit prejudice was measured by the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI). We found that male and female participants had different behavioral and neural correlates of gender stereotypes. Anodal tDCS significantly reduced male participants’ gender D-IAT scores compared with cathodal and sham stimulation, while the stimulation had an insignificant effect in female participants. The reduction in male participants’ gender bias mainly resulted from a decrease in the difference in reaction time (RT) between congruent and incongruent blocks. Regarding the explicit bias measurement, male and female participants had distinct attitudes, but tDCS had no effect on ASI. Our results revealed that the mPFC played a causal role in controlling implicit gender stereotypes, which is consistent with previous observations and complements past lesion, neuroimaging, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies and suggests that males and females have different neural bases for gender stereotypes. © Copyright © 2019 Wang, Wang, Guo, Ye, Lu, Luo and Zheng.

AB  - Purpose: Several research models have been proposed in the existing literature to understand the intention to use Islamic banking where conventional bank customers are not primarily addressed. Upon measuring the level of Islamic financial literacy (IFL) among the customers of conventional banks in the UAE, the purpose of this paper is to examine the direct and indirect effects of IFL, awareness, cost and benefit, reputation and attitude towards Islamic banking on the intention of potential customers to use Islamic banking. Design/methodology/approach: Using judgmental sampling techniques, questionnaires were distributed to working individuals who did not have accounts with Islamic banks. A total of 350 completed and usable questionnaires were received and used for further analysis. The SmartPLS 3.0 software was used to analyse the data. Findings: The results revealed that the level of IFL was high across the respondents and differed significantly as a function of gender, income level and years of work experience. The findings showed that IFL, awareness, reputation and attitude towards Islamic banking significantly influenced the intention to use Islamic banking, while cost and benefit appear not to. Interestingly, IFL was negatively correlated with the intention to use Islamic banking, but when the attitude towards Islamic banking mediated the relationship between IFL and the intention to use Islamic banking it then became positive. Research limitations/implications: Future research should consider looking at non-Muslim economies, which might be more vulnerable to IFL. In addition, a comparison between the current customers of Islamic banks and potential customers might be relevant to see whether the IFL of the current customers differs from the new customers. Practical implications: The implications of the research are twofold. First the study suggests that IFL is crucial for an Islamic bank’s potential new customers. Islamic bank managers should design and focus their policies toward enriching the knowledge of the public about Islamic banks and their products. Second, IFL alone does not lead to a higher level of intention to use Islamic banks unless there is a positive attitude towards such banks. Originality/value: To the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first studies to consider the IFL measure used in this paper. Therefore, this study will be the foundation for future research on IFL. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: Research on the health and wellbeing of retirees has tended to focus on financial security and financial planning. However, we suggest that one reason why financial security is important for retirees is that it enables social connectedness, which is critical for healthy ageing. Methods: This paper tests this hypothesis cross-sectionally (N = 3109) and longitudinally (N = 404) using a population-weighted mixed effects mediation model in two nationally representative samples of Australian retirees. Results: Analyses provide robust support for our model. Subjective financial security predicted retiree health cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Social connectedness also consistently predicted mental health and physical health, on average four times more strongly than financial security. Furthermore, social connectedness partially accounted for the protective effect of subjective financial security. Conclusions: We discuss the implications of these findings for public health, with a particular emphasis on how social connectedness can be better supported for people transitioning to retirement. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Off-site construction (OSC) has become the direction of China's construction transformation owing to the disappearance of demographic dividend and demand of environmental sustainability. Although the Chinese government has made efforts to promote OSC, its development progress remains slow. According to technology acceptance theory, the positive attitude and sufficient understanding of the public are of great significance to the advancement of new technology transformations. No relevant study has investigated people's awareness of OSC, and social media platforms provide big data for social science research. Accordingly, this study adopts web crawler technology combined with two methods of text mining, which are topic modeling and sentiment analysis, to explore public attitude toward OSC based on data collected from Sina Weibo. The research findings of this study are as follows: The attention status of the public toward OSC was greatly fluctuated but generally showed an upward tendency. The release of relevant government policies also significantly influenced the attention status of the public. What the public most concern about OSC was the building attributes and performance, such as connection issues, earthquake resistance, and waterproof property. Moreover, the Chinese public had relatively positive sentiments on OSC, and most of them expressed their interest and curiosity about OSC. The leading causes of public negative sentiments were safety issues, technical level, high prices, simplistic design and unemployment, indicating that popularization of the updated information on building performance, supportive policy and long-term significance of OSC was far from enough. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: With a disparate HIV prevalence among young men and women, high rates of teenage pregnancies and a lack of responsible fatherhood, issues of reproductive health among young people need to be urgently addressed. The aim of this research was to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding sexual and reproductive health among young men in the Bethesda Hospital catchment area of northern KwaZulu-Natal province. Methods: This observational, descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at six randomly selected high schools within the uMkhanyakude district. All grade 12 male learners ≥ 18 years completed a questionnaire regarding their reproductive health knowledge, attitudes and practices. Results: A total of 279 learners participated in the study with a median age of 20.2 years and a mean knowledge score of 63.8%. Only 28.3% of the learners showed good or excellent knowledge on basic sexual and reproductive health questions; 50.9% believed that girls say ‘no’ to sex when they mean ‘yes’, and 46.2% believed that girls were sexually aroused when dominated by a man. Some 156 (55.9%) of those who were sexually active did not know their current sexual partner's HIV status. There were significant associations between being brought up in a female-headed family and early sexual debut but not between early sexual debut and paternalistic attitudes to women. Discussion and conclusions: Basic sexual and reproductive health knowledge among the majority of participants was adequate. Patriarchal attitudes of sexual domination were prominent, and these are probably influenced by sociocultural belief systems of traditional masculinity, which are defined and dominated by men. This perpetuates gender inequality and contributes to poor sexual and reproductive health outcomes. Poor health-seeking behaviour and attitude relating to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and having concurrent multiple sexual partners, puts them and their sexual partners at risk of HIV/AIDS acquisition. Strategies need to be developed to enhance socially acceptable and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education and services among young men in this area, foster positive attitudes towards women and encourage gender-equal relationships. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - In August 2018, Denmark became the latest European country to ban the wearing of the niqab (face veil) in public. Indeed, several European countries such as France, Belgium and Austria have already implemented a ban on the wearing of the niqab in public places in these countries on the basis that the niqab is a symbol of gender oppression, Islamist fundamentalism and lack of integration. This issue has been the subject of heated media, political and public debates; however, the voices of veiled Muslim women remain unheard. Within the framework of Critical Race Feminism, the paper draws on qualitative interviews with Muslim women who wear the niqab in the United Kingdom (UK), in order to explore their views on legislation banning the wearing of the niqab in public. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article presents original user-based research concerning a Mexican European Diaspora’s use of Social Networking Sites (SNSs) for making racial and classed distinctions through the course of sharing and viewing content on their networked profiles. Bourdieu’s theoretical framework is used to address the ways in which SNSs usage fosters social capital, exclusion and displays of prejudice and discrimination. We also found useful the analysis of racial distinctions based on participants’ references to physical attributes. To illustrate the use of racial and classed distinctions, we specifically consider the use of Facebook and also of A Small World (ASW), an exclusive SNS, regarded as one of few designed for use by ‘the wealthy’ [Ruiz, 2008. “Five Social Networking Sites for the Wealthy.” Forbes. Accessed June 11, 2010. http://www.forbes.com/2008/05/02/social-networks-vip-tech-personal-cx_nr_0502style.html]. We analyse the term ‘naco’, a pejorative Mexican term commonly used to refer to vulgarity or inferiority amongst Mexican European and privileged diaspora with strong racial, classed and gendered connotations. The empirical material for this study is based on ethnographic research. Through the analysis of displayed images and text as well as well questionnaires and interviews we found tacit or explicit exclusion, discrimination and segregation through close-knit SNS networks engaged in by our participants, a Mexican privileged European diaspora. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Structural vulnerability illuminates how social positionings shape outcomes for marginalized individuals, like migrant farmworkers, who are often Latino, indigenous, and/or undocumented. Furthering scholarship on negotiating constraints, we explore how school employees (here, Migrant Advocates) broker health care access for migrant farmworker families. Ethnographic research in central Florida showed that Advocates perform similar functions as community health workers while experiencing similar dilemmas. We propose combining medical anthropological insights with the CDC’s Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child model, conceptualizing schools as an important site for families’ wellbeing, recognizing brokerage roles of staff, and offering new directions for migrant health scholars. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objective: “Consent is Sexy” (CIS) is a poster campaign incorporating sex-positive messages to promote consent and increase sexual communication among college students. We assess reactions to the campaign and associations between campaign recall and communication attitudes and behaviors. Participants: Male and female undergraduates at a Midwestern university were recruited (N = 284). Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted. t-Tests, logistic and multiple linear regressions were used to analyze the data. Results: Over half (56%) of participants recalled the campaign and reactions were positive. Students who recalled CIS had more positive attitudes towards sexual communication (p =.04) and greater perceived behavioral control (PBC; p <.01). Conclusions: Results show many students paid attention and reacted positively to CIS posters and results offer dissemination insights. Consent campaigns should continue to cultivate positive attitudes and PBC in regards to sexual communication. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Although people often are aware of the importance of adopting environmentally friendly lifestyles, they might be reluctant to do so as they believe that their actions do not make a difference (i.e. low response efficacy). Furthermore, they might experience reactance (e.g. negative attitudes) towards environmental messages that encourage them to adopt an environmentally friendly lifestyle. Therefore we experimentally tested whether it is possible to stimulate people to adopt an environmentally friendly lifestyle (i.e. recycle more clothing) by using visual impact metaphors that convey the message that old clothes deserve a new life. The findings show that a message in the form of a visual impact metaphor (vs. no visual impact metaphor) results in more positive attitudes towards recycling and stronger recycling intentions. This effect was mediated by two different underlying mechanisms: Response efficacy and more positive attitudes towards the persuasive attempt (i.e. positive evaluative persuasion knowledge). © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Consumption of processed organic food is on the rise while fresh organic food still dominates organic food market. Drawing from the literature on authenticity and construal level theory, this study aims to investigate the role of perceived authenticity and message construal level in consumers’ evaluations of two types of organic food (fresh vs. processed). Two experiments were conducted among college students (N = 129, Study 1) and adults 18–70 (N = 249, Study 2). Our findings suggest that consumers’ evaluations of organic food are fully mediated by perceived authenticity of each organic food type. Specifically, compared to processed organic food, consumers perceive fresh organic food more authentic, which leads to more favorable attitudes and higher purchase intention. This research further demonstrates that the indirect effect of organic food type via perceived authenticity is moderated by construal level of marketing messages. That is, when messages are construed at a low level, consumers tend to have more positive attitudes and higher purchase intention toward fresh than processed organic food. By contrast, product type makes no difference when messages are construed at a high level. These findings have clear implications on message development strategy when promoting processed organic food, in particular. Future research directions are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: The study aims to demonstrate the impact of social media users’ positive attitude towards the social networking sites (SNS) on the generation of a positive attitude towards social networking advertisements (SNA). A favourable attitude towards the SNA thus generated can positively influence brand attitude and purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was conducted to collect relevant data using a structured questionnaire. Structural equation modelling was conducted using the statistical software AMOS 18. Findings: Empirical analysis revealed the importance of brand advertisements on the social networks in inciting a positive attitude as well as a purchase intention for the brand in the SNS users’ minds. Research limitations/implications: The study has been conducted in the Indian context using Facebook as a model social networking site. Practical implications: Social media being one of the most popular and user-friendly platforms for regular communications, marketers are suggested to allocate a sizeable share of the advertising budget for social media advertisements and customer engagement so as to help build a positive attitude towards the advertised brand in the SNS users’ minds. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the impact of users’ positive evaluation of SNS as an effective communication medium, on the generation of a positive attitude towards the SNA, has been dealt for the first time here. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Men’s involvement makes a difference in maternal health. Well-informed and supportive men may encourage their wives to get more complete and regular antenatal care. In much of sub-Saharan Africa, however, men’s involvement with their wives’ health during pregnancy is minimal. This study investigated men’s response to Obulamu: How’s Your Pregnancy radio campaign messages about attending antenatal care with their wives, delivering at a health facility, being tested for HIV, maintaining maternal nutrition, and using malaria prevention. We conducted eight focus group discussions ranging from six to ten participants each: two groups of men from a rural area, two groups of men from a peri-urban area, and two groups each of expectant or recent mothers from the same rural and peri-urban areas. We also conducted six key informant interviews of midwives and other healthcare providers. Findings revealed that participants were highly exposed to the Obulamu campaign and knowledgeable about campaign messages. Most men expressed positive attitudes toward behaviors promoted by the campaign and voiced an intention to change their behaviors. Key informant interviews confirmed that since the start of the campaign an increase in male involvement with maternity visits had taken place. However, a sizeable minority of men, mostly rural residents, resisted involvement in their wives’ antenatal visits because of poverty, gender and cultural stereotypes, fear of HIV testing, and incongruity between messages and the realities of antenatal clinical practice. An interaction between individual and institutional-level factors as posited by the social ecological model was clearly evident; there was an incongruity between encouraging Obulamu messages about men’s involvement and the discouraging realities of antenatal clinical practice. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Postnatal care (PNC) in rural areas is characterised by low uptake, with possible effect on maternal and neonatal mortality rates. Mobile health (mHealth) communication has been proposed to promote the uptake of health services; however, there is limited information on how mHealth can strengthen PNC in rural areas. The objective of this review was to gather the best available evidence regarding mHealth communication to strengthen PNC in rural areas. Methods: Studies published between 1 January 2008 and 31 August 2018 were searched in electronic databases hosted by EBSCO Host. Reference list checking and contact with authors were also done. Critical appraisal of the eligible studies was also done. Results: The results of 11 articles were synthesised to report the determinants of PNC uptake. Determinants were aligned to the Integrative Model of Behaviural Prediction (IMBP). One-way mobile phone messaging was the most common type of mHealth communication used. mHealth communication influenced mothers' intentions, skills, and environmental constraints associated with uptake of PNC. Intentions were influenced by attitudes, perceived norms and self-efficacy. Positive attitudes, as well as changed attitudes toward PNC practices were observed. Perceived norms that were enhanced were delivery at a health facility with immediate PNC, seeking of reinforcement and professional health support of newborn care practices, and male partner support. Improved self-efficacy was demonstrated by mothers who attended scheduled appointments and they were confident with regard to newborn care practices. Skills for PNC that were improved included cord care, thermal care, appropriate breastfeeding and problem-solving. The environmental constraints faced and which were addressed in the studies included inaccessibility, unavailability and unaffordability of PNC services in rural areas. Conclusions: Results from the literature included in this study show that one-way mobile phone messaging is the common type of mHealth communication used to strengthen PNC in rural areas. mHealth communication can influence intentions, skills and environmental constraints as determinants of PNC uptake. mHealth communication is recommended to strengthen PNC in rural areas. To widen the evidence, more studies in the field of mHealth communication that report a variety of both maternal and neonatal outcomes are needed. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Up until now, the literature on sociological approaches to translation has mainly focused on the self-perceptions of translators. This article analyses the coverage devoted to non-literary translation and translators in the print media in Switzerland. What perceptions of translation are newspapers circulating? Are these hetero-images positively or negatively connoted? A qualitative thematic analysis is conducted on four daily newspapers in Switzerland - Tages-Anzeiger, St. Galler Tagblatt, Le Temps and 24 Heures (two important newspapers for each of the two major official languages) - over a period of one year (spring 2013 - spring 2014). The analysis shows the scarcity and negativism of discourse about non-literary translation in Switzerland: it is depicted as a risky, costly, lonely and peripheral business - results that would need to be compared across media and countries. Understanding the construction of external 'translation talk' may help social actors such as translators or professional societies fight against existing prejudices about translation. © John Benjamins Publishing Company

AB  - Background: Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer affecting women around the world in which the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the one of the recognized causative agent affecting women health. In response to this health issue, the Malaysian government had officially implemented the HPV immunisation programme for secondary schoolchildren in 2010 at the age of 13 years old and above. The purpose of this study is to investigate the sociodemographic determinants of knowledge and attitude among students of Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR) towards the HPV vaccination programme. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using self-administered questionnaires, recruiting 374 UTAR's students as the respondents by using convenience sampling method. Respondents were categorized as having good/poor level of knowledge and positive/negative attitude towards HPV vaccination. Results: Over half of the respondents were females (64.5%) and the majority were aged 20 years old and below (55.8%). Generally, 54.7% of the total respondents had a high level of knowledge towards HPV vaccine while 57.5% of the total respondents showed a negative attitude towards HPV vaccine. Female respondents aged 20 years old and below showed good knowledge (56.4%) and a more positive attitude (55.8%) towards HPV vaccine. Students from the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences (FMHS) exhibited higher knowledge (67.3%) and positive attitude (62.4%) as compared to the Faculty of Accountancy and Management (FAM) which showed only 32.7% of knowledge and 37.6% of positive attitude towards the HPV vaccination. Conclusion: The majority of UTAR students possess good knowledge regarding HPV vaccination. Nonetheless, they demonstrated a negative attitude towards HPV vaccination, depicting the necessity to impart and further intensify the sense of health awareness among all students, especially among male students. The judicious use of social media apart from the conventional mass media should be an advantage as to enhance the practice of HPV vaccination among them and thereafter minimize the health and economic burdens of cervical cancer. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The most common motivation people have for becoming vegetarian is ethical concern about using animals for food. One ideology called speciesism—which entails assigning different moral worth to different species of animals—is thought to play a central role in promoting ethical vegetarianism. Following a vegetarian diet provides a means of opposing speciesism, proclaiming to oneself and the public that humans should not embody an inherently higher moral status than other animals. Yet the extent to which speciesism and dietary motivations exert direct effects on the decision to go vegetarian remain unknown. Through two preregistered studies, I investigated links between speciesism, ethical dietary motivation, and vegetarian status. In study 1 (n = 576), I found that ethical motivation partially mediated the link between speciesism and vegetarian versus meat-eater status. However, the direct effect of speciesism on vegetarian status remained large, such that rejection of speciesism was a much stronger predictor of participants’ vegetarian status than was their reported level of ethical dietary motivation. In study 2 (n = 201), I found that although vegans reported having greater ethical dietary motivation than vegetarians did, this effect disappeared when controlling for speciesism. Thus, vegans’ greater rejection of speciesism explained why they were more ethically motivated than vegetarians were. These studies suggest that beliefs about speciesism may predict certain eating behaviors more robustly than ethical motivation does. Accordingly, in studying eating behavior, it may be valuable to consider not only what motivations people report for their food choices but also the ideological notions they bring to the table. © 2019, © 2019 ISAZ.

AB  - The immigration issue seems to have consolidated a top position on the European political agenda, and the body of literature devoted to explaining attitudes toward immigration continues to expand. Alongside established models focusing on threat perceptions as the central mechanism behind anti-immigration attitudes, increased attention has been paid to the role of media. The aim of the present study is to test the effects of media use on attitudes toward immigration from regions that are perceived to be remote versus those close to the host society. Moreover, the study goes beyond previous research by investigating reciprocal relationships between the use of specific media types and attitudes toward immigration. While the empirical findings suggest that the effects of using traditional news media is weak, right-wing alternative media appears more powerful in influencing immigration attitudes. Specifically, the results indicate that the use of right-wing alternative media reinforces negative attitudes toward perceived remote immigration. At the same time, the use of right-wing alternative media appears to stimulate more positive attitudes toward perceived close immigration. Further, reciprocal relationships were found between right-wing alternative media use and attitudes toward immigration. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Citizen science programs provide an opportunity for the public to reconnect with nature; however, pro-environmental values may not necessarily result in a high level of participation. This study assessed the values and attitudes toward ecology and conservation of 482 people, including 231 citizen scientists participating in two programs requiring either a ‘complex’ or ‘simple’ level of participation. Positive attitudes toward urban wildlife were positively associated with increased participation in citizen scientist programs; however, a pro-ecological attitude was not always associated with an increasing level of participation. Young adults were more likely to participate in the simple data submitting a program or via social media, while middle-aged and older adults from vegetated suburbs were more likely to participate in the complex data collecting multi-species focused program. These results have implications for strategic design and targeting of citizen science programs to maximize participation rates. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Successful interprofessional (IP) collaboration has great potential to improve healthcare delivery. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the attitudes towards IP collaboration in young health professionals who had not been exposed to IP learning activities. About one year after graduation from their vocational training, 387 graduates from various healthcare professions [Nurses (nursing and pediatric nursing), Therapists (physical therapy, speech and language therapy), Diagnostic professionals (biomedical science and radiography)], were invited to participate in an online survey. In total, data from 129 graduates were considered for data analyses. The University of Western England Interprofessional Questionnaire was administered to self-assess graduates individual attitude towards IP collaboration and learning using four scales. All health professional groups showed an overall positive attitude in communication and teamwork as well as in IP relationships and expressed a neutral attitude in IP learning and IP interactions. There were no significant differences in the overall scores between the health professional groups. In total, the three health professional groups showed similar attitudes towards IP collaboration and learning, despite their different scope of work. Results may help to design IP learning activities and this may contribute to better communication with and to know more about each other. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Gender studies have often been criticized for undermining family and religious values. In this paper, we argue that these criticisms exhibit the characteristics of conspiracy theories. We define gender conspiracy beliefs as convictions that gender studies and gender-equality activists represent an ideology secretly designed to harm traditional values and social arrangements. In two studies conducted among Catholics in Poland (Study 1 N= 1019; Study 2 N= 223), we examined the prevalence of gender conspiracy beliefs and their psychological concomitants. We hypothesized that gender conspiracy beliefs should be associated with a defensive identification with one’s religious group, captured by religious collective narcissism. In both studies, Catholic collective narcissism was demonstrated to be a robust predictor of gender conspiracy beliefs. We additionally demonstrated that Catholic collective narcissism predicted outgroup hostility, and this effect was mediated by gender conspiracy beliefs. We discuss the implications for gender-based prejudice. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Introduction: Harm reduction is a term for strategies that minimize the negative outcomes of drug use. Given the progressing opioid epidemic, identifying barriers to harm reduction dispensing in community pharmacies is essential. Methods: This online, survey-based study assessed community pharmacist attitudes toward harm reduction and perceived dispense rates of both naloxone and needles/syringes to patients without verifiable injectable prescriptions. The online survey was distributed to members of the Bexar County Pharmacist Association and university alumni. The survey collected demographics, perceived dispense rates of naloxone, needles and syringes, availability of pharmacy protocols for dispensing these products, and Likert-scaled attitudinal questions. Responses were collected for 6 weeks. Results: Thirty-two survey responses were analyzed. Participants were generally white (n=14) or Hispanic/Latino (n=14), had a median age of 37 years (interquartile range, 32-49 years), and had a median graduation year of 2011 (interquartile range, 1988-2016). Most pharmacists agreed or strongly agreed they should be involved in harm reduction (n=26) and that pharmacies are an appropriate place to access these resources (n=26). However, most reported never or rarely dispensing both naloxone (n=19) and needles and syringes (n=22). Naloxone or needle and syringe protocol use was reported by 66% (n=21) and 47% (n=15) of pharmacists, respectively. Pharmacy protocols significantly enhanced the likelihood of naloxone dispensing (P=.007) but not needle and syringe dispensing (P=.24). Conclusion: Community pharmacists exhibited positive attitudes toward harm reduction but reported low rates of dispensing both naloxone and needles and syringes. Pharmacy protocols could be enhanced to better support community pharmacists in this area. © 2019 CPNP.

AB  - PURPOSE: Digital storytelling (DST), broadly speaking, is a storytelling method that is interwoven with digital media. It is commonly used in educational settings or human services to support various sorts of social advocacy. While many of these DST practices have devised methods to engage marginalized groups to express their voices, they lack parallel initiatives to enable audiences to understand those voices. This study examined a story-retelling workshop model called StoryAd, which utilizes productions from DST activities to facilitate face-to-face contact. The workshop itself is also a lite version of DST activity. METHOD: A pilot study was conducted in Hong Kong in 2019. Participants enrolled online, met offline, and their advertisement ideas might go online and contribute back to the stories. The workshop model was evaluated using a one-group pretest-posttest design. The participants were 45 Hong Kong Chinese, aged 18-60. RESULTS: Participants' critical thinking disposition, self-esteem, perspective-taking, and curiosity toward new information increased, while their need for cognitive-closure decreased. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study has proved the feasibility and acceptability of the workshop model. It also opens the discussion about extending DST pedagogy to engage and influence story-readers.

AB  - Oriental representations of Muslims are often manifested in a society’s media, literature, theatre and other creative means of expression. However, these representations, which are often historically and conceptually one-sided, have adverse repercussions for Muslims today, potentially leading to Islamophobia. Orientalism of Muslims in Western writings and discourses have been much discussed, debated and disproved, yet some works of literature continue to disseminate many of the earlier Oriental assertions about Islam/Muslims: that of being terrorists, misogynists, barbaric or uncivilized compared to the civilized West. Sherry Jones’ The Jewel of Medina (2008) chronicles the history of Islam from the time of the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad, through the voice of his youngest wife Aisha. This paper argues that there is more to the image of the Muslim than what is portrayed by Western writers. Through an "(un)reading” of Sherry Jones’ text, this paper unravels the misconceptions regarding early and forced marriage with a view to address the ways in which these misconceptions could lead to Islamophobia. Using Edward Said’s theory of Contrapuntal reading, which urges the colonized to unread Western canonical texts to unearth the submerged details, this paper identifies and puts to question non-conforming depictions of Muslims in Sherry Jones’ The Jewel of Medina (2008) - while placing the text in its historical space - in an effort to mitigate the growing stereotyping of Muslims and to address misconceptions with regard to Islamic history. © 2019, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Press.

AB  - Partisan selectivity of news media and attitudinal polarization are linked, yet the bulk of research focuses on the role of political attitudes while neglecting religious dispositions. We consider the degree to which both network and cable news media offend viewers in terms of both politics and religion. Using data from the 2010 Baylor Religion Survey, we find that white evangelicals have higher odds than mainline Protestants of reporting taking offense from the evening news, as well as higher odds than religious non-affiliates of being offended by both types of news. The primary divide, however, was between affiliates and non-affiliates, as biblical literalism and religious exclusivism at least partially mediated differences between white evangelicals and mainliners in taking offense from the evening news. Religious service attendance at least partially mediated differences between affiliates and non-affiliates in taking offense from both types of news, but while political conservatism explained differences in being offended by the evening news, it was not a significant predictor of taking offense from cable news. We suggest that this is due to processes of media differentiation that make cable news an equal-opportunity offender. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This study proposes a new "three-stage technology-product-market" model to analyze the technology commercialization process. This model revises the technology acceptance model to more accurately consider the market potential of new technologies from a consumer perspective. This approach can be used to supplement developers' own evaluations of technology. To test the model empirically, an online survey of 350 end users was conducted regarding their intention to purchase the "Wireless USB," which uses "Zing" technology and was developed by the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute. The data was used to test the model using a structural equations approach. We indirectly confirmed the existence of gaps in the technology commercialization process by verifying the mediating effects of the productization stage. Results suggest that end users may not purchase a product, even if they perceive the technology to be innovative; the product purchase intention is significantly influenced by its perceived value. Therefore, developers must understand the concept of technology value for productization in order to refine a technology according to market demand. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Objective To increase knowledge, attitudes and practice of sexual and reproductive health and family planning and to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality rates in Mozambique. Design An implementation research project's intermediate evaluation, applying two cross-sectional surveys. The surveys were planned for 316 subjects before and after interventions. Setting Research performed in Natikiri district of Nampula province in northern Mozambique, targeting a suburban and rural populations in their homes. Participants 452 people were surveyed (91 before, 361 after), all belonging to the Macua ethnic group. Interventions A media campaign (2 weekly radio spots, bimonthly theatre performances) was performed for 8 months (2017 to 2018) and family health champions' teachings (monthly home visits) performed for 3 months, on sexual and reproductive health and family planning. Outcome measures planned and measured were adolescent's and adult's knowledge, attitudes and practice about those. Data were analysed by gender, age group and frequencies, using a CI of 95% (p<0.5 statistically significant). Results Radio spots, community theatre and volunteer champions increased population's knowledge about sexual and reproductive health and led to a more positive attitude toward family planning. Concerning attitude, results show differences between adults' proportions before and after: (1) did you hear about sexual and reproductive health (p=0.0425); (2) knows project key messages (p<0.001); (3) knows prenatal visits importance (p=0.0301); (4) access to contraceptives was easy (p<0.001). Adolescents showed statistically significant differences before and after: (1) knows project key messages (p<0.001); (2) access to contraceptives was easy (p=0.0361). Family planning practice did not increase in both groups. Conclusion A health education intervention, using a media campaign and local volunteers, is useful to promote mother and child health. There is an unmet need for family planning and the use of modern contraception is below desired practice, needing further research about cultural barriers. Communication for behaviour change activities will pursue and impact will be assessed to document family planning practice improvement. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB  - Background: Connected health has created opportunities for leveraging health data to deliver preventive and personalized health care services. The increasing number of personal devices and advances in measurement technologies contribute to an exponential growth in digital health data. The practices for sharing data across the health ecosystem are evolving as there are more opportunities for using such data to deliver responsive health services. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore user attitudes toward sharing personal health data (PHD). The study was executed within the first year after the implementation of the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) legal framework. Methods: The authors analyzed the results of an online questionnaire survey to explore the willingness of 8004 people using connected health services across four European countries to share their PHD and the conditions under which they would be willing to do so. Results: Our findings indicate that the majority of users are willing to share their personal PHD for scientific research (1811/8004, 22.63%). Age, education level, and occupation of the participants, in addition to the level of digitalization in their country were found to be associated with data sharing attitudes. Conclusions: Positive attitudes toward data sharing for scientific research can be perceived as an indication of trust established between users and academia. Nevertheless, the interpretation of data sharing attitudes is a complex process, related to and influenced by various factors. © Maria Karampela, Sofia Ouhbi, Minna Isomursu.

AB  - Our knowledge of how cities bring together different social classes is still limited. Much effort has been devoted to investigating residential segregation, mostly over well-defined social groups (e.g. race). Little is known of how mobility and human communications affect urban social integration. The dynamics of spatial and social-network segregation and individual variations along these two dimensions are largely untapped. In this article, we put forward a computational framework based on coupling large-scale information on human mobility, social-network connections and people’s socio-economic status (SES), to provide a breakthrough in our understanding of the dynamics of spatio-temporal and social-network segregation in cities. Building on top of a social similarity measure, the framework can be used to depict segregation dynamics down to the individual level, and also provide aggregate measurements at the scale of places and cities, and their evolution over time. By applying the methodology in Singapore using large-scale mobile phone and socio-economic datasets, we find a relatively higher level of segregation among relatively wealthier classes, a finding that holds for both social and physical space. We also highlight the interplay between the effect of distance decay and homophily as forces that determine communication intensity, defining a notion of characteristic ‘homophily distance’ that can be used to measure social segregation across cities. The time-resolved analysis reveals the changing landscape of urban segregation and the time-varying roles of places. Segregations in physical and social space are weakly correlated at the individual level but highly correlated when grouped across at least hundreds of individuals. The methodology and analysis presented in this paper enable a deeper understanding of the dynamics of human segregation in social and physical space, which can assist social scientists, planners and city authorities in the design of more integrated cities. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Information Communication Technology (ICT) can bring a meaning full qualitative difference in the manner &amp; methods the lessons are transacted in the classroom. Majority of the studies established that degree of integration of ICT by teachers is positively correlated with their attitude to use of ICT resources. Despite the availability of ICT resources the teachers are inadequately integrate ICT in teaching learning. A purposive investigation was executed on 65 teachers who teach 9th &amp; 10th grade students of the state aided schools of West Bengal, India. The study was conducted to find out the differences of attitude of practicing teachers towards integration of ICT in class room, before and after the short term training, provided under CSSTE scheme. A standardized Likert instrument was used to collect relevant data. By means of paired t-test it is revealed that respondent teachers have positive attitude towards use of ICT as pedagogical tool in teaching learning but it was evident that the short-term training fails to make any impact on their attitude towards utilizing the ICT resources in classroom teaching learning. Though the result is statistically insignificant, but results revealed but that the training have positive impact on teachers, in-terms of utilizing ICT resources, belong to Under Graduate, Rural and Arts Stream, while the training showed negative impact on their counterpart. The impact was positive for the respondent teachers irrespective of their gender. Though the impact of training is not consistence in all the relevant dimensions of teachers’ attitude the study has thrown a light to the fact that use of ICT in teaching learning should be given higher level of weight-age priority than current degree of emphasis it is enjoying. Thus it is indicates the necessity of more intensive Teachers’ Training with the focus of ICT pedagogy. © IJSTR 2019.

AB  - Opinion mining is an important area of research in the recent years which combines web mining with computational intelligence to collect opinions through websites, social media, company data analysis and customers. Opinion mining algorithms collect opinions from websites and classify them using the mining process such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes and other classifiers. Moreover, opinion mining is useful in business since it highlights the positive or negative attitude of their students as well as the products and services. This helps the business managers to improve their method of services and to modify the products which will suit the student interests. Sentiment analysis is a type of opinion mining technique which uses natural language processing and other computational intelligence techniques to make effective decisions. © IJSTR 2019.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to assess household preparedness for emergency events and its determinants in China. Design A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted on 3541 households in China in 2015. Participants Households were selected using a stratified cluster sampling strategy, representing central, eastern, western and southern regions of China. The designed questionnaires were administered through face-to-face interviews. Outcome measures Household emergency preparedness was measured with 14 indicators, tapping into the supply of nine emergency necessities (food and water, extra batteries, battery-powered radio, battery-operated torch, first-aid kit, gas mask, fire extinguisher, escape ropes, whistle), coverage of accident insurance, knowledge of local emergency response systems (emergency numbers, exit routes and shelters) and availability of a household evacuation plan. If an individual acted on 9 of the 14 indicators, they were deemed well prepared. Logistic regression models were established to identify predictors of well preparedness based on 3541 returned questionnaires containing no missing values. Results Only 9.9% of households were well prepared for emergencies: 53.6% did not know what to do and 31.6% did not want to think about it. A higher level of preparedness was found in the respondents who have attained higher education (adjusted OR=0.826 compared with the higher level), participated in emergency training activities (adjusted OR=2.299), had better emergency knowledge (adjusted OR=2.043), reported less fate-submissiveness (adjusted OR=1.385) and more self-reliance (adjusted OR=1.349), prior exposure to emergency events (adjusted OR=1.280) and held more positive attitudes towards preparedness (adjusted OR=1.286). Conclusion Household preparedness for emergency events is poor in China. Lack of motivation, negative attitude to preparedness and knowledge shortfall are major but remediable barriers for household preparedness. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

AB  - There is a "timing optimism" that artificial general intelligence will be achieved soon, but some literature has suggested that people have mixed feelings about its overall impact. This study expanded their findings by investigating how Taiwanese university students perceived the overall impact of high-level-machine-intelligence (HLMI) in three areas: a set of 12 human professions, autonomous vehicles, and smart homes. Respondents showed a relatively more positive attitude, with a median answer of "on balance good", toward HLMI's development corresponding to those occupations having a higher probability of automation and computerization, and a less positive attitude, with a median of "more or less neutral", toward professions involving human judgment and social intelligence, and especially creativity, which had a median of "on balance bad". On the other hand, they presented a highly positive attitude toward the AI application of the smart home, while they demonstrated relatively more reservation toward autonomous vehicles. Gender, area of study, and a computer science background were found as predictors in many cases, whereas traffic benefits, and safety and regulation concerns, among others, were found as the most significant predictors for the overall impact of autonomous vehicles, with comfort and support benefits being the most significant predictor for smart homes. Recommendations for educators, policy makers, and future research were provided. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Posting countermessages is commonly used as a strategy to combat false rumors spreading online. The effectiveness of countermessage exposure has been investigated in past studies, but little is known about its repercussions. The aim of this study was to contribute to the understanding of rumor control by investigating the factors impacting the effectiveness of countermessage exposure. A total of 164 participants were asked to judge the believability of rumor and factual tweets before and after countermessage exposure in a web-based experiment. Two forms of countermessage were compared to examine the effects of countermessages on belief change in the target tweets. One was subjective countermessages based on personal experiences, and the other was objective countermessages based on evidence. The results showed that objective countermessages reduced belief in rumor tweets, whereas subjective countermessages strengthened false beliefs. In addition, the half of the participants who were exposed to objective countermessages randomly mixed with subjective countermessages formed negative attitudes not only toward the rumor tweets but also toward the factual tweets. The results also showed gender differences in response to countermessage exposure; women tended to be more susceptible to countermessages and changed their beliefs regarding the target tweets negatively after the exposure. We discuss the practical implications of the results associated with the adverse effects of countermessage exposure. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - In 2016, the Netherlands was required to introduce new European Union (EU)’s (pictorial) tobacco health warnings. Our objective was to describe the pathways through which the new EU tobacco health warnings may influence quit attempts and smoking cessation among Dutch smokers. Longitudinal data from 2016 and 2017 from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Netherlands Survey were used. Smokers who participated in both surveys were included (N = 1017). Structural equation modeling was applied to examine the hypothesized pathways. Health warning salience was positively associated with more health worries (β = 0.301, p < 0.001) and a more positive attitude towards quitting (β = 0.180, p < 0.001), which, in turn, were associated with a stronger quit intention (health worries: β = 0.304, p < 0.001; attitude: β = 0.340, p < 0.001). Quit intention was a strong predictor of quit attempts (β = 0.336, p = 0.001). Health warning salience was also associated with stronger perceived social norms towards quitting (β = 0.166, p < 0.001), which directly predicted quit attempts (β = 0.141, p = 0.048). Quit attempts were positively associated with smoking cessation (β = 0.453, p = 0.043). Based on these findings, we posit that the effect of the EU’s tobacco health warnings on quit attempts and smoking cessation is mediated by increased health worries and a more positive attitude and perceived social norms towards quitting. Making tobacco health warnings more salient (e.g., by using plain packaging) may increase their potential to stimulate quitting among smokers. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Beauty and an attractive body shape are particularly important during early adulthood, as both are related to greater mating success, positive social feedback, and higher self-esteem. The media may further influence common features of beauty. We tested whether higher body‐dysmorphic disorder (BDD) scores were associated with sociocultural attitudes towards appearance. Additionally, we expected that a link between higher BDD scores and higher perceived media pressure would be mediated by lower self‐esteem (SE). Method: 350 young Iranian adults (mean age: 24.17 years; 76.9% females) took part in the study. Participants completed questionnaires covering sociodemographic data, sociocultural attitudes towards appearances, and SE, while experts rated participants for symptoms of body dysmorphic disorders. Results: Higher BDD scores were associated with higher scores for sociocultural attitudes towards appearance, while SE was not associated with BDD or sociocultural attitudes towards appearance. Higher scores for sociocultural attitudes towards appearance and media pressure predicted higher BDD scores, while SE had no influence. Conclusion: Among young Iranian adults, sociocultural attitudes towards appearances and BDD scores, as rated by experts’, were related, while SE was not. The shared variance between symptoms of BDD and sociocultural attitudes towards appearance was low, suggesting that other factors such as mating and career concerns together with social feedback might be more important in explaining symptoms of body dysmorphic disorders. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Due to the significance of the “refugee crisis” for European residents, the present research examined the link between residents’ support for newly arriving migrants and different types of intergroup contact with migrants. We compared the associations between support for migrants, and both positive and negative direct and mass mediated contact. In the link between contact and support, we examined the mediating role of residents’ attitudes towards migrants and the moderating role of their political orientation. In a Swiss sample (N = 861), only direct but not mass mediated contact was associated with support for migrants. Both positive and negative direct contact was linked to (higher vs. lower) support for migrants through (more vs. less positive) attitudes towards migrants. Relevant for interventions aimed at improving relations of host society with migrants, both positive and negative contact influenced support for migrants through attitudes, especially in people with a right wing political orientation. © 2019

AB  - Research question: The current study aimed to assess knowledge, attitudes and intentions in relation to fertility preservation among children, by proxy, and adolescents with cancer. Although fertility preservation options have been developed to mitigate the adverse long-term effects of life-saving cancer treatment on fertility, fertility is difficult for children and adolescents to conceptualize, especially when they face a cancer diagnosis. Design: This was a descriptive, semi-quantitative analysis. Adolescents and parents of children or adolescents within 6 months of a cancer diagnosis and undergoing gonadotoxic treatment were invited to participate. Seventy-one families completed and returned the study's questionnaire (91 questionnaires) over a period of 26 months. Results: The vast majority of participants were aware of the gonadotoxic effects of cancer treatment (85%) and had positive attitudes towards fertility preservation (>90%), but only a portion of them (20%) were willing to take action towards this goal. Although adolescent–parent pairs had similar attitudes towards fertility preservation, adolescents tended to be more sceptical about experimental fertility preservation options. Male post-pubertal cancer patients were more likely to be offered fertility preservation counselling or referral to a specialist in comparison to their younger and female counterparts. Conclusions: Fertility preservation care has advanced but there are still gender and age differences in counselling and treatment initiation in the paediatric and adolescent cancer population. Interventions to improve provider–patient–parent communication regarding fertility preservation and to help patients address the observed intention–behaviour gap in relation to fertility preservation options are needed. © 2019 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.

AB  - The recovery of California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) populations is an environmental success story, but it has created new challenges given their interactions with sport fisherman. Economic losses to the Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel (CPFV) stems both from the loss of fish, as well as the costs of fuel and time spent traveling to new fishing areas to avoid pinnipeds. Management solutions require a firm understanding of the public's perceptions of an issue. To address this shortcoming, we surveyed recreational anglers' perceptions of California sea lions and conducted a content analysis of media coverage of California sea lions in Southern Californian newspapers. We found that as anglers' knowledge of California sea lions increased, their subjective knowledge of the Marine Mammal Protection Act increased as well and they were less likely to advocate the use of lethal removal to manage sea lion issues. Avid fishers were more likely to consider shooting all sea lions as acceptable, and less likely to view controls to restrict human activity from sea lion areas as favorable. Anglers that expressed negative sentiments after an interaction with sea lions while fishing were more likely to view punishing the sea lion favorably, but less likely to view exposing the sea lions to pain as favorable. Our content analysis showed that most articles were about tourism and entertainment and the majority of articles focused on negative effects to sea lions. The media's framing might obscure the successful recovery of California sea lions and flame growing management concerns with stakeholders like anglers, dock workers, and marina occupants. Our survey showed that among stakeholders, increased understanding of the animals increased understanding of the regulatory context of their recovery and repellents as a socially acceptable means of managing the conflict. Thus, we have shown that knowledge among the public and stakeholders will enhance management efforts. Conservation management professionals can influence public attitudes by interacting with the media as well as using communications strategies that highlight the ecological mechanisms behind the conflict as well as the management actions. © 2019

AB  - Uptake of prenatal genetic testing (PGT) is low among those with sickle cell disease (SCD). This study evaluated the association of knowledge and attitudes towards prenatal genetic counseling (PGC), awareness of posttesting intervention options and omission bias with attitudes towards PGT. In addition, we explored changes among knowledge, attitudes, and awareness of options following exposure to an educational, clinical vignette among parents of children with SCD. Parents (n=44) completed a questionnaire and an educational, clinical vignette presenting a detailed account of a pregnant woman with sickle cell trait seeking PGT and PGC was read to each participant. t Tests, Spearman correlations, multivariable regressions, and moderation/mediation analyses were used. More positive attitudes towards PGC (P=0.01), lesser tendency of omission bias (P<0.01) and private insurance (P=0.04) were significant correlates of more positive attitudes towards PGT. Omission bias mediated the relationship of attitudes towards PGC and attitudes towards PGT (95% confidence interval: 0.13, 3.03). Awareness of options (P=0.02), knowledge of PGC (P=0.01) and knowledge of PGT (P=0.01) significantly improved after exposure to the clinical vignette. Patients and families with SCD can benefit from education about the importance of prenatal diagnosis to improve attitudes, address omission bias and promote more informed decisions of PGT. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Prejudice is one of the major threats to the cohesion of multicultural societies and adolescent years play a key role in its development. How social contexts contribute to adolescent prejudice is, however, not yet well-known. This 3-wave study of Swedish majority adolescents (N = 659; MageT1 = 13.41; MageT3 = 17.33) examined the effects of parents' and peers' attitudes on changes in youth attitudes toward immigrants as well as an interplay between parent, peer, and school context. The results of multilevel analyses revealed that within-person fluctuations in youth attitudes were positively related to fluctuations in peers' but not parents' attitudes. Both parents' and peers' attitudes, however, significantly predicted the differences in level and rate of change in attitudes between adolescents. In addition to these direct effects, mediation analysis showed that parents' attitudes predicted youth attitudes indirectly, via the attitudes of the peers youth associate with, suggesting an overall greater importance of parental bias. Peers' attitudes did not moderate the effects of parents but youth from ethnically diverse classrooms were less affected by their parents' prejudice than youth from less diverse classrooms. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of social context in the development of prejudice. They suggest that while parents set the stage, peers explain the day-to-day variation in prejudice, and that classroom diversity offsets some of the negative effects of parental bias. © 2019 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Ageism in the workplace has documented detrimental consequences for its victims, but its effects on those who hold ageist views are rarely investigated. A cross-sectional study and a longitudinal study examined ageism toward both younger and older workers and its relation to intergroup contact, work behaviors, organizational identification, and the well-being of prejudiced individuals. It was hypothesized that ageism would predict prejudiced individuals’ behaviors toward co-workers, identification with their organization, and vitality at work, indirectly through intergroup anxiety and quality of intergroup contact. Overall, 647 employees aged 24–62 years provided data on the variables of interest. Both studies suggested that ageist views worsened the quality of intergroup contact, which in turn increased counterproductive behaviors toward co-workers and decreased identification with the organization. Moreover, ageism marginally predicted vitality at work longitudinally through the mediation of quality of intergroup contact. No support emerged for the mediational role of intergroup anxiety. Theoretical explanations for these findings and their practical implications are discussed. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Introduction: The prototype of the “recidivist pedophile-child murderer” widely portrayed in the media is that of a (moral) monster. The horror and incomprehension of acts that are considered to be immoral, abnormal, and pathological, lead to the view that sex offenders must be “crazy”, “sick” or “perverse”. Attitudes towards sex offenders are generally very negative, and most people think they should be punished severely and locked up for as long as possible, especially child molesters. Women are slightly more understanding. The professionals who work with sex offenders (criminal justice system, care-workers) tend to have more positive perceptions. The aim of this study is to develop French-language tools to assess negative attitudes towards sex offenders. A further aim is to compare the attitudes of professionals, including people working in a CRIAVS (a regional center that provides guidance to professionals working with sex offenders), with those of other people. We will factor in history of sexual abuse, personality traits and emotional distress of the respondents. Method: Participants and procedure. The sample consisted of 405 people (mean age 25.51 ± 9.70 years, 15–70; 58% women). One-third of the respondents were care-workers, of whom 20% (n = 29) worked in a CRIAVS or in a treatment center for sex offenders. They were recruited via a web-based questionnaire created using Sphinx software. Material: The scale of negative social representations of sex offenders comprised 27 items, mostly worded in a derogatory way (e.g. “People who engage in acts of sexual violence are really monstrous”, “… have no place in society”; “… are people just like us”; “… should above all be given treatment”; “… do things that are totally incomprehensible”; “… are obviously very violent”; “… can never stop”). This questionnaire was the subject of a pre-test study. We also translated the Attitudes Towards Sex Offenders (ATS 21) scale, which is structured around three factors (Trust, Intent and Social Distance), each with 7 items. The material also included a personality trait scale (Big Five Inventory-10 items), an emotional distress scale (General Health Questionnaire-12 items) and questions about any history of sexual abuse experienced personally or by a close friend or relation. Results: A principal component factor analysis of responses to items of negative attitudes towards sex offenders yielded a two-factor varimax-rotated solution explaining more than 45% of total variance. The first factor, “Segregation of sex offenders”, concerned items conveying the view that sex offenders should be excluded from society, that they cannot live with other people, that they are monstrous, etc. The second factor, “Sick People”, concerned items giving the view that sex offenders needed above all to be treated, but also related to the fear they inspire, and the impulsive and serious nature of their acts. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients were respectively 0.94 and 0.67 (0.93 overall). The results showed strong correlations between ATS (ATS and its 3 factors: Trust, Intent and Social Distance) and the “Segregation of sex offenders”, as well as a significant correlation between Trust (ATS) and “Sick People”. The results showed an effect of age and level of education on the social representations of sex offenders, with less favorable attitudes among the youngest and those with the lowest level of education. There were weak links with personality traits (lower scores on Conscientiousness and higher scores on Neuroticism) and with emotional distress (higher scores on Anxiety-depression). There were also differences between women and men, with women showing greater tolerance than men, although they also scored higher on the “Sick People” factor. There were differences between people living in rural areas, whose attitudes were more negative than those living in urban areas. Finally, the attitudes of care-workers, particularly those working in a CRIAVS or treating sex offenders, were less negative than those of the other participants. Discussion: This study is the first step in the development of a scale of negative attitudes towards sex offenders (with satisfactory internal and external psychometric qualities). Results are consistent with previous data. Pejorative attitudes are an obstacle to the care and rehabilitation of sex offenders. This tool could be used by CRIAVS professionals to evaluate the attitudes of the people or professionals attending their awareness or training programs. This study extends work on the “monster” figure and the segregation of “social deviants”. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Psychological research suggests that violent extremism (e.g., terrorism) stems partly from existential motives, such as individuals’ need to achieve significance in life after experiencing failure, ostracism, or humiliation (Significance Quest Theory; SQT). Parallel investigations from sociology and criminology established similar findings by linking anomia—a syndrome including feelings of meaninglessness, powerlessness, isolation, self-estrangement, and normlessness—with violent behavior. In line with SQT, this contribution tested if anomia could mediate Loss of Significance effects on violent extremism. Accordingly, three studies conducted in France highlight indirect effects of exposure to discrimination on legitimation of political violence (Study 1, cross-sectional, minority population sample, N = 110), violent behavioral intentions (Study 2, experimental, undergraduate sample, N = 249), and support for ISIS fighters (Study 3, experimental, undergraduate sample, N = 221) through anomia. A subsequent study shows this indirect effect to be robust when controlled for Social Dominance Orientation and Political Extremism (Study 4, cross-sectional, undergraduate sample, N = 279). A final investigation re-analyzing data collected in Turkey highlights a reverse effect when the independent variable tapped into social inclusion (rather than exclusion; Study 5, cross-sectional, undergraduate sample, N = 321). This indirect effect was also robust to Political Extremism and Intolerance as control variables. These results support the usefulness of considering anomia as a proximal predictor of violent extremism in a SQT perspective. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The study examined factors associated with discrimination against gay people in a public referendum aimed at the restriction of gay rights. We tested whether positive and negative intergroup contact with gay people and intergroup contact with another stigmatized minority, the Roma, were associated with how the heterosexual majority voted in the referendum (i.e., discrimination). We tested two mechanisms underlying the link between intergroup contact and discrimination—the mediation by intergroup threat and the mediation by outgroup attitudes. We found that negative contact with both gay people and the Roma was associated with a higher probability of gay discrimination while positive contact was associated with a lower probability of gay discrimination. Intergroup threat, not intergroup attitudes, mediated the link between intergroup contact and discrimination. In the case of contact with gay people, intergroup contact was linked to discrimination through threat from gay people. In the case of contact with Roma, intergroup contact was linked to discrimination through the generalization of threats from the Roma to gay people but not via the generalization of outgroup attitudes. Our research brings novel evidence that contact with one minority can affect discrimination against another minority in both positive and negative way and that perceived threat, but not attitudes, plays a key role in majority's decision to discriminate against gay people. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: Stigma, anticipated responses from others, and their relationships may affect patients’ decision-making of cancer disclosure. However, little research has explored responses to cancer disclosure and the outcome from receivers’ perspectives who had stereotypic views of cancer. This vignette study aimed to explore how lay people with negative attitude to cancer would react to the friend's cancer disclosure. Methods: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted in community organisations. Of 161 recruited, 91 participants returned their questionnaires (56.5% of response rate). A total of 88 responses to open-ended questions were qualitatively analysed. Results: Thematic analysis extracted four themes: ‘Initial emotional reactions and the acceptance of the friend’s cancer diagnosis’; ‘Empathy, trust and helping intention’; ‘Sharing informational and emotional support provision’; and ‘Offering help, but waiting and seeing the friend's request.’ As a result of comparison to these themes by the participants’ familiarity of cancer patients in their real life, it was found that participants, who had not known any cancer patients, did not report the acceptance of the friends’ cancer diagnosis and informational support provision to share. Conclusion: Intervention for lay people who felt difficulty with accepting friends’ cancer diagnosis may be helpful to reduce the impact of friends’ cancer diagnosis. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Public expenditure on mental health education has grown exponentially in the past two decades. A qualitative study using focus groups was used to explore whether the experience of stigma among 22 mental health service users improved over time. We identified five major themes on changes in social stigma, perceived stigma, and stigma coping. Stigmatizing and discriminatory experiences were still common in workplace, healthcare system, and relational aspects but some participants perceived that there were reductions in social stigma. Participants believed that media portrayal and celebrity effect were important in fostering greater acceptance toward people with mental illness and the importance of family support and stigma resistance for minimizing the harmful impacts of stigma. The findings are important in the future design of public educational and stigma reduction programs. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) require management to mitigate their impact on ecosystems. The success of management decisions often depends on whether they are socially acceptable and to what extent people are willing to be actively involved in an early warning and rapid response system (EWRR). We administered a nation-wide public poll to assess people’s knowledge on plant, insect and fungal IAS; their perception of IAS as an environmental problem; and their support for different IAS management measures. Most respondents (76%) knew the term IAS, and more than half (62%) provided a correct definition. Species with more media attention and those that are easily visible are more frequently identified correctly. Almost all respondents (97%) support an EWRR system; however, there is heterogeneity in terms of the types of actions people approve of. Non-lethal measures garner more support than lethal ones. Gender and previous knowledge also affect the level of agreement. The willingness-to-pay question largely confirmed this, as people were divided into four classes according to their preferences for either biological, mechanical or chemical measures to control IAS; completeness and location of removal; and having an EWRR established. Mechanical removal is the most preferred treatment in two of the four classes, and complete removal is preferred over partial removal in one of the four classes. Having an EWRR is consistently supported in all classes, and removal in urban areas is preferred over removal in forestland in only one class. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This paper builds new theory and provides supporting evidence to contain the Not-Invented-Here Syndrome (NIHS) – a persistent decision-making error arising from an attitude-based bias against external knowledge. Conceptually, we draw on the 4i framework of organizational learning to develop a novel process perspective on NIHS. This allows us not only to unpack how and where NIHS impedes organizational learning, but also to identify the key requirements for effective NIHS countermeasures. Importantly, countermeasures fall into two categories: those that seek to change the negative attitude directly (direct NIHS countermeasures) and those that seek to attenuate the behavioral impact of negative attitudes without addressing the attitudes as such (indirect NIHS countermeasures). While the evidence base on direct NIHS countermeasures has grown over the last decade, indirect NIHS countermeasures have received little research attention. To address this gap, we adopt a mixed methods research design composed of two complementary empirical studies – the first qualitative and the second quantitative. Study 1 explores the prevalence of distinct NIHS countermeasures in collaborative R&D practice. Based on 32 interviews and three focus group meetings with R&D employees, we find that a broad array of primarily direct NIHS countermeasures is employed in R&D practice. Study 2 addresses the scarcity of scholarly and managerial insights on indirect NIHS countermeasures by testing the effectiveness of perspective taking as a debiasing technique to contain negative attitudes at the level of the individual. Based on quantitative survey data from 565 global R&D projects, it provides empirical evidence not only for the prevalence and negative effects of NIHS on project success as mediated by external knowledge absorption, but also for the effectiveness of perspective taking as an exemplary indirect NIHS countermeasure. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: Social media not only provide platforms for the public to obtain information about a disease but also allow them to share their opinions and experiences about it. Methods: This study analyzed 3000 tweets systematically selected from over 1 million tweets posted during the 2015 California measles outbreak. Results: News updates were the most tweeted messages (41.4%), followed by personal opinions (33.7%), resources (19.4%), personal experiences (2.5%), and questions (1.6%). Susceptibility was the most discussed health belief (21.8%), followed by cues to action (18.9%) and severity (13.0%). Individuals were significantly more likely to discuss severity. Nonprofit organizations were significantly more likely to offer cues to action than other user types, and media were less likely to include cues to action than other user types. Pro-vaccine tweets were more likely to contain links to traditional mainstream media sources such as newspapers and magazines, and anti-vaccine tweets were more likely to link to emerging news websites. Conclusions: Understanding who posts what on social media during an infectious disease outbreak allows public health agencies to better assess the public's attitudes, sentiments, and needs in order to provide timely and effective information. © 2019 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: Patient-centered-care (PCC) attitudes are important to enhance PCC behavior, but research on perceptions and attitudes that contribute to PCC attitudes is limited. We tested a new model, assessing whether the association between self-efficacy and PCC attitudes is mediated by communication and empathy attitudes. Furthermore, we assessed medical-school-stage and gender differences in these variables. Methods: Medical/dentistry students (N = 653) completed self-reported questionnaires. Analyses were performed using Pearson's-correlations, PROCESS macro, and independent samples t-tests. Results: The association between communication self-efficacy and PCC attitudes was completely mediated by communication and empathy attitudes. Students in clinical years had more positive attitudes toward PCC and empathy, and higher communication self-efficacy. Females had more positive attitudes toward PCC, communication, and empathy. Conclusions: The results emphasize the importance of communication self-efficacy and the mediating role of communication and empathy attitudes in enhancing PCC attitudes. This highlights the need to focus on learners' affective matter (what they feel/think) about their competencies and attitudes. Practice implications: Educational interventions should improve understanding of the benefits of applying good communication skills, of learning the importance of empathy and its relevance to patient care, and strengthening students' confidence in applying these skills. Attention to these is important for enhancing students' PCC attitudes. © 2019

AB  - In this research, the effects of microcelebrity endorsements on customers’ attitude and booking intentions toward hotels are examined. Specifically, Study 1 manipulated the effect of information source (hotel official website vs. microcelebrity) and hotel type (chain vs. independent). Results indicated that microcelebrity endorsements yielded more positive attitude toward independent hotels. This effect was investigated further in Study 2 where the moderating effect of misleading photos on the relationship between information source and consumers’ trust and repurchase intentions was examined. Results demonstrated that when participants were shown misleading photos, there was a higher level of trust toward the hotel when the information source was microcelebrity. When the photos were nonmisleading, the level of trust toward the hotel was unaffected by the source of the information. Taken together, these data contribute to the growing social media literature as well as the influence of microcelebrities on consumers’ responses. Hospitality managers might also consider the potential benefits of including microcelebrities into their strategic planning. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Male nursing students may experience social prejudice, which may lead to psychological distress. However, few quantitative studies have focused on their mental health. This study aimed to explore the relationship among self-esteem, perceived prejudice, and psychological distress in male nursing students, and compare differences in self-esteem, perceived prejudice, and psychological distress, as well as the relationships among these variables between male nursing students who selected nursing as their first choice for a major and those who did not. A survey based on a cross-sectional design was used. Self-esteem, perceived prejudice, and psychological distress of 460 male nursing students in China were measured using the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, a self-developed questionnaire, and the Kessler 10, respectively. Structural equation modeling was adopted to test the theoretical model regarding the relationships among self-esteem, perceived prejudice, and psychological distress. The results indicated that 82.2% of the participants reported psychological distress. The participants who did not select nursing as their first choice for a major reported a significantly higher perceived prejudice, higher prevalence of psychological distress, and lower self-esteem. Therefore, when selecting male students, nursing schools must prioritize those who selected nursing as their first choice for a major. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Research illustrates that girls indicate more positive attitudes towards reading than boys. Gender differences are often presented in simplistic terms with ‘all boys’ represented as one homogenous group. Methods: This study developed a survey to identify similarities and differences in boys' and girls' attitudes towards a range of school-related activities, including reading, and among boys themselves. The survey of 296 (f = 137, m = 159) 8- to 10-year-olds attending elementary schools in Australia was designed to identify the way attitudes towards school-related activities, including reading, may be interrelated. Cluster analysis identified nuances associated with socio-economic background, reading frequency and reading outcomes. Results: Results indicated that girls and boys were represented similarly in the cluster groups that indicated positive enjoyment for books. However, there were significantly more girls than boys who enjoyed the social aspects of reading. A main finding was that many boys indicated they personally enjoyed reading, in contrast to previous studies, however, they did not necessarily enjoy the social aspects of reading with this finding particularly evident for boys from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Attitude towards reading was interrelated with the social aspects of reading and other school-related activities such as competition sports. Conclusions: Outcomes from the survey cluster groupings made visible the multiplicity of differences among boys' attitudes towards reading that are often left out of simplistic representations in educational policies, teaching literature and the popular media. Findings suggest the need to open up educational discussions about the ways that reading attitudes may be embedded within, and related to, socio-economic location and other school-based experiences. © 2019 UKLA

AB  - This study is grounded in Allport's intergroup contact theory and Herek's sexual prejudice theory. We aimed at (a) investigating the mediational role of sexism and homonegativity on the relation between gender, age, and contact with gay and lesbian people with gender stereotypes about gay men and lesbians; and (b) replicating and corroborating the direct associations found in previous research among these variables. The present research used secondary data from a survey conducted by the Italian National Institute of Statistics and comprehending a representative sample of 5,863 Italian adults. The results from path analysis indicated that both homonegativity and sexism partially mediated the effect of gender and age on gender stereotypes, whereas they totally mediated the effect of contact with gay and lesbian persons. Findings suggest that reducing sexist and homonegative attitudes and increasing contact with gay and lesbian people may reduce stereotypical beliefs about homosexual people. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The human psyche is profoundly shaped by its cultural milieu; however, few studies have examined the dynamics of cultural influence in everyday life, especially when it comes to shaping people’s automatic, implicit attitudes. In this quasi-experimental field study, we investigated the effect of transient, but salient, cultural messages—the pop-cultural phenomenon of celebrity “fat-shaming”—on implicit anti-fat attitudes in the population. Adopting the “copycat suicide” methodology, we identified 20 fat-shaming events in the media; next, we obtained data from Project Implicit of participants who had completed the Weight Implicit Association Test from 2004 to 2015. As predicted, fat-shaming led to a spike in women’s (N=93,239) implicit anti-fat attitudes, with events of greater notoriety producing greater spikes. We also observed a general increase in implicit anti-fat attitudes over time. Although these passing comments may appear harmless, we show that feedback at the cultural level can be registered by the “body politic”. © 2019 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Crises are inevitable for any company, and the fate of a company’s image rests in how well they are responded to. Few studies have experimentally tested the impact that common types of company responses can have on consumers’ perceptions when a negative complaint has been made online. This research sought to expand the strategies put forth for crisis management by image restoration theory (IRT) using best practice research within the context of social mediated crisis communication. An online experiment examined the effect of a company’s response to an online complaint (i.e., professional apology, personal apology, deleting the comment, ignoring the comment, control group) on participants’ perceptions of the company (i.e., perceptions of company caring, attitude). The potential for perceptions of company caring to mediate the relationship between these expanded strategies and IRT’s ultimate aim of attitude change was also tested. An apology, whether professional or personal, improved participants’ perceptions compared to deleting or ignoring the complaint. Caring significantly mediated the relationship between response strategy and participant attitude. Compared to a control group, which had no transgression, ignoring or deleting the complaint led to negative attitudes about the company, while responding to the complaint with a personal or professional apology led to positive attitudes about the company via perceptions of company caring. Results indicate that online complaints could also be seen as opportunities to improve a company’s image, as attitudes toward the company were highest when a transgression occurred and was responded to positively, compared to not having the transgression take place at all (i.e., control condition). Potential extensions to current image repair strategies in the social media environment are discussed. © 2019, Reputation Institute and Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Introduction: It is increasingly becoming a requirement for radiographers to use the concept of Evidence Based Practice (EBP) to inform their clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices towards the use of EBP as well as to establish factors that influence the use of EBP amongst radiographers in Uganda. Methods: A total of 83 respondents participated in a cross-sectional survey conducted amongst qualified radiographers licensed to practice in Uganda. Data was collected using a self-reporting questionnaire that was accessed through the Bristol Online Survey Software. Using SPSS version 21, descriptive and inferential statistics were generated. Results: The study revealed that 47 (57%) and 36 (43%) respondents scored themselves as having high and low knowledge of EBP respectively. However, 52 (63%) respondents scored themselves as having a negative attitude towards EBP. As regards use of EBP, 49 (59%) out of 83 respondents reported use of EBP in clinical practice. Using binary logistic regression, a significant association was found between a high knowledge level and the use of EBP (Adjusted OR, 95% CI: 9.89: 3.54–27.64). Conclusion: Overall, majority of the respondents had high knowledge levels about EBP. However, a high proportion of them were found to have a negative attitude towards EBP. High knowledge levels of EBP were strongly associated with use of EBP in practice. This finding provides helpful insights for policy makers to consider a holistic approach towards improving the use of EBP among radiographers through devising interventions that strengthen both knowledge and attitude towards EBP. © 2019 The College of Radiographers

AB  - We examined the effectiveness of an imagery-based strategy designed to reduce prejudice in preschoolers in Italy. Three studies involving different target groups (disabled children, Black children) were conducted within Italian preschools. Children (4–6 years) were asked to imagine and draw meeting an outgroup member (Studies 1 and 2) or to imagine writing a letter to an outgroup member (Study 3). Results revealed that preschoolers in the experimental condition, relative to a control group, reported less intergroup bias in the form of contact intentions and resource allocation as well as greater behavioral inclusiveness; effects were mediated by improved intergroup attitudes. Our findings are important in understanding ways that promote positive intergroup relations in ways that align with the interests of young children. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Background: The legalization of medical and recreational cannabis is a topic of continued debate in countries around the world. It has been suggested that medical cannabis legalization influences cannabis legalization for recreational purposes through increased media attention toward the positive health effects of cannabis. However, the nature of media coverage is likely to vary across mass media and online sources (internet and social media). In addition, effects of information engagement on attitudes may vary depending on whether information was actively sought or obtained incidentally during patterns of regular media use (scanned). Methods: This study uses data from an online survey of Israeli adults (N = 554) to test the association between information seeking and scanning about medical cannabis (from mass media and online sources) and attitudes toward medical cannabis. Furthermore, we test indirect effects of media engagement on attitudes toward cannabis legalization through medical cannabis attitudes. Results: Seeking and scanning for information about medical cannabis from online sources, but not from mass media sources, were associated with positive attitudes toward medical cannabis. Engagement with medical cannabis information from online sources was also indirectly associated with greater support for cannabis legalization, through positive attitudes related to medical cannabis. Conclusion: The results suggest that one mechanism through which medical cannabis legalization is associated with cannabis legalization for all purposes is public engagement with information about medical cannabis in the media, particularly from the internet and social media channels. As increasingly more jurisdictions are expected to legalize medical cannabis, with resulting increase in media attention, support for recreational cannabis legalization may be expected to grow. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article investigates the effects of services proposed by private developers on buyers’ psychological attitudes in the decision-making process for off-plan purchases. We propose a new typology of services based on perceived value. We conducted a field experiment with real buyers who purchased an off-plan dwelling in France, and we measured the causal effects on developer reputation of four service intensity indexes that offer ‘visualisation’, ‘customisation’, ‘value enhancement’ and ‘interaction’ services. The results confirm the homebuyer-based typology of services and highlight the mediating roles of two types of attitudes, satisfaction with and trust in the developer, to explain the influence on developer reputation. Services designed to improve the perception of the quality of the dwelling itself (visualisation and customisation benefits) are less effective, and those intended to create a favourable purchase context (value enhancement and interactional benefits) are more influential, emphasising the benevolent role expected from developers. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2019.

AB  - Past research on environmentally sustainable behaviors has focused on the impact of a wide array of psychological factors, such as values, attitudes, norms, motivation, or perceptions, on behavior. The aim of this article is to study an alternative perspective by focusing on the effect of behavior on attitude, instead of the opposite, and by examining the mediation of satisfaction on that relationship. Drawing on both the self-perception and cognitive dissonance theories, we demonstrate that the expectancy disconfirmation model illuminates the conditions under which the past behavior-attitude link may improve. An online study with 409 U.S. citizens revealed that satisfaction mediates the positive behavior-attitude relationship, while this is not the case for the attitude-behavior relation. Our results also highlight the importance of multidimensional conceptualization for both proenvironmental behavior (PEB) and attitudes toward PEB, while providing useful guidelines for practitioners and policy makers. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Social discounting is when resource allocation decreases as social distance increases. Studies fitting different quantitative models to social discounting data have shown that a q-exponential function based on Tsallis' statistics best fits loss data, whereas a hyperbolic power function best fits gain data. However, a social discounting sign effect, where losses are discounted less than equivalent gains, has not been consistently found. This study fit four different quantitative social discounting models to gain and loss data for 40 United States (US) participants. We compared quantitative model fits to previous studies collected with Japanese and German participants to determine if (1) different quantitative social discounting models best fit loss and gain data, (2) US participants discounted less gains than Japanese participants, but not losses, and (3) US participants showed the sign effect. Results showed that the q-exponential function and the hyperbolic power function best fit median loss and gain data, respectively. There were no significant absolute differences between cultures for gains or losses, and US participants showed a robust sign effect. While most results for US participants were consistent with previous data, future cross-cultural social discounting studies are needed that manipulate sign as well as reward magnitude to determine best quantitative model fits. Social discounting results are also discussed in relation to their application to important health behaviors such as smoking and obesity. © Copyright © 2019 Stegall, Collette, Kinjo, Takahashi and Romanowich.

AB  - This article examines cross-national differences in solidarity towards immigrants in the EU. This concept of solidarity is operationalized through perceived ethnic threat vs. a positive view of multicultural society. The main argument of this article is that ‘classical’ enduring determinants (sociodemographic factors, subjective values and structural factors) are still able to explain ethnocentrism, but these factors are enriched and mediated by a cluster of five emerging explanatory factors which reflect societal malaise. These factors include dissatisfaction with society, political distrust, fear of social decline, lack of recognition, and social distrust. The thesis of societal malaise as a powerful concept to explain contemporary restrictions of macro-solidarity is tested with a Multiple-Group Structural Equation Model using data from 21 countries of the European Social Survey (wave 6 2012). A theory-guided approach is used to categorize European nations into six heterogeneous European areas. Statistical analyses reveal that new emerging factors of societal malaise indeed act as a mediator of classical explanations of ethnocentrism. From a comparative perspective, the determinants of macro-solidarity are strongly heterogeneous throughout the six European areas particularly between the East and West of the European Union. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to integrate the theory of planned behavior (TBP) and the technology acceptance model (TAM) in social marketing to predict and explain technology adoption (gym equipment use) in physical activity (PA) behavior among Ghanaian youth. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach was adopted for this study. The empirical data for this paper were drawn from 314 youth who are gym equipment users. The hypothesized relationships were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: This study found that the salient beliefs, namely, attitude, subjective norm and behavioral control toward gym equipment use, do not sufficiently explain PA adoption. However, a better result emerges when these salient beliefs are combined with perceived usefulness (PU) and ease of use (TAM). Practical implications: This paper provides evidence for issues of potential research, policy and managerial interest. The study findings showed that PA adoption, not PEOU, was directly impacted by PU. Thus, policymakers and implementers of social marketing intervention programs should promote the positive attitude toward gym equipment technology use and the perceptions of usefulness (improve cardiorespiratory fitness, feeling healthy and building muscle strength) of using gym equipment technology instead of ease of use to increase PA technology adoption behavior. Originality/value: Considering the uniqueness of this current study in the Ghanaian context, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first to integrate two influential theories, namely, the TPB and TAM, to examine the effects of the TPB and TAM variables on the adoption of technology (gym equipment use) in PA among the youth. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Responding to the call for an extension of social marketing scope and application, this paper aims to outline implementation of a multi-stream, multi-method formative research approach to understanding human trafficking in the global South context of Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected using a multi-method, multi-stream research design. The study used alternative methods allowing a critical perspective to be taken. Findings: Contradictions between upstream discourses and the lived experiences of trafficked individuals emerged. Specifically, moral and rational agency ideology, which conflates human trafficking with prostitution, unintentionally promotes human trafficking and underrepresents other forms of trafficking was evident. Experiences of socioeconomic oppression, traditional practices and an aspirational culture fuels positive attitudes towards human trafficking. The lived experience of human trafficking survivors while varied was underpinned by the common theme of job seeking. Participants perceived human traffickers as benevolent users rather than oppressors, and their rescue as oppressive and disempowering. Research limitations/implications: Application of a multi-stream approach is limited by research context, sample size, time and cost constraints. Future research extending the multi-stream research approach to other research contexts and groups is recommended. Practical implications: Multi-stream formative research design assisted to yield wider insights, which informed the design of a multilevel pilot intervention to combat human trafficking in Nigeria. Originality/value: Extending understanding beyond individual, myopic approaches that have dominated social marketing formative research. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Heavy dependence on fossil fuels among rural households contributes to GHG emissions and air pollution while increasing landfill loads in Poland. This study examines benefits from the renewable energy utilization support program that subsidized household purchase and installation of thermal solar panels. This review of synergy between energy, climate, and air quality policies focuses on solar panel subsidies funded through the European Union and county governments in Mazowieckie Voivodship in Poland. County government offices, using the unpublished list of households receiving subsidies for thermal solar panel installation, mediated in the implementation of the survey and collected 123 completed questionnaires in May and June 2015. The heteroscedasticity-corrected OLS estimates two equations identifying and quantifying factors influencing the purchase price of solar panels and rural household monthly energy bill savings after installation using the gathered data. Among sociodemographic variables, increasing age was associated with an increasing price paid for the panels, but education was associated with paying a lower price for solar panels and lower self-reported energy bill savings. Panel purchase price increased if the respondent was a farmer, viewed subsidies as important, and preferred domestically manufactured panels. Location of household increased the price as compared to the reference county. Savings on monthly energy bills increased if respondent had a positive view of solar energy, expected a decrease in the bill following the purchase of panels, and heated large areas in the house. Subsidy programs have been important in increased household solar energy utilization, especially among farm households, while self-reported energy bill savings increased with positive attitudes towards renewable energy and the larger heated areas in rural residences. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of transformational leadership (TL) on organizational commitment (OC) with the mediating role of organizational justice (OJ) in the higher education (HE) sector in Syria. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected from 502 employees from six HE institutions. Two measures of organizational outcomes were selected for this study, namely, job satisfaction (JS) and OC. Using structural equation modelling (SEM), the authors tested four alternative models to indicate the relationship between leadership and organizational outcomes. Findings: TL has both direct and indirect effects on OC through interactional justice (IJ). TL has an impact on JS through procedural justice (PJ) and IJ as intermediate variables, while transactional leadership (TrL) has an impact on JS through distributive justice (DJ). The three types of OJ have an impact on OC through JS. The authors found that the national culture may not influence the impact of the leader in the current globalization context, as the results were similar to the Western studies. Practical implications: The findings of the study provide managers of the HE sector with insights into the formations of employees’ fairness perceptions, and with some guidelines for managing employees by documenting OJ to draw positive attitudinal and behavioral responses from employees. Originality/value: While most previous research has focused on exploring the relationship between leadership and OJ or between OJ and JS in the business sector, the study, however, seeks in addition, to pinpoint the effect of OJ as a mediate variable between the leadership and JS and OC in HE. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Based on social exchange theory and the substitutes for leadership theory, this paper aims to investigate whether an organization’s high-commitment HRM strategy can substitute for the effect of servant leadership in promoting employees’ affective commitment, psychological empowerment and intent to remain with the organization. Design/methodology/approach: This study’s hypotheses were tested with moderation and mediation analyses conducted on a sample of 172 Chinese employees. Findings: The results show significant negative interaction effects between high-commitment HRM systems and servant leadership, such that high levels of one will reduce the positive effect of the other on affective commitment and psychological empowerment. Further, the effects of high-commitment HRM systems and servant leadership on turnover intentions are mediated through affective commitment and psychological empowerment. Finally, support was found for a mediated moderation model where the negative interaction effect between high-commitment HRM systems and servant leadership on turnover intentions is mediated through affective commitment. Practical implications: The results of this study can help practitioners identify alternative means to influence employees’ positive attitudes and work motivation when implementing high-commitment HRM systems is not feasible for the organization. Originality/value: This study contributes to the leadership literature by providing evidence supporting the substitutes for leadership theory and describing the specific conditions under which this theory is valid, as well as contributing to the HRM literature by examining the dynamic interaction of HRM and leadership. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Microaggressions and expressions of overt discrimination negatively affect the experience of medical trainees at all levels. Mistreatment of trainees, including abusive and discriminatory behavior by patients and families, occurs commonly and is receiving increased attention in both the medical literature and popular press. Heightened awareness of the problem has sparked a call to engage in substantive conversations about bias in health professions education. The emphasis on direct observation in medical education makes the bedside a common setting for educators to witness these behaviors firsthand. Many educators are committed to developing a positive climate for learners but lack the training and skills to facilitate discussions about discrimination. As a result, these difficult but important conversations may not occur. The authors present a three-phase approach to responding to microaggressions and discrimination toward trainees from patients, and offer a communication toolkit that frontline medical educators can use in their daily practice. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Taken-for-granted knowledge about people from other social groups is a key challenge for overcoming stereotypes. This article describes a novel arts-based research method to visualise participants’ frames of distanced social groups and aims to trigger reflections among them. The Reflective Photobooth invites participants to dress up as members of distanced social groups, stage a scene, produce pictures, answer prompting questions, and discuss their visualisations. We argue that the artistic re-enactment that underlies the visualisation process can attract diverse groups of participants to engage with research topics, create places for the articulation of critical statements against existing societal clichés and stereotypical media representations, and trigger reflections among participants about taken-for-granted knowledge. The method was tested within the Frame-a-Farmer project, in which the social distance between consumers and food producers in modern agrifood systems was addressed. Results indicate that despite the method bearing some risks and facing some challenges, three promising areas of future application could be identified: (i) raising awareness among large groups of people, (ii) collecting stories or topical vignettes, and (iii) deconstructing taken-for-granted knowledge and societal clichés. © 2020, © 2020 International Visual Sociology Association.

AB  - This research explores the effects of visual representations of immigrants and refugees in U.S. news outlets. Study 1 examined news photographs about immigrants and refugees that were shared on Twitter by regional news outlets in all 50 states. Most photos contained either a human interest frame, featuring immigrants and refugees as everyday people, or a political frame, showcasing politicians. Study 2’s experiment determined the effects of these visuals on participants’ emotions and, in turn, their attitudes toward immigrants and refugees. The political frame increased negative emotions, leading to negative attitudes. The human interest frame increased positive emotions, enhancing positive attitudes. © 2019, © 2019 Broadcast Education Association.

AB  - How does media use and individualsʼ senses of political efficacy affect their attitudes towards immigrants in southern Europe? While studies of the media offer contrasting results concerning their effects on anti-immigrant sentiments, research on political efficacy shows that citizens who feel able to influence politics may develop more positive attitudes towards immigration. In this article, public perceptions of non-European immigrants, in the host countries, are analysed over time (2014–2017) using Eurobarometer data. By analysing the links between attitudes towards immigration, media use, and political efficacy during the migration crises using multivariate analysis, I find that in times of crisis the use of (traditional and new) media, and political efficacy, positively affect people’s attitudes towards non-European immigration. © 2019, © 2019 The Founding Editors, Contemporary Italian Politics.

AB  - This study examined the effects of joining and actively participating in electronic-cigarette-related social media communities (SMCs), along with e-cigarette-related subjective norms, and social identification with other electronic-cigarette (e-cigarette) users, on current e-cigarette users’ attitudes toward quitting, self-efficacy, and intention to quit. Results (n = 1016) indicated that greater e-cigarette-related social media use, more positive e-cigarette-related subjective norms and greater identification with other e-cigarette users, resulted in significantly more negative attitudes toward quitting, lower self-efficacy and lower intention to quit. E-cigarette-related social media use also interacted with subjective norms to influence intention to quit, and with identification with other e-cigarette users to influence self-efficacy. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The present article investigates socio-psychological conditions for the formation of ideas about the spiritual ideal for children of primary school age. The criteria (value-positive attitude of the child to the ideals of Beauty and Good, identification with the ideal bearers, imitation of the behaviour of people and literary characters, understanding of children’s own ideas about the spiritual ideal), indicators and levels (high, average, low) for the formation of the idea of a spiritual ideal in children of elementary school age are established. The results based on age and gender specifics and levels of formation of ideas about the spiritual ideal of primary school children are obtained. The factors influencing formation of the spiritual ideal and socio-psychological conditions of its formation are revealed: the peculiarities of relationships with others (parents, teachers, friends, peers, acquaintances and strangers); influence of mass media (TV products, computer network, radio information, books, literary works, magazines, newspapers); artistic aesthetic influence (works of art and theatre, communication with nature, aesthetic priorities and preferences, artistic amateur activities). © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - One hundred and eighty-eight participants completed the online questionnaire with items on demographics (age and gender), social exclusion, surveillance use, Facebook addiction, and narcissistic grandiosity. The findings showed that social exclusion was positively associated with Facebook addiction (B = 0.237, p < 0.001) and surveillance use was significantly positively associated with Facebook addiction (B = 0.211, p < 0.01). The surveillance use of Facebook was found to be a significant mediator between the risk of social exclusion on Facebook and Facebook addiction (B = 0.054, CI [0.20, 0.113]). Narcissistic grandiosity significantly moderated the associations between social exclusion and Facebook addiction (B = 0.079, p = 0.012). These findings suggest that the risk of social exclusion could serve as facilitator of Facebook addiction depending on narcissistic grandiosity. © 2019 by the author.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to conduct a preliminary study to assess knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) associated with antibiotic use among medical students (MS) and non-medical students (NMS) at Kathmandu University, Nepal. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 1223 students for a cross-sectional study. In total, 1222 questionnaires collected from 609 MS and 613 NMS were regarded as effective. A t-test and Chi-square test were applied to analyze the data. A total of 25 out of 39 questions in the KAP survey were found to have statistical significance. The MS showed higher levels of knowledge/attitude/practice associated with antibiotic use than the NMS. Significant gaps were found in and between the MS and NMS in the first and final years of study. Interventions, such as lectures, courses, workshops, and seminars on antibiotic use, along with internet and media campaigns, etc., are needed to improve the awareness and change the behavior of both the MS and the NMS of universities with regards to the rational use of antibiotics. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Since 2000, Vladimir Putin has used various means to consolidate a non-democratic regime in Russia. While regime support comes from many factors, the literature lacks consensus on whether social media use (SNS) associates with public support for non-democratic regimes. This study analyses whether using particular SNS platforms associate with more positive or negative evaluations of the regime in Russia. The mixed findings show that Russian SNS users have very nuanced attitudes towards the regime and its actors. Further, while Facebook and Twitter users are more critical of political actors and their work in protecting democracy, other platform-specific associations are additive. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Timber out-grower schemes have proved to be one of the most profitable enterprises for rural households. No wonder, several analysts and researchers regard them as an alternative model to avoid problems of displacement and create ‘win-win’ outcomes for both rural communities and private investors in forestry. However, understanding farmers’ knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards tree out-grower schemes plays a key role in farmers’ adoption of the interventions. This study examined these farmers’ attributes towards out-grower schemes in selected districts of Malawi. Data were collected from 300 farmers who were randomly selected between September and October 2017 through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. The results revealed that 82% of the respondents participated in timber out-grower schemes, piloted by WVI and ICRAF. Based on a median score of 4.75 (IQR 4–5), respondents were strongly agreed on their knowledge on timber out-grower schemes as a basis for adopting the intervention. Using the cumulative Cube-root frequency method of stratification, the results revealed that more than half (51%) of the respondents belonged to the high category, and thus had high knowledge of timber out-grower schemes, whereas 32% and 17% had very high and medium levels of knowledge, respectively. The study also revealed that 79.3% of the respondents had a positive attitude towards out-grower schemes. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a positive, significant relationship between marital status (r = 0.081), household size (r = 0.062), education (r = 0.051) and knowledge of the respondents on timber out-grower schemes. A significant positive relationship was also observed between marital status (r = 0.156), household size (0.178), education (0.002), ethnic group (0.151) and attitudes of the respondents towards timber out-grower schemes. However, a negative relationship between knowledge and attitude was revealed (r = −0.534). The study therefore concludes that socio-economic factors, such as gender, education, ethnic group and household size, should be considered in upscaling timber out-grower schemes in Malawi. © 2019, © 2019 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

AB  - Little is known about the experiences of lesbian and bisexual women with infants or children or about their views on trade-offs required by parenthood. In this study, we examined how reactions to experiences with infants/children, perceived trade-offs of parenthood, and self-reported nurturance vary as a function of women’s sexual orientation. Two hundred cisgender childless women (53 lesbian, 57 plurisexual, 90 heterosexual) from the United States, recruited via social media, participated in this study. Results showed that lesbian women reported more negative attitudes toward infants/children and parenthood than did heterosexual women. Self-reported nurturance did not differ as a function of sexual orientation. Overall, lesbian women reported that they had less favorable experiences with infants and/or children and that they anticipated more social and economic costs involved with parenthood than did heterosexual women. Lesbian women also reported lower aspirations for parenthood than heterosexual women, and this was largely accounted for by differences in perceptions of the trade-offs involved with parenthood. Plurisexual women did not differ from lesbian or heterosexual women on any outcome. These results contribute to our understanding of why lesbian women are, on average, less likely than heterosexual women to aspire to parenthood. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The growing incidence and health implications for those affected make T2DM a major public health issue. Objectives: To compile a demographic, anthropometric and knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) profile of adult patients with T2DM in the public health sector of the Free State province, South Africa. Design: A descriptive observational study was conducted. Setting: A total of 255 participants attending public health facilities in the Free State were interviewed. Outcome Measures: Questionnaires were completed in an interview to determine demographics and KAP. Anthropometric measurements were obtained by standard techniques. Results: The majority of the participants (n = 222; 87.1%) were black women from urban areas, who were overweight and obese. The median age at diagnosis was 48 years (range 15–80 years), and 25 participants (9.8%) lacked formal schooling. In 212 participants (83.1%), a waist circumference above cut-off points was observed. Only half of the participants knew the normal range for blood glucose. Approximately 80% felt that they would be a different person if they did not have diabetes. Although 96.1% of participants were knowledgeable about the benefits of physical exercise, only 31.0% reported exercising on a daily basis. A statistically significant association was found between knowledge and attitudes, indicating that better knowledge about diabetes could be associated with a more positive attitude towards diabetes. Conclusion: Poor knowledge, a negative attitude and poor practices related to diabetes were observed in a very high percentage of participants, which may contribute to morbidity and mortality. The fact that knowledge was associated with attitude indicates that interventions aimed at improving knowledge could benefit patients in more than one way. Interventions to equip patients to successfully manage their condition are urgently required. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - This study evaluates environmental service-learning in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in relation to demographic variables and students' characteristics. A diverse group of school and community sites were recruited. Statistical analysis was performed between the final attitude index scores and demographic variables. UAE citizens were found to have a more positive attitude toward the environment than others. Educational level and age were also significantly associated with final attitude index scores. Participants aged 18–22 years scored significantly higher (p < 0.003) than those who were younger than 18 years and older than 22 years. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We propose a difference-in-differences approach for disentangling a total treatment effect within specific subpopulations into a direct effect and an indirect effect operating through a binary mediating variable. Random treatment assignment along with specific common trend and effect homogeneity assumptions identify the direct effects on the always and never takers, whose mediator is not affected by the treatment, as well as the direct and indirect effects on the compliers, whose mediator reacts to the treatment. In our empirical application, we analyze the impact of the Vietnam draft lottery on political preferences. The results suggest that a high draft risk due to the draft lottery outcome leads to an increase in mild preferences for the Republican Party, but has no effect on strong preferences for either party or on specific political attitudes. The increase in Republican support is mostly driven by the direct effect not operating through the mediator that is military service. © 2019, © 2019 American Statistical Association.

AB  - Nowadays, RFID technology is widely being used in libraries across the world. This study is in line with global literature pertaining to the implementation of RFID technology in libraries and intends to explore and examine the perceptions of employees from two libraries in Qatar. Data was collected from both staff and managers using two separate surveys. The perceptions of both sets of employees were analyzed and compared to highlight the differences in benefits, drawbacks, and issues concerning the implementation of RFID in contrast to barcode. 'Shelf management of resources,' 'perceived RFID contributions,' and 'workplace efficiency' were the top 3 rated dimensions pertaining to the use of RFID. Additionally, 'increased customer satisfaction' was rated the highest among the reasons as to why RFID is adopted in libraries and the fact that all negative decision determinants were moderately perceived when compared to the positive ones indicates the overall positive attitude of managers in these libraries towards RFID technology. Further conclusions and future work are proposed at the end of the study. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.

AB  - Introduction: The Javanese are the largest ethnic group in Indonesia. 87.84% of Indonesia’s population who suffer from dental disease also experience periodontal abnormalities. Severe periodontal diseases in a pregnant women can produce inflammatory mediators that can threaten the fetal placenta thereby increasing the chance of a preterm birth. Social support provided by the family can bring out a positive attitude and motivation for the mother to maintain oher health during their pregnancy. Objective: This study aimed to find out the impact of social support from the closest family of a pregnant women on their periodontal health. Method: This was an observational analytic study with a cross sectional design. The population in this study is pregnant women from Javanese ethnic group in the Pucang Sewu Public Health Center in Surabaya city, Indonesia. Sample calculation was determined using the simple random sampling technique and the sample size was 49 pregnant women. The data were analyzed using the spearman correlation test and multiple linear regression test. Results: In this study 65.3% of pregnant women had periodontal abnormalities in the form of gingivitis. This study found several predictor factors that linearly related to the occurrence of periodontal problems in pregnant women, these are: oral hygiene status (p = 0.002); the action of pregnant women in maintaining oral health and oral hygiene (p = 0.026); family support (p = 0.012); family knowledge (p = 0.005). Conclusion: Family support has an impact on the occurrence of periodontal problems in pregnant women. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Increasing the level of physical activity (PA) is an important strategy for reducing the burden of non-communicable diseases. Objectives: This study aimed at addressing the level and related factors of PA among adults in Kerman. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed among 1000 adults, using a multistage sampling method. The short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used. Chi-square, one-way ANOVA, and ordinal regression tests were used to assess the correlation between independent variables (age, gender, level of education, income, employment, marital status, and living in deprived areas) and level of PA. Results: The median of PA was 1584 MET-minutes/week. The level of PA was low in 25.6%, moderate in 44.4%, and vigorous in 30% of participants. Participants with higher ages (OR = 0.98; P = 0.008), those with pre-college education (OR = 0.63; P = 0.027), and students (OR = 0.50; P = 0.019) had a lower probability to be in a high level of PA. Men (OR = 2.17; P < 0.001) and those with an average income (OR = 1.53; P = 0.027) had a higher probability to be in a high level of PA. Conclusions: The level of PA is relatively low in Kerman. It seems that increasing awareness of the benefits of PA, creating a positive attitude towards PA, providing healthy transportation options, increasing PA facilities including sports spaces and enhancing social support are the most important strategies for increasing the level of PA in the Iranian society. © 2019, Author(s).

AB  - Disorder of autistic spectrum has a high rate of spread in Russia and the world. Russian statistics is subject to deformities in relation to the disease. People diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and their families are socially excluded. It manifests itself in the institutional plane and in the discursive media space. In the institutional environment, positive changes occur to solve the problem: The work of public organizations and special - virtual and real - social media platforms are intensifying, the information space of messages and news about autism is increasing, the conservative state system is gradually transforming measures of social and educational policies in an inclusive manner. However, at the institutional level of the mass media and public opinion, a wary and often prejudiced attitude towards people and children with mental disorders continues to persist. Among all types of disabilities, mental disorders are the most discriminated. This prevents the implementation of measures of social inclusion by civil society institutions and the state. Intensive informational and educational work with the Russian population is required to overcome myths and stereotypes regarding children and adults with ASD. © BEIESP.

AB  - Accurate confidence—confidence that reflects the accuracy of knowledge—can be relevant for decision-making in areas of high uncertainty. Accuracy of confidence is of particular importance in the area of climate change where scientifically correct information exists alongside misinformation in the public discourse and media. Here we assess the accuracy of confidence in climate change knowledge in a national German sample (n = 509). The accuracy of the confidence of the citizens in their climate change knowledge was only around half of what it could be based on the accuracy of their knowledge. Moreover, the accuracy of confidence controlling for knowledge accuracy was lower for climate change than for two benchmark comparisons: general science knowledge in another national German sample (n = 588), and climate change knowledge in a scientist sample (n = 207). Although these results cannot necessarily be generalized to the population of all indicators of climate change knowledge, the results suggest that the confidence of citizens in their climate change knowledge is unnecessarily fuzzy given their actual knowledge. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - We investigated the relationship between income inequality and all-cause mortality in 87 regional county municipalities (RCMs) of Quebec (Canada) while accounting for time lags and effects of other socioeconomic variables. We presumed to be true that income inequality entails stress and depression. Thus, these phenomena were tested as mediating factors. The data used consist of eight (8) area-based chronological variables: mortality rate, Gini index, disposable income, criminality rate, number of physicians, density of population, and the proportion of people reporting feeling stressed or depressed. The association between income inequality and mortality was analyzed using the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach with local fixed effects to control unobservable characteristics. Our results show that higher income inequality led to a significant increase of mortality rate with a time lag of 5 years when socioeconomic characteristics were held constant. As expected, households' disposable income and mortality rate were negatively associated. Moreover, mortality rate was positively associated with population density and negatively associated with the number of physicians. Finally, only depression showed the potential to act as a mediating factor. Based on our findings, we suggest that, over time, income inequality, by amplifying depression phenomena, increases the mortality rate in Quebec's RCMs. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Progress in advanced vehicular technologies and computer science leads to driverless vehicles becoming a reality. The standard ambulances might be replaced by driverless ambulances operated by an autopilot that provides passengers with a secure regime. Therefore, the study's aim was to collate two different countries regarding the consumers' preparedness to travel on such autonomous ambulances. To obtain a more demonstrative result, a questionnaire survey was conducted in two countries (Hungary and Kazakhstan). It also gathered 'affect' measures in order to figure out if 'affect' served as a medium between the ambulance mode and readiness to ride, and to understand whether emotions play any role during the decision making. The necessary data were collected through the so-called Autonomous Ambulance Acceptance Questionnaire. After conducting 't-Test', 'ANOVA', and Mediation analysis, the findings have been discussed. The results help to realize the necessity of developing educational guides to prepare potential patients for Autonomous Vehicles technology. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The understanding of the role of Cohesion Policy on the processes of European identity building is becoming more and more important in a period or resurgence of nationalisms and Euroscepticism. However, empirical evidence on this is still extremely scarce, due to both conceptual issues and data limitations. The present study tackles these limits and presents an empirical analysis of the way in which satisfaction with Cohesion Policy affected identification with Europe in EU regions between 2014 and 2017. Results show that this relationship is highly dependent on the intensity of funding spent, capturing the intensity of the European policy, and on the recent economic trend occurred at the regional level. This effect is boosted by a positive attitude towards EU institutions. © 2019 The Author(s). Regional Science Policy and Practice © 2019 RSAI

AB  - Public stigma surrounding HIV is related to heightened emotional distress, poor psychological functioning, and reduced subjective well-being in people living with HIV. For men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV, they may also face stigmatizing attitudes within the gay community, which create an additional burden to their health. Grounded in the psychological mediation framework, the present study examined the underlying psychological processes through which HIV stigma from the public and within the gay community influences the mental and social health of MSM living with HIV. Findings from 206 Chinese MSM living with HIV in Hong Kong indicated that negative self-concept, maladaptive coping, and peer isolation mediated the effect of HIV stigma on mental and social health. The study revealed the cognitive, regulatory, and interpersonal processes underlying HIV stigma and health. Feeling intense HIV stigma from the public and within the gay community may render MSM living with HIV more vulnerable to negative self-concept, maladaptive coping, and peer isolation, which contribute to poor mental and social health. To combat prejudice and discrimination against people living HIV, stigma reduction initiatives should be implemented not only in the public, but also in the gay community. Cognitive-behavioral interventions can also be used to restructure negative self-beliefs and build adaptive emotion regulation skills, which can improve stigma-related health outcomes among MSM living with HIV. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Strong anti-Islamic sentiments increased dramatically after the 9/11 terror attacks on the United States, leading to an uptick in prejudice and the perpetration of hate crimes targeting Muslims. Sikh men and boys, often mistaken for Muslims, suffered as collateral damage. The overall health of both communities has been adversely affected by these experiences. Faced with such realities, communities and parents often adopt adaptive behaviors to foster healthy development in their children. In this paper, drawing on interviews with 23 Sikh parents from 12 families, we examine Sikh parents’ ethno-religious socialization of their children. The confluence of media stereotyping and mistaken identities has shaped Sikh parents’ beliefs regarding their children’s retention/relinquishment of outward identity markers. Sikh parents, in general, are concerned about the safety of their boys, due to the distinctive appearance of their religious markers, such as the turban. They are engaged in a constant struggle to ensure that their children are not identified as Muslims and to protect them from potential harm. In most of the families in our study, boys were raised to give up wearing the indicators of their ethno-religious group. In addition, many parents took responsibility for educating the wider community about their ethno-religious practices through direct communication, participation in cultural events, and support of other ethno-religious minorities. Policy implications are discussed. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Social media is an important tool for disaster prevention and management. To reveal the public responses to disasters on social media in the context of East Asian culture, an urban flood disaster event that occurred inWuhan City, China, in the summer of 2016 was selected as a case. Data were collected from Sina-Weibo, which is the earliest and most popular social media platform in China. We categorized a total of 17,047 messages into four types, analyzed the Pearson correlation between information dissemination and precipitation, and identified the important accounts and their messages in the social networks by visualized analysis. The results show that there is a one-day lag between participation and public response. Message dissemination has a steeply downward trend over time, that is, a long tail effect. Information disseminates quickly within two hours, and then dissemination declines after four hours, with opinion messages disseminating faster than other types of messages. Famous news organizations and several celebrities play a leading role in social networks. In general, the participation of Chinese netizens in disaster events is lower than that of people inWestern countries, and social media is not yet used as a tool for disaster response. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate doctors’ intentions to raise a patient safety concern by applying the socio-psychological model ‘Theory of Planned Behaviour’. Design: Qualitative semi-structured focus groups and interviews. Setting: Training venues across England (North West, South East and South West). Participants: Sampling was purposeful to include doctors from differing backgrounds and grades. Main outcome measures: Perceptions of raising a patient safety concern. Results: While raising a concern was considered an appropriate professional behaviour, there were multiple barriers to raising a concern, which could be explained by the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Negative attitudes operated due to a fear of the consequences, such as becoming professionally isolated. Disapproval for raising a concern was encountered at an interpersonal and organisational level. Organisational constraints of workload and culture significantly undermined the raising of a concern. Responses about concerns were often side-lined or not taken seriously, leading to demotivation to report. This was reinforced by high-profile cases in the media and the negative treatment of whistle-blowers. While regulator guidance acted as an enabler to justify raising a concern, doctors felt disempowered to raise a concern about people in positions of greater power, and ceased to report concerns due to a perceived lack of action about concerns raised previously. Conclusions: Intentions to raise a concern were complex and highly contextual. The Theory of Planned Behaviour is a useful model to aid understanding of the factors which influence the decision to raise a concern. Results point to implications for policymakers, including the need to publicise positive stories of whistle-blowers and providing greater support to doctors. © 2019, The Royal Society of Medicine.

AB  - A common reaction experienced by family members of patients with psychosis is grief for the loss of their healthy relative. Importantly, high levels of perceived loss have been related to the manifestation of high expressed emotion (EE), which includes the negative attitudes expressed by relatives toward an ill family member. However, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between relatives' perceived loss and EE attitudes in the early stages of psychosis are still not fully understood. In this regard, attachment theory has been suggested as a useful framework for understanding this link. The current study aimed to examine: (1) whether relatives' perceived loss was associated with relatives' EE dimensions (i.e., criticism and emotional over-involvement (EOI)), and (2) whether such associations were mediated by relatives' attachment dimensions (i.e., anxiety and avoidance). Seventy-eight relatives of patients with early psychosis completed the Mental Illness Version of the Texas Inventory of Grief for the assessment of loss reactions. Attachment dimensions and EE attitudes were assessed by the Psychosis Attachment Measure and the Family Questionnaire, respectively. Findings indicated that relatives' perceived loss was associated with EE dimensions. Relatives' attachment anxiety, but not avoidance, mediated the relationship of perceived loss with both criticism and EOI. Findings highlight the importance of examining the role of relatives' attachment characteristics for understanding how perceptions of loss might impact the manifestation of EE attitudes in the early stages of psychosis. Family interventions aimed at assisting relatives to improve their management of negative emotional reactions to loss are fundamental to prevent impairing loss reactions and the entrenchment of high-EE attitudes. © 2019 Hinojosa-Marqués et al.

AB  - The microbiome is proving to be increasingly important for human brain functioning. A series of recent studies have shown that the microbiome influences the central nervous system in various ways, and consequently acts on the psychological well-being of the individual by mediating, among others, the reactions of stress and anxiety. From a specifically neuroethical point of view, according to some scholars, the particular composition of the microbiome-qua microbial community-can have consequences on the traditional idea of human individuality. Another neuroethical aspect concerns the reception of this new knowledge in relation to clinical applications. In fact, attention to the balance of the microbiome-which includes eating behavior, the use of psychobiotics and, in the treatment of certain diseases, the use of fecal microbiota transplantation-may be limited or even prevented by a biased negative attitude. This attitude derives from a prejudice related to everything that has to do with the organic processing of food and, in general, with the human stomach and intestine: the latter have traditionally been regarded as low, dirty, contaminated and opposed to what belongs to the mind and the brain. This biased attitude can lead one to fail to adequately consider the new anthropological conceptions related to the microbiome, resulting in a state of health, both physical and psychological, inferior to what one might have by paying the right attention to the knowledge available today. Shifting from the ubiquitous high-low metaphor (which is synonymous with superior-inferior) to an inside-outside metaphor can thus be a neuroethical strategy to achieve a new and unbiased reception of the discoveries related to the microbiome. © Cambridge University Press 2019.

AB  - Biodiversity is in worldwide decline and it is becoming increasingly important to expand biodiversity awareness and achieve broad-based support for conservation. We introduce the concept of species literacy, as knowledge about species can be a good starting point for engaging people in biodiversity. However, concern has been raised about a general lack of knowledge about native species. We explored species literacy via a species identification test in the Netherlands, and we investigated potential drivers of it. The dataset included 3210 general public participants, 602 primary school children aged 9/10, and 938 biodiversity professionals. A considerable gap in species literacy was found between professionals and laypeople. Knowledge about common, native animals was particularly low in children, who on average identified only 35% of the species correctly. Mammals received relatively high identification scores as compared to birds. Laypeople's species literacy increased with age and educational level, and was associated with positive attitudes towards nature and animals, media exposure and having a garden. The results indicate that a considerable part of the Dutch lay public is disconnected from native biodiversity. This points to a separation between people and nature that could hinder future efforts to preserve biodiversity. Our assessment can help bridge the gap between laypeople and professionals, as it can help set up communication and education strategies about native biodiversity that fit prior knowledge. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - From time to time the popular media draws attention to hate crimes and hate groups, evoking images of Nazi-Germany and the rise of fascism. The geographic association between hate groups and hate crimes is uncertain. In this research we ask whether hate crimes are co-located and correlated to the presence of hate groups to explore a potential association between these two phenomena. Publicly available point level data on hate crimes and hate groups collected by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) were aggregated to unitary framework of hexagonal grid cells of a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) at multiple scales for consistent analysis. We explore the effects of proximity by interpreting a co-location map, deploying a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) for count data, and apply a Spatial Lag Model (SLM) at multiple scales, to ascertain the effects of the size of the aggregation units on the relationship between hate groups and hate crimes. Controlled or uncontrolled for spatial dependence, at all scales, the Spatial Lag Model (SLM) shows that an average of 39.5% of the hate crimes was correlated with hate groups. These results are consistent with the existing research but show that in most instances spatial dependence was present, regardless of the size of the aggregation unit or the distance to neighboring cells. Our future research will consider additional racial, economic and social variables using a DGGS. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Background Framing bias occurs when people make a decision based on the way the information is presented, as opposed to just on the facts themselves. How the diagnostician sees a problem may be strongly influenced by the way it is framed. Does framing bias result in clinically meaningful diagnostic error? Methods We created three hypothetical cases and asked consultants and registrars in Emergency Medicine and Internal Medicine to provide their differential diagnoses and investigations list. Two of the presentations were written two ways to frame the case towards or away from a particular diagnosis (Presentation 2 - pulmonary embolus (PE) and Presentation 3 - interstitial lung disease (ILD)) and these were randomly assigned to the participants. Both versions were however entirely identical in terms of the objective facts. Physician impressions and diagnostic plan were compared. A third presentation was identical for all and served as a control for clinician baseline 'risk-averseness'. Results There were significant differences in the differential diagnoses generated depending on the presentation's framing. PE and ILD were considered and investigated for the majority of the time when the presentation was framed towards these diagnoses, and the minority of the time when it was not. This finding was most striking in Presentation 2, where 100%versus50% of clinicians considered PE in their diagnosis when the presentation was framed towards PE. This result remained robust when undertaking stratified analysis and logistic regression to account for differences in seniority and baseline risk-averseness -neither of the latter variables had any effect on the result. Conclusion We demonstrate a clinically meaningful effect of framing bias on diagnostic error. The strength of our study is focus on clinically meaningful outcomes: investigations ordered. This finding has implications for the way we conduct handovers and teach juniors to communicate clinical information. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

AB  - This research examined whether linguistic abstraction in group-directed criticisms moderates the intergroup sensitivity effect. Study 1 (N = 76) showed that criticisms coming from an out-group member and formulated in concrete terms—which imply lower generalizability and stability of the information transmitted—provoked less negative reactions compared with out-group criticisms formulated in abstract terms. Linguistic abstraction did not affect reactions to in-group criticism. In Study 2 (N = 77), receivers of concrete criticism from an out-group representative attributed less hostile intentions and prejudice to the critic, and this mediated the impact of critic group membership and linguistic abstraction on negativity toward criticism. Participants also reported more favorable attitudes toward the out-group as a whole when out-group criticism was formulated in concrete terms. This research underlines that linguistic abstraction can facilitate or obstruct effective group communication, and has important implications for the development of communicative strategies aiming to promote social change. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Objectives: Progress on health equity will require a robust metric. The aim of this article is to propose a new health equity metric that is distinct from existing measures and that allows meaningful comparisons across time and place, is calculable using health data typically available, and measures health equity across all major forms of social exclusion. Study design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: The new health equity measure was calculated using data included from all 50 states and the District of Columbia in the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, collected by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The total sample size was 287,602. State-specific sample sizes ranged from 2269 (Alaska) to 14,685 (Kansas) with a median of 4452. A Healthy Days measure was calculated as the mean number of days that the respondents reported being physically healthy and mentally healthy out of the previous 30 days. The proposed measure defines individual health disutility as the distastefulness associated with one's health falling short of optimal achievable health, instrumentalized as the median health of the most socially privileged category, that of upper-income white men. The value of the health equity metric in a population is the mean value of this distastefulness over the entire population and has a theoretical range of -∞ to 1. Results: There is substantial variation across states (mean: 0.13; standard deviation: 0.15), with the District of Columbia (0.48), Minnesota (0.37), and Connecticut (0.30) showing the greatest health equity, and West Virginia (−0.26), Arkansas (−0.18), and Kentucky (−0.13) exhibiting the least. Across states, the value of the health equity metric is not correlated with the size of black-white health disparities. Conclusions: It is feasible to use a single health equity metric for consistent and objective measurement of health equity. Doing so may facilitate more rapid progress toward health equity. © 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health

AB  - Objective: A waiting list randomised control trial has shown the Move More Pack, a print-based intervention supported by Internet tools, to improve physical activity levels in cancer survivors; however, one-third of them do not improve from the intervention. The objective of this process evaluation is to understand intervention use, the mechanisms of impact, the perceived benefits and the contextual factors influencing these, identifying for whom it is a useful resource. Methods: The process evaluation used mixed methods, based on guidance from the UK Medical Research Council, including 181 questionnaire responses on intervention use and physical activity improvement over 12 weeks, 56 open-text responses and 17 semistructured interviews. Results: The Move More Pack was suggested to be most useful when delivered towards the start of the cancer journey to those with a positive attitude to fight cancer but with a low level of physical activity, capitalising on a teachable moment. It was suggested that healthcare professionals could support the effective distribution of the Move More Pack. The intervention's printed components were more popular and well used than the Internet tools. Use of the printed intervention components was positively correlated with physical activity improvement but use of the Internet tools was not. Women were more likely to use the intervention's printed components than men. Cancer survivors using the intervention reflected that they had increased confidence and motivation for physical activity and other lifestyle behaviours. Conclusion: The Move More Pack should be offered by healthcare professionals, during cancer treatment, when health is salient, to those with a positive attitude to fight cancer but with low levels of physical activity. Use of the intervention's printed components is more likely to improve physical activity than the Internet tools, and the components are more likely to be used by women. The use of Internet tools to support physical activity improvement in cancer survivors requires further investigation. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - A tightly controlled activity of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) including renin, angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACEs), and angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors is critical not only for maintaining systemic hemodynamics and blood volume but also for controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue remodeling in target organs. ACE inhibitors or Ang II receptor type 1 (AT1R) blockers are widely used as first line drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases that are caused by chronical activation of RAS. However, about 15% of patients using ACE inhibitors develop side effects in the skin and the underlying mechanisms have been poorly understood or even neglected. Herein we show an endogenous RAS in maintaining self-renewal and regeneration potential of epidermal stem cells (ESCs) thereby contributing to wound healing. Firstly, we found that ESCs may express ACE, and its members in wound edges were positively associated with wound healing in Captopril-treated rats. Secondly, we demonstrated that human ESCs had a functional RAS including ACE1, ACE2, Ang II, AT1R, and AT2R. ACE-Ang II axis maintains human ESC function via activation of both AT1R and AT2R, which are negatively regulated by each other. Ang II-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)1 and STAT3 was mediated by the negative cross-talk between AT1R and AT2R in human ESCs. These results suggest that Ang II is a critical regulator of ESC function and ESC-mediated epidermal regeneration. Inappropriate interruption of Ang II-operated signaling may prejudice ESC function leading to impaired skin wound healing or even disease. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: We sought to investigate the relationship between cervical cord compression and factors related to whole-spine sagittal balance. Methods: This retrospective single-center study included patients who visited our clinic for the evaluation of lumbar pathology including trauma and degeneration. Patients aged 60–89 years who underwent whole-spine sagittal T2 scout magnetic resonance imaging and whole-spine radiograph between 2014 and 2018 were included in our study. We consecutively enrolled 100 patients for our study without any prejudice. We collected data on patient characteristics, diagnosis, cervical cord compression index (CCI), sagittal vertical axis (C7-S1, C2-7), and other parameters related to sagittal balance such as pelvic incidence minus lumbar lordosis. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to compare CCI with each whole-spine sagittal balance parameter. Results: Of the 100 patients, 44 were men. The mean age was 74.21 years. On the basis of Pearson correlation coefficients, CCI showed the strongest positive linear correlation with C7-S1 sagittal vertical axis (r = 0.688; P < 0.01), followed by the C2-7 sagittal vertical axis (r = 0.563; P < 0.01). Conclusions: Cervical cord compression is more likely to develop in patients with sagittal imbalance. It is important to use whole-spine radiograph and whole-spine T2 scout magnetic resonance imaging to analyze CCI in these patients. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Phubbing is a kind of social exclusion and is used to indicate the interruption mobile phone usage has on a social relationship. Theoretical and practical evidence illustrates that parents' behavior have a strong influence on adolescents' deviant behaviors. The present study aimed to determine if adolescents' mobile phone addiction increase after being phubbed by parents, and examine effects of the mediating roles of parent-child attachment, deviant peer affiliation, and moderating role of gender. The study sample comprised 1007 adolescents (518 girls and 489 boys). Multivariable regression with bootstrap sampling was executed to test the moderated mediation. Results revealed that parents' phubbing was positively related to adolescents' mobile phone addiction (β = 0.30, p < .001). Parent-child attachment and deviant peers was found to mediate the relationship between parents' phubbing, ab = 0.06, 95% CI = [0.04, 0.09], and adolescents' mobile phone addiction ab = 0.03, 95% CI = [0.01, 0.05]; while gender was found to moderate the indirect effect of parents' phubbing on mobile phone addiction through deviant peers; the indirect effect was stronger for boys than for girls. These findings illustrate that parents' phubbing is a risk factor for adolescent mobile phone addiction. © 2019

AB  - Objective: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) sustained in childhood is associated with poor social outcomes. This study investigated the role of theory of mind (ToM) as a mediator of the relation between TBI and peer rejection/victimization and reciprocated friendships, as well as the moderating effect of parental nurturance on those relationships. Method: Participants were children of 8-13 years old (M = 10.45, SD = 1.47), including 13 with severe TBI, 39 with complicated mild/moderate TBI, and 32 children with orthopedic injuries. Data on peer rejection/victimization and friendship were collected in school classrooms using the Extended Class Play and friendship nominations. Parents rated parental nurturance using the Child-Rearing Practices Report. Finally, ToM was measured based on children's average performance across three tasks measuring different aspects of ToM. Results: Severe TBI was associated with poorer ToM, greater peer rejection/victimization, and fewer reciprocated friendships. ToM mediated the relation between severe TBI and peer rejection/victimization (i.e., severe TBI predicted poorer ToM, which in turn predicted greater rejection/victimization). Parental nurturance significantly moderated this relation, such that the mediating effect of ToM was significant only at low and average levels of parental nurturance, for both severe and complicated mild/moderate TBI groups. Neither the mediating effect of ToM nor the moderating effect of parental nurturance was significant for reciprocated friendships. Conclusion: High parental nurturance may mitigate the negative effects of ToM deficits on risk of peer rejection/victimization among children with TBI. Interventions designed to increase parental nurturance or ToM may promote better social outcomes among children with TBI. © INS. Published by Cambridge University Press, 2019.

AB  - The current study tested the impact of different messaging interventions on changing attitude and behaviour in relation to Red and Processed Meat Consumption (RPMC). The study compared the effectiveness of receiving fourteen daily messages on the health, environment, or health + environment benefits of reduced RPMC, against a no message control condition. All three intervention conditions also received daily reminders of the goal regarding RPMC and were asked to record RPMC using a food diary. Participants in the control condition were only asked to use a food diary to record daily food intake. Behaviour and attitude in relation to RPMC of all participants were assessed at Time 1 (pre-message), Time 2 (immediately post-message, two weeks later) and Time 3 (one month later again). Participants were Italian undergraduates (at Time 1 N = 322) randomly allocated to one of the four conditions. Only those completing all measures at all time points were retained for analysis (N = 241). Results showed that health message condition and environment message condition, but not health + environment messages condition, were effective in increasing a positive attitude towards reduced RPMC compared to the control condition. Attitude mediated the effects of health condition and environmental condition on the reduction of behaviour. The effects of health and environment messages on attitude and behaviour persisted for one month after the end of the intervention. Implications for devising effective messaging intervention to change RPMC are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Introduction: Among several different instruments developed to compare the complexity of healthcare processes, relative value units (RVUs) are among the most well-known and widely used in hospitals, but despite being a recognized management tool, in our setting, the few studies published have been based on theoretical assumptions. Our objective was to assess the level of complexity of each process in our service and to determine the RVUs generated, in order to relate complexity and costs. Methods: During 2014, data were retrospectively collected for 840 cancer patients from the Radiation Oncology Department, Araba University Hospital. Activity times and costs were subsequently assigned to calculate RVUs for each activity, cancer subtype and treatment option. Results: The activity associated with the lowest cost, assigned an RVU of 1, was simulation (phase changes) in treatment, with an annual cost of €9933, while that with the highest cost, assigned the greatest number of RVUs, was administration of treatment by radiotherapy technicians (RTTs) (€633,754 and 63.80 RVUs). The care process that consumed the most resources was adjuvant treatment of breast cancer (€998,070), equivalent to 364.62 RVUs compared to the cheapest subtype of adjuvant treatments or 2440 RVUs compared to the care process that used the fewest resources overall. Conclusion: The most expensive activities are those which are the most complex or consume the most resources. Knowledge of RVUs may be employed to analyse our activity and assess the possibility of increasing the efficiency of our service without prejudicing quality. © 2019 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to characterize the Portuguese general population's knowledge and attitudes about postpartum depression, and analyze its sociodemographic and clinical correlates. Design: A cross-sectional internet survey. Setting: Participants were recruited through advertisements on social media websites, in thematic forums and by email. Participants: A total of 621 people in the general population (88.1% women) participated in the study. Measurements: Participants were questioned about sociodemographic and clinical data, personal contact with postpartum depression, awareness of public education campaigns about postpartum depression and knowledge and attitudes towards postpartum depression (outcome variables). Findings: The sample presented a good level of knowledge and positive attitudes about postpartum depression despite the existence of some gaps in knowledge and some stereotypes. Personal contact with postpartum depression was associated with higher levels of knowledge (p < .001) and more positive attitudes towards postpartum depression (p < .001) and participants who assisted to public education campaigns reported higher levels of knowledge about postpartum depression (p < .001). Lower levels of knowledge and more negative attitudes about postpartum depression were found in men and older and less educated people. Key conclusions and implications for practice: These results show the importance of awareness-raising and education campaigns directed at the general population, particularly focusing on people who can act as the postpartum women's support network (e.g., partners, parents, in-laws), to increase the level of knowledge and to foster more positive attitudes towards postpartum depression. © 2019

AB  - Background: Discussions about invasiveness of care (advanced directives) and end-of-life issues have become frequent among intensivists and patients. Nevertheless, there are considerable divergences in the attitudes between intensivists and patients toward end-of-life care in the intensive care units (ICU). Methods: The goal was to compare the preferences between intensivists and general public regarding ICU admission of a hypothetical patient with six different clinical outcomes. For that, intensivists and the general public (university graduate professionals outside the area of health) were invited to participate in this study. A survey was conducted with a hypothetical patient with six different clinical outcomes ranging from ICU discharge without any neurological sequelae, nor dependence for daily activities, to death. The WHOQOL-BREF was applied. Comparisons were made between the answers provided by intensivists regarding what they would choose for themselves and their patients, and the preferences of general public. Results: Between July 2013 and July 2016, 300 participants in 5 hospitals in São Paulo, Brazil were invited to participate in this study, of whom 257 (85.7%) responded the survey. Eighty-two intensivists responded what they would choose for themselves, 81 intensivists responded what they would choose for their patients, and 94 people from general public responded what they would choose for themselves. Quality of life did not differ among the groups. In all scenarios, except when the outcome was severe disability or death, intensivists were more likely to choose ICU admission for their patients than for themselves (p < .05 for all). Compared with general public, intensivists were more likely to choose ICU admission for themselves only when the best clinical scenario outcome is considered (p < .001). General public was significantly less prone to choosing ICU admission than intensivists when choosing for their patients, in three out of six scenarios (p < .001 for all). Conclusions: Considerable divergences exist between intensivists' and patients' preferences toward end-of-life care. Advanced care planning and effective ongoing communication among intensivists, patients and relatives are essential to improve end-of-life decisions and the quality of care. © 2019

AB  - Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) have a heightened sensitivity to social exclusion. Experimental manipulations have produced inconsistent findings and suggested that baseline negative affect (NA) might influence the experience of exclusion. We administered a standardized social exclusion protocol (Cyberball paradigm) in BPD (n = 39) and age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 29) to investigate the association of NA on social exclusion and activation in brain regions previously implicated in this paradigm. Compared with controls, patients with BPD showed higher activation during social exclusion in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and in the right precuneus. Prescan NA ratings were associated with higher brain activation in the ACC and mPFC over all conditions, and post hoc t tests revealed that differences between the groups were only significant when controlling for NA. Brain activation during exclusion was correlated with NA separately for each group. Only BPD patients showed a significant association of NA and exclusion related precuneus activation (r =.52 p =.001). Additionally, BPD patients experienced less feelings of belonging compared with a healthy control (HC) group during inclusion and exclusion, although they estimated their ball possessions significantly higher than did the HC. These findings suggest that baseline NA has a crucial impact on Cyberball-related brain activation. The results underscore the importance of considering levels of NA in social exclusion protocols for participants high in this trait. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Attitudes of drug-abstinent youth considering marijuana initiation can be highly ambivalent. Invalidating pro-usage elements (i.e., opinions)of ambivalent marijuana attitudes, while leaving anti-marijuana elements intact, may create stronger, less ambivalent marijuana-resistant attitudes and lower usage intentions, while concurrently elucidating the role of ambivalence in persuasive prevention. Method: From an initial pool of marijuana-abstinent middle-school students (N = 538), the quintile expressing the most negative attitudes toward a marijuana prevention appeal (N = 101)were randomly assigned to one of three conditions designed to invalidate pro-marijuana opinions. Analyses then tested their susceptibility to a second marijuana prevention appeal. Results: Personally threatening messages were found ineffective, but appeals contesting resistant responses significantly decreased ambivalence (p <.01). Mediational analyses showed that this decreased ambivalence was associated with less favorable attitudes and lower marijuana usage intentions (both p <.001). An attribution-based manipulation increased ambivalence (p <.05), which was associated with positive usage intentions mediated through positive attitudes (both p <.001). Conclusion: Analyses elucidated the role of attitude ambivalence in prevention, providing a more complete understanding of potential facilitative use of ambivalence in prevention models based on prevention. Results support the further examination and use of methods that invalidate pro-marijuana opinions, thereby leading to greater susceptibility to subsequent prevention appeals. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - ‘If it bleeds, it leads’, events characterised by fatalities, are likely to attract high levels of media coverage. This study adopts a multidisciplinary approach to investigate public discourses on the MH17 tragedy in Malaysia and the United Kingdom. First, corpus-based discourse analysis was employed to explore the construction of the Malaysian Airlines tragedy MH17 in four selected Malaysian and British newspapers. In addition, an attitudinal study examining 50 Malaysian and 50 UK nationals’ perceptions of the tragedy was conducted. Keywords analysis revealed an overall tendency for the news media to construct the air tragedy through classifications between ‘us’ and ‘others’. Specifically, important ‘Us’ (Malaysian elites) and non-important ‘Other’ (non-Malaysian) in the Malaysian newspapers, versus good ‘Us’ (the West) and evil ‘Others’ (Russia) in the British newspapers. The attitudinal analysis shows, for both the Malaysian and the UK respondents, the most salient associations with the MH17 tragedy related to ‘conflicts’. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Urban stream syndrome, including urban waterlogging, flood risk, water shortage, water pollution and ecological restoration, are major challenges that cause potential risks to human beings. Recently, the sponge city construction (SCC) initiative in China has received extensive attention because it aims to systematically solve all of these urban water-related issues for a city. To date, little research has focused on the life-cycle operations, maintenance requirements and low public awareness of sponge city facilities (SCFs; e.g., rain gardens, green roofs, grass swales, and pavement greenbelts), which are challenges facing the development and sustainability of the SCC initiative. The aim of this study is to explore (i) the willingness to pay (WTP) for the life-cycle maintenance of SCFs and its determinants and (ii) the public's perceptions and attitudes towards the SCC initiative. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey combined with contingent valuation in three pilot sponge cities and then applied a two-phase logistic model and Tobit model to estimate the WTP of the respondents and the factors influencing the WTP. The results show that 76% of the respondents agreed to pay for life-cycle maintenance of SCFs, and the median amount of WTP was 16.57 CNY (2.53 USD) per month. Important factors influencing WTP include respondents’ perceptions of the efficacy of the SCFs, concerns regarding the waterlogging risk and support for the SCF construction plans. The findings of this research extend our knowledge of the public's perceptions of and attitudes towards the SCC initiative and suggest that public contributions could serve as a crucial and feasible funding source for the life-cycle maintenance of SCFs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We report on a study of the longitudinal effects of the 2014 World Cup on the host Brazil's overall image and for tourism intentions in three other countries (total sample = 207). Brazil's image declined significantly 2013–2014 on some but not all measures and improved amongst a significant minority. The mixed outcomes are explained by the moderating effects of respondent personality, their involvement in the event (rather than in the sport being hosted) and their perception of the news they had been exposed to. Those who held a relatively negative attitude towards Brazil before the event tended to be positively influenced by positive media, watching the closing ceremony and by searching for news about Brazil. Those relatively high in Openness to Experience were less likely to report a reduction in attitude. The net effect was an improvement in tourism intentions, mainly among those less likely to visit pre-event and a decline among most others. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The veteran cohort has been inextricably linked in the general public’s mind by media-generated perceptions of high risk and fear of crime, echoed in wider contemporary debates linking issues of place, social identity, social exclusion, and a loss of belonging in wider communities. Despite the growing interest in the longer term outcomes of transition from military to civilian life from policy-makers, practitioners, and academics, few qualitative studies explore the social and relational impacts of this transitional experience on those who have experienced it. Tensions and frustrations expressed by ex-forces personnel, engaging in addiction services with a history of engagement in the criminal justice sector, are explored through the lens of belongingness, loss and related citizenship frameworks to expose temporal impacts on the acquisition, loss, and reformulation of a sense of belonging across the life course. The relevance of a significant loss of belonging in the transition from military to civilian life is useful, given the widely accepted damaging consequences of having this need thwarted. This article concludes that a broader understanding of this largely disenfranchised grief can enable more informed reflexive opportunities to facilitate a valued military veteran citizenship status and thereby contribute to the formulation of current policy debates concerning the veteran question. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Objective Psychiatric disorders are often considered the leading cause of violence. This may be due to a stereotype created by media and general opinion.Method The Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS) was used to evaluate the severity of aggressive and violent behaviors in 400 patients who attended a post-acute psychiatric service in Milan from 2014 to 2016 and suffered from different psychiatric disorders. The psychopathological clinical picture was evaluated by Clinical Global Impression (CGI). The study also assessed the possible correlation between epidemiologic and sociodemographic factors, clinical variables, and aggression and violence.Results Of the total number of subjects, 21.50% showed a MOAS score >0, 11.50% presented mild aggression (0-10 MOAS weighted score), 9% moderate aggression (11-20), and 1% severe aggression (MOAS >20). With respect to violent behaviors, 16% of patients showed a score >0 in one MOAS subscale other than verbal aggression according to violence definition. The severity of clinical picture seemed to be related to higher weighted MOAS score. Multivariate testing of different sociodemographic and clinical variables showed that violence was related to unemployment status, and significantly correlated to compulsory admission (TSO), suicide attempts (TS), and personality disorders, while the severity of clinical psychiatric picture seemed to play a secondary role.Conclusion Results have shown that personality disorders and sociodemographic factors, including economic factors, seem to be major determinants of violence among patients diagnosed with mental disorders. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - People higher in benevolent sexism often outwardly endorse gender equality, but support men over women for challenging positions and experiences. Reflecting shifting standards (a tendency to evaluate stereotyped group members against within-category judgment standards), people higher in sexism may evaluate prominent women’s competence against a lower competency standard for women (who are stereotyped as less competent than men are), and not against a standard for men. Thus prominent women could be perceived as especially competent (versus other women), yet men might still garner ultimate support. Study 1 tested for this possibility using an ecologically valid example: the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Study 1 showed that benevolent (and not hostile) sexism predicted less opposition to Donald Trump’s candidacy and more positive attitudes toward the election outcome among 57 mostly female U.S. college students. Study 1 also showed that benevolent sexism positively predicted competence perceived in Hillary Clinton. To determine if this positive relationship reflected shifting standards, we manipulated the gender to which a prominent woman would be compared in Study 2 with 189 U.S. adults. Reflecting shifting standards, benevolent sexism related to evaluating women as more competent when they were evaluated against other women versus other men. Shifting standards also mediated a relationship between benevolent sexism and expecting lower female success. Using shifting standards may be one way that people higher in benevolent sexism might evaluate prominent women as especially competent, yet ultimately support men. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - We examined the interrelation between religiosity, anti-intellectualism, and political mistrust in predicting belief in conspiracy theories. Improving on previous psychological research on the link between religiosity and societal and political attitudes, we assessed the predictive power of religious self-categorization and the importance attached to one's own (non)religious worldview predicting belief in conspiracy theories separately. Applying quota sampling in a study in Australia (N = 515), the sample consisted of 48.9% believers (i.e., those who self-categorized as religious persons) and 51.1% non-believers (i.e., those who self-categorized as non-religious persons). The results showed that believers and non-believers did not differ in the belief in conspiracy theories. Unpacking this further though, we did find that the extent to which religious worldviews were endorsed predicted belief in conspiracy theories. Among believers, the importance attached to their religious worldview was directly associated with higher belief in conspiracy theories and this link was partly mediated by higher anti-intellectualism. Political trust, in turn, served as an inhibitor of the link between religiosity and conspiracy beliefs. Among non-believers, there was no direct association between the importance of non-religious worldview and belief in conspiracy theories. However, we found that higher trust in political institutions accounted for the negative association between non-religious worldview and lower belief in conspiracy theories. The results underline the importance of distinguishing religiosity as a self-categorization and religiosity as a worldview. We find that it is not the self-categorization as religious, but the extent to which religious worldviews are endorsed that could predict people's beliefs in conspiracy theories. © 2019 The British Psychological Society

AB  - Intergroup contact is the leading strategy for reducing the stigma associated with mental illness. For the first time, the current study examines the effectiveness of a contemporary intergroup contact strategy, called electronic or E-contact, to reduce stigma against people diagnosed with schizophrenia. It also examines the mediating role of three target-relevant intergroup emotions, namely fear, anger, and pity. In total, 133 participants engaged in E-contact with a person diagnosed with schizophrenia (intergroup E-contact), E-contact with a person without a mental illness (intragroup E-contact), or no contact. Compared to the intragroup E-contact and no-contact conditions, intergroup E-contact reduced fear, anger, and stereotyping toward people with schizophrenia. Additionally, fear and anger, but not pity, were found to be significant affective mediators of the E-contact effect. The findings demonstrate the value of computer-mediated intergroup contact for stigma reduction, and emphasize the importance of intergroup emotions in this domain. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - We aimed to create an engaging and dynamic intervention for schools that uses videos of direct school peer contact to implement a vicarious contact intervention. Participants were ethnic majority (Italian) and minority (immigrant) high school students (N = 485; age ranging from 14 to 22 years old, Mage = 17.24 years), who were asked to watch and evaluate videos created by peers from their school for a competition for the best video on intercultural friendships. Results revealed that vicarious contact, relative to a control condition where participants were not shown any videos, improved outgroup attitudes, reduced negative outgroup stereotypes, and increased willingness to engage in contact with the outgroup. These effects only emerged when intercultural friendships in the videos were salient. Inclusion of the other in the self, but neither intergroup anxiety nor fear of rejection by the outgroup, significantly mediated the effect of the videos on outcomes. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of the findings. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The positive effects of intergroup contact on prejudice reduction have been widely validated by now. However, the potential of contact for intergroup relations is only available when there is readiness to have contact with outgroup members to begin with. In two correlational studies with the main ethnic groups in postconflict Kosovo, Albanian majority (Study 1, N = 221) and Serb minority (Study 2, N = 110), we examine how social identity complexity mechanism and distinctiveness threat contribute to predicting more readiness to have contact with outgroup members. As the establishment of a new national identity unfolds, we show that while there are different processes that work for each of the groups, distinctiveness threat is a central concern to both as it mediates the relationship between identity and intergroup outcomes. For the Albanian majority group, having more complex identities (or perceiving less identity overlap between national and ethnic identity) predicts more readiness to have contact and feeling more positively towards members of the outgroup via reduced distinctiveness threat. For the Serb minority, however, threat is predicted only by strength of ethnic identification, which in turn predicts negative feelings towards members of the ethnic outgroup and less readiness to contact them.

AB  - Majority-group members often hold negative attitudes toward minority-group members who identify with both the majority and their minority group. Integrating perspectives from social identity theory and acculturation research with a coalitional psychology framework, we show that an underlying mechanism for such bias is the perception that dual identifiers are disloyal to the majority group. In Study 1, majority-group participants in the U.S. questioned the loyalty of a dually identified Arab immigrant more than one who identified solely with the (American) majority group, especially under intergroup threat, which in turn predicted less favorable feelings toward the immigrant. Study 2 conceptually replicated the effect of the identity manipulation and the mediating influence of perceived loyalty on judgments about an immigrant being allowed to enlist in the U.S. military. Study 3, partially replicated the findings in Poland, focusing on Russian immigrants as targets. In Study 4, which independently manipulated both the identity expressed by immigrants and their loyalty, a dually identified immigrant whose loyalty to the majority group was portrayed as high was not judged as less qualified than an immigrant who identified only with the majority group for jobs with the potential to inflict damage on the majority group. Study 5, replicated and extended the previous studies in the context of fans of allied or rival soccer teams in Germany, revealing the moderating role of existing group relations on the hypothesized loyalty processes. In summary, coalitionally driven perceptions of (dis)loyalty appear to undergird bias toward minority-group members who hold dual identifications. © 2019 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Issues that are associated with climate change have global importance. Most related studies take a national or regional perspective on the impact of climate change. Taiwan is constrained by its geographical conditions, which increase its vulnerability to climate change, especially in its western coastal areas. The county that is most affected by climate change is Yunlin. In 2013–2014, projects that were sponsored by Taiwan’s government analyzed the relationship among synthesized vulnerability, ecological footprint (EF) and adaptation to climate change and proposed 15 categories of synthesized vulnerability and EF values. This study further examines the relationship between vulnerability and EF values and examines how residents of four townships—Linnei, Sihu, Mailiao, and Huwei—cope with the effects of climate change. This study investigates whether the residents of the four townships vary in their attitudes to climate change, their perceptions of disaster risk, and their behavioral intentions with respect to coping with climate change. The structural equation model (SEM) is used to examine the relationships among attitudes to climate change, perceptions of disaster risk, and the behavioral intentions of residents in townships with various vulnerabilities to climate change. The results that are obtained using the SEM reveal that climate change mitigation/adaptation behavior is affected by attitudes to climate change and perceptions of disaster risk. However, the effects of attitudes and perceptions on mitigation and adaptation that are mediated by place attachment are not statistically significant. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The killing of Cecil the Lion in July 2015 generated considerable media attention worldwide. We measured public interest in Cecil's death to examine the degree to which this high-profile incident represented the type of focusing event that public policy scholars often emphasize as being important for triggering policy change. Finding that public interest in lion conservation spiked in the weeks immediately following the incident, we then analysed whether this focusing event led to policy changes to restrict trophy hunting in eight countries (USA, Spain, France, Russia, Canada, South Africa, Germany and Mexico) that most frequently import lion Panthera leo trophies. The surge in public attention seems to have had only a limited impact on the adoption of significant new policy, although it may have hastened changes in some countries. © 2017 Fauna & Flora International.

AB  - Purpose: Mobile Facebook (m-Facebook) creates many business opportunities for brands and firms while increasingly drawing interest in scientific literature. However, research is scarce on the immersive experiences prompted by m-Facebook, and how these experiences facilitate users’ engagement, their positive attitude towards Facebook and their continued use of it. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This paper theoretically and empirically analyses m-Facebook users’ immersive experiences, along with their affective and behavioural effects. Findings: The results reveal the important role of imagery, presence and flow in the context of m-Facebook; the interplay between these three immersive phenomena; and the influence the user’s optimum stimulation level has on them. Originality/value: The investigation offers a foundation for understanding users’ immersive experiences on m-Facebook, and informs practitioners who aim to enhance users’ engagement with, attitude towards, and continued use of m-Facebook content. © 2018, Inma Rodríguez-Ardura and Antoni Meseguer-Artola.

AB  - We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine if posting a “selfie” and receiving validation from others in the form of “likes” on social media can help narcissists reduce psychological distress. After all participants completed the narcissistic personality inventory (NPI) and experienced social exclusion, participants completed an auditory startle task that elicits the P3 to white noise—an ERP component that reflects emotional arousal and is sensitive to psychological distress. Participants were then randomly assigned to either view a personal “selfie” that quickly received a significant number of ostensibly real “likes” (selfie with likes condition), view a “selfie” with no feedback (selfie only condition), or view a neutral picture before (neutral picture condition) completing the auditory startle task again. Results revealed that participants high on the Leadership/Authority subscale of the NPI in the “selfie” with “likes” condition demonstrated a pre–post manipulation decrease in P3 mean amplitude, relative to participants in the other two conditions. These results suggest that approval via social media can help certain kinds of narcissists alleviate distress from social exclusion. © Copyright © 2019 Nash, Johansson and Yogeeswaran.

AB  - Background: Vaccine refusal is shaped by the social ecology in which it occurs. How people who refuse vaccines are communicated to and treated may affect the nature and strength of their negative vaccine beliefs, and their responsiveness to health promotion messages. Yet little is known about how people who refuse vaccines are perceived by the public. Our research examined perceptions among pro-vaccine Australians of the vaccine-refusal movement. Methods: Descriptions of the vaccine-refusal movement by 2666 pro-vaccine Australians were analysed using thematic discourse analysis. Descriptive themes were identified via inductive, iterative coding. Discourse analysis techniques were then used to interpret latent beliefs about the vaccine-refusal movement. Results: Participants had negative and stigmatising perceptions of the vaccine-refusal movement. They believed the movement is dangerous, misinformed, and comprised of charlatans and fools who are unintelligent, selfish, overly emotional, conspiratorial and scientifically illiterate. Discursive analysis showed that these perceptions were underpinned by beliefs that people would have to be defective in some way to believe anti-vaccine rhetoric. Furthermore, perceptions were underpinned by beliefs that the movement spreads not only disease, but also dangerous ideas that were seen to attack the social order, institutions, values and reason. Participants′ intensely-negative views related to their inability to imagine why someone would refuse vaccines. Conclusions: This research provides a focused, qualitative account of public perceptions of the vaccine-refusal movement. The findings are concerning: stigma towards vaccine-refusing people may adversely affect their wellbeing and entrench their negative vaccine beliefs. The research suggests that more compassionate, nuanced discussion of vaccine refusal in the public sphere is needed. It also supports the need to systematically examine public attitudes towards vaccine refusal as a determinant of vaccine confidence. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to examine when and how the number of “likes” can exert significant influence on consumer evaluations of social media advertising. It sheds a novel perspective on how social media “likes”, advertising disclosures and the presence of firm-serving motives influence advertising effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach: Study 1 examines how the number of “likes” influences consumer attitudes towards the sponsoring brand by strengthening advertising credibility, when social media ads are effectively (vs non-effectively) disclosed. Study 2 further establishes how the influence of the number of “likes” for effectively disclosed ads varies depending on whether the company states (vs does not state) its firm-serving motives. Findings: The authors found that a social media ad displayed with a higher number of “likes” is perceived to be more credible, which can then yield more positive attitudes towards the brand. However, the use of effective disclosures moderates this relationship. To offset this effect, companies can restore the value of “likes” by stating their firm-serving motives openly when they develop social media advertising messages. Research limitations/implications: The study offers a novel perspective on how consumers evaluate the number of displayed “likes” in the context of other social media features. Practical implications: The study shows how social media marketers can become more effective in taking advantage of the number of “likes” that they accumulate on social networking site platforms. Originality/value: The study illustrates a novel mechanism behind how and when the number of “likes” can influence the effectiveness of social media advertising. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to propose and evaluate a pedagogically sound and innovative strategy to teach a higher education course that prepares future professionals to intelligently use information and communication technologies (ICTs) in their personal and professional lives. Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual framework used for the design of the course was the socio-constructivism and activity theories. The implementation of the course was evaluated using the intrinsic case study methodology by including several instruments. Findings: The pedagogical strategy proposed proved to be sound, as the evaluation showed that students were able to describe, use and propose innovative uses of a wide range of cutting-edge technologies in their both everyday lives and professional settings; they also had the skills to analyse the opportunities and challenges that these presented. Moreover, students liked this innovative way of learning and ended with a positive attitude towards ICT. Originality/value: Although several courses prepare students to be digital citizens or use ICT to enhance the teaching-learning process, millennials are ill prepared to use cutting-edge technologies in an innovative, responsible and critical way in their future professions. The course that was designed is original in that it goes beyond preparing digital citizens to prepare professionals in any domain to use ICT in an informed and responsible way. Moreover, it is a documented, successful example of an undergraduate universal course in a highly important current society dimension. The authors believe that its pedagogical proposal could be transferred to courses dealing with other global issues such as the environment, economy and peace. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study, using scenarios, examined the impact of two kinds of cause-related marketing (CRM) efforts (a traditional donation of a portion of sales to a related cause and a more strategic one-for-one donation of donating a product to a related cause when that product was purchased) on millennials’ (those born between 1982 and 2000) attitudes and purchase intentions for four different consumer product categories. The four different consumer product categories selected included a specialty good (laptop), a shopping good (hat), a convenience good (bottled water), and a service (food restaurant). Given the importance of social media to millennials, this research also examined the role of social media on CRM awareness. While millennials had relatively low awareness of CRM campaigns, there was a positive correlation between social media use and CRM awareness. Additionally, CRM efforts may not work for all products as there was no impact on attitude or purchase intention for the product category of laptops. Additionally, the positive attitudes created by marketers’ CRM efforts will not always translate to increased purchase intentions. The use of a strategic one-for-one CRM effort though had a greater impact, specifically for products that deal with needed fundamentals, such as food and water. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The notion of sexual citizenship has been developed over the past two decades, and its discussion has been expanded to other regions. This article investigates the claiming of rights by non-heterosexuals in Hong Kong to achieve two objectives: to articulate the importance of the rights claiming process, particularly regarding how non-heterosexuals are being transformed to become claimants through rights claims, and to extend the notion of sexual citizenship in East Asia, particularly in the Hong Kong context. The findings show four distinctive characteristics of sexual citizenship in Hong Kong. Non-heterosexuals are found to have faced different struggles and barriers before or during the process of claiming rights, including restricted welfare rights access in various social institutions. Furthermore, the development of sexual citizenship in the Hong Kong local context is found to be limited. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Interpersonal discrimination experience has been associated with adverse birth outcomes. Limited research has evaluated this relationship within multicultural contexts outside the United States where the nature and salience of discrimination experiences may differ. Such research is important in order to help identify protective and risk factors that may mediate the relationship between discrimination experience and adverse birth outcomes. Methods: Evaluated the relationship between perceived discrimination, as measured in pregnancy, with birth weight and gestation length among Māori, Pacific, and Asian women from Aotearoa New Zealand (N = 1653). Results: Thirty percent of the sample reported some type of unfair treatment that they attributed to their ethnicity. For Māori women specifically, unfair treatment at work (β =-243 g) and in acquiring housing (β =-146 g) were associated with lower birth weight when compared to Māori women not experiencing these types of discrimination, while an ethnically motivated physical attack (β =-1.06 week), and unfair treatment in the workplace (β =-0.95 week), in the criminal justice system (β =-0.55 week), or in banking (β =-0.73 week) were associated with significantly shorter gestation. Conclusions: Despite a high prevalence of discrimination experience among women from all ethnic groups, discrimination experience was a strong predictor of lower birth weight and shorter gestation length among indigenous Māori women only. Additional research is needed to better understand the risk and protective factors that may moderate the relationship between discrimination experience and adverse birth outcomes among women from different ethnic groups. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - One explanation for the post-1965 shift in the vote choice of White Americans posits that it was driven by a shift in the racial imagery of the two major parties. The growing role of Latinos in the Democratic Party has brought new changes in the racial groups associated with the parties. In this paper, I explore whether the increasing attention to Latinos in Democratic Party politics is having an effect similar to that which followed African-Americans political repositioning 50 years ago, and decreasing support for the Party among White Democrats. Drawing on three survey experiments, from two elections, I demonstrate that as White Democrats learn about Democratic outreach to Latinos, they become less supportive of Democrats. This pattern, I find, is driven by the effects that such information has on the racial prototypes associated with each party. All together, these findings point to a new phase of racial realignment in the American political system. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: Challenges of teamwork in online classes may adversely affect students’ future attitudes toward teamwork. Further, there is a concern about whether online programs foster students’ teamwork skills. To answer these questions, the purpose of this paper is to compare online and face-to-face students’ attitudes toward teamwork, interest in learning teamwork skills and teamwork self-efficacy. Design/methodology/approach: The authors developed a conceptual model explaining how students’ background, engagement in learning teamwork, teamwork self-efficacy and interest in learning teamwork affect attitudes toward teamwork and rigorously tested the model for a meaningful comparison between online and face-to-face students. Attitudes toward teamwork, teamwork interest and teamwork self-efficacy of 582 online and face-to-face students who attend the same academic program were compared. Findings: The results suggest that online students have less positive attitudes towards teamwork compared to face-to-face students although online students have a higher level of teamwork self-efficacy. Therefore, online students’ relative less positive attitudes toward teamwork cannot be explained by the lack of engagement, teamwork skills or interest. Research limitations/implications: The homogeneity of the sample population is one of the limitations of the paper although it provides the opportunity for a comparative study of online and face-to-face students by controlling the majors. Practical implications: Instructors should evaluate the appropriateness of team assignments while incorporating teamwork in online classes. Originality/value: Concerns about online teamwork are discussed but have not been rigorously investigated in the literature. The authors conducted a comprehensive study involving 582 undergraduate students. The findings of this paper suggest that new approaches are needed to incorporate teamwork in online classes. The results also show that importance of building teamwork self-efficacy. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Although unfavorable pricing errors (UPEs) cost customers billions of dollars each year, research has not yet examined customers’ reactions to UPEs. This paper aims to fill this gap by examining customers’ reactions to UPEs in terms of frequency, magnitude and the interaction between frequency and magnitude. Also, this study explores the moderated mediating role of price consciousness. Design/methodology/approach: Three experimental studies were conducted to examine customers’ reactions to UPEs in terms of frequency, magnitude and the interaction between frequency and magnitude. PROCESS Model 6 and 84 along with multivariate regression analysis and MANOVA were used to test the hypotheses. Findings: The results show that high-frequency and high-magnitude UPEs lead to increased perceived deception and dissatisfaction, resulting in a higher negative attitude toward the grocery store, decreased re-patronage intentions and increased negative word-of-mouth (NWOM). Also, results show that regardless of customers’ price consciousness level, customers display negative reactions when encountering UPEs. Research limitations/implications: This paper only investigates UPEs in the brick and mortar setting; future studies should examine UPEs in different settings. Practical implications: The findings show that UPEs can cause significant problems for grocery stores. Thus, managers should take precautionary measures (e.g. constantly checking shelves) to ensure that the advertised price and the checkout price match. Originality/value: This paper represents the first attempt to empirically examine the relationship between UPEs frequency and magnitude, on the one hand, and perceived deception, dissatisfaction, customer attitude, re-patronage intentions, NWOM and price consciousness on the other. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: The use of mobile health apps is now common in diabetes self-management and acceptability of such tools could help predict further use. There is limited research on the acceptability of such apps: use over time, the factors and features that influence self-management, how to overcome barriers, and how to use an app in relation to health-care personnel. In this study, we aimed to obtain an in-depth understanding of users' acceptability of a mobile app for diabetes self-management, and to explore their communication with health-care personnel concerning the app. Methods: The study had a qualitative descriptive design. Two researchers conducted 24 semi-structured in-depth interviews with adults with type 2 diabetes who had used a digital diabetes diary app for 1 year, during participation in the Norwegian Study in the EU project RENEWING HeALTH. We recruited the participants in a primary health-care setting. The transcripts of the interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis on developing themes, which we interpreted according to a theory of acceptability. We used NVivo 11 Pro during the process. Results: The users' acceptability of the app diverged. Overall, the responses indicated that the use of a digital diabetes diary requires hard work, but could also ease the effort involved in following a healthy lifestyle and better-controlled levels of blood glucose. Crucial to the acceptability was that a routine use could give an overview of diabetes registration and give new insights into self-management. In addition, support from health-care personnel with diabetes knowledge was described as necessary, either to confirm the decisions made based on use of the app, or to get additional self-management support. There were gradual transitions between practical and social acceptability, where utility of the app seems to be necessary for both practical and social acceptability. Lack of acceptability could cause both digital and clinical distress. Conclusions: Both practical and social acceptability were important at different levels. If the users found the utility of the app to be acceptable, they could tolerate some lack of usability. We need to be aware of both digital and clinical distress when diabetes apps form a part of relevant health-care.

AB  - This article uses visitor research to explore public attitudes to the British Museum and perceptions of its relationship to the history of the British Empire. Firstly, it provides an analysis of direct messages received by the Museum over a twelve month period via letters, emails and comments on social media platforms. Secondly, it draws on short interviews undertaken with visitors upon arrival at the Museum before entry. Thirdly, it draws on formative and summative evaluation for two recent British Museum special exhibitions that explicitly addressed imperial and colonial histories, ‘Indigenous Australia: Enduring Civilization’ (23 April–2 August 2015) and South Africa: The Art of a Nation’ (27 October 2016–26 February 2017). Finally, it draws on focus groups (April 2018) held to explore perceptions of the Museum held by culturally active non-visitors. Collectively this insight highlights the Museum’s vast potential to inform contemporary debates about empire by developing new approaches to displaying and interpreting its collection. © 2019, © 2019 Third Text.

AB  - This study investigated how the prevalent visual depiction of obesity in the media promotes stigmatization of obese individuals. Particularly, this study proposed and tested the two sequential mechanisms which were not explicated in the previous models but indispensable in stigma research: (1) the disease avoidance response (i.e. discomfort for physical contact) and (2) dehumanizing perception. Results of two experiments overall supported the extended model: the headless photos of obese individuals triggered the disease avoidance responses, which sequentially increased the dehumanizing perception of and negative attitudes toward obese individuals. The identity trait (e.g. gender) match increased readers' level of social identification with obese people and alleviated the disease avoidance response when they saw the photo of the obese model as a whole being. By contrast, the opposite effects (i.e. disidentification and heightened discomfort) were found when the participants saw the headless photo of the obese model of the same gender. © 2019, © 2019 National Communication Association.

AB  - The functionalization of Laponite RD platelets with different cationic, anionic, and nonionic homo- and copolymers synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) has been investigated. The effective interaction of the macromolecular RAFT agents (macroRAFTs) with the inorganic particles is known to be of crucial importance for the successful coating of minerals with polymers via RAFT-mediated emulsion polymerization to produce polymer-encapsulated inorganic particles. The macroRAFT agents synthesized in the present work contain carefully selected reinitiating R groups, which bear either ionizable tertiary amine or quaternary ammonium moieties (from 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate, DMAEMA), negatively charged acrylic acid (AA) repeat units, or neutral polyethylene glycol (PEG) side chains, and are capable of interacting with Laponite via different adsorption mechanisms. The equilibrium adsorption of these RAFT (co)polymers was investigated by the plotting of adsorption isotherms, and either L-type or H-type curves were obtained. The hydrophobicity of the macroRAFT was shown to promote adsorption, as did the pending configuration of the PEG block. Charge repulsion between AA and the negatively charged surface of Laponite at pH 7.5, on the other hand, was prejudicial for adsorption, while the strong electrostatic interaction between the cationic DMAEMA molecules and the Laponite surface led to high-affinity-type curves.

AB  - Background: Over 300,000 people in Israel cope with temporary or permanent hair loss (alopecia) that results from diseases and medical treatments. For women, hair loss can be a highly traumatic event that may lead to adverse psychosocial consequences and health outcomes. Nevertheless, this phenomenon has been mostly ignored by health professionals as it is primarily considered an aesthetic - rather than as a health-related issue. Only recently the Healthcare Basket Committee approved financial assistance for the purchase of wigs by patients coping with hair loss. Given the important role that the media plays in shaping health policies related to diagnoses, treatment and support services, the current study sought to enrich our understanding of how the media portrays disease-related hair-loss. Methods: Using framing and agenda-setting theories, this study examined the media portrayals of hair loss associated with three diseases - cancer, alopecia areata, and ringworm, depicted in Israeli newspapers in 1994-2016. The sample consisted of 470 articles about the three diseases: 306 on cancer, 36 on AA, and 128 on ringworm. Results: Textual and visual analysis revealed the ways media marginalize this physical flaw. Cancer was framed in medical terms, and patients were portrayed as older Israeli-born people whose hair loss was absent from their experience. Ringworm was framed as a fear-inducing disease; patients were portrayed as faceless, unidentified immigrants that coped with visible hair loss. Articles on AA provided the greatest focus on the patient's experience of hair loss, but patients were portrayed as young foreign people. Conclusions: Our results revealed a hierarchy of stigmas against hair loss, in which the media coverage marginalized this experience. The omission of hair loss by the media may explain, at least in part, why health professionals often ignore the psychosocial needs of these patients. Health insurance funding of wigs is a helpful but nevertheless insufficient solution to coping with feminine hair loss. Our findings may encourage media leaders to conduct planned media interventions to increase awareness of clinicians and health policymakers about the unique challenges faced by women coping with hair loss and promote health policy-making aimed at the well-being of these women. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The use of social media platforms to facilitate teaching and learning requires resources (hardware and Internet access) to enable active student participation. Limited access to these resources may impair students’ learning and, should the students consequently fail to graduate, tacitly contribute to their social exclusion. The results of a survey amongst students at a South African university, identified statistically significant differences relating to hardware and Internet access between more affluent students, and lower income students. Using social media may, therefore, be countering the objective of widening the admissions to universities in South Africa as an attempt to address past exclusionary practices. This study raises awareness with instructors and administrators globally, about the risk of tacit social exclusion, as a result of the tools selected to facilitate learning. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Although they are faced with a situation of extreme social exclusion, individuals experiencing homelessness (IEH) have gradually begun to incorporate the use of social networking sites (SNS) into their everyday lives. Aims: To review the publications that have examined the use of SNS among IEH and to analyze the impact that this online activity has on the health of these individuals. Methods: This study employed a scoping review method, analyzing scientific literature published up to the end of 2016. Results: An analysis was performed on nineteen peer-reviewed articles and three grey literature publications. IEH, especially those who are younger, use SNS in a similar proportion to the overall population. When these individuals used the networks due to their own initiative, it was found to have a positive health effect in that it mitigated the consequences of living on the street. Interventions aimed at improving the participants’ health achieved positive results, both in terms of preventing problems associated with drug abuse and high-risk sexual behavior and of promoting mental health. Conclusions: The use of SNS presents some health benefits for IEH. Virtual communication and information alternatives provide opportunities to improve the mental and general health of people in social exclusion situations. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The purpose of the current study was to determine if the relationship between interhemispheric interaction and cognitive flexibility extends to explanations of forgiveness and apology acceptance. A growing body of research indicates that consistency of handedness may be reflective of an individual’s degree of interhemispheric interaction and access to processes of the right hemisphere. As such, individual differences in processing that require interhemispheric interaction, such as belief updating, are associated with consistency of handedness. Participants completed the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI) and read descriptions of interpersonal transgressions, then rated their willingness to forgive before and after an apology was offered. There was a main effect such that the presence of apology increased forgiveness. However, inconsistent handedness was associated with greater forgiveness prior to apology compared to consistent handedness. A second study was conducted to determine if the individual differences in forgiveness were mediated by different dimensions of empathy (personal distress, perspective taking, empathic concern and fantasy). Participants completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, the Forgiveness Scale and the EHI. Results revealed those with inconsistent handedness who scored lower on personal distress reported decreased negative thoughts about transgressors compared to those with consistent handedness. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In the spirit of the multiculturalism enshrined in the 2008 constitution, a number of legal instruments to fight discrimination were adopted in Ecuador and have been at the disposal of Ecuadorian socio-political actors, organizations, and state agencies. This article zeroes in on two of these legal instruments: 1) the 2009 insertion of the classification and definition of ‘hate crimes’ and ‘discrimination’ in the Código Integral Penal, and 2) the 2013 Ley Orgánica de Comunicación (Communications Law), which was an administrative law especially directed to those who publish written and visual texts in the media. Above and beyond illustrating how anti-discrimination legal instruments are actually applied in Ecuador to remedy anti-black racism in the field of everyday life, the two legal cases are approached within the multiplicity of fields of meaning they have relevance within. Both cases reveal contemporary race relations in a historically racist society in which the state has openly been instrumental for the reproduction of racist stereotypes that contribute to the making of Afro-Ecuadorians as second-class citizens. They uncover how much involved and why the relatively new, mostly urban-based, Afro-Ecuadorian middle-class has been in fighting anti-black racism. The article also points to the many limitations of contemporary legal instruments to end discrimination. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Sexual assault is a major concern on college campuses. Some colleges and universities adopt and educate their students using an affirmative consent standard, such that for a sexual encounter to be considered consensual (and thus not an act of sexual assault), it must include explicit, voluntary, and conscious agreement to engage in sexual activity by all parties involved. The current study sought to examine the extent to which accurate knowledge and understanding of affirmative sexual consent may explain college students' intentions to engage in affirmative sexual consent communication, alongside other influential predictors, as proposed by the Integrated Behavioral Model. Results indicated that while college students who were more likely to define sexual consent based upon an affirmative consent definition were also more likely to intend to engage in affirmative sexual consent communication, it was ultimately the ability to apply that knowledge to a variety of sexual situations that predicted behavioral intentions, alongside positive attitudes about and perceived behavioral control to engage in the behavior. Colleges and universities must therefore not only inform their students about the definition of affirmative sexual consent, they must also provide them with situational knowledge about how and when to engage in affirmative sexual consent communication, as well as improve students’ related attitudes and perceived behavioral control. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Multiple studies have examined ‘what’ people think about fuel management (perceptions); fewer have examined ‘how’ people think about it (structure of thoughts). In an Australian study, we used Integrative Complexity Theory (ICT) to explore the relationship between how complexly people thought about, and how acceptable they found, three fuel management strategies: prescribed burning, mechanical thinning and livestock grazing. Integrative complexity (IC) was associated with the direction of acceptability of the most familiar practice - prescribed burning, but trust in organizations was associated with acceptability of all strategies. IC was associated with the extremity of acceptability, with higher IC associated with more moderate attitudes. Our findings support the argument that targeting communication to (i) match current IC and (ii) encourage growth in complexity of thinking has potential to encourage more moderate and stable attitudes about fuel management. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Policy-makers have called for community engagement to be made central to police operations in England and Wales, yet little empirical investigation has been undertaken in this context to support its efficacy. This article uses a quasi-experimental research design to review a community engagement intervention that aimed to develop citizens’ perceptions of social capital in their community, improve their perceptions the police, and reduce fear of crime and antisocial behaviour (ASB) incidents. We also develop and test a conceptual model that explores the mechanisms by which social capital may influence citizens’ fear of crime and perceptions of the police, positing that local area potency; the belief that a group can be effective in achieving its goals, may be an important mediating mechanism. Results of independent samples t-tests indicate that the intervention was successful in meeting its objectives in the area it was trialled. There were significant increases in social capital, local area potency, confidence in the police and perceptions of police community focus, and decreases in fear of crime and ASB. These results were generally not evident in a control area. Structural equation modelling results supported the hypothesized model, indicating that local area potency mediates the relationships between social capital and the project outcomes. These findings contribute to the limited empirical evidence in support of the positive influence of community engagement in the United Kingdom, and indicate that social capital and local area potency are important antecedents of citizens’ positive attitudes toward crime and the police. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The Internet's relatively unfettered transmission of information risks exposing individuals to extremist content. Using online survey data (N = 768) of American youth and young adults, we examine factors that bring individuals into contact with online material advocating violence. Combining aspects of social structure-social learning theory with insights from routine activity theory, we find that exposure to violence-advocating materials is positively correlated with online behaviors, including the use of social media platforms and the virtual spaces individuals frequent. Target antagonism is also correlated with exposure to violence-advocating materials, but guardianship and online and offline associations are not. Finally, feelings of dissatisfaction with major social institutions and economic disengagement are associated with exposure to violent materials online. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This article examines the development of television scripts in the crime drama genre within the context of US commercial broadcasting in the network era. In 1968, public discourse around race relations, civil rights and violence reached a height following the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr and Robert F. Kennedy, and the release of a government study on urban uprisings by the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders. Ironside (1967–75, NBC) and N.Y.P.D. (1967–69, ABC) are two crime dramas that drew on recent events related to black militants and white supremacy in order to appeal to viewers with socially relevant entertainment during this time. The archival records of screenwriters Sy Salkowitz and Lonne Elder make it possible to trace the development of one episode from each series over the course of multiple drafts. This analysis of the script development process explores the relationship between public discourse, industrial context, commercial agendas and creative priorities. Ironside and N.Y.P.D. are both crime dramas, but an examination of both series yields points of divergence which help to illustrate the norms of the network system in terms of act structure, genre tropes, and the oversight of standards and practices. © 2019 Intellect Ltd.

AB  - The current study aimed to advance the eating pathology literature through investigating the association between a salient stressor for Black American women (race-related stress) and eating pathology, while also examining the potential mediating role of depressive symptoms on this association. In addition, the study aimed to examine the potential protective role of cultural worldview in this model. A community sample of 119 Black women between the ages of 18 and 60 years (M = 36.34, SD = 12.51) were recruited for the study. Results supported a significant indirect effect of race-related stress on eating pathology through depressive symptoms. Moderated mediation analyses revealed a conditional effect of depression at various levels of worldview. Contrary to our hypotheses, participants with a more collectivistic and spiritual worldview often engaged in more eating pathology as a result of self-reported depressive symptoms stemming from experiences of race-related stress. Implications and future directions are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Transgender (TG) is the term which covers individuals who have a gender identity or gender expression than their assigned gender given at the time of birth. These individuals often cover themselves under one umbrella as the third gender. They are unable to identify themselves to a gender, either a male or as a female and they term themselves as the third gender. The society discriminates them since their behavior does not correlate with their congenital gender. The life of transgender is very difficult and stigmatized as they are considered as the most unwanted creatures of the society. Majority of them face discrimination from the society and the social stigma attached to them is so intense that they are ostracized from the main stream of the society. Aim: To understand about the social exclusion and overall day to day life of the transgender. In this study Transwomen were the respondents Result: Majority of the transgender said that they are undergoing a miserable life and the stigma attached to them is much higher when compared to any other anti social people such as criminals, drug addicts or people with contagious diseases etc . There is significant association between the financial status and the stigma, education and the social exclusion, family support and social exclusion, family support and stigma, financial status and social exclusion. These variables are indirectly proportional to the exclusion and stigma towards the transgender. Conclusion: The study validates that when the financial status is high, or if the family support is more the social exclusion and stigma attached is less compared to those coming from low economic strata of the society. Transgender with lower economic standards normally have lower education level and they in due course of time are forced to leave their homes and end up as manual labor coolies or sex workers. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

AB  - Purpose: We explored the perspectives of racialized physiotherapists in Canada on their experiences of racism in their roles as physiotherapists. Method: This qualitative descriptive cross-sectional study used semi-structured, one-on-one interviews. Data were organized using NVivo qualitative analysis software and analyzed using inductive and deductive coding following the six-step DEPICT method. Results: Twelve Canadian licenced physiotherapists (four men and eight women, three rural and nine urban, from multiple racialized groups) described the experiences of racism they faced in their roles as physiotherapists at the institutionalized, personally mediated, and internalized levels. These experiences were shaped by their personal characteristics, including accent, geographical location, and country of physiotherapy (PT) education. Participants described their responses to these incidents and provided insight into how the profession can mitigate racism and promote diversity and inclusion. Conclusions: Participants described interpersonal racism often mediated by location and accent and experiences of internalized racism causing self-doubt, but they most commonly detailed institutionalized racism. PT was experienced as being infused with Whiteness, which participants typically responded to by downplaying or ignoring. The findings from this study can be used to stimulate conversations in the Canadian PT community, especially among those in leadership positions, about not only acknowledging racism as an issue but also taking action against it with further research, advocacy, and training. © 2019, University of Toronto Press Inc.

AB  - Digital storytelling, where a person appears in a video on a social media platform, has for some time been used to encourage audiences to reconsider their attitudes towards mental illness. Marketing the experiences of vulnerable people, however, is a risky undertaking that must be addressed carefully. This paper presents three strategies to consider when designing such campaigns: real, bold and defined. The paper provides an in-depth examination of the three strategies, using examples to illustrate how they can be incorporated into a marketing plan. It concludes with a review of the key issues to consider in order to protect those willing to tell their stories, and discusses the potential implications for mental health organisations and social marketing professionals. © 2019 Henry Stewart.

AB  - This scientific research deals with the actual problem, that is the study of the language of criminal chronicles in the Western Ukrainian media discourse in the 1920-1930s. Object of analysis is news reports on gender violence in popular Western Ukrainian newspapers of the interwar twenty years. The chosen methodology is feminist discourse-analysis which allows us to identify the media representations of gender identity and to find out what ideological discourse has had symbolic hegemony, which gender regime was supported by language. It turns out that the language of criminal news fixes symbolic mechanisms for establishing power regimes. The texts of criminal news show gender stereotypes and prejudices against women, which traditionally functioned and articulated in public discourse. Gender violence was explained (and justified) by personal, religious and social reasons. The problem of domestic violence attracted journalists from the 1920s and 1930s. Victim women who dared to challenge patriarchal customs were appraised extremely subjectively, biasedly, often – in a negative way. Publications about sexual crimes (rape, sexual harassment) were rare, since this topic was banned in the Western Ukrainian public discourse of the 1920s-1930s. In Western Ukrainian popular magazines, the language of criminal news construed a gendered society, deleting power for men and exposing a woman to objectification. Journalists used certain linguistic strategies to support the dominant gender regime: author's intentionality, peculiar journalistic formulation and focus of information, the specifics of structuring material and hidden meanings of the text. © BEIESP.

AB  - It is commonly believed that the general public is heavily dependent on the media for its political news and views and that, as a consequence, the media exercise a strong influence over public opinion and behaviour. However, many millions in the Western world strongly believe things that are barely ever mentioned in the mainstream media, just as many millions also firmly reject or ignore some of the messages that are repeated incessantly by them. This confirms sixty years of experimental psychology research showing that most individuals are capable of preserving their beliefs, even in the face of overwhelming evidence, argument and logic to the contrary. Consistent with this, political science research finds little evidence of strong media influence on the party voting, political attitudes and election agendas of citizens. They have their own ways of gathering political information about the world around them, and they do not necessarily believe what they read in the papers, unless they are so inclined to start with. Consequently, media influences on mass opinion and behaviour are weaker than commonly assumed and, such as they are, their effects are more beneficial than harmful for democracy. © The Author 2019.

AB  - In recent decades, dramatic developments in genetics research have begun to transform not only the practice of medicine but also conceptions of the social world. In the media, in popular culture, and in everyday conversation, Americans routinely link genetics to individual behavior and social outcomes. At the same time, some social researchers contend that biological definitions of race have lost ground in the United States over the last fifty years. At the crossroads of two trends-on one hand, the post-World War II recoil from biological accounts of racial difference, and on the other, the growing admiration for the advances of genetic science-the American public's conception of race is a phenomenon that merits greater attention from sociologists than it has received to date. However, survey data on racial attitudes has proven to be significantly affected by social desirability bias. While a number of studies have attempted to measure social desirability bias with regard to racial attitudes, most have focused on racial policy preferences rather than genetic accounts of racial inequality. We employ a list experiment to create an unobtrusive measure of support for a biologistic understanding of racial inequality. We show that one in five non-Black Americans attribute income inequality between Black and White people to unspecified genetic differences between the two groups. We also find that this number is substantially underestimated when using a direct question. The magnitude of social desirability effects varies, and is most pronounced among women, older people, and the highly-educated.

AB  - Australian media invests considerable attention in asylum seekers and their children, especially those arriving by boat. In this paper, we provide an analysis of Australian newsprint media published during the term of Australia’s Gillard’s government (2010-2013). This period is critical as it coincides with rising numbers of boat arrivals to Australian shores, fear towards Muslims, and growing Islamophobia. At the time, there were government promises to move children from offshore immigration detention into community-based detention, that would involve living among mainstream Australian society. A data set of 46 articles from major Australian newspapers articles was subject to a discourse analysis of representations of children in both the written texts and in silences. Manipulative tactics of ‘risk framing’ and ‘dispersed intentionality’ were identified as discursive acts aimed to confuse compassion and deviancy with respect to asylum seeker children presumed to be from Islamic backgrounds. We argue that this was achieved through binary characterizations in which Muslim parents and people smugglers were constructed as deviant alongside intentional silences, that may have otherwise elicited compassion for asylum seeker children. We propose that this period of media reporting is foundational to understanding the rise of Islamophobic discourses and the implication of Muslim children in Australia. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Content analyses of U.S. English-language news coverage of immigration indicate that these stories are laden with negative, threatening messages and have an almost exclusive focus on Latino immigrants. However, little is known regarding how non-immigrant Latinos process and interpret these messages. The current survey of adult non-immigrant Latinos living in the United States addresses this question by applying insights from the rejection-identification model and research on vicarious shame. Based on this research, experiencing group shame in response to immigration news should drive Latinos to distance themselves from this identity, leading to greater affiliation with American identity (to maintain a positive self-concept) and stronger support for restrictive immigration policies (to mitigate the potential threats). Alternatively, experiencing anger in response to this coverage should result in less distancing from the shared Latino identity (i.e., greater affiliation), prompting decreased association with American identity and less support for restrictive immigration policies. Results from the mediation model tested here found support for predictions stemming from both vicarious shame and rejection-identification assumptions, indicating that they represent distinct pathways to views on immigration attitudes and identity management. Furthermore, in line with social identity theory, Mexican Americans (vs. non-Mexican Latinos) were more likely to distance from the immigration message and perceive immigration coverage to depict negative beliefs others hold about their ethnic group (owing to the disproportionate emphasis on Mexicans in this coverage). Results are discussed in terms of the implications for group standing as well as the importance of legitimacy of media messages in this context. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - This empirical study contributes towards identifying the effect of social exclusion on labor market integration of people with disabilities in Romania. Certain categories of individuals with disabilities have longer unemployment duration than others and this empirical study is focused on identifying which variables have a significant influence on exit to job hazard on Romanian labor market. The significant gap between employees without disabilities and employees with disabilities in the Romanian labor market can be explain based on certain influential factors such as: Lower productivity levels, higher training costs, differentiated work schedules, special demands, higher risk of work injuries and work-related accidents, etc. The findings reveal the lack of statistical significance for the differences between median survival time and hazard rates of disabled individuals, a function of their disability. Moreover, our results show that only an age and unemployment allowance has had a significant effect on unemployment duration and exit to a job hazard of educated individuals with disabilities. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This study examined the relationships between the factors that influence residents' attitudes toward supporting for sustainable tourism in an island context. A quantification approach was employed to obtain the residents' perspectives. This study collected 384 valid questionnaires from the residents and analyzed the collected data using structural equation modeling to test the model. The findings revealed that the Maximizing Community Participation dimension demonstrated a positive direct effect on residents' support for sustainable tourism, and this dimension explained most of the variance in the model. The Perceived Economic Benefits dimension exhibited a positive direct effect on the residents' support for sustainable tourism. Perceived Economic Benefits mediated the effect of Environmental Sustainability on support for sustainable tourism. The findings provide practical implications for policy makers on the promotion of sustainable tourism. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Family conflict can reduce adolescent adherence to type 1 diabetes management tasks. The Family Teamwork in-person intervention was shown to be efficacious in reducing conflict and low adherence to diabetes-related tasks. Its reach and potential impact, however, were limited by the need to deliver the intervention sessions in person. Relational agents (ie, computerized versions of humans) have been shown to appeal to diverse audiences and may be an acceptable replacement for a human in technology-based behavior change interventions. Objective: The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a pilot study assessing feasibility and acceptability of Diabetes Family Teamwork Online, an adapted version of the Family Teamwork intervention, delivered over the internet and guided by a relational agent. Methods: Parent-adolescent dyads were recruited through a diabetes care clinic at a large tertiary care hospital in the southwestern United States. A one-group design, with assessments at baseline, immediate postintervention, and 3 months later, was used to assess feasibility. A priori feasibility criteria included an assessment of recruitment, completion, attrition, program satisfaction, therapeutic alliance, attitudes toward the relational agent, and data collection. The institutional review board at Baylor College of Medicine approved the protocol (H-37245). Results: Twenty-seven adolescents aged 10 to 15 years with type 1 diabetes and their parents were enrolled. Criteria used to assess feasibility were (1) recruitment goals were met (n=20), (2) families completed ≥75% of the modules, (3) attrition rate was ≤10%, (4) program satisfaction was high (≥80% of families), (5) therapeutic alliance was high (average score of ≥60/84), (6) families expressed positive attitudes toward the relational agent (average item score of ≥5 on ≥4 items), (7) ≥80% of data were collected at post 1 and post 2, and (8) few technical issues (≤10%) occurred during intervention delivery. All feasibility criteria were met. Qualitative data confirmed that adolescents and parents had positive reactions to both the content and approach. Conclusions: The Diabetes Family Teamwork Online intervention proved to be a feasible and acceptable method for enhancing communication around diabetes management tasks in families with an adolescent who has type 1 diabetes. ©Debbe Thompson, Chishinga Callender, Caroline Gonynor, Karen W Cullen, Maria J Redondo, Ashley Butler, Barbara J Anderson.

AB  - In the present research, we applied the dual process model of ideology and prejudice to beliefs and behavioral intentions toward animals. In Study 1 (N = 126), we demonstrate in a community sample that right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) predicts support for restricting the distribution of wolves and bears in the wild mediated by perceived threat elicited from the animal outgroups. In contrast, social dominance orientation (SDO) had an indirect effect on the legitimization of meat consumption via endorsement of human supremacy beliefs. In Study 2 (N = 223), we examined the causal direction of the dual process model using an experimental approach. Results show that RWA predicts support for restricting the free movement of a new animal species in the wild only when it is perceived to be threatening for humans. However, SDO predicted perceived legitimacy of meat consumption, regardless of whether the new animal species was characterized as lower or higher in status compared to other animals. Implications of these findings are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Social stress and inflammatory processes are strong regulators of one another. Considerable evidence shows that social threats trigger inflammatory responses that increase infection susceptibility in both humans and animals, while infectious disease triggers inflammation that in turn regulates social behaviours. However, no previous study has examined whether young children's popularity and their rate of infectious disease are associated. We investigated the longitudinal bidirectional links between children's popularity status as perceived by peers, and parent reports of a variety of infectious diseases that are common in early childhood (i.e. common cold as well as eye, ear, throat, lung and gastric infections). We used data from the 'Matter of the First Friendship Study' (MOFF), a longitudinal prospective multi-informant study, following 579 Norwegian pre-schoolers (292 girls, median age at baseline = six years) with annual assessments over a period of three years. Social network analysis was used to estimate each child's level of popularity. Cross-lagged autoregressive analyses revealed negative dose-response relations between children's popularity scores and subsequent infection (b = -0.18, CI = -0.29, -0.06, and b = -0.13, CI = -0.23, -0.03). In conclusion, the results suggest that children who are unpopular in early childhood are at increased risk of contracting infection the following year. © 2019 Ulset et al.

AB  - Different studies have analysed how green marketing influences the sustainable image of tourist companies or have focused on the identification and engagement between these companies and their consumers. In any case, the question of how this process influences consumers' behaviour in the hotel industry requires even more in-depth study, with the intention of explaining the changes that occur in the current consumer and how this affects the hotel industry. This study is useful to demonstrate that beyond the direct influence of green marketing on green word of mouth indicators there are other indirect influences which are represented by other mediating variables: green attitudinal loyalty and green trust. From the literature on green marketing and the conceptual approaches offered by the Hierarchy of Effects Model and the Associate Learning Principles, this study conducted an empirical approach using a structured questionnaire. The questionnaire responses, obtained from a sample of 238 hotel users, were analysed using a Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to test the research hypothesis related to the positive influence of green marketing on green trust, green attitudinal loyalty, and green word of mouth. This research provides theoretical and managerial implications to help executives adopt green marketing strategies, thanks to their positive effects on consumers' recommendations, both direct and indirect, through loyalty and trust. It is concluded that green marketing actions have a greater effect on their indirect relationship with word of mouth than on their direct relationship and that loyalty is the aspect with the highest influence regarding trust. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - There have been many studies on the impact of urban greenery on perceived danger and preferences, but not many have been conducted in non-English speaking countries. We carried out our research among female university students in Poland, Latvia and China (n = 243), using a photograph rating survey instrument, and presenting slides presenting park landscapes. We compared the impact of the presence of trees and shrubs and their capability of offering concealment, as well as perceived space use intensity on perceived danger and preferences in all three countries. Participants rated the presence of shrubs as a more positive influence on path use intensity and as a negative influence on perceived danger. The link between tree presence and perceived danger in Poland and Latvia is small as well as insignificant in China. In addition, perceived danger turned out to be a mediator of the relations between the presence of trees and shrubs and perceived path use intensity and preference. Our findings support the idea that vegetation in parks could be shaped so that it does not provide place to hide. However, this recommendation is primarily applicable to areas in which the variable 'perceived danger' is of importance. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: This paper studies organisational and personal factors affecting the behaviour of academic staff in Saudi universities. It seeks to investigate the beliefs of academic staff regarding the use of ICT and other factors to enhance the productivity of their scientific research. Also, this study aims to improve the sustainability of publication in Saudi universities. ICT includes using the library system for accessing research repository databases such as Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, etc. and other factors. The authors also developed the Importance Performance Map Analysis (IPMA) for these factors in order to provide guidelines for Saudi universities to build university systems to manage and measure the research productivity of academic staff. In summary, this research identifies factors critical to enhancing research productivity in Saudi universities. This will help to improve the sustainability of publication in Saudi universities. By enhancing the sustainability of publication, the reputation of Saudi universities will be improved and the reputation of academic staff in Saudi universities. As well the sustainability of publication will assist the promote of Saudi academic staff. Approach: This paper analysed 200 papers related to the enhancement of research productivity from various research databases such as Science Direct, IEEE and Scopus. We included the usage of ICT in research analysis, university policy, university research funding and the number of publications published by academic staff. The authors used different databases and systematic literature reviews (SLR) to find the most important factors which could improve research productivity in universities. An online questionnaire answered by 375 academic staff from four developing Saudi universities that are Taif University, Taibah University, Jeddah University, Hail University�was used to determine the relationship between information technology factors and research performance together with other factors such as university policy, international collaboration, research funding and job satisfaction. In this study, we used SmartPLS v3 to analyse the results from the questionnaires. Findings: The results show that personal factors such as personal use of ICT and organisational factors such as job satisfaction, university policy, IT funding, international collaboration and the level of ICT use in the university have positive effects on scientific research productivity among academic staff at Saudi universities. Those results are based on the beliefs of academic staff regarding the use of information technology for research purposes and other factors. This paper finds that university policy recorded an importance of 0.523, job satisfaction was 0.224, international collaboration was 0.103, personal use of ICT was 0.102, the level of using ICT in the university was 0.074 and the importance of ICT funding was �0.156. Also, the results from SmartPLS show that university policy has a 0.215 effect size on research performance, job satisfaction has a 0.045 effect size on research performance, international collaboration has a 0.009 effect size on research performance, personal use of ICT has a 0.011 effect size on research performance, a university�s use of ICT has a 0.006 effect size on research performance and ICT funding has a 0.014 effect size on the research performance of academic staff in Saudi universities. These results will help to improve the sustainability of publication in Saudi universities in order to enhance the universities� rankings and the reputation of academic staff. Sustainability is a target for any organization, both for profit-making entities or non-profit organizations such as universities. This means that Saudi universities should enhance the sustainability of their publication. In order to achieves the goals of higher education institutions. Originality: No study has investigated the factors affecting the performance of academic staff in Arab countries, especially in Saudi universities. Therefore, the originality of this study resides in being the first study to investigate the impact of researchers� attitudes to enhancing the research productivity performance of researchers in Saudi universities. Also, it is one of the few studies which discusses sustainability in Saudi universities. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Being a family carer can be rewarding but can also lead to mental and physical exhaustion as well as feelings of social exclusion and isolation. Research has shown that the use of the Internet and online forums can provide an immediate place to find information and reassurance and that forum use can be an empathetic place to share experiences and seek emotional support. This article details a systematic literature search of research on carers of people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism using the Internet. A thematic synthesis of the resulting papers identified that online forums give carers a sense of agency by providing a place to go for informational support that may not be elsewhere. Carers also enjoyed the safe community of solidarity and emotional support that online forums provide. An important finding is the lack of published papers in this area with the inclusion of just eight papers. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Prejudiced attitudes and political nationalism vary widely around the world, but there has been little research on what predicts this variation. Here we examine the ecological and cultural factors underlying the worldwide distribution of prejudice. We suggest that cultures grow more prejudiced when they tighten cultural norms in response to destabilizing ecological threats. A set of seven archival analyses, surveys, and experiments (∑N = 3,986,402) find that nations, American states, and pre-industrial societies with tighter cultural norms show the most prejudice based on skin color, religion, nationality, and sexuality, and that tightness predicts why prejudice is often highest in areas of the world with histories of ecological threat. People's support for cultural tightness also mediates the link between perceived ecological threat and intentions to vote for nationalist politicians. Results replicate when controlling for economic development, inequality, conservatism, residential mobility, and shared cultural heritage. These findings offer a cultural evolutionary perspective on prejudice, with implications for immigration, intercultural conflict, and radicalization. © 2019 Jackson et al.

AB  - Both Reid and Berkeley reject ‘representationalism’, an epistemological position whereby we (mediately) perceive things in the world indirectly via ideas in our mind, on the grounds of anti-scepticism and common sense. My aim in this paper is to draw out the similarities between Reid and Berkeley’s ‘anti-representationalist’ arguments, whilst also identifying the root of their disagreements on certain fundamental metaphysical issues. Reid famously rejects Berkeley’s idealism, in which all that exists are ideas and minds, because it undermines the dictates of common sense. Reid also charges Berkeley with not only accepting but furthering the progress of ‘the Way of Ideas’, a longstanding tradition which has drawn philosophy away from true science and common sense. From Berkeley’s perspective, Reid is a ‘materialist’; that is, he dogmatically accepts that mind-independent things exist. I argue that these important differences can be explained by both thinkers’ construal of certain ‘philosophical prejudices’. Finally, I conclude that despite these differences, both ought to be characterised as ‘anti-representationalists’ in light of their shared epistemological concerns. © Edinburgh University Press.

AB  - Children’s independent mobility (IM), their freedom to move about their neighbourhood without supervision by adults, has been in steady decline in recent decades. Previous research has linked perceptions of the environment with various measures of IM, but recently concerns have been raised regarding inconsistency in measuring IM. This study used various measures of IM and aimed to address how parental perceptions of the neighbourhood environment are associated with children’s territorial range (actual IM), as well as how this relationship is mediated by IM parenting practices (allowed IM). A sample of 105 child/parent dyads from Vancouver, Canada participated in this study. Children (age 10–13) wore a global positioning system (GPS) watch and an accelerometer and completed an activity diary for seven days to assess their territorial range. Parents completed a questionnaire that assessed perceptions of their neighbourhood environment and IM parenting practices—license for IM and roaming allowance. Path analyses were used to address the research aims. License for IM and roaming allowance mediated the relationship between perceived walking facilities, crime safety, and neighbourhood relations and children’s territorial range. Findings suggest that future interventions to increase children’s territorial range should focus primarily on attitude and behaviour change among parents to grant children more freedom. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Breast cancer (BC) is ranked as the most frequently diagnosed cancer site among women in Saudi Arabia. Several studies in Saudi Arabia have reported low awareness of BC and significant obstacles to early presentation among Saudi women. A key sociocultural obstacle against breast screening and early detection of BC in several conservative cultures is that men manage women’s choices and activities. The aim of this research is to find out the key background knowledge, attitudes, and related practice among male partners in the city of Abha in relation to women’s BC prevention and means for early detection. Methods: A cross-sectional study targeting husbands aged 20 years or older chosen from the outpatient clinics in the Urban Primary Health Care Centers in Abha City. Through questionnaires, interview data were collected regarding knowledge about BC and wife practices and attitudes towards BC. Results: The study included 832 husbands. The study showed that only 20.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 19.9–24.1) of husbands had heard about mammography and only 22.1% had heard about breast self-examination among women as a screening test for BC. The most commonly mentioned variations that might occur in relation to BC were size changes (45.6%). The leading source of BC knowledge was from television (48.9%), and the least-mentioned source of information was healthcare workers (22.4%). Husbands mentioned that only 9.3% of wives had been examined before by mammography. In a multivariate logistic regression of male factors associated with wives’ practices and attitudes towards BC, only good knowledge among husbands was a significant factor. Conclusions: The study documented the low level of BC knowledge among male partners. There is an urgent need to pay more consideration to disseminating awareness among men, as they are associates, and they must be armed with proper awareness. There is an urgent demand for establishing a national program and educational campaigns towards BC. Stressing the advantages and access to free mammography is necessary. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate inpatient and staff member attitudes toward and experiences with ward cats, and identify possible mechanisms for how cats affect patient satisfaction in a psychiatric clinic. Thirty-three inpatients diagnosed with depression or psychosis residing on wards with and without cats and 17 staff members working on wards with cats participated in semi-structured interviews using a cross-sectional study design. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and correlations. The results showed that 17 out of 19 inpatients and all the staff members liked having a cat on their ward. Further, 12 out of 14 inpatients on wards without cats would like having a cat on their ward. Inpatient perceptions of the cat’s impact on the ward atmosphere correlated significantly with their emotional relationship with the cat (p = 0.015, r = 0.561), how often they saw the cat (p = 0.002, r = 0.676), and if they liked cats in general (p = 0.041, r = 0.486). Our results highlight the positive attitudes of inpatients and staff members toward ward cats and the potential of ward cats to enhance patient satisfaction. This influence might be mediated by factors such as the frequency of contact, the relationship between each patient and the cat, and each patient’s attitude toward cats in general. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Guided by intergroup contact and communication accommodation theories, this study tested the effects of U.S. participants’ (N = 286) communication with their most frequent contact who had a visible physical disability and its effects on attitudes toward and stereotypes of people with disabilities as a whole. As predicted, mediation analysis showed the type of interability contact (i.e., nonfamily = 1 and family = 2), and participants’ perceptions of their own communication accommodation during interability interactions with the contact had significant indirect effects on the improvement of attitudes toward and reduction of stereotypes about people with disabilities through relational solidarity and intergroup anxiety as sequential mediators. In addition, communication accommodation had significant positive direct effects on intergroup attitudes. These findings provide insights into the important role played by interability contact, especially in the family context and communication accommodation in developing positive relationships in order to reduce anxiety, prejudices, and biases toward people with disabilities. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Fake news about climate change refers to fabricated information that mimics the appearance of legitimate reporting but is intended to mislead consumers. In light of concerns about fake news regarding climate change and other topics, researchers and media providers have been searching for ways to limit its spread and influence. This study tested the effect of two simple interventions, both of which primed critical thinking, on individuals’ evaluation of the credibility of real and fake news about climate change on Facebook. Through an online experiment (n = 2,750 participants), participants either read a series of guidelines for evaluating news online, or read and then rated the importance of each guideline; a control group was not exposed to guidelines of any type. We found that participants exposed to both types of guidelines reported a reduced likelihood to trust, like, and share fake news about climate change on Facebook. Importantly, exposure to these guidelines did not diminish individuals’ likelihood to trust, like, or share legitimate climate news. The effect sizes for both types of intervention were small. However, because of the scale and speed at which social media operates, even a small reduction in users’ likelihood to trust, like, and share fake news could be meaningful and impactful. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Participatory health interventions have long been advocated as an approach to help marginalised community members exercise their rights as citizens, including access to health care. More than two decades ago, the Roma health mediation programme was established in Romania as a participatory community health intervention. Mediators are employed specifically to act as intermediaries between ‘Roma patients’ and local authorities or health professionals, with the overall aim to increase trust and improve access to health care. Based on data gathered during a year of ethnographic fieldwork with Roma health mediators in Romania, including participant observation and interviews, this article analyses the social processes by which participatory approaches produce both social inclusion and exclusion. It illustrates how mediators exceeded their remit of health and attempted to discipline communities into forms of neoliberal citizenship. Mediators reframed access to health care not as a right that community members already have, but as a benefit that must be individually ‘earned’ through the fulfilment of neoliberal citizenship. The article argues that far from being an ‘empowering tool’, community participation can extend the power of governing institutions and thereby may in fact contribute to the maintenance of a political status quo that perpetuates the precarisation of marginalised communities. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Racial disparities in the utilization of epilepsy surgery are well documented, but it is unknown whether a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm trained on physician notes would produce biased recommendations for epilepsy presurgical evaluations. To assess this, an NLP algorithm was trained to identify potential surgical candidates using 1097 notes from 175 epilepsy patients with a history of resective epilepsy surgery and 268 patients who achieved seizure freedom without surgery (total N = 443 patients). The model was tested on 8340 notes from 3776 patients with epilepsy whose surgical candidacy status was unknown (2029 male, 1747 female, median age = 9 years; age range = 0-60 years). Multiple linear regression using demographic variables as covariates was used to test for correlations between patient race and surgical candidacy scores. After accounting for other demographic and socioeconomic variables, patient race, gender, and primary language did not influence surgical candidacy scores (P >.35 for all). Higher scores were given to patients >18 years old who traveled farther to receive care, and those who had a higher family income and public insurance (P <.001,.001,.001, and.01, respectively). Demographic effects on surgical candidacy scores appeared to reflect patterns in patient referrals. Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2019 International League Against Epilepsy

AB  - China is now becoming a fundamental market for the prosperity and growth of the world’s tourism economy. It promotes the rapid development of foreign tourism and brings some influences to social life. Chinese tourists are highly concerned with foreign media at home and abroad; the Vietnamese Media is the same. Based on the theoretical framework, this paper analyzes the Chinese tourists report towards the Vietnamese Media “VnExpress” 2018 and discusses the construction of Chinese tourists’ image from the three views of macroscopic, the middle, and microcosmic of the news text framework. From there, it shows the tendency and prejudice of the Vietnamese media. The study found that “VnExpress” has a clear tendency; the image of Chinese tourists is full of negatives. At the same time, it indirectly involves events on political issues; Vietnamese media also maintain strong political sensitivity. Moreover, it emphasizes the integrity of Vietnam’s territorial sovereignty, the particularity of history and culture, and strengthening the sense of identity of Vietnamese readers. © Media Watch.

AB  - Cinema for social change is not a new approach. Odia cinema, earlier known as Oriya cinema, has been intrinsically connected to the essence of Odia language and culture in the Indian state of Odisha. Since the inception of Odia cinema, it has been endeavoring to send social messages by employing visual communication for social change and development. Despite riding on the path of social and attitudinal changes, the films representing the disabled characters have raised eyebrows concerning its commitments to outcomes. As the spirit of rights activism and changing public discourses on disability on the rise, Odia cinema industry is pushed to face a decisive test. The disdain for disability in entertainment media is unraveled, and the politics of treating the disabled has become flawed. The current study has attempted to understand the cinematic construction in the light of the model, gender, identity, and societal approach towards disability issues. © Media Watch.

AB  - Peer relationship plays an important role in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). However, little is known about how and in what conditions peer relationship may influence NSSI. By integrating multiple theories (i.e., attachment theory, the emotional regulation model of self-compassion and NSSI, and the differential-susceptibility theory), the current study investigated two potential mediators (i.e., self-compassion and depressive symptoms) and one potential moderator (i.e., behavioral impulsivity) of the relation between peer acceptance and NSSI. Participants were 813 Chinese adolescents (43% female; Mage at Wave 1 = 13.15 years) from a two-wave longitudinal study with data spanning one year. The results revealed that the indirect pathways linking peer acceptance and NSSI were conditioned on the level of behavioral impulsivity. Specifically, for adolescents with lower levels of impulsivity, a higher level of peer acceptance was related to fewer depressive symptoms directly or indirectly through self-compassion; fewer depressive symptoms, in turn, were linked to fewer NSSI behaviors longitudinally. For adolescents with higher levels of behavioral impulsivity, peer acceptance was related to fewer NSSI behaviors only through self-compassion. Results indicate that increasing peer acceptance is important in reducing adolescent NSSI. Interventions designed to reduce adolescent NSSI may also be effective if they focus on promoting adolescent self-compassion, particularly for adolescents with higher levels of behavioral impulsivity. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the context of the financial crisis in Europe and drawing on social identity and perceived disadvantage literature, this research explored national identification, perceived prejudice, perceived ostracism, and anger as predictors of intentions to engage in normative collective action and support for non-normative and destructive action. Correlational data were collected in Greece (N = 218), Portugal (N = 312), and Italy (N = 211) during the financial crisis that affected several European countries in the early 2010s. Hierarchical regressions showed that national identification, above and beyond all other variables, positively predicted normative collective action intentions, and negatively predicted support for non-normative action. That is, people who were identified more strong with their national identity were more likely to report that they will engage in collective action to enhance the position of their (national) in-group, and less likely to support destructive collective action. Mediation analyses revealed that in the case of Portugal and Italy, national identification associated negatively with anger, while anger positively predicted normative collective action. The findings of this research point to the importance of national identification as a factor, that, on the one hand motivates people's mobilization toward supporting the rights of the ingroup but on the other hand impedes the more negative and destructive side of collective action. The contextual and instrumental role of national identity in contexts of threat is discussed. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This paper builds on scholarship of welfare chauvinism in Europe to present evidence of the relationship between xenophobia and family leave policies in contemporary Russia. I argue that popular anti-immigrant moods pressure government into providing more generous family benefits to Russian families while proposing restrictions to migrants. Findings are based on elite interviews, as well as content analysis of mass media, policy documents, public speeches, and party manifestos. I show that xenophobia is widespread in Russia among the public and policymakers alike, and find that xenophobia is embraced by policymakers to guide decisions regarding the allocation of social benefits. © 2019 The Regents of the University of California

AB  - Intercultural friendships are a powerful form of intergroup contact to reduce prejudice (Pettigrew, 1998). Little is known about if and how intercultural friendships may also foster intercultural competence. An important prerequisite for the development of intercultural competence is that adolescents reflect on cultural variations. We refer to the degree to which adolescents discuss cultural variations in intercultural friendships as intercultural socialization and explore the following research questions: (1) Does intercultural socialization in friendships mediate the relation between age, intercultural friendship characteristics (friendship group composition, and length, quality, and interaction frequency of the closest intercultural friendship), and adolescents’ intercultural competence? (2) Do these relations depend on the adolescents’ self-identification with majority and minority culture(s)? The sample included 571 adolescents in Germany (48% female, Mage = 13.69 years, 52% identifying only as members of the cultural majority, 48% (also) as members of a cultural minority. Intercultural competence was measured using a self-report questionnaire and open-ended questions capturing the adolescents’ interpretation of and reaction to intercultural situations. Quantitative measures tapped into friendship characteristics (friendship group composition, and length, quality, and interaction frequency of the closest intercultural friendship). To test our model, we employed multigroup path analysis with latent variables in Mplus. Results showed that intercultural socialization linked age and intercultural friendship characteristics with adolescents’ intercultural competence. The relations partly varied depending on student's cultural self-identification. We conclude that intercultural friendships are associated with important skills that are needed in increasingly multicultural societies if students experience and discuss cultural variations in these friendships. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - What is known on the subject?: People with a diagnosis of personality disorder often experience stigma both outside of, and within, mental health services. The media contribute to people's understanding of mental health issues, and negative portrayals appear to lead to increased negative attitudes in readers. Relatively little is known about how the press represent personality disorder, and the types of messages that people with this disorder may be receiving, which may impact on their understanding of themselves and emotional well-being. What the paper adds to existing knowledge?: The key findings indicate that in a 10-year period, the representation of personality disorder in the popular tabloid press in the UK was characterized by the frequent use of language of violence. The research approach enabled the study to identify significant patterns in the language used, rather than only using a checklist of words that the press are directed to avoid. This adds to our understanding about the images repeatedly presented that may affect how readers treat people with a diagnosis of personality disorder and affect the self-esteem of those with the diagnosis. What are the implications for practice?: Mental health nurses are well placed to address issues of stigma both in terms of the general public's beliefs and the impact it has on those who use mental health services. A greater understanding of the messages in the press can help nurses to support service users who are vulnerable to believing that their lives will start to reflect the negative messages they have read. Abstract: IntroductionMany people with a diagnosis of personality disorder experience stigma, and the press’ representations may contribute to those processes. To date, little is known about how the press write about people with personality disorder and analysis of language used is often limited to checklists of words to avoid. AimThe aim of the study was to explore the linguistic characteristics of press articles about personality disorder in popular tabloids in the UK and consider the implications for stigmatization. MethodCorpus linguistics was used to examine a 50% sample of all articles published by the popular press in the UK, from 2008 to 2017, that referred to personality disorder (n = 260). ResultsThe findings identified a range of words that constructed narratives of violence. DiscussionThe method enabled the findings to expand the current level of knowledge in the field, identifying patterns in the use of the language of violence, which may contribute to the processes of self-stigma. Implications for practiceGreater understanding of the messages in the press can sensitize nurses to common misconceptions about the disorder, how these may have become internalised and the need for psycho-social interventions to address the impact of self-stigma on self-esteem. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - People with disabilities face multiple forms of social exclusion, discrimination, and oppression, including in the domain of sex and sexuality. From a critical psychoanalytic viewpoint, social responses to persons with impairments are strongly unconsciously mediated, and often dominated by projections based on archaic anxieties about dependency, vulnerability, and shame. Where disability meets sexuality, these defenses may be more prominent still, resulting, for one example, in the prejudiced myth that people with disabilities are disinterested in, or not capable of, sex. Using this theoretical stance, this paper examines how the developmental role of family and societal influences on the social constructions of sexuality and disability are internalized, resisted, and negotiated by two South Africans with physical disabilities. Data are drawn from interview material elicited via photovoice methodology. The interview narratives and photographic images are used to explore how sexual oppression may be internalized, creating intra-psychic barriers to inclusion for this already structurally disadvantaged group. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Why did a Conservative UK government decide to cut back road building during a time of austerity in the 1990s, whereas a Conservative-led Coalition government decided to substantially increase road building during a time of austerity after 2010? This study aims to answer that question drawing on 32 interviews with ministers, advisors and others, and secondary analysis of media coverage and public opinion. It uses Critical Realist methods in a more specific way than previous studies, representing the key actors, causal mechanisms and changes in underlying social structures in diagrammatic form. It concludes that three mechanisms: a rational response to changing transport circumstances, changing economic ideology prompted by the recession of 2007–9 and public opinion, influenced by the protest movement in the 1990s, explain the contrasting decisions. It identifies key actors who influenced government decisions and explains how a Critical Realist analysis questions the traditional concept in transport studies of causal factors and their relative importance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is growing evidence for the effectiveness of choice architecture or ‘nudge’ interventions to change a range of behaviours including the consumption of alcohol, tobacco and food. Public acceptability is key to implementing these and other interventions. However, few studies have assessed public acceptability of these interventions, including the extent to which acceptability varies with the type of intervention, the target behaviour and with evidence of intervention effectiveness. These were assessed in an online study using a between-participants full factorial design with three factors: Policy (availability vs size vs labelling vs tax) x Behaviour (alcohol consumption vs tobacco use vs high-calorie snack food consumption) x Evidence communication (no message vs assertion of policy effectiveness vs assertion and quantification of policy effectiveness [e.g., a 10% change in behaviour]). Participants (N = 7058) were randomly allocated to one of the 36 groups. The primary outcome was acceptability of the policy. Acceptability differed across policy, behaviour and evidence communication (all ps <.001). Labelling was the most acceptable policy (supported by 78%) and Availability the least (47%). Tobacco use was the most acceptable behaviour to be targeted by policies (73%) compared with policies targeting Alcohol (55%) and Food (54%). Relative to the control group (60%), asserting evidence of effectiveness increased acceptability (63%); adding a quantification to this assertion did not significantly increase this further (65%). Public acceptability for nudges and taxes to improve population health varies with the behaviour targeted and the type of intervention but is generally favourable. Communicating that these policies are effective can increase support by a small but significant amount, suggesting that highlighting effectiveness could contribute to mobilising public demand for policies. While uncertainty remains about the strength of public support needed, this may help overcome political inertia and enable action on behaviours that damage population and planetary health. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: Emergency departments (EDs) are a new focus of interest in recent years as a possible solution for increasing organ donations, as, EDs are full of missed opportunities. In this study, we aimed to determine the barriers to the identification and referral by emergency medicine physicians (EMPs) of potential brain death (BD) cases. Materials and methods: The participants of the study consist of 252 EMPs who had answered the questionnaire sent via e-mail. Findings: The following causes were found in the questionnaire: (1) negative attitudes and lack of knowledge about organ donation in society (63.1%); (2) religious beliefs (57.5%); (3) family refusal (57.1%); (4) disruption of bodily integrity (45.6%); (5) inadequate knowledge of doctors (50.4%); (6) difficulties in predicting the prognosis of the patient and diagnosing BD in EDs (40.1%); (7) fear of negative reactions from relatives of patients (37.7%); (8) the absence of an organ procurement unit (OPU) (36.5%); (9) lack of ideal candidates (27%); (10) increased workload in EDs (23.8%); and (11) fear of legal problems arising (23.8%). Of the participants, 42.9% stated that there was an OPU in their hospital. Of the participants, 15.8% reported that they have good communication with the OPU. Conclusions: Negative attitudes and lack of knowledge about organ donation in society, religious beliefs, inadequate knowledge of EMPs, and the absence of an OPU in hospitals are important barriers to organ donor notification from EDs. Increasing social awareness and increasing of the level of knowledge of EMPs and close cooperation between OPU and EDs will significantly contribute to the increase of organ donor notifications from EDs. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The operating environment of water infrastructure is inherently dynamic due to factors such as water-related events, media coverage of such events, or changes in institutional expectations. This dynamic environment impacts public perceptions of infrastructure services and providers. In an effort to understand public views regarding water infrastructure, decision makers may periodically assess perceptions to aid in pursuing successful community-supported management strategies. However, single cross-sectional samples from previous studies do not consider the changes in perceptions over time. This study assessed dynamic perceptions of local water providers using two surveys deployed in 21 US shrinking cities, before (2013) and after (2016) media attention on nationwide water infrastructure challenges arising from events such as the Flint water crisis. Questions of interest pertained to whether respondents trust their water providers and want to partake in participatory processes of local utilities. Results indicated a statistically significant change in perceptions, highlighting the importance of temporal sampling. Statistical modeling revealed that geographic parameters typically have homogeneous impacts, indicating localized factors influencing utility-customer relationships in shaping perceptions, whereas demographic parameters have heterogeneous impacts. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Parents can significantly impact their adolescent child’s sexual and relationship decision-making, yet many parents are not effectively communicating with their teens about these topics. Media are sexual socialization agents for adolescents, which can encourage early or risky sexual activity. Media Aware Parent is a web-based program for parents of adolescents that was designed to improve adolescent sexual health by providing parents with the skills to have high-quality communication with their child about sex and relationships as well as to mediate their media usage. This web-based randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2018–2019 with parent-child pairs (grades 7, 8, or 9; N = 355) from across the United States. Parent participants identified as mostly female (75%), white/Caucasian (74%); and non-Hispanic (92%). The youth sample was more balanced in terms of gender (45% female) and more diverse with respect to race (66% white) and ethnicity (86% non-Hispanic). Twenty-eight percent of the families identified as a single parent household, and 35% of the youth were eligible for free school lunch. The present study assessed the short-term effects of Media Aware Parent on parent–adolescent communication, adolescent sexual health outcomes, and media-related outcomes across a one-month timeframe. Parents were randomly assigned to the intervention (Media Aware Parent) or active control group (online access to medically-accurate information on adolescent sexual health). The intervention improved parent–adolescent communication quality as rated by both parents and youth. Youth were more likely to understand that their parent did not want them to have sex at this early age. Youth reported more agency over hook-ups, more positive attitudes about sexual health communication and contraception/protection, and more self-efficacy to use contraception/protection, if they decide to have sexual activity. The intervention improved media literacy skills in both parents and youth, and resulted in youth being more aware of family media rules. Parents gave overwhelming positive feedback about Media Aware Parent. The results from this pretest-posttest study provide evidence that Media Aware Parent is an effective web-based program for parents seeking to enhance parent–adolescent communication and media mediation, and positively impact their adolescents’ sexual health outcomes. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Diversity and inclusion in medicine, and in surgery in particular, still merit substantial attention in 2019. With each increase in academic rank there are fewer women, with only 24% of full professors in medicine being women. Underrepresented minorities face similar challenges, with only 3% of medical faculty being black and 4% of medical faculty being Hispanic or Latino; only 2% of full professors are Hispanic or Latino and only another 2% are black. Explicit discrimination unfortunately still does exist, but in many environments, more subtle forms of bias are more prevalent. Microaggressions, which are categorized as microassaults, microinsults, microinvalidations, and environmental microaggressions, are indirect expressions of prejudice that contribute to the maintenance of existing power structures and may limit the hiring, promotion, and retention of women and underrepresented minorities. The primary goal of this communication is to help readers understand microaggressions and their effect. We also provide suggestions for how recipients or bystanders may respond to microaggressions. © 2019 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Intergroup contact has long been recognized as an important factor in promoting positive intergroup attitudes. However, in operationalizing intergroup attitudes, previous studies have rarely investigated attitudes toward one of the most intimate forms of contact, romantic relationships. In this study (N = 176), we expand the intergroup contact literature to examine the association between intergroup contact and, arguably, a litmus test of intergroup attitudes: receptivity to intergroup romance. We do so in Northern Ireland, a context that is historically and presently characterized by sectarian division and tension between Catholics and Protestants. Our findings reveal that intergroup contact is positively associated with receptivity to both dating and marrying an outgroup member. These associations are mediated by ingroup norms toward outgroup romances. General outgroup attitudes were also found to be positively associated with contact but, in contrast to romantic attitudes, this association was shown, for the first time, to be simultaneously mediated by ingroup norms, anxiety, empathy, and trust. In addition, strength of ingroup identification played a moderating role, with a stronger positive relationship between contact and both romantic and general outgroup attitudes among higher identifiers. The findings highlight the importance of examining attitudes toward intergroup romantic relationships, as well as understanding the different mediating and moderating mechanisms which may account for how contact influences general attitudes and romantic attitudes. In the wake of the UK vote to leave the European Union, they also serve as an important reminder of how intergroup contact can be effective in promoting peace in Northern Ireland. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This study responds to calls to examine the mechanism through which talent management affects talented employees’ attitudes. Anchored on exchange theories, this study examines a salient mechanism, perceived organisational support, through which talent management practices might affect talented employees’ attitudes. Data were obtained from a cross-sectional survey of 242 talented employees in the Ghanaian banking sector and analysed with the use of the structural equation modelling analytical technique. Our findings show that talent management has not only a direct effect, but also an indirect effect, on talented employees’ attitudes of affective commitment and quit intention through perceived organisational support. The study has implications for the management of talented employees. Points for practitioners: The effectiveness of organisational support systems exists not only in the practices themselves, but also in the perceptions that employees have of those practices. For organisations to benefit fully from the implementation of talent management, managers must inform talent pool members of their status and constantly communicate talent management practices. While directly impacting affective commitment and intention to quit, talent management also operates through a path connecting perceived organisational support to these attitudes. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - It is common nowadays for parents to share information about their children on social network sites (SNSs). However, little is known on how adolescents think and feel about this sharenting behavior. Therefore, this study explores adolescents' perception of the reasons why parents share information about their adolescent children on SNSs, and adolescents' attitudes toward sharenting. A survey study was conducted among 817 adolescents. Factor analyses pointed toward four perceived sharenting motives: parental advice motives, social motives, impression management motives, and informative-archiving motives. Adolescents believed that parents mainly shared information about their children due to informative-archiving motives. They believed that parental advice motives were less common. Preliminary analyses pointed out that adolescents largely disapproved of sharenting. They mainly considered it as embarrassing and useless. Regression analysis indicated that when adolescents perceived sharenting as an impression management issue, the more negative their attitudes were toward sharenting. Conversely, the more adolescents thought that parents shared information about their children due to informative-archiving motives, the less they disapproved of sharenting. Additionally, when adolescents themselves disclosed more personal information or when they were more often confronted with sharenting, they had more positive attitudes toward sharenting. Adolescents who were more concerned about their online privacy, were more likely to disapprove of sharenting. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The article discusses police oversight systems. In the Nordic countries, the primary focus of external oversight is on individual accountability, and the article reports on results from an evaluation of the Danish Independent Police Complaints Authority (IPCA), established in 2011. Results show that the vast majority of complaints are not upheld, and that most complainants are dissatisfied with their experience with the system. They find the case processing time too long, they think the Authority is prejudiced in favour of the police, and they do not understand the reasoning behind the decisions. The article argues that disappointment is related to the fact that the IPCA focuses almost exclusively on individual wrongdoing (rarely finding sufficient evidence to take action), whereas complainants seek recognition and wish to hold the police organization accountable. It is suggested that the complaints system should be redirected towards mediation between officers and citizens and include a focus on organizational accountability. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - A woman's social behaviour reportedly varies across the menstrual cycle. In this study, we estimated changes in sensitivity to social exclusion across the menstrual cycle and scrutinized the related role of progesterone. Forty-nine naturally cycling women played a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball)to manipulate social inclusion. All participants underwent inclusion and exclusion conditions during the late follicular and the luteal phase. We assessed salivary progesterone concentrations at each cycle phase. After each Cyberball session we measured positive/negative mood using the Multidimensional Mood State Questionnaire (MDMQ). Multilevel analyses indicated that women showed worse mood following exclusion as compared to inclusion conditions (p = 0.014). Notably, this exclusion effect was more pronounced during the luteal phase than the late follicular phase (p = 0.029). As expected, progesterone concentrations were higher during the luteal phase as compared to the late follicular phase, but interestingly, progesterone concentrations were negatively associated with exclusion effects. When accounting for mediation via progesterone, direct cycle-phase related differences in social exclusion effects even increased as compared to the model without mediator. These findings suggest that progesterone may function as buffer against negative feelings that result from being socially excluded. The relevance of these findings for Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)are discussed, and we conclude that social exclusion may represent an important research domain criterion (RDoC)of relevance for PMDD, with progesterone pointing to new potential pharmacological targets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Autochthony is the belief that a place belongs to those who were born there and that they are more entitled. Autochthony and local identification can foster sensitivity to any source of disorder that threatens local stability. The aims of this study were to determine whether: (a) local identification is associated with a higher level of sensitivity to urban disorder and a higher level of prejudice toward immigrants; (b) higher city identifiers use autochthony (entitlement for first comers) as a justification for both of these attitudes. A self-report questionnaire was administered to 254 adult residents of Turin, Italy. Local identification was found related to autochthony and to urban disorder sensitivity, autochthony was positively associated with both urban disorder sensitivity and prejudice toward immigrants and it mediated the relationship between local identification and prejudice. © 2019 Society for Community Research and Action

AB  - In recent years, western media coverage is frequently filled with issues relating to Islam, which are unfavorable to Muslims. The attitudinal consequences of such media messages are widely discussed; however, empirical research is scarce. This study uses large-scale panel data on adolescents in combination with newspaper data and takes advantage of an extensive fieldwork period during which media salience of Muslims has fluctuated. All unmeasured time-invariant characteristics are accounted for by adopting a fixed-effects panel design. The results provide evidence of immediate attitudinal responses to media salience: the more media salience of Muslims on the day of survey participation, the more negative adolescents feel about Muslims. However, the results do not point toward a secondary transfer effect because media-induced negative attitudes toward Muslims were not transferred to ethnic minorities. Findings of this study advance current research by providing evidence for the effect of daily variations in media salience on attitudes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objectives of this study were to identify the knowledge and support needs for a wide range of health professions who come in contact with patients with Functional Neurological Disorders (FND) in Australia. Invitations to an anonymous online survey (36 items) were sent to health professionals (practicing in the fields of neurology, psychiatry, psychology, general practice, nursing and physiotherapy) who are involved in the care of patients suffering from FND. Potential participants were invited via professional and hospital databases, advertising in professional newsletters as well as direct emails. A total of 538 health professionals completed the questionnaire. Most participants did not feel well educated about FND with only 14% of General practitioners (GPs) reporting ‘good’ knowledge. Neurologists, GPs and nurses reported lower clinical interest and greater negative attitude towards FND than psychiatrists, psychologists and physiotherapists. Many health professionals do not feel confident discussing the possibility of a Functional Neurological Disorder with a patient. Seeing more patients per year was significantly correlated with greater knowledge (r = 0.54) and confidence diagnosing (r = 0.49) FND. It was also significantly related to confidence in discussing the diagnosis of FND with a patient (r = 0.44). These factors were not significantly related to years of practice. Although patients suffering from Functional Neurological Disorders are commonly seen by many health professionals in clinic practice, there is little training in this area and self-perceived knowledge in Australia is generally poor. There is, however, clear interest in this area and our findings suggest that improved teaching and education of health professionals about FND and its management could potentially have a significant impact towards better patient care. © 2019

AB  - Objectives: Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in the criminal justice setting is an effective way to address opioid use disorder and prevent associated deaths in the community. The Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC) is the first statewide correctional system in the United States to offer comprehensive MOUD services to incarcerated individuals.However, due to stigma, eligible individuals may be reluctant to engage with MOUD. This study aims to 1) evaluate the efficacy of an educational video intervention about MOUD and 2) characterize MOUD-related attitudes in a general incarcerated population. Methods: Participants were recruited from eight elective classes offered to soon-to-be-released incarcerated individuals at RIDOC. Participants viewed an eight-minute video featuring incarcerated individuals speaking about their experiences using MOUD, designed to reduce MOUD-related stigma. Participants were administered surveys prior to and after watching the video to assess changes in MOUD knowledge (MOUD-K) and MOUD attitudes (MOUD-A). Results: This evaluation of the intervention included 80 incarcerated participants (median age = 35, 93% male, 36% non-Hispanic White, and 26% non-Hispanic Black). Forty percent indicated non-medical opioid use within six months prior to incarceration; 13% had previously used MOUD. Significant improvements in MOUD-K scores (t(65) = −7.0, p < 0.0001) and MOUD-A scores (t(69) = −5.8, p < 0.0001) were detected after participants viewed the video. The intervention yielded greater ΔMOUD-A scores among those identifying as non-Hispanic Black, compared to non-Hispanic Whites (β = 2.6, CI = 0.4, 4.8). Conclusion: The educational video improved both knowledge and positive attitudes towards MOUD, with changes in MOUD attitudes being influenced by race. These findings may inform future MOUD educational programs, thereby helping to reduce opioid use disorder-related morbidity and mortality. © 2019

AB  - Online dating has become a very popular way to find a romantic partner. In the present study, we examined whether romantic interest and rejection in such a setting would evoke differential electrocortical and cardiac responses. For this purpose a database was created, similar to a dating website, where the participants’ personal information and photos were placed. Heterosexual, single participants (N = 61) evaluated the profiles of opposite-sex potential romantic partners and decided whether they would like to date this person or not. Subsequently, participants passively viewed (34 analyzable volunteers participated in the EEG session; 10 male; mean age = 20) the pictures of the potential partners together with their own judgment about the “dateability” of the potential partner, and the potential partner's judgment of the “dateability” of the participant. After viewing the pictures participants received the email addresses to contact their matches. Electrocortical and cardiac responses to these “match” or “non-match” judgments were measured. A significantly larger P3 response was found when participants received a positive evaluation as compared to negative evaluations. This is in line with an explanation in terms of reward. A significantly larger cardiac deceleration was found when participants received a negative evaluation as compared to positive evaluations, which is in line with an explanation in terms of social pain. Findings are discussed in terms of activation of different parts of the anterior cingulate cortex. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: Viral videos of the detainment of undocumented immigrants in cages and police killings of unarmed citizens are two of the most pressing traumatic events facing adolescents of color. However, little is known about whether these online experiences are linked to mental health outcomes. This study examines the association between exposure to such events online and mental health in a sample of African American and Latinx adolescents. Methods: Data were collected from a national sample of 302 African American and Latinx adolescents aged 11–19 years. Participants reported their exposure to traumatic events online (TEO), depressive symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and other sociodemographics. Multiple regression analyses were conducted. Results: Analyses indicated a significant association between TEO and both PTSD symptoms and depressive symptoms, indicating that more frequent experiences of TEO were associated with higher levels of PTSD symptoms and depressive symptoms. In addition, regression analyses further indicated that girls reported higher PTSD and depressive symptoms than boys. Latinx participants also reported increased depressive symptoms. Conclusions: This study extends recent research that suggests police killings, as well as viewing distressing news directed at members of one's own racial–ethnic group or those who share the same immigration status, are related to poor mental health outcomes. Researchers should also explore what protective factors may buffer youth against the outcomes typically associated with these events. © 2019 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine

AB  - A survey of people in the market distribution area of the Florida Times-Union (T-U) showed that amount of exposure to the newspaper indirectly predicted positive attitudes about civic participation and civic participation behaviors such as volunteering and religious activities, as mediated through connectivity with the T-U and news interest. Online and offline communication were also directly related to positive civic participation attitudes and indirectly to community volunteering and religious activities. © 2019 NOND of AEJMC.

AB  - Aquaculture in Norway is expected to grow radically in the years to come. From both the government and from the industry itself, there is a demand for developing policies that can accommodate this intensification in activity. However, the aquaculture industry in Norway is also met with considerable skepticism and resistance. Both NGOs and several researchers have voiced concerns in the media, expressing a need for more insight into this resistance. This article explores the attitudes of local residents and stakeholder groups towards aquaculture through a qualitative field study in a small coastal community. Data shows that attitudes are not necessarily a matter of being for or against aquaculture. The issue at stake is sustainability, as what residents and stakeholder groups want is sustainable aquaculture. However, how the different groups interpreted sustainability differed, both between groups and depending on the circumstances. Our analysis shows that interpretations are embedded in different world-views or orders of worth. In this article, we give empirical insight into the expressed attitudes of various stakeholder groups, discuss the underlying values and indicate possible implications these findings can have for policy-making in the Norwegian coastal zone. © 2019

AB  - Physical attractiveness is an essential factor in consumers' evaluation processes during a service encounter. Using both experimental and field study designs, we demonstrate that a service representative's physical attractiveness affects consumer response (i.e., customer satisfaction, service quality perception, and likability of the service representative). Also, we find that a consumer's social distance perception between themselves and a service representative mediates the physical attractiveness effect on consumer response. Thus, this article is the first to demonstrate that social distance perception is an underlining mechanism of the physical attractiveness effect. Furthermore, findings from Studies 2 and 3 show that consumers' physical attractiveness and their attractiveness-ability belief moderate the physical attractiveness effect. Although contentious to some, our findings indicate that the recruitment of attractive representatives may be an effective business practice in service settings. However, managers should not regard consumers as a homogeneous group; self-perceived unattractive consumers may respond negatively to their service representative's physical attractiveness. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Despite the spreading of virtual reality (VR) in tourism, little is known about the characteristics of different segments of tourists experiencing cultural tourism attractions through VR applications. This paper proposes to profile museum visitors based on their perceptions and attitudes towards VR applications and investigates whether they are significantly different in terms of socio-demographic characteristics and emotional responses towards the VR-mediated experience. With the use of exploratory factor-cluster analysis of 287 visitors of a cultural attraction, three clusters were identified with significant differences in terms of attitudes and perceptions towards the VR-mediated experience and emotional feelings. Implications for research and practice are discussed. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study examined determinants of attitudes towards and use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in older adults, including variations in cultural context, socio-demographic factors (age, education, and gender) and the individual’s time perspective. Towards this end, 638 older adults in Italy (n = 262, M = 71.7 years) and Sweden (n = 376, M = 69.9 years) completed the Swedish Time Perspective Inventory (S-ZTPI), the Attitude toward Technologies Questionnaire (ATTQ), and questions regarding use of specific digital technologies (e.g. Internet, Skype, Facebook); data were collected in 2013–2014. The results showed more positive attitudes toward ICTs in Swedish compared with Italian elderly as well as more frequent use of technologies. Regardless of nationality, younger age and higher levels of educational attainment was positively associated with attitudes towards ICTs. Male gender was associated with higher ATTQ scores in the Italian, but not in the Swedish, sample. Time perspective accounted for significant variance beyond the foregoing variables. S-ZTPI Past Negative, Future Negative and Present Fatalistic in particular, were (negatively) related to ATTQ scores, with a similar pattern for ICT use. Future Positive and Present Hedonistic were positively associated with ATTQ scores, across the samples. In conclusion, between-person differences in time perspective organization are an important factor to account for variability in attitudes towards and use of ICTs in old age, and appears to exert an influence over and beyond other significant predictors, such as cultural context, age/cohort membership, and educational level. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - We examined the association of women empowerment and HIV testing in Nepalese women. Data from the 2012 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey provided a sample of 6,579 females ages 15-49 years. Women empowerment subcategories included participation in decision making, attitudes about safer sex negotiation, and sexual autonomy. Only 454 participants (6.9%) had been tested for HIV. Of note, 41.3% had high participation in decision making, 84.5% showed positive attitudes about safer sex negotiation, and 71.8% scored high in sexual autonomy. After adjusting potential confounders, the odds of being tested were higher for women with positive attitudes about safer sex negotiation (adjusted odds ratio = 1.444, 95% confidence interval: 1.006-2.072, p =.046) and high sexual autonomy (adjusted odds ratio = 3.138, 95% confidence interval: 1.375-7.164, p =.007). Age, education, and wealth were independent factors determining the women's HIV testing approach. Our study can be a guide for interventions and policies to empower women and encourage HIV testing in Nepal. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

AB  - Attitudes towards immigration are among the core predictors of attitudes toward the European Union. However, even though most citizens learn about immigration through the media, we lack a comprehensive account of how media coverage of immigration influences support for the European Union. In this study, we use a combination of European Social Survey and Media Claims data to investigate the effects of the visibility and valence of immigration and refugee media coverage on political trust in the European Union in 18 countries between 2012 and 2016. Our results show that media coverage of immigration and refugees influences trust in the European Union; however, the effects depend on citizens’ ideological leaning and content characteristics. Furthermore, we find that the impact of immigration attitudes on trust in the European Union becomes more important over the course of the refugee crisis. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Background: Participation in first-in-human (FIH) clinical trials is a valuable contribution to science. This study aims to investigate the Saudi public's attitude toward FIH clinical trials, identify their willingness to take part in it, and their preferences for participating in these kinds of trials, given the fact that the Saudi FDA has never approved such studies in Saudi Arabia. Methods: This was a cross sectional study conducted in February 2018. It was based on a self-reported survey distributed by convenience among Saudi adults visiting a national festival in Riyadh and through social media. Data were analysed using descriptive and bivariate statistics, as well as linear and binary logistic regression. Results: Study participants who were invited and completed the survey were 657. The percentage mean score of participants’ attitudes and concern was 70.1 ± 16.4 and 58.3 ± 15.3 respectively. Almost 71.5% expressed their intention to enroll in such trials. Higher attitudinal scores were reported by those who perceived healthcare services as good/excellent (adj.P < 0.001), and by those who had less concerns (adj.P = 0.005). Less educated participants were 1.75 [1.04–2.93] times more likely to enroll in future clinical trials, adj.P = 0.035. For every one unit increase in the attitudinal score, study participants were 1.03 [1.02–1.04] more likely to enroll in future trials, adj.P < 0.001. In contrary, for every one unit increase in concern scores, the odds of enrollment decreased among study participants by 0.98 [0.97–0.99], adj.P = 0.017. The factors causing people to decline participation were mainly fear of the unknown, social reasons, religious reasons, moral reasons, and the concern over human beings being treated as animals. The preferred duration for participation was 1–3 days (n = 268, 57%). Participants revealed their preferences of clinical trial studies were in favor: (a) vaccines (n = 209, 44.5%); (b) treatment drugs (n = 232, 49.4%); and (c) medical devices (n = 310, 66.0%). Conclusion: The Saudi public community showed a high level of enthusiasm for participation in future FIH clinical trials, yet they had some reservations. Increasing public awareness about the benefits of clinical trials and conduction process helps to alleviate the concerns of the Saudi people and to increase their likelihood of enrollment. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Objective: This analysis explores the effects of relaying information about the genetic and behavioral causes of obesity (vs. control) on physician trainees’ verbal communication behavior with a virtual patient with obesity. Moderation by physician trainees’ gender and BMI was also assessed. Methods: 119 physician trainees’ verbal responses were recorded and coded using a close-ended content analytic approach. Results: Physician trainees in the behavioral and genetic information conditions were more likely to discuss weight (behavioral: AOR = 5.40; genetic: AOR = 6.58,) and provide lifestyle counseling (behavioral: AOR = 10.92; genetic: AOR = 3.50). Those in the behavioral condition were more likely to make assumptions about the patient's lifestyle behavior (AOR = 5.53) and use stigmatizing language (AOR = 4.69). Heavier physician trainees in the genetic condition had shorter interactions (β = −0.53, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Emphasizing the genetic causes of overweight offers a potential avenue for encouraging clinical communication with patients with obesity, without also increasing prejudice and bias. Additional efforts may be needed to reap the benefits of genetic information for providers with higher weight. Practice Implications: For providers, considering genetic factors underlying patient body weight and obesity risk may serve to reduce stigmatizing communication with patients. © 2019

AB  - An online experiment examined the effects of Instagram posts’ source types and product-placement types on brand attitude and credibility perception. A 2 (source: brand versus Instagram influencer) × 2 (product placement: product-only [explicit product placement] versus influencer-with-product [moderate product placement]) between-subjects factorial experiment (N = 304) tested the effects of the two manipulated factors on source credibility, corporate credibility, and attitude toward brand posts. Two-way ANOVAs indicate a main effect of source types on perceived trustworthiness and interaction effects of product-placement and source types on perceived expertise, corporate credibility, and attitude toward brand posts. Consumers exposed to brand as the source conditions indicated no difference in corporate credibility and brand attitude regardless of product-placement types. In contrast, consumers exposed to Instagram influencer as the source conditions indicated higher corporate credibility and more positive attitude toward brand posts when exposed to the influencer-with-product conditions than when exposed to the product-only conditions. Consumers differently react to product placement on Instagram influencers’ accounts depending on whether the influencers are present versus absent. Consumers react negatively to influencers’ posts when they do not appear with the products they endorse. Parasocial interaction mediates the relationship between product/brand placement types and corporate credibility. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Research suggests that modernization is an important driver of liberalization in the field of gay and lesbian rights. Surprisingly, it has often been assumed—but not empirically examined—that a culture of tolerance mediates the relationship between socioeconomic modernization and liberal legislation. This article closes this gap by analyzing the seventy-three countries that took part in the fifth and sixth waves of the World Values Survey. As government responsiveness to public attitudes is structurally enforced by means of electoral accountability in democracies, but not in autocracies, we, in addition, distinguish between these regime types in an analysis of moderated mediation. We show that tolerant attitudes toward homosexuals do, indeed, mediate the influence of modernization on gay and lesbian rights policies in democracies, but not in autocracies. The result is confirmed by extensive robustness checks, including an instrumental variables approach to account for a potential reverse causality between tolerance and rights. The study does not only underline the relevance of cultural aspects of modernization, but also points to the crucial importance of regime type for a translation of public opinion into policy. © 2018 University of Utah.

AB  - Objective: Bisexual women report higher rates of sexual revictimization than their heterosexual and lesbian peers (Heidt, Marx, & Gold, 2005; Hequembourg, Livingston, & Parks, 2013), and limited research has examined risk factors for sexual revictimization among this population. The current study examined hazardous drinking use as a mediator of the relation between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and adult rape among bisexual women. Further, antibisexual prejudice was tested as a moderator of the indirect effect to better understand the context of hazardous drinking within this population. Method: Data were collected online from 343 bisexual women. Participants completed measures of CSA, antibisexual prejudice, hazardous drinking, and adult rape. The PROCESS macro was used to test the conditional indirect effect of CSA on adult rape via hazardous drinking, moderated by antibisexual prejudice. Results: The rate of revictimization in the current sample was 38.6%. The hypothesized conditional indirect effect was supported; CSA was indirectly related to adult rape through hazardous drinking only at mean and high levels of antibisexual prejudice. Conclusions: Findings highlight the need for interventions at both policy and individual levels. Policies aimed at reducing bisexual stigma may be useful in addressing high rates of revictimization and reducing the potential for victim blaming, as it highlights the role of societal stigma in creating risk for revictimization. Clinical interventions focused on helping CSA survivors cope adaptively with the added stress of antibisexual prejudice may be useful in reducing risk for sexual revictimization. © 2019 American Psychological Association.

AB  - In the international context of efforts to combat the stigmatization of people with mental health problems, representations and attitudes about these illnesses have not to date been widely investigated in France. However, new technologies offer an unprecedented opportunity to collect such information on a large scale and to deploy more efficient action against stigma. Objectives: The Crazy'App survey was designed as an instrument for studying potentially stigmatizing representations and attitudes towards mental disorders. It asks respondents to react, rather than to standard diagnostic labels or case vignettes, to video testimonies by people with different mental disorders talking about their experiences. Methods: The web survey was made available on smartphone or computer and advertised on various media and during a French exhibition about mental disorders, mental health and well-being (“Mental Désordre”, Cité des sciences, Paris, 2016). It consisted of short (< 2 min) video testimonials by four people presenting respectively anorexia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction to alcohol. Each testimony was immediately followed by series of questions to which participants were to respond using visual analog scales. The questionnaires investigated different domains, such as the causes of each of these mental disorders, the possible treatments and the respondent's personal attitudes in hypothetical situations (e.g. working with the person seen in the video). After having completed the survey, respondents were offered an opportunity to compare their own responses to those of the other respondents, and watch expert psychiatrists interviews delivering clinical and scientific knowledge and sharing their own attitudes. Results: The respondents (n = 2600) were young, mostly women, educated and concerned about the subject. They exhibited good knowledge of the disorders. They reported a multi-causal view of the etiologies, where psychological causes were rated higher than neurobiological causes (although less so for respondents reporting having had a mental disorder themselves), while other types of causes (environmental, spiritual, and nutritional) received much lower ratings. Respondents also expressed high potential social proximity, but this result varied according to the type of disorder, in particular, the social distance and the perception of dangerousness were greater for addiction and bipolar disorder. Conclusions: Crazy'App operationalizes emerging strategies in the efforts to combat stigma, implementing what is known as a “contact based intervention” in English-speaking countries. While it does not erase the differences in attitudes observed from one pathology to another, this type of survey-intervention based on video testimonies could help to reduce the desire for social distancing from people with mental disorders, even in a particularly sensitized and informed population. Multimedia technologies are an efficient way to offer rich, potentially interactive content better able to embody people and their actual experiences than clinical descriptions or even life narratives. However the use of videos could put the focus on the individual characteristics (physical, gestural, verbal, nonverbal…), and this should be cautiously taken into account according to the anti-stigma objectives. Connected technologies also make it possible to enhance the more classic de-stigmatization actions focused on the deconstruction of preconceived ideas, making the action more participatory, while simultaneously assessing their efficacy. By mediating contact with individuals and behaviors perceived as deviant, the aim would be to develop psycho-social skills and concrete abilities for action in the general population, to include people with mental disorders in the community. © 2018 L'Encéphale, Paris

AB  - The Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus populations of Windermere, England’s largest natural lake in the Lake District of north-west England, have been studied since the 1940s. However, the species’ cultural importance has a much longer history and these populations have been fished since 1223. As early as 1660, Arctic charr were exploited in a high-profile commercial net fishery and greatly enjoyed by locals and in a ‘potted’ form by wealthier members of UK society. However, overfishing led to substantially decreased catches and commercial netting was stopped in 1921. Local fishing for Arctic charr persists to the present as a small recreational plumb-line fishery using artificial lures. These fishing activities and resulting catches have long held great cultural interest for the local community and visiting national and international tourists. The cultural importance of the Arctic charr populations of Windermere has recently been the subject of national media interest that culminated in a 2017 documentary film highlighting environmental issues facing the Arctic charr and also celebrating the role of this iconic species in the cultural life of Windermere. In addition, international recognition of the Arctic charr populations of Windermere also contributed to the Lake District becoming a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2017. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - There has been significant progress in educational attainment in India since its independence. Yet the achievements are low in comparison to countries in similar stages of development. The situation is worse among groups who have a history of exclusion. Children from these groups have lower enrollment and higher dropout rates than national averages. Yet some of them are able to overcome these limitations and show academic resilience. Using data from the Indian Human Development Survey (2005), we study the role of the different child, household, and school-level factors associated with academic resilience among these children. Further, to understand the mechanism through which group membership affects resilience we also study the indirect effect of group membership mediated through those factors. We find that the protective factors vary across the different disadvantaged groups. The main effect of group membership is through structural factors like poverty and maternal education. Yet, the child level and household level factors play an important role in most cases. Schools fail to play the expected role of being the source of resilience among those who face the strongest burden of structural factors. For some, the schools are the main site where they experience most of the adversities of group memberships. The results highlight the need for educational policy, which addresses the importance of schools as drivers and determinants of academic resilience. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This pioneering study explores the powerful mediating effect of community participation on both residents’ attitudes toward sustainable tourism development and their personal environmentally responsible behaviour. It establishes residents’ attitudes when the concept of sustainable tourism development is introduced, measures its influence on their participation in public affairs, and the importance of their own environmentally responsible behaviour. It explores the complex relationships between attitude, community participation, and environmentally responsible behaviour involved, using a survey of 362 residents from 5 eco-tourism communities in Taiwan. Results show that residents’ attitudes towards sustainable tourism development positively and significantly affect both community participation and environmentally responsible behaviour. The degree of residents’ community participation also positively affects environmentally responsible behaviour. Residents’ attitudes toward sustainable tourism development also directly affected environmentally responsible behaviour as well as indirectly affect behaviour via the mediator, “community participation”. Five mechanisms are suggested to encourage these changes: (1) Institutions develop community sustainable tourism civic education, (2) cohesion and insight for consciousness events to promote sustainable tourism development attitudes, (3) lively public hearings should be encouraged to turn passive into active participation, (4) mechanisms for reporting environmental damage should be created, and (5) community environmental clean-up days should be held. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: Social media and sustainability are changing Chinese consumers’ consumption behavior in notable ways. Few apparel industry sustainability efforts are enforced or well known in China. As China operates its own social media sites, it is necessary to study Chinese social media, rather than Western types, in order to understand its influence on Chinese consumer behavior with regard to sustainability. By extending the theory of reasoned action (TRA) and the prototype willingness model, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how Chinese consumers were taught their environmentally sustainable apparel (ESA) consumption behavior through social media, and also how the influence of peers affected their purchase intentions. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 238 survey responses were collected and analyzed from a Chinese research firm in 2016. In accord with the study objectives, an exploratory factor analysis was first conducted, and then a two-step analysis of a structural equation model was employed for hypothesis testing. To test the significance of hypothesized mediated effects, a bootstrap procedure with 2,000 bootstrap samples from the original data was used to compute bias-corrected 95% CI for indirect effects. Moreover, hierarchical regressions were demonstrated to verify the unique contribution of social media influence. Findings: The study findings support the previous literature that indicated positive attitudes toward environmentally sustainable purchasing behavior increased as Chinese consumers learned about social and environmental issues. Also, results of the analysis revealed that Chinese consumers’ engagement with social media and their peers were important social influences that were directly tied to increasing sustainable apparel purchase intentions. Originality/value: By extending two grand theories of the prototype willingness model theory and the TRA, this study underlines a novel link between the influence of social media and ESA purchase intentions among Chinese consumers. Results are valuable in a global context as it is one of only a few studies to explore Chinese consumers’ purchase intentions of ESA through an exclusive social media platform – WeChat – in China. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Approaching issues through the lens of nonnegotiable values increases the perceived intractability of debate (Baron & Spranca in Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 70, 1–16, 1997), while focusing on the concrete consequences of policies instead results in the moderation of extreme opinions (Fernbach, Rogers, Fox, & Sloman in Psychological Science, 24, 939–946, 2013) and a greater likelihood of conflict resolution (Baron & Leshner in Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 6, 183–194, 2000). Using comments on the popular social media platform Reddit from January 2006 until September 2017, we showed how changes in the framing of same-sex marriage in public discourse relate to changes in public opinion. We used a topic model to show that the contributions of certain protected-values-based topics to the debate (religious arguments and freedom of opinion) increased prior to the emergence of a public consensus in support of same-sex marriage (Gallup, 2017), and declined afterward. In contrast, the discussion of certain consequentialist topics (the impact of politicians’ stance and same-sex marriage as a matter of policy) showed the opposite pattern. Our results reinforce the meaningfulness of protected values and consequentialism as relevant dimensions for describing public discourse and highlight the usefulness of unsupervised machine-learning methods in tackling questions about social attitude change. © 2019, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate, theoretically and empirically, the role of the six dimensions of reconceptualized ethnocentrism in consumer ethnocentrism. The paper investigates both direct and indirect effects of the six dimensions on consumer ethnocentrism, through four theoretically meaningful mediators: nationalism, ethnic ingroup positivity, national ingroup positivity and prejudice against foreigners. Design/methodology/approach: This study has used primary data collected from 304 US citizens through online surveys, including measures of demographics, ethnocentrism, consumer ethnocentrism, nationalism and attitudes toward ethnic ingroups, national ingroups and foreigners. Correlational, sequential multiple regression and parallel multiple mediation analyses were conducted to investigate effects of the dimensions of ethnocentrism on consumer ethnocentrism. Findings: Regression and mediation analyses, covarying age, education, gender, ethnicity and socio-economic status, showed that ethnocentric purity had a direct effect on consumer ethnocentrism, whereas ethnocentric devotion and exploitativeness had indirect effects, entirely mediated by nationalism. There were no significant effects of the other dimensions of ethnocentrism, ethnic ingroup positivity, national ingroup positivity or prejudice against foreigners. In addition, two demographic variables (white/Anglo Americans and lower socio-economic status) had a direct effect on consumer ethnocentrism, whereas three other variables (gender, education and age) did not. Originality/value: This study is first to explore how the dimensions of ethnocentrism relate to consumer ethnocentrism. Although consumer ethnocentrism has often been linked to ethnocentrism, the relationship has never been explicitly studied. Ethnocentrism, defined as ethnic group self-centeredness and self-importance, in which the main role is to ensure ethnic group strength and survival, plays a substantial but mainly indirect role via nationalism in consumer ethnocentrism. This study shows that both direct and indirect processes concerned with ethnic groups play a substantial role in the development of consumer ethnocentrism. Implications of the findings for consumer ethnocentrism and global consumer culture are discussed. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The period of early adolescence is characterized by dramatic changes, simultaneously affecting physiological, psychological, social, and cognitive development. The physical transition from elementary to middle school can exacerbate the stress and adversity experienced during this critical life stage. Middle school students often struggle to find social and emotional support, and many students experience a decreased sense of belonging in school, diverting students from promising academic and career trajectories. Drawing on psychological insights for promoting belonging, we fielded a brief intervention designed to help students reappraise concerns about fitting in at the start of middle school as both temporary and normal. We conducted a district-wide double-blind experimental study of this approach with middle school students (n = 1,304). Compared with the control condition activities, the intervention reduced sixth-grade disciplinary incidents across the district by 34%, increased attendance by 12%, and reduced the number of failing grades by 18%. Differences in benefits across demographic groups were not statistically significant, but some impacts were descriptively larger for historically underserved minority students and boys. A mediational analysis suggested 80% of long-term intervention effects on students’ grade point averages were accounted for by changes in students’ attitudes and behaviors. These results demonstrate the long-term benefits of psychologically reappraising stressful experiences during critical transitions and the psychological and behavioral mechanisms that support them. Furthermore, this brief intervention is a highly cost-effective and scalable approach that schools may use to help address the troubling decline in positive attitudes and academic outcomes typically accompanying adolescence and the middle school transition. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine a possible negative spillover effect in sports sponsorship to answer whether the sponsored team’s poor performance will have a negative effect on audiences’ trust in its sponsor’s brand. The authors further analysed whether the audience’s attitude towards the team plays a mediating role and whether the audience’s personality type (active vs passive) plays a moderating role in this negative spillover effect. Design/methodology/approach: Three experimental studies were conducted with 380 Chinese undergraduates and MBA student participants over two years. The authors designed the experiment as a computer-mediated intervention in which good, poor and neutral performance groups were compared. After the respondents were exposed to the intervention, we asked them to answer questions using a computer terminal. We analysed the data from the three experiments through analysis of variance (ANOVA), regression analysis and a bootstrap. Findings: The audiences who were exposed to a team’s poor performance condition reported less trust in the sponsor’s brand relative to those exposed to a good performance condition, and the brand trust was even lower than for those who were exposed to a control condition (no performance information). Further, the audience’s negative attitude towards the sports team mediated the negative effect of the team’s poor performance on its sponsor’s brand trust. The negative effect was more obvious for individuals with Type A personalities (active) than for those with Type B personalities (passive). Originality/value: The prior literature has neglected a possible negative effect of a sports team’s performance on its sponsor’s brand trust. In particular, questions of whether, how and when this negative effect occurs are critical for sponsors, teams, and audiences. Since sports team sponsorship is burgeoning in China, the negative implications are unclear in this new context. Thus, the revelation that the negative spillover effects of a team’s poor performance on audiences’ trust in the sponsor’s brand provides two original contributions. First, the negative effect reveals value for multiple sponsorship stakeholders. Second, the Chinese context in this study adds value for future research and practice regarding both Chinese-foreign and domestic Chinese decisions. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - While exposure to stereotyped minority characters reinforces prejudice, when viewers identify with counter-stereotyped characters prejudice tends to decrease. This study examines the juxtaposition of identifying with either a counter-stereotyped Black protagonist or a stereotyped supporting cast. Participants read a prompt (group vs. individual salience), watched an episode of Luke Cage, then reported their identification with the Black protagonist (Cage) and the social group (the Black community of Harlem). Findings suggest that individual identification with a counter-stereotype reduces symbolic racism, while social identification with a stereotyped group does not. © 2019, © 2019 Eastern Communication Association.

AB  - The current research examined the effects of color format (text only, text with black-and-white photo, text with full-colored photo, and text with color highlighted on the main visual subject) and issue involvement (high versus low) on individuals’ psychological reactions (attitude, feeling of empathy, and intention to help) to disaster relief ad. Two studies were conducted using student and general public samples. Results from both studies indicated ads with photos, especially black-and-white photos, generated more positive attitude, greater feeling of empathy, and stronger intention to participate in charity activities. Higher issue involvement also leads to more positive attitude and stronger behavioral intention. An interaction effect between color format and issues involvement was found in Study 2. The mediating role of cognitive elaboration was also explored. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - In recent years, the outbreak of numerous environmental risk incidents aroused widespread public concern about the amplification mechanism of environmental risk in China. However, few studies have investigated the influence path of environmental risk perception on behavioral responses in Chinese context from a micro perspective. In this article, we develop a multidimensional path model from environmental risk perception to behavioral responses, which aims to investigate how the public’s environmental risk perception influence its different behavioral responses, including environmental radical behavior, environmental concern behavior and environmental protection behavior. A survey data from Chinese General Social Survey 2013 (CGSS2013), was used to test the model, including questions related to information channel (e.g., media use, interpersonal network), cognitive evaluation (e.g., environmental value, public’s evaluation of environmental governance) and environmental knowledge. The results indicate that both information channel factors and cognitive evaluation factors can significantly influence the progress that from environmental risk perception to behavioral responses, of which both media use and environmental value play the amplification role in the transform process, while interpersonal network and public’s evaluation of environmental governance would inhibit public’s risk perception transforming into environmental behavior. Besides, environmental knowledge displays a key bridge role between information channel factors and cognitive evaluation factors. This research findings also demonstrated the evolution paths of three environmental behaviors under the same level of risk perception, namely, risk transformation and diffusion, risk perception enhancement and risk attenuation respectively. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Interventions in India to improve menstrual health and hygiene management (MHHM) have been implemented at the national, state, district and school level. However, evaluations of these interventions have been scarce. The objective of the study was to determine if a social and behavioral change communication (SBCC) intervention (GARIMA) had a relationship with knowledge, attitudes, interpersonal communication, restrictions and MHHM using a comparison group post-test only design among 2206 adolescent girls. Methods: Intervention villages and adolescent girls were selected through stratified random sampling based on where GARIMA was implemented. Villages and adolescent girls in comparison villages were matched socio-demographically to intervention villages and adolescent girls. Multi-level logistic regressions assessed the relationship between the encoded exposure, mediators and MHHM. Results: The results showed that the encoded exposure predicted all behaviors corresponding to MHHM. Additionally, adolescent girls in the high encoded exposure group had significantly higher knowledge about puberty and reproductive parts (AOR: 2.03 (95% CI: 1.31 - 3.15)), positive attitudes towards gender (AOR: 1.48 (95% CI: 1.02 - 2.16)) and higher levels of some discussion and dialogue (AOR: 1.41 (95% CI: 1.04 - 1.92)). Conclusions: Future programs should use SBCC to improve MHHM behavior but involve families, peers and community members to a greater extent in order to improve attitudes towards menstruation, attitudes towards restrictions, attitudes towards absorbent use and reduce restrictions within the community. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Existing empirical research on the link between ethnic minority concentration in residential environments and voting for the radical right is inconclusive, mainly due to major differences between studies in the spatial scale at which minority concentration is measured. We examined whether the presence of non-western ethnic minorities in the residential environment, measured at four spatial scales, is related to individuals' intention to vote for the Dutch Party for Freedom (Dutch acronym PVV). We combined individual level survey data and register data, and we used multi-level structural equation models to examine possible mediation by anti-immigrant attitudes and political dissatisfaction. The models show different effects at different scales. At the micro scale (100 by 100 meter grids) we find a curvilinear effect: individuals with 30-50 per cent non-western minorities in their direct living environment are most likely to report to vote for the PVV. At higher spatial scales (up to municipal level) we find that the higher the proportion of non-western minorities, the more likely individuals are to report to vote for the PVV. These effects can however not be explained by anti-immigrant attitudes or political dissatisfaction. We even find that at the micro scale the presence of non-western minorities is related to less anti-immigrant attitudes. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of hepatitis B and C patients towards the disease. METHODS: The cross-sectional, descriptive, questionnaire-based study was conducted at the Rawalpindi Medical University (RMU) and its allied hospitals, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from October to December 2017, and comprised hepatitis B and C patients aged ≥18 years who were visiting the outpatient department. A structured, close-ended, 30-item questionnaire was used to collect data which was then analysed using SPSS 23. . RESULTS: Of the 399 patients, 230(57.6%) were women, 103(26%) did not have any formal education, and TV, radio and the internet was the main source of information regarding hepatitis for 138(34.6%) patients. The overall mean age was 42.82}11.78 years. The sample showed poor knowledge with a mean score of 7.33}2.03, adequate attitude with a mean of 4.33}1.19, and poor practice with a mean of 2.97}1.05. Correlation was statistically significant between knowledge and practice (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Lack of imperative knowledge of hepatitis in patients was the main reason for negative attitude and poor practices.

AB  - Background: Adverse events are underreported in research studies, particularly randomized controlled trials and pharmacovigilance studies. A method that researchers could use to identify more complete safety profiles for medications is to use social media analytics. However, patient's perspectives on the ethical issues associated with using patient reports of adverse drug events on social media are unclear. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the ethics of using social media for detecting and monitoring adverse events for research purposes using a multi methods approach. Methods: A multi methods design comprising qualitative semistructured interviews (n=24), a focus group (n=3), and 3 Web-based discussions (n=20) with members of the public was adopted. Findings from a recent systematic review on the use of social media for monitoring adverse events provided a theoretical framework to interpret the study's findings. Results: Views were ascertained regarding the potential benefits and harms of the research, privacy expectations, informed consent, and social media platform. Although the majority of participants were supportive of social media content being used for research on adverse events, a small number of participants strongly opposed the idea. The potential benefit of the research was cited as the most influential factor to whether participants would give their consent to their data being used for research. There were also some caveats to people's support for the use of their social media data for research purposes: The type of social media platform and consideration of the vulnerability of the social media user. Informed consent was regarded as difficult to obtain and this divided the opinion on whether it should be sought. Conclusions: Social media users were generally positive about their social media data being used for research purposes; particularly for research on adverse events. However, approval was dependent on the potential benefit of the research and that individuals are protected from harm. Further study is required to establish when consent is required for an individual's social media data to be used. © 2019 Su Golder, Arabella Scantlebury, Helen Christmas.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in healthcare. Here, AI-based chatbot systems can act as automated conversational agents, capable of promoting health, providing education, and potentially prompting behaviour change. Exploring the motivation to use health chatbots is required to predict uptake; however, few studies to date have explored their acceptability. This research aimed to explore participants’ willingness to engage with AI-led health chatbots. Methods: The study incorporated semi-structured interviews (N-29) which informed the development of an online survey (N-216) advertised via social media. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. A survey of 24 items explored demographic and attitudinal variables, including acceptability and perceived utility. The quantitative data were analysed using binary regressions with a single categorical predictor. Results: Three broad themes: ‘Understanding of chatbots’, ‘AI hesitancy’ and ‘Motivations for health chatbots’ were identified, outlining concerns about accuracy, cyber-security, and the inability of AI-led services to empathise. The survey showed moderate acceptability (67%), correlated negatively with perceived poorer IT skills OR = 0.32 [CI95%:0.13–0.78] and dislike for talking to computers OR = 0.77 [CI95%:0.60–0.99] as well as positively correlated with perceived utility OR = 5.10 [CI95%:3.08–8.43], positive attitude OR = 2.71 [CI95%:1.77–4.16] and perceived trustworthiness OR = 1.92 [CI95%:1.13–3.25]. Conclusion: Most internet users would be receptive to using health chatbots, although hesitancy regarding this technology is likely to compromise engagement. Intervention designers focusing on AI-led health chatbots need to employ user-centred and theory-based approaches addressing patients’ concerns and optimising user experience in order to achieve the best uptake and utilisation. Patients’ perspectives, motivation and capabilities need to be taken into account when developing and assessing the effectiveness of health chatbots. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Paying attention to the rising popularity of virtual assistants (VAs) that offer unique user experiences through voice-centered interaction, this study examined the effects of modality, device, and task differences on perceived human likeness of, and attitudes toward, voice-activated VAs. To do so, a 2 (modality: voice vs. text) × 2 (device: mobile vs. laptop) × 2 (task type: hedonic vs. utilitarian) mixed factorial experimental design was employed. Findings suggest that voice (vs. text) interaction leads to more positive attitudes toward the VA system mediated by heightened perceived human likeness of the VA, but only with utilitarian (vs. hedonic) tasks. Interestingly, laptop (vs. mobile phone) interaction also enhanced perceived human likeness of the VA. This study offers theoretical and practical implications for VA research by exploring the combinational effects of modality, device, and task differences on user perceptions through human-like interactions. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.

AB  - Educational multimedia resources are included in the learning process as a "support" means. In this case, information resources serve as a means of intensifying the training process, individualization of learning and partial automation of routine work of the teacher related to the integration, monitoring and evaluation of students' knowledge.Relevance The article discusses the fundamental changes occurring in all spheres of society in connection with the introduction of information and communication technologies (ICT), not only open up broad opportunities for the development and information support of the individual, but also pose new challenges for the education system [1]. In the most general form, these tasks are aimed at the formation of the individual’s readiness for life and professional activity in the information society. Thus, the modern social order requires the improvement of professional training of specialists owning information and communication technologies, including multimedia technologies.Methods The use of multimedia tools to control knowledge. Such tools can be used both for intermediate knowledge testing (within the study of one topic of the course of database fundamentals), and for the final knowledge test (after studying a section or course). As a rule, students have a positive attitude towards tests submitted using a computer, and in determining the results there are no problems with biased (formal) grading. Such tests depending on the level of complexity, the number of questions and other parameters can be used at any stage of the study of the discipline.Results Students may encounter some difficulties caused by lack of experience with the test form of control. Testing requires students not only knowledge of a certain educational material, but also the ability to work with it, i.e. understand the specifics of the test tasks. To do this, apply in the classroom interactive tests. The Internet is also used to solve tests in on-line mode.Organized in the classroom and after school hours, working with interactive tests forms the students' core information competencies, and for many they are the ones that are most relevant today and will be needed in the future.Discussion The authors of the article describe the introduction of multimedia resources, their presentation as a complex process leading to changes in the content of education, revision of the methods and forms of organization of the educational process, the construction of holistic courses based on the use of meaningful content of information sources in individual disciplines. Conclusion It is important to note that in most universities of the Republic of Kazakhstan teachers and students are not developers of multimedia resources used in education. Most often, teachers and trainees act as users of such tools. However, practice shows that every year an increasing number of teachers can not stay away from the development of simple, but electronic means of teaching. In this regard, it is advisable for a modern teacher to have an idea of how to develop high-quality multimedia resources, and about hardware and software — tools for creating computer-based learning tools. © BEIESP.

AB  - Introduction End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is increasing globally, and renal transplantation (RT) is the preferred renal replacement therapy to treat ESRD. Internationally, there are only a few countries with RT rates above 50 per million population (pmp), while most of the countries have RT rates between 30-40 pmp. The low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) makes up the majority for the RT rates below 20 pmp in which Malaysia belongs to despite its increasing ESRD rates. There is a need to explore the barriers to access RT with targeted solutions to improve the RT rates and service in LMIC. Thus, a qualitative study was undertaken in Malaysia to address this issue. Method A qualitative methodological approach was performed between March-May 2018. Semistructured interviews were used to explore current RT policy and service availability. Keyinformants were identified from a detailed stakeholder analysis of RT system in Malaysia. Interviews were digitally audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded with ATLAS.ti software and underwent thematic analysis thoroughly. Results Eight key-informants participated in the study. Barriers and related solutions were classified using the socio-ecological model (SEM). As reported, the barriers and solutions of RT in Malaysia are the results of a complex interplay of personal, cultural, and environmental factors. Key barriers are linked to public's attitude and perception towards RT and the unaccommodating practices in the healthcare fraternity for RT. Key-informants provided a systematic solution that shed light on how RT could be improved at each SEM level via effective communication, education and inter-agency collaboration. Conclusion The SEM provided a framework to foster a better understanding of current practice, barriers, and solutions to RT in Malaysia. This study is the first to explore the barriers and related solutions to RT comprehensively as a whole. Implications of these findings could prompt a policy change for a better RT service delivery model not just for Malaysia but also for other LMIC. Further stakeholder engagement and evaluation of the systems are required to provide insight into best practices that will help to improve the RT rates and service in Malaysia. © 2019 Gan Kim Soon et al.

AB  - The development of robot technology provides many possibilities for the life support of the elderly. This study explored the acceptability of robots to assist the elderly from the perspective of future designers. A quantitative questionnaire (58 copies) and a qualitative one-to-one interview (10 people) were conducted to explore the attitude of future designers towards the use of robots to assist the elderly. One-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test statistic was used to analyze the data of the questionnaire. The results show that the mean and median of 11 of the 12 dimensions of the acceptability questionnaire are greater than 3 (3 represents uncertain and neutral attitude), and 10 have statistical significance (p < 0.05). Also, the interview results show the positive attitude of future designers. The research shows that future designers hold a positive and open attitude towards the use of robots to assist the elderly. The research findings can help people understand the attitude of future designers and provide some reference for subsequent robot design and development. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Sustainability has become one of the key factors for the development of tourism both nowadays and in the future. The need to integrate environmental, socio-cultural and economic factors is a consequence of the evolution of society itself, the introduction of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) and a new way of understanding tourism and the world in general. Tourists increasingly seek a unique quality in their travels and are better informed before deciding on a tourist destination to spend their holidays or leisure time. They want to have unique, memorable experiences, and because of that, they are willing to look for those destinations that can offer them something different. The generation of expectations is no longer the sole responsibility of companies and public and private organizations in destinations, since information may be in the hands of the individuals themselves who can share it in social networks, blogs, or on platforms such as Booking or TripAdvisor, among others. This forces companies and public and private organizations to rethink the way in which and when they relate to tourists in general. With all these considerations, one of the objectives of this study was to analyse the way in which sustainability interrelates with the generation of expectations, experiences and perceptions and the effect on the possibilities of returning to a tourist destination and even recommending it in social networks to friends and acquaintances. For this reason, the destination of Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico, was chosen, a mature destination of sun and beach that, in recent years, has been immersed in a process of change where one of the axes is sustainability. This study used a convenience survey with 310 valid questionnaires with tourists who stayed more than three days in Acapulco during the months of December 2016 to February 2017. The questionnaires were completed at different points of the destination and by participants over 18 years of age. We used SEM (Structural Equations Modeling) and EQS (Structural Equation Modeling Software) for statistical analysis. The results of the study showed how expectations influenced experiences and the intention to return to the destination and recommend it (WOM), thus, we proposed a series of recommendations for public and private agents that manage this tourist destination. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - People with strong (vs. moderate) political attitudes have been shown to exhibit less phasic reactivity to perceptual anomalies, presumably to prevent their committed meaning systems from being challenged by novel experiences. Several researchers have proposed that (but not tested whether) firmly committed individuals also engage in more attentional suppression of anomalies, likely mediated by prestimulus alpha power. We expected participants with strong (vs. moderate) political attitudes to display increased pre-stimulus alpha power when processing perceptual anomalies. We recorded electrophysiological activity during the presentation of normal cards (control group) or both normal and anomalous playing cards (experimental group; total N = 191). In line with our predictions, the presence of anomalous playing cards in the stimulus set increased prestimulus alpha power only among individuals with strong but not moderate political attitudes. As potential markers of phasic reactivity, we also analyzed the late positive potential (LPP) and earlier components of the event-related potential, namely P1, N1, and P300. The moderating effect of extreme attitudes on ERP amplitudes remained inconclusive. Altogether, our findings support the idea that ideological conviction is related to increased tonic responses to perceptual anomalies. © 2019 Reiss et al.

AB  - Public participation plays an important role of traffic planning and management, but it is a great challenge to collect and analyze public opinions for traffic problems on a large scale under traditional methods. Traffic management departments should appropriately adopt public opinions in order to formulate scientific and reasonable regulations and policies. At present, while increasing degree of public participation, data collection and processing should be accelerated to make up for the shortcomings of traditional planning. This paper focuses on text analysis using large data with temporal and spatial attributes of social network platform. Web crawler technology is used to obtain traffic-related text in mainstream social platforms. After basic treatment, the emotional tendency of the text is analyzed. Then, based on the probabilistic topic modeling (latent Dirichlet allocation model), the main opinions of the public are extracted, and the spatial and temporal characteristics of the data are summarized. Taking Nanjing Metro as an example, the existing problems are summarized from the public opinions and improvement measures are put forward, which proves the feasibility of providing technical support for public participation in public transport with social media big data. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The conventional approach to sustainability is being extended through approaches such as the psychology of sustainability and sustainable development. Under such approaches, the analysis of sustainability also involves understanding improvements in people's quality of life in environments such as education and learning. Based on this theoretical approach, this study explored the relationships between anxiety, emotional intelligence, and mechanisms for coping with stressful situations. The mediating role of emotional intelligence in the relationship between anxiety and coping mechanisms was also assessed. The anxiety, emotional intelligence, and coping variables were measured using standardized tests administered to students. This cross-sectional study was based on self-reports by health students at universities in Valencia (Spain). The study conformed to the ethical standards established by the Declaration of Helsinki. In total, 434 students participated in the study. The students were aged between 17 and 54 years (M = 21; SD = 0.320). From the perspective of the psychology of sustainability, the results indicate that avoidance coping strategies are positively related to anxiety and are negatively related to emotional intelligence. However, the results also show that approach coping strategies are positively related to emotional intelligence. In addition, the analysis shows the mediating role of emotional intelligence in the relationship between anxiety and coping. This study shows the need to encourage the sustainable development of emotional intelligence among health professionals and to consider this sustainable development when designing education programs for health-related fields. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Natural Protected Areas face the challenge of conciliating attractions with satisfaction of their different stakeholders without compromising their own resources. Marketing can play an important role to this challenge from a macromarketing perspective. No studies are found in the literature on the integral assessment of marketing practices in Natural Protected Areas. For the first time, it proposes a marketing audit in Natural Protected Areas to fill that gap applying the Importance-Performance Analysis matrix, useful in strategic decisions, through interviews with directors of Natural Protected Areas. The main strengths, weaknesses, and deficits in the application of marketing are identified. The presence of a restricted and biased attitude towards marketing was noted among directors. In addition, the marketing behaviour is studied in two of the main social networks (Twitter/Facebook), comparisons were established in the USA, Spain, Italy and Mexico, identifying behavioural profiles in five groups in accordance with the 26 indicators under analysis. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Aim: To describe a protocol that examines the feasibility and effectiveness of a face-to-face guided self-disclosure intervention for facilitating benefit finding and other related psychological outcomes for breast cancer patients. Background: Benefit finding can promote a positive attitude among patients facing disease. However, limited studies have focused on improving benefit finding among breast cancer patients. Previous research has been based on group interventions, which may not suit all patients. Self-disclosure was recognized as a strong predictor of benefit finding. This protocol is based on a brief face-to-face disclosure intervention to improve benefit finding for breast cancer patients. Design: A non-blinded randomized controlled trial. Methods: A total of 154 patients with breast cancer who have undergone radical mastectomy will be randomly assigned to either the experimental group, which will participate in a six-session face-to-face individual intervention, or the control group at a ratio of 1:1. Baseline assessments will take place after the breast cancer diagnosis, with follow-up assessments at 3, 6 and 9 months after baseline. The primary outcome is benefit finding; other outcomes are self-disclosure, cognitive reappraisal, social support, optimism and medical coping modes. Discussion: This study is to design a protocol for guided self-disclosure interventions to promote benefit finding in Chinese breast cancer patients. If this intervention is feasible and effective, it could be implemented in clinical practice. Impact: This study will provide useful advice for health professionals to guide breast cancer patients in benefit finding during stressful events. If it is effective, it will be implemented broadly in clinical practice. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - In France, laïcité is a legal principle enforcing State secularism. However, research indicates that Modern (vs. traditional) beliefs about laïcité (ML) help legitimate prejudice against minorities. From Social Identity Theory, we hypothesized that ML should be positively linked with national identification, stereotyping, prejudice and support for discrimination. Accordingly, we demonstrate that ML independently predicts support for discriminatory policies (Study 1a, N = 241) and Maghrebi IAT scores (Study 1b, N = 242). ML mediates the link between national identification and Generalized Prejudice (Study 2a, N = 215; Study 2d, N = 114) as well as Support for Discriminatory Policies (Study 2b, N = 250). Experimental corroboration of this mediation was provided (Study 2c, N = 100). An exploratory study showed that priming ML led to more support for discrimination through national identification (Study 3, N = 89). These results reveal the important intergroup regulation feature of ML beliefs in France. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs) may be associated with a personal relationship with nature. We conducted a quasi-experiment with 423 residents who had or had not actively participated in a tree-planting scheme and lived in 20 neighborhoods that differ in their greenness level. We tested whether exposure to nature (specified by the amount of vegetation cover in residents’ neighborhoods) and/or past PEB (specified by tree-planting participation) was associated with residents’ PEB and whether key psychological constructs would mediate these relationships. Structural equation mediation models revealed that the level of neighborhood vegetation and involvement in the planting scheme explained 46% of the variance in PEB, with connection to nature, the use of nature for psychological restoration, and environmental attitudes mediating the relationships. Connection to nature was more strongly associated with engagement in PEB than the use of nature for psychological restoration and environmental attitudes. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Driven by the proliferation of digital media, citizen science – the involvement of non-scientists in scientific research – represents one of the most important recent developments in science communication as it brings science and the public closer together. So far, however, citizen science projects have mostly attracted people that are highly educated, mostly male and already have very positive attitudes towards science. Based on nationally representative survey data (N = 1051), our study explores the potential of citizen science in Switzerland. Using regression analysis, we show that attitudes towards science are significant antecedents of respondents’ interest in participating in citizen science – but that gender and education are not. In addition, latent class analysis identifies five segments, representing over one-third of the Swiss population, who are interested in citizen science and could potentially be engaged: ‘Free-Timers’, ‘Senior Sciencephiles’, ‘Young Sciencephiles’, ‘Intrigued Adolescents’ and ‘Fully Employed Parents’. Additional description suggests that previously overlooked segments are best addressed online via YouTube or offline in zoos or botanical gardens. Overall, our analysis suggests that citizen science’s potential is far higher than previous projects were able to realize. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Background: The use of arterial closure devices in achieving femoral hemostasis has been well documented in adults but insufficiently studied in the pediatric population. An earlier study from our institution of 40 Angio-Seal devices in 38 patients concluded that the arterial closure device is safe in children with only a single minor complication. Ongoing experience with this device at our institution, however, suggests a higher rate of complication. Objective: To retrospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Angio-Seal in a pediatric population. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis reviewed all cases in which the Angio-Seal was deployed from June 2011 to September 2017. Peri-procedural documentation was reviewed for pre-procedure labs, clinical effectiveness in achieving hemostasis and complications related to the use of this device. Logistic regression analysis was also used to evaluate the relationship between patient demographic, vessel size and indication for angiography, and the presence or absence of complications. Results: During the study period, 48 additional Angio-Seal devices were deployed in 41 consecutive patients. Five patients were excluded for being older than 18 years. The mean age of the patients was 13.3 years (range: 4–18 years) with 18 patients female. The mean common femoral artery diameter was 5.98 mm in short axis diameter (range: 4–9 mm). Complications were present in 6/43 cases (14%) including 3 minor and 3 major complications that included additional procedures. No significant relationship was identified between vessel size, age and the indication for angiography, and the rate of complication on logistic regression analysis. Conclusion: While percutaneous arterial closure devices can be efficacious for achieving hemostasis, our experience demonstrates a higher rate of complications in children, contrary to a previous report. The deployment of such devices should be performed with prejudice in this population. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objective: This article explores whether there are different consequences from Internet use—in the form of changed political attitudes—for older Chinese as compared to their younger counterparts. Methods: Using data from a nationwide representative survey of Chinese adults, analyses include both cross-tabulation and multiple regression. Results: It is found that millennials are more open to political change than are older Chinese, that older Internet users—as compared to older nonusers—have attitudes more similar to those of millennials, and that differences in attitudes are greater between older users and nonusers than between millennial users and nonusers. Conclusion: The findings support the conclusion that Internet use has had greater consequences for changed political attitudes for older Chinese than for their younger counterparts. © 2019 by the Southwestern Social Science Association

AB  - Aims and method Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder that is stereotypically stigmatised as untreatable and associated with violence. Several authorities have suggested that changing the name, for example to psychosis, would reduce such stigmatisation. We aimed to compare attitudes to schizophrenia and psychosis on Twitter to see if psychosis was associated with less negative attitudes. Tweets containing the terms 'schizophrenia', 'schizophrenic', 'psychosis' or 'psychotic' were collected on www.twitter.com and were captured with NCapture. On NVivo, tweets were coded into categories based on user type, tweet content, attitude and stigma type by two independent raters. We compared the content and attitudes of tweets referring to schizophrenia/schizophrenic and psychosis/psychotic.Results A total of 1120 tweets referring to schizophrenia/schizophrenic and 1080 referring to psychosis/psychotic were identified over two 7-day periods; 424 original tweets for schizophrenia and 416 original tweets for psychosis were included in the analysis. Psychosis was significantly more commonly included in tweets expressing negative attitudes (n=131, 31.5%) than schizophrenia (n=41, 9.7%) (χ2 = 237.03, P &lt; 0.0001). Of the personal opinions or dyadic interactions, 125 (53.4%) in the psychosis data set were stigmatising, compared with 33 (24.6%) of those in the schizophrenia set (χ2 = 44.65, P &lt; 0.0001).Clinical implications The terms psychosis/psychotic are associated with a significantly higher number of tweets with negative content than schizophrenia/schizophrenic. Together with other evidence, this suggests that changing the name of schizophrenia to psychosis will not reduce negative attitudes toward the condition.Declaration of interest S.L. has received personal fees from Otsuka and Sunovion, and personal and research fees from Janssen. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Modeling the opinion dynamics of transit system riders is key to understanding their needs, motivations and sensitivities for service changes. This can make planning and operations processes to match user profile, hence promoting more transit usage with positive results on sustainable development. This research work investigated the triangulation of social (how users are related to each other)and semantic (what issues/topics are on user minds)network analysis as well as sentiment analysis (how do they feel about these topics)of social media interactions for supporting better underrating of transit user opinions and levels of satisfaction. We used data from the Twitter account of TransLink (Vancouver transit agency); tracked them over 11 month period; compared them to similar data from two other Canadian cities; and, in so doing, contrasted the results in days with disruptions and days with normal operations. Our research work developed a methodology that can be guide agencies in this regards. First, the social network should be qualified as a viable community (small world), not just a random graph (with sparsely connected nodes). It should be clustered into sub-communities based on their connectivity and the issues they discuss. Second, we used a lexicon for customer satisfaction to detect topics in tweets. Linking topics to sentiments (user view of them)can be used as indicator for their opinion. Studying the variations of topics and sentiment across sub-communities, we can observe the origination of ideas. By tracking the evolution of the social network, we could study the potential impacts of social interaction (possibly learning)on opinion dynamics. In the specific case of Vancouver data, sentiment was negative, indicating a lower levels of satisfaction across all topics. However, this negativity should be taken in context—many social media interactions (especially Twitter)have negative sentiment. Interestingly, analysis of sentiment levels in days with disruption, particularly those related to public safety incidents, showed lower levels of negative attitude. This contrast could be an indirect measure of trust: while customers may not be satisfied with services, they trust that the agency is doing its best to protect them. Analysis of customer social networks showed that the sub-network of the most influential players closely matched of the full network in terms of topics and sentiment. Analysis of sub-communities shows that the network is not a venue for disseminating information by the agency. Many sub-groups, especially the ones we call medium-size groups (defined in our work as having between a 1000 and 10,000 nodes), portray a more of inter-customer interactions. It seems this is where discussions and topics evolve. The results of our analysis is specific to Vancouver and to the data and period investigated. They should not be generalized given the evolutionary nature of social media contents and the dynamics of opinion. Our methodology, however, can be used as benchmark or a starting point to conducting similar analysis in other agencies. The interpretation, as always, will remain context-sensitive (influenced by local conditions). Transit agencies should conduct such analysis frequently; experiment with adjusting its steps and the proposed algorithms to their local conditions; and establish a mechanism for the frequency of such analysis. More importantly, they should always triangulate the results of such analysis against findings from other sources of data such as community meetings and customer surveys. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Based on two theoretical approaches—contact theory and threat perception theory—in combination with meaningful encounter and media perspective and using the example of two neighbourhoods in Zagreb, this paper aims to explore several issues related to asylum seekers: (1) the definition and perceptions of asylum seekers expressed by locals; (2) attitudes towards asylum seekers in relation to vicinity to an asylum seeker centre and contact with asylum seekers on the neighbourhood level; and (3) the relationship between attitudes and socio-demographic characteristics of respondents. The survey was conducted in the period of November 2015 to January 2016, using a systematic random sample (N = 299) in two selected neighbourhoods of the City of Zagreb: Dugave and Trnje. Each neighbourhood represents a specific surrounding in relation to the proximity of asylum seekers. In terms of location and contact with the asylum seekers, significant differences were found in all obtained latent dimensions of attitudes towards asylum seekers and attitudes based on locational attributes regarding asylum seeker reception: Dugave residents (located closer to the reception and accommodation centre) expressed, in general, more negative attitudes towards asylum seekers and their reception in Croatia than their counterparts in Trnje. The specific timeframe (the 2015–2016 sequence usually referred to as “European Migration Crisis”) and the spatial context chosen for conducting the survey allows for spatialised and comparative findings. The discussion further develops the perceptive role played by media in a context of highly-mediatised migration, and the nature of contact in shaping more positive or negative attitudes towards refugees and migrants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Exposure to threat increases the risk for internalizing problems in adolescence. Deficits in integrating bodily cues into representations of emotion are thought to contribute to internalizing problems. Given the role of the medial prefrontal cortex in regulating bodily responses and integrating them into representations of emotional states, coordination between activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and autonomic nervous system responses may be influenced by past threat exposure with consequences for the emergence of internalizing problems. A sample of 179 Mexican-origin adolescents (88 female) reported on neighborhood and school crime, peer victimization, and discrimination when they were 10-16 years old. At age 17, participants underwent a functional neuroimaging scan during which they viewed pictures of emotional faces while respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and skin conductance responses were measured. Adolescents also reported symptoms of internalizing problems. Greater exposure to threats across adolescence was associated with more internalizing problems. Threat exposure was also associated with stronger negative coupling between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and RSA. Stronger negative ventromedial prefrontal cortex-RSA coupling was associated with fewer internalizing problems. These results suggest the degree of coordinated activity between the brain and parasympathetic nervous system is both enhanced by threat experiences and decreased in adolescents with more internalizing problems.

AB  - Until 2017, Germany was an exception to the success of radical right parties in postwar Europe. We provide new evidence for the transformation of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) to a radical right party drawing upon social media data. Further, we demonstrate that the AfD's electorate now matches the radical right template of other countries and that its trajectory mirrors the ideological shift of the party. Using data from the 2013 to 2017 series of German Longitudinal Elections Study (GLES) tracking polls, we employ multilevel modelling to test our argument on support for the AfD. We find the AfD's support now resembles the image of European radical right voters. Specifically, general right-wing views and negative attitudes towards immigration have become the main motivation to vote for the AfD. This, together with the increased salience of immigration and the AfD's new ideological profile, explains the party's rise. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Drawing from activation theory and the goal literature, this research explores how competing product-related goals influence attitudes and intentions and how advertised product claims (fortification and health claims) nudge competing consumer goals. Additionally, this research investigates how promotional cue alignment with a product-related goal can positively influence attitudes and intentions. Four studies reveal that when a promotional cue does not align with a focal product cue, there is no impact on attitudes and intentions. When an additional cue, such as a health message, is added to the promotional claim that is aligned with the product-related cue, then multiple aligned cues can nudge a non-focal goal to better align with dominant product-related cues, leading to more positive attitudes and intentions, and this effect is mediated by changes in product health goals. This research has implications for goal literature and for advertisers, manufacturers and policy makers. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Stroke is currently the second leading cause of death in industrialized countries and the second cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Diabetes is an independent risk factor for stroke that exacerbates the severity of lesions, disability and cognitive decline. There is increasing evidence that sustained brain inflammation may account for this long-term prejudicial outcome in diabetic patients in particular. We sought to demonstrate that experimental permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo) in the diabetic mouse aggravates stroke, induces cognitive decline, and is associated with exacerbated brain inflammation, and that these effects can be alleviated and/or prevented by the immunomodulator, glatiramer acetate (GA). Male diabetic C57Bl6 mice (streptozotocin IP) subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo), were treated by the immunomodulator, GA (Copaxone®) (1 mg/kg daily, sc) until 3 or 7 days post stroke. Infarct volume, brain pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, microglial/macrophage density, and neurogenesis were monitored during the first week post stroke. Neurological sensorimotor deficit, spatial memory and brain deposits of Aβ40 and Aβ42 were assessed until six weeks post stroke. In diabetic mice with pMCAo, proinflammatory mediators (IL-1β, MCP1, TNFα and CD68) were significantly higher than in non-diabetic mice. In GA-treated mice, the infarct volume was reduced by 30% at D3 and by 40% at D7 post stroke (P < 0.05), sensorimotor recovery was accelerated as early as D3, and long-term memory loss was prevented. Moreover, proinflammatory mediators significantly decreased between D3 (COX2) and D7 (CD32, TNFα, IL-1β), and neurogenesis was significantly increased at D7. Moreover, GA abrogates the accumulation of insoluble Aβ40. This work is the first one to evidence that the immunomodulatory drug GA reduces infarct volume and proinflammatory mediators, enhances early neurogenesis, accelerates sensorimotor recovery, and prevents long-term memory loss in diabetic mice with pMCAo. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Objective: Engaging community urologists in referring patients to clinical trials could increase the reach of cancer trials and, ultimately, alleviate cancer disparities. We sought to identify determinants of referring patients to clinical trials among urology practices serving rural communities. Methods: We conducted semistructured qualitative interviews based on the Theoretical Domains Framework at nonmetropolitan urology practices located in communities offering urological cancer trials. Participants were asked to consider barriers and strategies that might support engaging their patients in discussions about urological cancer clinical trials and referring them appropriately. Recorded interviews were transcribed and coded using template analysis. Results: Most participants were not aware of available trials and had no experience with trial referral. Overall, participants held positive attitudes toward clinical trials and recognized their potential roles in accrual, but limited local resources reduced opportunities for offering trials. Most participants expressed a need for increased human, financial, and other resources to support this role. Many participants requested information and training to increase their knowledge of clinical trials and confidence in offering them to patients. Participants highlighted the need to build efficient pathways to identify available trials, match eligible patients, and facilitate communication and collaboration with cancer centers for patient follow-up and continuity of care. Conclusions: With adequate logistical and informational support, community urology practices could play an important role in clinical trial accrual, advancing cancer research and increasing treatment options for rural cancer patients. Future studies should explore the effectiveness of strategies to optimize urology practices’ role in clinical trial accrual. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Differences in mortality between groups with different socioeconomic positions (SEP) are well-established, but the relative contribution of different SEP measures is unclear. This study compares the correlation between three SEP dimensions and mortality, and investigates differences between gender and age groups (35–59 vs. 60–84). We use an 11% random sample with an 80% oversample of deaths from the Finnish population with information on education, occupational class, individual income, and mortality (n = 496,658; 274,316 deaths between 1995 and 2007). We estimate bivariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models and population attributable fractions. The total effects of education are substantially mediated by occupation and income, and the effects of occupation is mediated by income. All dimensions have their own net effect on mortality, but income shows the steepest mortality gradient (HR 1.78, lowest vs. highest quintile). Income is more important for men and occupational class more important among elderly women. Mortality inequalities are generally smaller in older ages, but the relative importance of income increases. In health inequality studies, the use of only one SEP indicator functions well as a broad marker of SEP. However, only analyses of multiple dimensions allow insights into social mechanisms and how they differ between population subgroups. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - The present study addresses the popularity of ‘social media influencer’ (SMIs) by examining the effect of users’ perceived social distance from SMIs on their broadcasting intention on social live streaming platforms. Drawing on motivational factors related to social distance and applying Cognitive Transactional Theory as a theoretical lens, our empirical analysis is based on 657 broadcasters on the market-leading social live streaming platforms in China. This study reached the following findings: Users’ social distance from SMIs is positively related to their broadcast intention. Challenge stressors and hindrance stressors have different mediating effects between social distance and broadcast intention. Challenge stressors positively mediate the relationship between social distance and broadcast intention, and hindrance stressors negatively mediate the relationship between these two variables. Users’ material values moderate the relationship between hindrance stressors and broadcast intention. These conclusions extend the understanding of the theoretical motivation behind the booming phenomenon of ‘SMIs’ and can help platform managers to motivate users’ continued participation on these platforms. © 2019

AB  - International crises often influence consumers to reject offerings associated with a hostile country. While research has shown that negative emotions mediate the influence of animosity beliefs on consumer behavior, scholars do not examine the specific influence of different discrete emotions. This study extends prior research by demonstrating that extreme negative emotions of contempt and disgust play a key role in explaining the effects of animosity beliefs on behavior. The strength of these emotions results in a degraded image of the target country that is associated with social exclusion and intergroup hatred. In such circumstances, animosity also reduces product quality perceptions and is extremely difficult to manage. The best strategy is to eliminate any connection between the country of origin and the relevant offering. The findings of this study suggest that rather than assessing negative emotions in general, managers should consider the specific emotional reactions elicited by the country under examination. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective: The current study examined the relationship between minority stress, social support, and the mental health of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) Australians during the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey. Method: A sample of 1,305 Australian LGB adults completed an online survey that measured their frequency of exposure to negative and positive media messages about same-sex marriage, perceived personal support, and psychological distress during the postal survey. Results: More frequent exposure to negative media messages about same-sex marriage was associated with greater psychological distress. This association, however, was significantly weaker amongst participants who perceived greater personal support for same-sex marriage from their immediate social network. Alternatively, exposure to positive messages of public support via public and social media was not associated with psychological distress, and did not moderate the association between negative media message exposure and psychological distress. Nonetheless, more frequent exposure to public support was more strongly associated with reduced psychological distress amongst participants who perceived their immediate social network to be less supportive of same-sex marriage. Conclusions: The findings highlight how legislative processes related to the rights of stigmatised, minority populations have the potential to adversely affect their mental health. The findings also highlight the role of personal and public support as protective factors against minority stress. Within the limits of a cross-sectional study design, these findings have implications for public policy and legislative decision-making, treating clinicians of LGB clients, and LGB rights and mental health organisations. © 2019 The Australian Psychological Society

AB  - India's official embrace of the soft power concept and the popular equation of Bollywood films with India's international image are discussed here with reference to their contemporary convergence. This article seeks to make the case that the underlying claims of the soft power doctrine necessitate an empirical test at the level of grassroots reception. Further, this article also seeks to shift the emphasis from ‘impressing the West’ towards interrogating the dynamics of India's cultural diplomacy in other Asian states. With these aims in mind, this article presents two qualitative case studies from Chiang Mai, Thailand and Metro Manila in the Philippines. The responses collected indicate the inherent complexities of Inter-Asian dialogues on culture and modernity as well as the importance of the local media environment in determining perceptions of contemporary India. Ultimately, the capacity of popular culture to create a positive impression and to counter existing prejudices and misconceptions is supported in a series of reception studies. At the same time, the ‘moral superiority’ and historical legacies that are assumed to underpin India's cultural prestige in the region are challenged by the content and tone of these responses from the general public. In the contemporary setting of Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), it becomes clear that the mediation of Indian culture operates within an increasingly transnational media environment and a competitive modernity that informs comparative perspectives between Asian cultures. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This paper examines the process that leads to resilience to negative information and purchase intentions in a digital environment. A conceptual framework is proposed and tested using a sample of retail banking customers and an application of the structural equation models. The results suggest that consumer behavior in digital settings is more influenced by brand personality than by online brand experience. If a brand can develop and sustain an attractive brand personality, then consumers tend to have a positive attitude toward the brand and discuss the brand positively on social media networks. This behavior will lead to higher resilience to negative information and increased purchase intentions. Although online brand experience does not influence the level of electronic word-of-mouth, it directly affects brand attitude and indirectly influences both resilience to negative information and purchase intentions. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study examined positive religious coping (e.g., prayer) and negative religious coping (e.g., blaming the Devil) as mediators between perceived prejudice (everyday discrimination, stigma consciousness, perceived invisibility) and psychological distress (depression, anxiety, hostility). Structural equation modeling revealed that negative religious coping fully mediated the relationship between prejudice and psychological distress. Content analysis of participants' descriptions of their experiences with prejudice also showed that negative religious coping significantly mediated the relationship between prejudice and the frequency with which negative emotions were expressed. Positive religious coping did not mediate either analysis. Implications for culturally sensitive counseling interventions are discussed. © 2018 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Donald Trump’s bombastic statements regarding women and minorities were a constant theme in the 2016 presidential election and attracted attention from both the mainstream media and his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Given the increasing use of social networking sites among political actors and the public, as well as the focus given to women and minorities in the 2016 election, we utilize a content analysis of presidential candidates’ social media activity in the months preceding the election in order to better understand how the candidates addressed women and minorities. We ultimately find that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton out-posted Trump in both positive and negative content in the categories of women’s issues; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender issues; race; and immigration. However, this is not the case with issues involving crime and police, which was a lens through which Trump was more likely to approach race-related issues. In many instances, the candidates also appeared to strategically target content-specific posts to the social media platforms where they would be most likely to be seen by women or the minority group most closely related to the post’s content. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - More than 180 people in Canada have faced criminal charges related to HIV nondisclosure. Media coverage is often sensational and commonly portrays people living with HIV as hypersexualized threats to the (inter)national body politic. This article analyzes mainstream news media coverage of four HIV nondisclosure cases to examine how the accused (two men, two women) are constructed as sexual predators, which we found occurs through two key discursive moves. First, by tying the narrative to stereotypical conceptualizations of hegemonic and toxic masculinity and pariah femininity to construct the individual as promiscuous, hypersexual and dangerous. Second, by crafting a narrative that evokes complex moral emotions; notably, these include the ‘negative’ emotions of anger, disgust and fear. Given that racialized men are disproportionately represented and demonized in media accounts, and the tense race relations in the current western political landscape, it is important to consider how emotions (rather than medical evidence of the risks of transmission, intent to infect or actual transmission) might contribute to shaping punitive mentalities and the harsh application of the law. By examining how race, gender, class and sexuality are mobilized to construct narratives of Black masculinity as inherently toxic and women’s sexual freedom as exemplifying pariah femininity, and the ways in which the coverage evokes negative moral emotions, we contend that media coverage shores up moralized discourses about sexuality, masculinity and femininity and HIV/AIDS. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Although criminologists have studied public attitudes to community sanctions, and there has also been some attention to media representations of them, there has been no serious examination of the relationships between media and public understandings. This article presents an interdisciplinary analysis (drawing on sociology, media and communications and organizational studies) of the potential influence of media consumption practices on penal tastes among diverse participant groups. We aim to develop a clearer understanding of how these processes shape the public legitimacy of community sanctions. In particular, we report on original research employing innovative methodologies to explore the dynamic set of practices deployed by audiences in the process of making meaningful the media landscape on punishment and community sanctions. Our findings offer some confirmation of the primacy of the prison in the popular imagination; the media profile of community sanctions is delimited by their perceived banality, in turn leading to confusion surrounding their purpose and potential. However, this study suggests that the legitimacy problem for community sanctions may be far more complex than ‘newsworthiness’. Community sanctions, we argue, may be subject to appraisal in line with penal ‘tastes’ in which the function of moral censure is of central significance. However, we also uncover some evidence about how traditional markers of taste are disrupted by processes of media convergence (of appropriation, circulation, response) in ways which can operate to limit deliberation even amongst more liberal audience groups, and conversely open it up amongst those who are more punitive. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Past research on confronting racial prejudice has largely examined negative racial stereotypes. In the present work, we investigate perceiver and target perspectives associated with the evaluative costs of confronting positive racial stereotypes. We demonstrate that, in general, Asian Americans and African Americans who confront positive racial stereotypes suffer higher evaluative costs compared to targets who confront negative racial stereotypes and those who do not confront due, in part, to the lower perceived offensiveness of positive stereotypes (Studies 1 and 2). Moreover, Asian American and African American participants report lower confrontation intentions and higher anticipated evaluative costs for confronting positive, compared to negative, stereotypes. Furthermore, higher perceived offensiveness and lower anticipated favorable evaluations serially mediate the relationship between stereotype valence and confrontation intentions (Study 3). Overall, this research extends our understanding of the evaluative costs associated with confronting prejudice, with important downstream consequences regarding the continued prevalence of positive racial stereotypes. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how corporate reputation interacts with corporate social responsibility (CSR) fit and affects stakeholders’ skeptical attribution (SA) of CSR motives, as well as their attitudes, supportive communication intent and purchase intent. This study proposes that a high-fit CSR program does not necessarily engender more favorable outcomes, nor does it stimulate SA. The study proposes the effects of CSR fit differ by corporate reputation. For bad-reputation companies, low-fit is anticipated to generate more desirable CSR outcomes than high-fit initiatives. Design/methodology/approach: Two experiments were conducted. The first experiment employed a randomized 2 (CSR fit: high fit vs low fit) × 2 (good reputation vs bad reputation) × 2 (Industry: food retailing and insurance) full factorial design to examine the suggested hypotheses. The second study employed a randomized 2 (CSR fit: high fit vs low fit) × 2 (good reputation vs bad reputation) full factorial design with consumer samples to replicate the conceptual relationships among variables in the first study. Findings: While reputation plays a dominant role in influencing stakeholders’ CSR-related responses across both CSR fit situations, a SA partially mediates the relationship between reputation and stakeholder reactions. CSR fit interacts with reputation, and influences the partial mediation process through SA; under a bad reputation condition, low-fit CSR engenders less SA and results in better stakeholder reactions. A similar tendency was found with supportive communication intent and purchase intent. High-fit CSR initiatives by a negative reputation company engendered the weakest supportive intent and purchase intent. For a reputable company, across both CSR fits, respondents displayed generally very positive attitudes toward, greater intent to support, and intent to purchase from the company. Originality/value: The study findings provide useful and empirically supported logical explanations of why high-fit CSR programs sometimes cause backlash effects, despite the general consensus that such initiatives generate positive outcomes. This study offers an alternative and more relevant perspective to conceptualize the complexity of anticipating CSR outcomes. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Digital libraries and social media have emerged as two prominent online information sources with different characteristics. The purpose of this paper is to compare digital libraries and social media from the perspective of the dual route model which outlined a general framework of central and peripheral route-induced attitude change. Design/methodology/approach: Research hypotheses were developed and data collected from users of digital libraries and social media were used for data analysis. The paired samples t-test was employed to compare the means. Findings: Both central route (information quality) and peripheral route (source credibility and reputation) of digital libraries are higher than those of social media. Practical implications: The important status of digital libraries as conventional information sources should be propagated by various “marketing” ways. Managers of digital libraries should encourage their users to use both digital libraries and social media so that some unique advantage of social media could usefully complement digital libraries. They should also recognize the challenge brought by social media and try various ways to enhance reputation. Originality/value: Building on the dual route model, this study compares digital libraries and social media in terms of the central route and peripheral route, which the authors believe presents a new lens for digital library research and practice alike. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Understanding the neural correlates of social interaction among depressed adolescents with suicidal tendencies might help personalize treatment. We tested whether brain function during social interaction is disrupted for depressed adolescents with (1) high suicide ideation and (2) recent attempts. Depressed adolescents with high suicide ideation, including attempters (n = 45;HS) or low suicide ideation (n = 42;LS), and healthy adolescents (n = 39;HC), completed a version of the Cyberball peer interaction task during an fMRI scan. Groups were compared on brain activity during peer exclusion and inclusion versus a non-social condition. During peer exclusion and inclusion, HS youth showed significantly lower activity in precentral and postcentral gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, insula, and putamen compared to LS youth; and significantly reduced activity in caudate and anterior cingulate cortex compared to HC youth. In a second analysis, suicide attempters (n = 26;SA) were compared to other groups. SA adolescents showed significantly higher activity in ACC and superior and middle frontal gyrus than all other groups. Brain activity was significantly correlated with negative emotionality, social functioning, and cognitive control. Conclusions: Adolescent suicide ideation and attempts were linked to altered neural function during positive and negative peer interactions. We discuss the implications of these findings for suicide prevention efforts. © 2019

AB  - This study investigates the differences between the risk factors of income poverty and severe material deprivation by assessing to what extent both indicators are subject to the same underlying household-level and country-level determinants. Given that these two indicators encompass the majority of the Europe 2020 social inclusion target group, it is crucial for policy makers to better know which determinants are effective in explaining the differences within and between countries in the risk of these two target components. We employ a series of single-level and multilevel logistic multinomial models to explain differences between those who suffer from income poverty ‘only’, from severe material deprivation ‘only’, from both problems and none. The comparative use of single-level and multilevel methods allow for the first time to confront the respective within and between-country explanatory power of both types of models. In addition to the usual econometric approach of identifying significant relationships, we employed the Shapley decomposition method to compare the relative contribution of independent variables at the household-level (i.e. work intensity, household education, household costs, socio-demographic variables) and country-level (i.e. size of social spending (total, in-cash, in-kind), pro-poorness of social benefits, median income levels and the unemployment rate) to within and between-country explained variance measures. We apply our method to the cross-sectional European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions for the year 2012. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - We performed a systematic review of qualitative research on interventions to reduce homophobia. Specifically, we conducted a thematic analysis of participant feedback given in 30 qualitative and mixed-methods studies. Participants often described interventions as “eye-opening.” However, they also criticized many interventions for their mismatch with the social, historical, or institutional context in which they were conducted. Some participants rejected the interventions altogether, describing them as offensive or disgusting. We drew three conclusions. First, participants not only were actively making sense of the interventions but also were often aware of philosophical and political tensions (especially liberal vs. queer approaches). Second, participants sometimes used the perceived inadequacy of the intervention for the local context as an argument to resist change. Finally, tensions in participant feedback (eye-opening vs. disgusting) can be read as evidence that reducing homophobia is “dirty work”: such work is both vital for society and despised by many. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In recent years, the social research of Pearl Jephcott has been subject to scholarly reappraisal on the grounds that it displays an early commitment to the unmediated reporting of ‘the authentic voice of her participants’. This article investigates the extent to which this claim holds for Jephcott’s seminal 1971 study Homes in High Flats. It suggests that, although Homes in High Flats sought to investigate ‘people and their homes rather than housing in the usual sense’, the study’s ability to realise this aim was complicated by the social distance obtaining between researcher and researched. Based on re-analysis of the study’s archived research materials, the article explores how this distance mediated the researchers’ interpretation and re-presentation of the tenant’s voice, deepening understanding of the epistemological premises of Jephcott’s work. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - While it has been well established that breastfeeding provides the best nourishment for children, few women achieve the recommended breastfeeding duration. Negative media messages have been identified as one explanation for the lack of individual and public support for breastfeeding. This study explored the influence of media on the knowledge and attitudes of a nearly childless population to ascertain if and how entertainment media can positively impact perceptions of breastfeeding. Using cultivation and parasocial interaction, this research measured entertainment television’s effect on breastfeeding attitudes using randomized-group experiments involving 375 students. Overall, participants generally held positive attitudes but were uncomfortable seeing breastfeeding. Moreover, results indicate that viewing a prime-time television clip that depicted public breastfeeding not only significantly lessened the extent to which participants believed that breastfeeding was a private activity but also improved attitudes and support for breastfeeding in public. This study concludes that more pro-breastfeeding media messages in entertainment media could help create a climate conducive to breastfeeding success. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: The Lebanese public perceives the physician-patient relationship as flawed. The objectives of this study are to assess factors associated with the public's trust in physicians in the context of the Lebanese healthcare system and to explore potential ways to enhance it. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study based on a grounded theory methodology using semi-structured interviews with members of the Lebanese public (not restricted to patients). We selected participants through convenience and maximum variation sampling approaches. The constant comparative analysis resulted in a theoretical framework that describes the factors influencing trust in physicians. Results: Participants trusted an experienced, up-to-date, graduate of a North American or Western European school, working in a reputable hospital, with a high level of diagnostic skills. The personal characteristics that improved trust were physicians who are 'non-materialistic', have a good rapport, and have sufficient encounter time with patients. Social factors that enhance trust in the physician include: being a family member, recommended by a family member, featured in mainstream media, and/or having a good reputation. Trust increased compliance, loyalty despite occasional mistakes committed, high consultation fees, and negative attitudes towards the physician's institution. Conversely, no trust led to severed therapeutic relationship and seeking second opinions. Conclusion: The level of trust of members of the Lebanese public in physicians was affected by the personal characteristics of physicians, their practice or clinical skills, their interactions with the patient, finances, in addition to a number of social factors. Moreover, the level of trust had major implications on patients' interactions with their physicians. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Importance: Burnout, a syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a decreased sense of efficacy, is common among resident physicians, and negative emotional states may increase the expression of prejudices, which are associated with racial disparities in health care. Whether racial bias varies by symptoms of burnout among resident physicians is unknown. Objective: To assess the association between burnout and explicit and implicit racial biases toward black people in resident physicians. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study obtained data from surveys completed by first-year medical students and resident physicians in the United States as part of the Cognitive Habits and Growth Evaluation Study. Participants were followed up from enrollment in 2010 to 2011 through 2017. Participants completed questionnaires at year 4 of medical school as well as at the second and third years of residency. Only data from resident physicians who self-identified as belonging to a racial group other than black (n = 3392) were included in the analyses because of scarce evidence of racial bias in the care provided to black patients by black physicians. Resident physicians training in radiology or pathology were excluded because they provided less direct patient interaction. Main Outcomes and Measures: Burnout symptoms were measured by 2 single-item measures from the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Explicit attitudes about white and black people were measured by a feeling thermometer (FT, from 0 to 100 points, ranging from very cold or unfavorable [lowest score] to very warm or favorable [highest score]; included in the second-year [R2] and third-year [R3] questionnaires). The R2 Questionnaire included a racial Implicit Association Test (IAT; range: -2 to 2). Results: Among the 3392 nonblack resident physician respondents, 1693 (49.9%) were male, 1964 (57.9%) were younger than 30 years, and 2362 (69.6%) self-identified as belonging to the white race. In this cohort, 1529 of 3380 resident physicians (45.2%) had symptoms of burnout and 1394 of 3377 resident physicians (41.3%) had depression. From this group, 12 did not complete the burnout items and 15 did not complete the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) items. The mean (SD) FT score toward black people was 77.9 (21.0) and toward white people was 81.1 (20.1), and the mean (SD) racial IAT score was 0.4 (0.4). Burnout at the R2 Questionnaire time point was associated with greater explicit and implicit racial biases. In multivariable analyses adjusting for demographics, specialty, depression, and FT scores toward white people, resident physicians with burnout had greater explicit racial bias (difference in FT score, -2.40; 95% CI, -3.42 to -1.37; P <.001) and implicit racial bias (difference in IAT score, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.02-0.08; P =.002). A dose-response association was found between change in depersonalization from R2 to R3 Questionnaire and R3 Questionnaire explicit bias (for each 1-point increase the difference in R3 FT score decreased, -0.73; 95% CI, -1.23 to -0.23; P =.004) and change in explicit bias. Conclusions and Relevance: Among resident physicians, symptoms of burnout appeared to be associated with greater explicit and implicit racial biases; given the high prevalence of burnout and the negative implications of bias for medical care, symptoms of burnout may be factors in racial disparities in health care. © 2019 Dyrbye L et al.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to test the effects of two types of celebrities (Instagram celebrity vs traditional celebrity) on source trustworthiness, brand attitude, envy and social presence. The proposed theoretical model consists of the celebrity type as the independent variable, social presence as the mediator and self-discrepancy as the moderator. Design/methodology/approach: A randomized two-group comparison (Instagram celebrity vs traditional celebrity) between-subjects experiment (n=104) was conducted. Findings: The results indicate that consumers exposed to Instagram celebrity’s brand posts perceive the source to be more trustworthy, show more positive attitude toward the endorsed brand, feel stronger social presence and feel more envious of the source than those consumers exposed to traditional celebrity’s brand posts. Structural equation modeling (Mplus 8.0) and bootstrap confidence intervals indicate that social presence mediates the causal effects of celebrity type on trustworthiness, brand attitude and envy. Multiple regression analyses reveal the moderating effects of appearance-related actual–ideal self-discrepancy. Practical implications: Ultimately, managerial implications for social media marketing and Instagram influencer-based branding are provided. From the perspective of marketing planning, the findings speak to the power of influencer marketing as an effective branding strategy. Originality/value: The paper discusses theoretical implications for the marketing literature on celebrity endorsements. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Since the end of 2016, “fake news” has had a clear meaning in the USA. After years of scholarship attempting to define “fake news” and where it fits among the larger schema of media hoaxing and deception, popular culture and even academic studies converged following the 2016 US presidential election to define “fake news” in drastically new ways. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: In light of the recent elections in the USA, many fear “fake news” that have gradually become a powerful and sinister force, both in the news media environment as well as in the fair and free elections. The scenario draws into questions how the general public interacts with such outlets, and to what extent and in which ways individual responsibility should govern the interactions with social media. Findings: Fake news is a growing threat to democratic elections in the USA and other democracies by relentless targeting of hyper-partisan views, which play to the fears and prejudices of people, in order to influence their voting plans and their behavior. Originality/value: Essentially, “fake news” is changing and even distorting how political campaigns are run, ultimately calling into question legitimacy of elections, elected officials and governments. Scholarship has increasingly confirmed social media as an enabler of “fake news,” and continues to project its potentially negative impact on democracy, furthering the already existing practices of partisan selective exposure, as well as heightening the need for individual responsibility. © 2019, Terry Lee.

AB  - Background: Systematic research into palliative care (PC) for people with substance use disorder (SUD) and multiple problems is scarce. The existing literature shows problems in the organizational structure of this care, e.g., lack of clear care pathways. Furthermore, negative attitudes of healthcare professionals (HCPs) and stigmatization surrounding SUD, and patients' care-avoidance and non-disclosure of substance use are hindering factors in providing timely and person-centered PC. Furthermore, the experiences and needs of patients and proxies themselves are unknown. Therefore, this study aims to explore which problems and needs patients with SUD and multiple problems, and their proxies, experience in a PC phase. Methods: Data-collection of this qualitative study consisted of semi-structured interviews with patients with SUD and multiple problems in a PC phase, and their proxies, about their experiences in PC and their well-being. Interviews were inductively analyzed. Results: Nine patients and three proxies were included. Six patients suffered from COPD, one patient from cirrhosis of the liver and two patients from both. Seven patients stayed in a nursing home and two had a room in either a social care service (hostel) or an assisted living home where medical care was provided. Five themes were identified: 1) healthcare delivery (including HCPs behaviour and values); 2) end-of-life (EOL) preferences (mostly concerning only the individual patient and the 'here-and-the-now'); 3) multidimensional problems; 4) coping (active and passive) and; 5) closed communication. Proxies' experiences with healthcare differed. Emotionally, they were all burdened by their histories with the patients. Conclusions: This study shows that talking about and anticipating on PC with this patient-group appears hard due to patients' closed and avoiding communication. Furthermore, some of patients' EOL-preferences and needs, and coping-strategies, seem to differ from the more generally-accepted ideas and practices. Therefore, educating HCPs in communicating with this patient-group, is needed. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of organizational justice and conflict management on employee relations (ER) through the mediating role of climate of trust. Design/methodology/approach: This study was conducted with a sample of 331 employees working in a power transmission unit of Odisha. Data were collected by administering a structured questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling (AMOS 20). Findings: The results reveal that climate of trust plays the role of a partial mediator between organizational justice and ER and conflict management and ER. Also, it was found that organizational justice, conflict management and climate of trust are the positive and significant predictors of ER. Research limitations/implications: The study was confined to a single state-owned power transmission unit of an Indian state, which restricts its generalizability. The research would benefit from exploration in alternative units. Practical implications: This scholarly work may encourage managers and decision makers to develop trust building climate by focusing on organizational justice and conflict management to flourish an environment of harmonious ER, furthermore to formulate effective strategies for cultivating facilitative work environment to enhance positive attitude among the employees to challenge future goals. Originality/value: The research is exclusive in determining the influence of organizational justice and conflict management on ER through the mediator of climate of trust in the new perspective of the power sector that provides empirical evidence to the extant literature. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Objective: Nurse shortage is a critical problem for global healthcare services. It impacts the quality of clinical care. Work engagement is the core competence of hospitals, which indicates employee's positive attitude toward organization and work. This study aimed to explore the relationships among calling, organizational commitment, and work engagement. Methods: A cross-sectional study was designed, and 320 nurses from tertiary hospitals in China completed the questionnaires that included demographic information, calling scale, employee engagement scale, and organizational commitment scale. Pearson correlation was performed to test the correlations among calling, organizational commitment, and work engagement. Stepwise regression analyses were performed to explore the mediating role of organizational commitment. The bootstrap method was employed to confirm the mediating effect. Results: Nurses’ work engagement score was at the medium degree, whereas calling and organizational commitment were in the medium to high level. The results revealed that calling, organizational commitment, work engagement, and each dimension were positively correlated with one another (r = 0.145–0.922, P < 0.01). The organizational commitment plays a partially mediating effect between calling and work engagement (β = 0.603 to 0.333, P < 0.01). Conclusions: The mediation effect of organizational commitment was verified, which provided a comprehensive understanding of how calling impacted work engagement. Moreover, administrators should not only promote interventions to increase work engagement but also pay attention to calling and organizational commitment so as to improve their work engagement. Taken together, increased level of work engagement is required in the current nursing field. © 2019 Chinese Nursing Association

AB  - Background: Cervical cancer is the most common cancer and a major cause of morbidity and mortality among women in Zimbabwe yet it is preventable, early detectable and highly curable. The objective of this study was to investigate knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices towards cervical cancer, its prevention and treatment in Harare, Zimbabwe. Methods: Sequential explanatory mixed methods approach consisting of analytical cross sectional survey and a qualitative inquiry was used. Study population consisted of women with cervical cancer, health workers and other stakeholders who are involved in cancer control programmes. Patient survey data were collected using validated structured questionnaire in Surveytogo software in an android tablet. Qualitative study used key informant interviews to understand survey findings better. Data analyses for the survey involved univariate and multivariate analyses using STATA version 14. For qualitative study, themes in transcripts were coded and analyzed using Dedoose software to generate evidence for the study. Results: Participants reported different levels of knowledge of causes (23%), risk factors (71%), prevention (72%), screening (73%) and treatment (80%) of cervical cancer. Knowledge of causes of cervical cancer were negatively associated with: being aged 45 or more years (OR = 0.02; p = 0.004), having no household income (OR = 0.02;p = 0.007), household income <US$600 per month (OR = 0.02; p = 0.015), middle class wealth (OR = 0.01;p = 0.032), watching TV daily (OR = 0.01;p = 0.007) and 1-6 times per week (OR = 0.02; p = 0.045). Knowledge of causes of cervical cancer were also positively associated with listening to radio daily (OR = 394, CI: 11.02-1406) (p = 0.001) and 1-6 times a week (OR = 100, CI: 2.95-3364) (p = 0.010). Knowledge of prevention was only positively associated with listening to the radio daily (OR = 77, CI: 1.89-3114) (p = 0.022) and 1-6 times a week (OR = 174, CI: 2.42-1255) (p = 0.018). Major drivers of lack of knowledge for cervical cancer were: limited awareness programmes, lack of knowledge among health workers, donor prioritization of infectious diseases, infancy of cervical cancer interventions, negative attitudes towards cervical cancer and misconceptions. Conclusions: This study revealed that knowledge of causes and prevention of cervical cancer was associated with frequent radio listenership. Strengthening of health education through the packaging of messages targeting the wider society using different delivery channels is thus recommended. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: There are many threats to cultural heritage including armed conflict and natural disasters such as earthquakes, fire and flooding. It is understandable that these dramatic events frequently capture the world’s attention. However, a far more considerable danger is inadequate management a lack of financial resources to conduct continuous conservation and maintenance. The purpose of this paper is to gain an understanding of the current state of financial sustainability at a limited selection set of tangible immovable cultural heritage sites and investigate why this critical aspect is deficient. Case studies have been identified where management improved, and a level of financial sustainability is achieved. Design/methodology/approach: To improve the conservation of tangible immovable cultural heritage sites, a specific definition of financial sustainability is required, which significantly differs from the management of for-profit activities and even other non-profit cultural institutions such as museums, and takes into account the special requirements for conservation and education, additional values, site access and the wide variety of places that range from archaeological sites to single structures. The methodology began with researching the definition of financial sustainability from non-profit institutions then refining through the application it to a defined and limited selection set of World Heritage properties. World Heritage properties were selected, given the wealth of data readily available. Following this larger selection, several evaluation case studies were selected for further investigation including an analysis of the management circumstances and how greater financial sustainability was achieved. The investigation initially relied on secondary sources including academic articles, thesis, management plans, nomination dossiers, reactive monitoring mission reports, newspaper articles, periodic reporting and required State of Conservation Reports. The case study investigation relied on primary sources including observational site visits and interviews using an informal questionnaire. Findings were later verified by follow up interviews. Findings: The research led to a definition of financial sustainability specifically for tangible cultural heritage sites that included five components, namely, management planning, revenue identification, expenditure analysis, administration and strategic planning, and, most importantly, alignment and support of cultural, educational and conservation mission. A majority of World Heritage properties in this study fall short of this definition of financial sustainability and do not sufficiently address this issue. Research revealed that there is a need for more dialogue with informed data on the financial aspects of managing tangible cultural heritage sites as most locations studied are not able to efficiently manage funds or take full advantage of possible opportunities. However, a few sites have achieved greater financial sustainability. The research describes the identified five critical circumstances in further defining financial sustainability: a conducive and open planning environment, knowledge and education, positive perceptions concerning the importance of finance, managerial autonomy and public interest. These circumstances permitted better management of existing funding and an environment for innovation. Research limitations/implications: Research limitations during the initial study included a hesitation or unwillingness to discuss financial details, a general lack of statistics, a lack of knowledge related to finance, a prejudice against the topic and a concern over the commodification of cultural heritage. However, as the case studies identified achieved greater financial sustainability, this was less of a limitation. Additional limitations included the necessity to conduct interviews via telephone and in European languages, English, Spanish and Italian. The final limitation was that this study only focused on single tangible cultural heritage sites and excluded larger sites such as entire cities and intangible or movable cultural heritage. Practical implications: The circumstances, which comprise the definition, identified during the research lead to a number of possibilities for improving the financial sustainability. The first is not to place emphasis on a management plan but in fostering an environment that encourages financial planning. The second circumstance is to improve the knowledge and education of finance for site managers. Third, a positive perception of finance, standard business practice and surplus generating activities must occur. Fourth, financial management must be devolved to individual sites. Finally, the public must be involved to ensure financial sustainability. There must be initiatives to frequently include the local community and encourage participation. Social implications: Most cultural heritage sites are financially dependent upon the state, and this will likely continue, but it is improbable to expect full financial support ad infinitum. Overdependence on highly variable top-down funding leaves cultural heritage vulnerable and open to uncertainty. While it is unrealistic to expect most sites to become financially self-sufficient or that managers will suddenly become entrepreneurs, it is reasonable to expect some improvement. The goal should not be to create a business from cultural heritage but to improve financial management for greater sustainability. Financially sustainability ensures that sites are conserved and maintained for future generations. Originality/value: The need to preserve cultural heritage is widely recognized by many different segments of society. However, the availability of financial resources to sustain conservation is often deficient or overlooked. Without taking measures for continued financial support, tangible cultural heritage is at risk as preventive maintenance is ignored and essential personnel and their skills are lost. Commodification of cultural heritage is of great concern and, when used as a means of generating income, it can compromise other values. Thus, a critical balancing act must be achieved by those who care about the historic, aesthetic and scientific values. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate, from the perspective of a retailer, which of two philanthropy programs (pay-what-you-want [PWYW] with charitable giving or mere donation) results in more positive impressions of, and behavioral intentions toward, the retailer sponsoring the program. Design/methodology/approach: Two studies investigate the influence of donation format (PWYW with charitable giving versus mere donation) on attitude and behavioral intentions toward the retailer, the second of which also explores equity as the mediating mechanism that produces the more favorable attitudes and intentions. Findings: Results indicate that PWYW with charitable giving is effective at enhancing purchase intentions and attitudes toward the retailer. Specifically, results suggest that the implementation of a PWYW with charitable giving format leads to higher perceptions of equity, ultimately leading to more positive attitudes and higher purchase intentions toward the retailer as compared with a mere donation format. Alternative explanations are examined and ruled out. Originality/value: To date, research predominantly examines PWYW with charitable giving from a pricing perspective and has yet to explore how it compares with other donation campaigns in terms of the impact on consumers’ attitudes and intentions toward the sponsoring retailer. This research fills that gap and contributes to the literature by broadening the perspective by which PWYW with charitable giving is examined. Managerially, the research is important, as it suggests that consumers consider the equity of various donation formats and think more favorably of retailers using more equitable donation campaigns. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In the Indian society, various factors other than mere knowledge have shown to have a more significant impact over contraceptive usage and choice such as educational levels of women, marital duration, cultural and social factors, and exposure to mass media. This study focuses on assessing the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of contraceptive use among married women. A cross-sectional study was conducted among married women aged between 18 to 49 years attending a tertiary care hospital in the city of Chennai from June to September 2018. A total of 146 women were interviewed, and the KAP parameters were assessed using a pretested structured questionnaire. Though 97.9% (n=143) of the women in this study had knowledge about some form of contraception, only 24.7% (n=36) practiced them. Among the users (n=36), the decision to adopt contraception was made by the husband in 69.4% (n=25). Among the non-users (n=110), the major reasons for not practicing contraception were lack of interest in 37.2%(n=41) and fear of side effects in 35.5% (n=39). This study demonstrates a significant gap between the knowledge and practice of contraceptives in our population. Improving doctor-patient relationship and encouraging a positive attitude of the husband towards contraception are the key factors in promoting adoption of the contraceptive practices. © International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.

AB  - This study examines the mechanisms of flood-risk precautionary behavior among Greek citizens. To that end, we specify and test a mediation model in which awareness-raising factors and confidence attitudes influence the citizens' current flood preparedness and preparedness intention through perceptual and emotional processes. Raw data were obtained via an online survey that received 1855 responses. Causal relations were tested by means of structural equation modeling (SEM). Overall, results indicate that risk perception and worry are significant drivers of preparedness intention. In particular, they act as mediating variables, explaining how flood experience, access to more risk information, vulnerability awareness, and trust in authorities affect citizens' intention to invest in precautionary measures. Especially trust was found to have a negative effect on worry, leading to lower preparedness levels. Worry was also found to have a significant role in explaining the current preparedness levels. Interestingly, citizens who had already undertaken precautionary measures in the past appear to be more willing to invest in more measures. Implications for improving flood-risk management in Greece are discussed. © 2019 Author(s). This work is distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

AB  - Although many Veterans and active duty service members experience mental health problems, most do not seek out any sort of mental health help. Stigma (a significant predictor of treatment-seeking) has been documented among Veterans and active duty service members; however, previous research on stigma in these groups has primarily utilized correlational and qualitative designs. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of stigma toward mental health problems in Veterans and active duty service members using an experimental design. One hundred sixty-five Veterans and active duty service members were randomized to read a vignette that described a Veteran who either did or did not experience a mental health problem and did or did not seek psychotherapy. Results indicated that the participants held more stigmatizing attitudes toward the Veteran who was described as having a mental health problem, but not toward the Veteran who was described as seeking psychotherapy. Additionally, participants held more positive attitudes toward the Veteran, compared to the attitudes that they believed other military members would hold. Last, with this sample of Veterans and active duty service members, self-stigma toward seeking psychotherapy was found to partially mediate the relationship between perceived public stigma and attitudes. Implications for addressing stigma in military service members and Veterans are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Society for Military Psychology, Division 19 of the American Psychological Association.

AB  - This article examines how Mizrahim perceive their media representation on Israeli television. Using Karl Jaspers’ psychological theory of boundary situations, the article seeks to explain the seeming disparity between the negative depiction of Mizrahim on Israeli TV and Mizrahi consumption of these representations. Having conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 25 individuals, the article found that most of the interviewees were well aware of their negative representation on Israeli TV yet used various interpretive strategies, stemming from ‘media boundary situations,’ to deal with this prejudice. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The so-called attitude-behaviour-gap of ecology might have changed to a „producer-people-gap”. In summer 2017 in Germany, the intention of private house-builders to buy an exterior insulation system based on renewable materials was measured as positive, with a mean of 5.2 on a 1–7 Likert scale. But the intentions of professionals were clearly below, e.g. craftsmen, with an average of 3.6 on the same scale–although both groups, the privates and the professionals, judged that there is a clear trend towards such products. Because of these findings, an additional investigation of management by producers was conducted in autumn and winter 2017/2018, in which a very critical atmosphere towards renewable materials was found. It was analyzed that the managements` attitudes might not be a basic refusal of renewable material in general, but rather a fear of costs of research and development of new products. A concept was tested, to see if it would be possible to cause an attitude change within the professional key target groups just by applying marketing instruments. Five articles in key media of this market have been published between February and May 2018. In the following evaluation (n = 150) in May 2018 significant effects of the communication have been measured: The intention of decision-makers in craftsmen`s businesses to buy an exterior insulation system based on renewable material rose significantly (0.01 Lv.) from a mean of 3.6 in 2017 to 4.4 in 2018. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Hierarchy-legitimizing beliefs can justify and perpetuate extant social hierarchies, such as economic inequality. Individual differences are important predictors of many political beliefs, but the role of compassion in this context has not been explored. This study investigated the relationship between dispositional compassion, which has shown promise in predicting enhanced prosociality, with hierarchy-legitimizing viewpoints, mediated by social dominance orientation (SDO). A sample of 590 undergraduate students completed measures of compassion, empathy, SDO, and sociopolitical policy views. Structural equation modeling showed that SDO mediated the relationship between compassion and hierarchy legitimization. The findings have implications for compassion’s relevance in political psychology, and for expanding understanding of the antecedents of anti-egalitarianism. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper examines public discourse on race, whiteness and Muslims through an in-depth exploration of an online media controversy following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. On 16 April, the day after the attacks, the liberal magazine Salon.com published David Sirota’s article, ‘Let’s Hope the Boston Marathon Bomber is a White American’. A firestorm of commentary followed, with conservatives defending the profiling of Muslims, and accusing Sirota of anti-white racism. Anchored in questions of race, racism and Muslims and marked by a sharp partisan polarisation, these discussions intensified after 18 April, when the Tsarnaev brothers were identified as the perpetrators. The ensuing debate surrounding the racial identity of the Tsarnaevs displays how Muslim racialisation occurs and operates within a conservative discourse strongly committed to a colour-blind ideology. Our paper moves beyond this affirmation of literature on Muslim racialisation and sets this process within a relationally constructed and performative white racial identity. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Culture has been shown to influence health beliefs and health-related behaviors by influencing the type of health information to which women have been exposed and shapes health and illness perceptions and practices. To increase screening rates, cultural influences should be considered as important correlates of screening behaviors for breast cancer. This study used semi-structured interviews of women attending a cancer screening facility in Lagos, Nigeria guided by the PEN-3 model to describe culturally relevant factors that shape attitudes toward breast cancer and breast cancer screening. Religion was the most prominent theme and was shown to have positive, negative and existential effect on breast cancer perceptions. Other major themes observed were related to family and traditional beliefs. The results from this study could be used to develop and implement culturally relevant cancer prevention interventions, strategies, and recommendations to overcome screening barriers in an effort to increase breast cancer participation and awareness among Nigerian women. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The women in my study talked about how they coped with what they saw as a backlash of Islamophobia. I show how they have come to deal with the effects of this in their everyday life. Even though most of the women in my study were born and raised in Britain, this antipathy towards Muslims has made them question their sense of belonging.

AB  - Muhammad Ali fought in the UK three times in the 1960s, each time to the accompaniment of significant media coverage that made him into a public figure. On his first fight in 1963, his unusual personality both delighted and reviled. Many of the criticisms were rooted in a dislike of American culture but beneath them were also racial stereotypes that encouraged a view of him as brash and immature. By his second and third fights in 1966, he was a deeply controversial figure in the USA because of his conversion to Islam and opposition to the Vietnam War. Yet neither issue had the same significance in the UK and his British fan base grew, despite the way he also reminded some of the danger that British racial tensions might escalate in the way they had in America. Ali was also an inspiration to Britons of colour and those who believed in the need for radical challenges to the world’s problems. As such, he is an example of how ideas, fears and hopes around race relations were transnational and the need for its British historians to ensure their accounts are de-domesticised. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Two surveys, including an original survey and a survey containing substantial secondary data, found substantial links between party identity, selective media exposure and attitudes on immigration. Republicans were significantly more likely to segregate themselves to like-minded media and to avoid traditional objective sources like national and local newspapers, local and national broadcast television news. Border-state residency failed to moderate attitudes about immigration; differences were found between local and national media. Finally, Republican support for immigration fell between 2016 and 2018, after the election of President Trump. © 2019, © 2019 Broadcast Education Association.

AB  - This article examines how German print media have represented male migrants with Muslim backgrounds in relation to mainstream society and the stereotypes drawn on and created, including that of the migrant Muslim man as a criminal and sexual perpetrator. Media reports about ‘lecherous refugees’ have risen in the wake of wider social controversies about the ‘European refugee crisis’ and the consequences of welcoming over 1.5 million refugees from predominantly Muslim countries into Germany in recent years. Many of these reports reflect the Cologne New Year’s Eve 2016 sexual attacks by migrant men against German women. This study of German print media identifies a racialisation and ‘islamicisation’ of sexual violence and proposes the original theoretical concept of intersectional stereotyping to conceptualise the intersecting of religious, racialised and gendered patterns in media representations of male Muslim migrants. The research combines and extends the analytical frameworks of intersectionality and stereotyping to develop a new concept useful in media studies and beyond. The article provides a previously unexplored insight into racialised anti-Muslim stereotyping in German society in socio-political and historical context through the lens of print media. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - For US policymakers, the ideological war for ‘hearts and minds’ after World War II transcended the scope of traditional diplomacy. The American strategy sought to exert as much control as possible over the framing of US policy in foreign media, particularly through radio broadcasts. The present article focuses on the Truman administrations’ mediated public diplomacy efforts in Denmark, as implemented through the United States Information Service (USIS) in Copenhagen. Through an examination of archival material from the US State Department and digitized versions of preserved Danish radio broadcasts, this study shows how the United States tried to promote favourable framings of its policies in Denmark. Because the ideological battles of the Cold War were fought through the media, the Danish Broadcasting Corporation was deemed of special importance to US interests. However, from the outset, the political and executive heads of Danish State Radio were still traumatized by the coercion they had experienced under Nazi occupation in 1940–45; they therefore adhered strictly to principles of autonomy and rejection of unmitigated propaganda. With surprising operational flexibility, the Copenhagen branch of USIS thus adjusted their procedures to fit the local environment; USIS delivered source material and offered assistance, but left decisions about editing and approach angles to Danish journalists. Occasionally, therefore, sensitive themes such as race relations and McCarthyism in the United States received a critical framing in Danish media. However, regarding USIS’s core issues such as the nature and intentions of the Soviet regime and Danish citizens’ faith in NATO, USIS, via Danish State Radio, played an important role in framing US policy and reversing neutralist attitudes. © 2019, © 2019 IAMHIST & Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Cultured meat can be produced from growing animal cells in-vitro rather than as part of a living animal. This technology has the potential to address several of the major ethical, environmental, and public health concerns associated with conventional meat production. However, research has highlighted some consumer uncertainty regarding the concept. Although several studies have examined the media coverage of this new food technology, research linking different frames to differences in consumer attitudes is lacking. In an experimental study, we expose U.S. adults (n = 480) to one of three different frames on cultured meat: “societal benefits,” “high tech,” and “same meat.” We demonstrate that those who encounter cultured meat through the “high tech” frame have significantly more negative attitudes toward the concept, and are significantly less likely to consume it. Worryingly, this has been a very dominant frame in early media coverage of cultured meat. Whilst this is arguably inevitable, since its technologically advanced nature is what makes it newsworthy, we argue that this high tech framing may be causing consumers to develop more negative attitudes toward cultured meat than they otherwise might. Implications for producers and researchers are discussed. © 2019 Bryant and Dillard.

AB  - In this paper, we examine how social structures of gender, caste, and religion, within which children in India operate, inform their engagements with media technologies/narratives. We demonstrate our approach using the case of three villages in the Ahmedabad district of Gujarat, India. We examine children’s media cultures using ethnographic methods which occasion long-term immersion and paying attention to children’s narratives. We also argue that children experience and enact their agency while engaging with media from within the limitations or norms imposed by the social structures. This is evident in the simple negotiation strategies they have developed to challenge social structures and norms prevalent in their societies. Based on empirical evidence we conclude that the children’s exposure to and consumption of media narratives under adult management allow the families and communities to reinforce the dominant rationality of patriarchy, caste hierarchy, and religious prejudice. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Food marketing targeted to Black and Latino adolescents primarily promotes energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and likely contributes to diet-related health disparities. Targeted marketing raises further public health concerns as Black and Latino youth are also exposed to greater amounts of unhealthy food marketing in the media and their communities. However, little is known about Black and Latino adolescents’ attitudes toward brands and marketing that target them directly. Focus groups with Black and Latino adolescents (N= 51) explored their attitudes toward targeted and non-targeted brands of food, beverages, and restaurants. Pile sorting activities using cards printed with targeted and non-targeted brand logos were used as an elicitation technique. Overall, participants indicated more positive attitudes about the targeted brands discussed in the focus groups than the non-targeted brands, and participants often described targeted brands as being for someone most like them. Some participants expressed appreciation for marketing that recognized “someone like them” as potential consumers, while others raised ethical issues regarding targeting of unhealthy foods. Participants’ strong affinity for targeted brands, and ambivalent attitudes about targeted marketing of unhealthy products, highlight an opportunity to increase awareness of food marketing targeting communities of color and address targeted marketing through countermarketing and grassroots advocacy campaigns. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Though the significance of involving children in environmental sustainability efforts is widely acknowledged, we still lack evidence on what they think of environmental issues and about the protection of nature. The aim of the paper is to systematically describe the reasons that children give for protecting the environment. Thirty-three children (aged 6–11 years) participated in one of the six focus groups. Method of qualitative content analysis was used for analyzing the data. Study findings showed that participants were aware of some of the environmental problems or environmentally harmful behaviour like litter and pollution. Moreover, the study participants had various views about the importance of nature protection like maintaining clean environment, protecting human life and health, or protecting animals and plants. The reasons they gave for environmental protection were related to both humans and other parts of the nature. Furthermore, the participants learned about nature protection from sources like family, school, various literature sources, computer games, television and by watching how others behaved. Implications regarding results of the study are presented further in the paper. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Muslims are routinely and distortedly associated with danger and terrorist activity in the media. Such depictions have clear implications for the social behaviors oriented toward this social group, however, explicitly interpersonal media effects of this nature are in need of enhanced examination. In this study, we assess the potential for positive depictions of Muslims to enhance the interpersonal interaction inclinations of consumers, using psychological theory to explore underlying mechanisms (i.e., narrative transportation, perceptions of social stigma, and prejudicial attitudes). Experimental evidence provides general support for our proposed theoretical model. Moreover, findings reveal a process of mediated social dissent wherein consumers’ perceptions of negative societal evaluations about Muslims facilitated more positive personal evaluations. Implications of these findings are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 National Communication Association.

AB  - Interactive multimedia enables a mediated nature experience in ecologically vulnerable areas. The aim of this study is to clarify the social and individual motivational factors governing satisfaction with virtual nature tours. After visiting the Piusa Caves Nature Reserve in Estonia, and participating in its virtual tourism (VT), 299 tourists responded to a questionnaire regarding their natural and VT experiences. We use a general linear model to explore the effectiveness of predicting satisfaction with VT based on values, beliefs about treating nature, pro-ecological norms, and need for emotional arousal from virtual experiences. Compared to people with a high need for arousal, people with a low need are more easily satisfied with VT, regardless of its weak emotional triggers, e.g. lack of lively impressions, feeling of place change, and connection to real nature. Pro-ecological beliefs augment satisfaction with VT in people with a high need for arousal. Mediated nature experiences offer ways of engaging with nature more conveniently to hedonistic travellers and would likely be rejected by people who seek social interaction and physical challenges when travelling. As VT is better received among women, lower educated people, and 50–70-year-olds, these may be ideal target groups for promotion of mediated nature experiences. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper seeks to build on scholarship that historicises the commodification of water in Africa. It foregrounds this phenomenon as part of broader processes of colonial remaking of society–nature relations. An empirical analysis is developed that illustrates how the British colonists’ condescending attitudes to indigenous social-ecologies, as well as the attendant exclusionary practises relating to colonisers versus colonised body-space interactions, not only formed the moral and material justification for subjugating the “inferior other” but also provided legitimating narratives for entrenching a racially differentiated urbanism, imposing western sanitation attitudes and introducing modernist ways of capturing and domesticating water at Blantyre. These marked a watershed moment in reconfiguring water–society interactions from being quotidian activities performed by the indigenes to produce water as a use-value/basic need, to that mediated by the circulation of money, modernist public health concerns and water technologies primarily intended to serve the interests of the minority white settlers; thus setting in stone the production of Blantyre town in Malawi as an alienated and commodified waterscape. © 2018, © 2018 The Center for Political Ecology.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the influence of an instructional strategy for the use of DOKEOS, Course Management System (CMS) on the attitudes of professors toward distance education. The study was carried out in the Faculty of Accounting and Administration of a Mexican Public University. The research design was non-experimental with a group of twenty-five professors who were selected through purposive sampling. A questionnaire, which was an attitude scale toward the use of an administration system of online courses, was administered to participants before and after the implementation of an instructional strategy on the use of DOKEOS. Afterwards, usage statistics was examined between weeks three and six. Data analysis included calculation frequency, median, mode and standard deviation. The significant differences between the median of the pre-tests and post-tests were analysed, and then the t-test was administered. Results showed that the instructional strategy contributed to a more positive attitude of professors toward distance education. © 2019

AB  - China has relaxed its family planning policy to allow all married couples to have a second child. To ensure a smooth implementation of the new policy (second-child policy), an efficient detection of public attitudes is necessary. However, traditional methods fail to meet the requirement. This paper aims to examine social media responses, and then uses of linguistic analysis methods to build computational models for automatic detection of attitudinal expressions in social media posts. In this study, a total of 17,305 Sina Weibo posts with keywords were collected and analyzed. First, a content analysis was performed on collected posts to determine whether each of them reflected positive, neutral, or negative attitudes. Second, a series of linguistic features were obtained from each post. Third, based on selected linguistic features, decision tree models were built for differentiating among posts indicating different types of attitudes (positive, neutral, and negative). Results showed that 22.30% of analyzed posts indicated negative attitudes. 62.88% of relevant posts reflected a negative desire for bearing a second child. “Cost and burden” was recognized as a major barrier to the birth of a second child (56.55%). The classification accuracy of decision tree models ranged from 71.6 to 74.4%. This paper supports the need for improving public attitudes towards the second-child policy, and confirms that the use of linguistic analysis method can add to the validity of online detection of public attitudes towards significant social events. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The rise in participation of social media networks is accompanied with a corresponding rise in online extremism. The present research was carried out to ascertain whether anonymity, membership length and postage frequency are predictors of online extremism. A total of 205 Twitter accounts and 102,290 tweets were examined. To address the research question, both a corpus linguistic analysis (CLA) and content analysis (CA) were conducted. The former looked at extreme words associated with Islam and the latter looked at four types of extremist behaviour (extreme pro-social, extreme anti-social, extreme anti-social prejudicial biases and extreme radical behaviours). Keyness tests demonstrated that extreme words were most significantly associated with Twitter accounts with high anonymity, low membership length and low postage frequency. A series of multiple regressions found that anonymity significantly predicted four types of extremist behaviour. Membership length only predicted extreme anti-social behaviour and postage frequency did not display any significant predictive power for any of the four types of extremist behaviour. These results suggest that anonymity, membership length and postage frequency differ in terms of predicting extremist language and behaviour. © 2019 international journal of cyber criminology.

AB  - We investigated intergroup contact's cognitively liberalizing function by testing it's association with socio-cognitive skills (perspective-taking and empathy skills, and cognitive flexibility) and group-based ideologies (ethnocentrism and social dominance orientation [SDO]) among a majority (Turks) and minority (Kurds) status group (total N = 483). We further examined whether these relationships were provided by contact's primary intergroup function—more positive attitudes toward the contacted group. Multigroup structural equation modeling analyses demonstrated that high quality cross-group friendships were directly and negatively related to both ethnocentrism and SDO among the minority group. These associations were mediated by positive outgroup attitudes among the majority group. For both groups, perspective-taking and empathy were significantly predicted by lower levels of ethnocentrism and SDO. Contact also indirectly led to higher cognitive flexibility among both groups. Findings highlight the need to explore more extensively contact's psychological outcomes at the individual level, beyond changing outgroup attitudes. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Recent studies conducted in the UK, US, and in few other European countries have revealed a prominent political parallelism phenomenon in the news coverage of Islam and Muslims. The studies have evidenced that the coverage of Islam and Muslims is widely influenced by the ideological leanings of the newspapers. This paper sets out to explore whether the ideological differences of the Australian newspapers are reflected in the coverage of Islam and Muslims from January 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017. Employing Van Dijk’s ideological square and lexicalisation approaches within the CDA paradigm, this study examined editorials from two leading Australian newspapers. The findings validate the existence of the political parallelism phenomenon in the editorial contents of the selected newspapers representing Islam and Muslims. The findings show that The Australian, which is a rightist or conservative newspaper, toed the line of right-wing political parties and politicians such as Pauline Hanson and Malcolm Turnbull, portrayed Islam and Muslims in an overwhelmingly negative way, appreciated anti-immigration policies, criticised those who support accepting refugees, highlighted violence in Muslims countries, and collectivised Muslims while commenting on terrorist attacks in the West. On the other hand, The Age, which is a leftist or centre-left newspaper, criticised the far-rights for appreciating and supporting the rightist or conservative policies against Muslims, advocated the leftist or progressive or liberal stance, portrayed Islam and Muslims in a positive, supportive and balanced way, and advocated understanding, harmony and cohesion in Australia. © SEARCH Journal 2019.

AB  - Malaria is still the health problems in the community, especially in endemic areas like Papua. Malaria in pregnancy is contributing to the high numbers of pain and maternal mortality. One effort decreases the prevalence of malaria is empowering officers and clients or pregnant women by increasing knowledge to do prevention. One effort to increase knowledge with counseling at the time of antenatal. Effective counseling using the picture/media sheets behind a great way make it easier for mothers to understand the information provided. This research was to know relationship counseling using media sheet back toward an increase in knowledge, attitudes and compliance perform prevention of malaria infection. The method used was the stage that is training midwives Next research experiments with design pre-and post test-test, determination of sample with randomized assigment, group counseling is a treatment using media sheet turning 85 mothers and control group counseling without the media as much as 85 mothers. After counseling, conducted observation for 3 months in a row to see malaria prevention practices. Results: there was a change in the average knowledge of 2.014 (p < 005) between the pre and post test-test. Statistically, there is a change of attitude and knowledge difference 2.07 6.68 group treat compared to the kelompk control. Malaria prevention practices as using mosquito nets, do not hang the thrift in the home, use protective clothing when outside the House on the first and second month after statistically meaningful counseling with a value of p < 0.05. Conclusion: turning sheet using media counseling can improve knowledge, attitudes in a positive and pregnant mother dutifully do well compared with malaria prevention counseling without the media.

AB  - This paper tried to investigate the current situation of using social media as tools for e-learning to support learning at an emerging university in the south of Saudi Arabia. It also examined the benefits of using social media tools in higher education and the important role that these tools can play to facilitate the educational process. Additionally, the barriers that lecturers could face during the use of social media tools in the educational process were examined. Participants in this study were 10 lecturers. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data for this study. The results indicated that some of the interviewees had very positive attitudes towards using social media as tools for e-learning and felt that these tools were extremely effective instructional tools and should be integrated into the university curricula and that tutors should start using them as tools to aid the other learning environments. However, the results indicated that the major barriers to using these tools in learning were a distraction, opposing Islamic religious teachings, privacy issues, and cyberbullying. The study recommended that this study could be replicated at other Saudi universities to investigate factors and barriers that might affect Saudi students’ attitudes toward using social media to support learning. © 2019 International Journal of Information and Education Technology.

AB  - Background: In the emerging era of digitalization and electronic health, skin cancer–related apps represent useful tools to support dermatologic consultation and examination. Yet, little is known about how patients perceive the value of such apps. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate patient attitudes and their awareness toward skin cancer–related apps. Methods: A cross-sectional study including 200 patients from the oncological outpatient unit was conducted at the University Hospital (LMU Munich, Germany) between September and December 2018. Patients were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire on the popularity and usefulness of health-related and skin cancer–related apps. A descriptive analysis was performed with the expression of categorical variables as frequencies and percentages. For continuous variables, the median and range were indicated. Contingency tables and chi-square tests were performed to investigate associations between sociodemographic data and selected items of the questionnaire. Results: A total of 98.9% (195/197) of patients had never used skin cancer–related apps or could not remember. In 49.7% (93/187) of cases, patients were unsure about the usefulness of skin cancer apps, whereas 42.6% (78/183) thought that skin cancer apps could supplement or support the professional skin examination performed by a physician. However, 47.9% (90/188) were interested in acquiring more information by their dermatologists about skin cancer apps. Young age (P=.002), male gender (P=.02), a previous history of melanoma (P=.004), and higher educational level (P=.002) were significantly associated with a positive attitude. Nevertheless, 55.9% (105/188) preferred a printed patient brochure on skin cancer to downloading and using an app. Conclusions: The experience and knowledge of skin cancer–related apps was surprisingly low in this population, although there was a high general interest in more information about such apps. Printed patient brochures were the preferred information source. © 2017, JMIR Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Palliative care in oncology is an interdisciplinary approach, centered on patients and their families, carried out along the course of ne-oplastic diseases, based on symptom control, assertive communication and shared decision-making. Although clinical guidelines recommend a holistic intervention, early integration of palliative care into traditional oncological treatment, research shows a great delay in referral of patients, restricting palliative care to end-of-life care. Why does there seem to be a rationing of the early referral, sometimes in violation of human dignity? To a large extent it has to do with lack of knowledge, training and education of health professionals about palliative care and the techniques to deal with the process of death and dying. Several studies have demonstrated the benefit of integrating palliative actions into the routine of active cancer treatments, not only in terms of effective control of physical and psychological symptoms, but also in terms of overall quality of life, patient and family satisfaction, health care costs and survival in some cases. It is necessary to take measures that encourage oncologists to obtain further training in palliative care, as a formal, compulsory internship, integrated in their specific training program. This way, a new generation of physicians will surely change the lives of cancer patients, and their families, integrating — without disproportionate rationing — oncology and palliative medicine. © 2019, CELOM.

AB  - Objective: With the growing prevalence of overweight and obesity, medical students should be prepared to engage in weight management and obesity-related communications in order to prevent patients from having stigmatising experiences. In addition, medical students should have training to reduce anti-fat prejudices. Design: Cross-sectional proof of concept study. Setting: University Hospital Tuebingen, Germany. Participants: 246 participants (207 second-year medical students, 13 standardised patients (SPs) and 22 teachers) took part in the study. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The primary outcome was the assessment of degree of reality of the encounter with the SP wearing an obesity simulation suit (OSS). The secondary outcome was the evaluation of students' awareness and prejudice against patients with obesity in a simulated role play. Additionally, a description of the advantages and disadvantages when using such a teaching tool is delivered. Results: The OSS contributed to a realistic perception of the patient group depicted in a role play according to students, teachers and SPs. OSS body mass index estimation by students, teachers and SPs correctly was over 30 kg/m2 - thus in the range of obesity. In a selected subscale of the Anti-Fat Attitudes Test, students showed significantly stronger anti-fat stigmatisation compared with teachers and SPs. Conclusions: An OSS worn by an SP is a valuable teaching tool to raise awareness about patients with obesity. It gives a realistic picture of the encounter. Stigmatisation was low in general but was especially present in the students. Further research should include intervention studies to address this issue. © 2019 Author(s).

AB  - The aim of this paper is to discuss how social psychology might go about studying social hostility in public life that goes beyond mere disagreement on political matters. The paper addresses the case of online misogyny against women active in public life. In the context of a profound coarsening of political debate in Britain and elsewhere, women who are active in public life come regularly up against a barrage of abuse and intimidation online. The paper argues that manifestations of misogyny cross ideological lines and takes an array of forms. Misogyny is a specific class of prejudice that harms the dignity of women by calling into question women's (human) rights to participation in public life, freedom of expression, and personal safety. In order to fully understand the intricacies of online misogyny, social psychologists need to draw upon more directly on communications and media theories of mediated communication and connective action. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the influences of internalized homophobia on Chinese gay and bisexual men’s quality of life and life satisfaction. Four hundred and eighty-three participants completed the Internalized Homophobia Scale, Chinese SF-12 Health Survey Version 2, and Satisfaction With Life Scale via the Internet. Scores for quality of life in several domains and life satisfaction were significantly lower than the heterosexuals’ norm scores. The present study revealed that internalized homophobia significantly negatively correlated with the mental component summary score and life satisfaction. The mental component summary score mediated the relationship between internalized homophobia and life satisfaction. Sexual orientation moderated the relationship between internalized homophobia and mental component score. Gay and bisexual men in China experience poorer quality of life and less satisfaction with life compared to heterosexuals, and internalized homophobia contributes to both. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Introduction There is an evidence showing that when nurses have to allocate their time because of a lack of resources, older patients and especially those with dementia have a secondary care priority. The purpose of this study is to advance the level of knowledge, promote positive attitudes of nurses and reduce care deficits towards people with dementia through the implementation of a training programme. The programme will be enriched by an observational study of the care of patients with dementia to identify areas of missed care. Method and analysis This study will follow a mixed methodology consisting of three stages: (1) evaluation of the level of nurses' knowledge and attitudes towards dementia care through the use of structured questionnaires, (2) observational study to evaluate nursing care in hospital settings, in order to detect any missed care and (3) quasi-experimental study, with a before-and-after design, through the implementation of the training programme in order to increase nurses' knowledge, improve attitudes and consequently to promote care for patients with dementia. The data will be analysed with descriptive and inferential statistics with the use of the SPSS V.24.0 and with content analysis as regard to the observational data. Ethics and dissemination The protocol was approved by the National Bioethics committee and other local committees (ηη: 2018.01.02). The participants will give their informed consent and the anonymity and confidentiality. Also, the protection of data will be respected. The results of the study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed international journals and conferences. If the intervention is successful, the training package will be given to the continuous education unit of the National Professional Association in order to be used on a regular basis. © 2019 Author(s).

AB  - With the popularity of crowdfunding, many small- and medium-sized ventures and startups which have insufficient funds advertise and sell their services or products in reward-based crowdfunding markets. The success of crowdfunding projects for sale purposes is therefore beneficial to the sustainable development of these growing enterprises. Based upon goal attainment theory, a research model based on a cost-benefit framework is proposed to analyze consumer purchase intention in reward-based crowdfunding markets. The research model is empirically tested with data collected from 398 participants in China. A structural equation modeling analysis reveal that perceived benefits (price concession and perceived innovation) exert a significant positive impact on perceived net goal attainment (PNGA), whereas perceived costs (transaction cost and performance risk) have a weak negative effect on PNGA. The results also indicate that satisfaction mediates between PNGA and purchase intention. Furthermore, we use an artificial neural network analysis to weigh the relative importance of the antecedents of PNGA. The results suggest that perceived innovation is more important than price concession, which is consistent with the structural equation modeling analysis. These results might deepen our understanding of how consumers trade off costs and benefits in the purchase of crowdfunding products/services. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The lack of professional skills in project teams is one of the most important factors contributing to the high failure rate of Information Technology (IT) projects. Therefore, preparing students for increasingly complex IT projects has been an important learning objective in information sciences and technology programs. This article investigates the relationships between face-to-face students' self-efficacy of managing project tasks through online processes and their attitudes toward teamwork. The relationships among student engagement in learning experiences related to teamwork, self-efficacy of technology-mediated teamwork, and attitudes towards teamwork are investigated using confirmatory factor analysis on a data set with 344 participants. The analysis shows that self-efficacy of technology-mediated teamwork mediates the effect of learning engagement on attitudes toward teamwork. Therefore, the article postulates that mastering technology-mediated teamwork skills helps face-to-face students develop positive attitudes toward teamwork, which can be transferred to the workplace. © 2019, IGI Global.

AB  - It has recently been proposed that compulsive sexual behavior disorder should be included in the 11th version of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems. Concerns have been repeatedly expressed regarding the overpathologizing of sexual behaviors and the potential for false-positive results in clinical practice. Empirical evidence indicates that stereotypes related to gender and sexual orientation might influence therapists' assessments of clients. Those stereotypes are likely to be associated with different levels of pathologization and stigmatization of high levels of sexual interest and behavior. The aim of this study was to explore the possible connections between clients' gender and sexual orientation and mental health professionals' (MHP) pathologization of compulsive sexual behavior. A sample of MHPs (N 546) were presented with a case vignette describing a client with compulsive sexual behavior. The information on the client varied by gender (male or female), sexual orientation (homosexual or heterosexual), and clinical condition (ambiguous diagnostic criteria and fulfilled compulsive sexual behavior disorder diagnostic criteria). After reading the vignette, the MHPs rated the client's mental health status and gave an opinion about causation (psychological vs. biological etiology) and stigmatization indicators (blaming the affected individual for their problems, desire for social distance, perception of dangerousness). The MHPs showed significantly fewer tendencies to pathologize when the client was a homosexual woman or man independent of their clinical condition. Mediation analyses revealed that the biological etiological model partly mediated the effects of reduced pathologization in homosexual clients. These results indicate that clinical decisions relating to compulsive sexual behavior are influenced by nosologically irrelevant beliefs about the biological causation of sexual behavior. © 2019 American Psychological Association.

AB  - This study investigated the efficacy of a live theater performance intervention for enhancing the attitudes of pre-service rehabilitation students toward people with disabilities. A convenience sample of 54 undergraduate students of Latino/a descent (females = 33 and males = 21), age range 18 - 24 completed a pre-post design attitude change intervention. Data were collected on the students' attitudes toward persons with disabilities, using the scale of attitudes towards disabled persons, and gladness, using a liker scale. Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to analyze the data. Results indicated the live theater performance intervention was more effective in providing positive emotion of gladness and in improving the attitudes of the students towards PWDs compared to simple print media. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - This article discusses the gender-specific effect of the changing economic structure of mountain villages in Turkey. Rural women, who are conventionally unpaid family workers, have begun entering into off-farm work due to declining household incomes in recent years. The implications of this for gender relations are found to be contradictory in much recent research. In this study, we employed the concepts of the hybridity of rural communities and the multiplicity of social exclusion in a globalising countryside. We used a qualitative methodology employing multiple sources of data. In addition to in-depth interviews with 27 village women, we conducted semi-structured interviews with village headmen and structured interviews with 218 village women to understand the structural context behind the women’s narratives. We found that the dimension of social exclusion varies with gender and age within the community. While middle-aged men are increasingly unemployed and have withdrawn into uncompetitive rural life, young women engage in wage work and challenge geographical disadvantages by spending their meagre earnings on transportation and communication technologies. The reconfiguration of marginality within the community, rather than the total marginalisation of villagers, is an ongoing process. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: Transport-related cycling can contribute to employees’ increased physical activities in their daily lives, with potential health and environmental benefits. Still, a theoretical understanding of the links between the perceptions of physical environment and transport-related cycling through social cognitive theories is unclear. In addition, there is a lack of understanding on the moderating effects of the perceived physical environment on social cognitive pathways when predicting transport-related cycling. The purpose of this study was to apply the theory of planned behavior (TPB) framework to determine (a) whether TPB mediates the effects between the perceived physical environment and transport-related cycling and (b) whether the perceived physical environment moderates TPB-cycling relations. Methods: Using a prospective design, Chinese employees (N = 193) self-reported their perceived physical environment of their workplace neighborhood (i.e., residential density, land-use diversity, land-use accessibility, street connectivity, infrastructures, aesthetics, traffic-related safety, and crime-related safety), attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavior control (PBC), intention, and duration and frequency of transport-related cycling in the last week. One month later, self-reported cycling for transport was again collected from a subset sample of employees (N = 98). Mediation and moderation structural equation models linking perceived physical environment, TPB constructs, and transport-related cycling were tested. Results: The effects from residential density to attitudes and subjective norm, from land-use diversity and street connectivity to subjective norm and PBC, and from aesthetics and crime-related safety to attitudes, were found significant and positive. Attitudes, subjective norm, and PBC predicted intention, in which intention further predicted employee's future transport-related cycling one month later. Importantly, attitudes, subjective norm, and PBC mediated the relations from land-use diversity and street connectivity to intention, while intention mediated the effect from PBC to employee's future transport-related cycling. Past behavior showed significant effects on attitudes, subjective norm, PBC, intention, and employee's future transport-related cycling. The effect from past behavior to intention was mediated by the social cognitive variables of attitudes, subjective norm, and PBC. However, no moderating effects of perceived physical environments on the TPB-cycling relations were found, except the moderating effect of crime-related safety on the path from PBC to cycling. Conclusion: Current results indicate that Chinese employees’ transport-related cycling are a function of environmental (i.e., perceived physical environmental attributes) and social cognitive (i.e., attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention) factors. Findings of the current study can inform the development of multi-component behavioral change interventions targeting the improvement of transport-related cycling for employees. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Soil organic carbon (C) is an essential component of the global C cycle. Processes that control its composition and dynamics over large scales are not well understood. Thus, our understanding of C cycling is incomplete, which makes it difficult to predict C gains and losses due to changes in climate, land use and management. Here we show that controls on the composition of organic C, the particulate, humus and resistant fractions, and the potential vulnerability of C to decomposition across Australia are distinct, scale-dependent and variable. We used machine-learning with 5,721 topsoil measurements to show that, continentally, the climate, soil properties (for example, total nitrogen and pH) and elevation are dominant controls. However, we found that such general assessments disregard underlying region-specific controls that affect the distribution of the organic C fractions and vulnerability. This can lead to misinterpretations that prejudice our understanding of soil C processes and dynamics. Regionally, climate is mediated through interactions with soil properties, mineralogy and topography. In some regions, climate is uninfluential. These results highlight the need for regional assessments of soil C dynamics and more local parameterization of biogeochemical and Earth system models. Our analysis propounds the development of region-specific strategies for effective C management and climate change mitigation. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - There have been many surveys of public responses to Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), both reported in peer-reviewed journals and in the mainstream media. People anchor their representations of novel technological objects within their existing experience. What elements of such experience anchor AVs? We review academic English language survey studies from 2015 to 2017 and surveys publicised in UK National newspapers which typically reveal discomfort about the prospect of AVs. Against this background we report the results of our own survey of 11,827 drivers across 11 European countries, addressing attitudes to driving alongside AVs as well as to riding in them. We establish a composite indicator of perceptions of AVs that combines responses on using AVs and sharing the road with them, and analyse its relationship with a set of covariate measures. Respondents’ technological optimism and uptake of driving technology was associated with more positive perceptions of AVs, and measures of respondents’ enjoyment of driving, and how ‘sociable’ they were towards fellow road users, was associated with more negative perceptions. The negative association between driving ‘sociability’ and enthusiasm for AVs was attenuated by levels of general technological optimism. We discuss the difficulties in researching public responses to novel technological objects and make suggestions for improvement in future survey research on AVs. © 2019

AB  - Genetic analysis has become integral to many large cohort studies. However, little is known about longitudinal cohort study participants’ attitudes toward genetics and genetic testing. We analyzed data from a survey of participants in the Jackson Heart Study (n = 960), Framingham Heart Study (n = 955), and Framingham Heart Study–Omni Cohort (n = 160). Based on a three-question attitude scale, most participants had positive attitudes toward genetic testing (median score = 4.3-5/5). Participants were also asked to select words to describe their attitudes toward genetics. More respondents endorsed the positive words “hopeful” (60%-70%), “optimistic” (44%-64%), “enthusiastic” (35%-43%), or “excited” (28%-30%) than the negative words “cautious” (35%-38%), “concerned” (25%-55%), “worried” (6%-13%), “pessimistic” (2%-5%), or “horrified” (1%-5%). Characteristics associated with favorable attitudes were greater genetics knowledge, higher subjective numeracy, experience with genetic testing, less frequent religious attendance, and not being employed. These findings demonstrate variation in attitudes even among participants in long-standing cohort studies, indicating a need for ongoing participant engagement and education. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Although young people's mobility behaviors and their association with information and communications technologies (ICT) usage have been extensively researched, few studies have considered the relationship between changes in the use of ICT over time and young people's travel patterns. This paper explores how use of the Internet during adolescence/late childhood and the degree of change while transitioning from late childhood to adulthood is related to sustainable travel patterns in young adults. We are particularly interested in the mediating role that attitudes towards the environment have on the relationship between early age Internet use and sustainable travel in young adults. The use of rich, longitudinal datasets, the 2004 British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and the Understanding Society Survey (Wave 4, 2012/14), allow an investigation of these attitudes and relationships for the same people from childhood to adulthood. We use structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the complex interrelationships between young adults’ Internet use over time, their travel modes and attitudes towards the environment, and other related behaviors. Our key finding is that consistently high levels of Internet use between adolescence and young adulthood is associated with the formation of environmental attitudes. While other factors not considered in this study might also have an effect, we find that these attitudes are indirectly but significantly associated with young adults’ sustainable travel patterns and behaviors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper makes a critical contribution to the discussion about the transition from an automobile society to a multimodal society in Western transport and mobility research, which is characterised by a flexible use of different transport options. This discussion is fuelled, in particular, by the emergence of smart mobility, in which information and communication technologies (ICTs) – e.g., the smartphone – are used to switch flexibly between new interconnected mobility services (such as carsharing, ridesharing, bikesharing, bus or train). The starting point for the scepticism towards this transition is the research on transport poverty, which problematizes social exclusions from participation in mobility due to the unequal distribution of mode options. This paper suggests a change of perspective from the real mode choice to potential/optional mode choice in order to account for this scepticism in the research on multimodal behaviours. Multioptionality is conceptualised as a necessary precondition for multimodal behaviours to achieve this change of perspective. Based on this conceptualisation, three theses result from a quantitative analysis of a data set from an area in the Rhine-Main region in Germany. The theses challenge the often-postulated potential ubiquity of multimodal behaviours: (i) Transport poverty – represented by a lack of mode options – inhibits the potential production of multimodal behaviours, particularly by socially marginalised people (low income, low education, precarious job situation, etc.). (ii) A multimodal divide describes the reproduction of transport poverty in the guise of modernisation, as the transport poor – with few mode options – also lack certain ICTs that provide central access media to smart mobility. (iii) Another (perfidious) form of social exclusion from participation in smart mobility concerns critical thinkers who avoid installing mobility applications to protect their privacy. This exclusion occurs because these apps do not have an alternative as access software to smart mobility. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: As nursing students are the future workforce in nursing, they should have the necessary skills to find, understand and apply health information available on electronic platforms into their practice. Objectives: To assess eHealth literacy skills and associated factors among nursing students. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: A Government School of Nursing, Sri Lanka. Participants: A purposive sample of 440 nursing students. Method: A self-administered questionnaire consisting of socio-demographic data, the questions related to the internet use and eHealth Literacy skills was used. In data analysis, descriptive statistics, the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis H test were applied. Results: The sample consisted of 440 nursing students (420 females and 20 males). The mean eHealth literacy score was 28.02 (SD ± 4.60). Nearly half of the respondents (49.4%)reported inadequate eHealth literacy skills. The respondents reported comparatively poor skills in differentiating high-quality health resources from low-quality health resources on the internet and the ability to use information from the internet to make health decisions. The majority viewed that including information technology (IT)as a subject into the nursing curriculum was very (50.7%)or absolutely (33.6%)important. The influencing factors of eHealth literacy skills of nursing students were self-rated internet skills (P = < 0.001), perception towards using the internet in health decision making (P = 0.009)and using the internet to access health resources (P = 0.001). Conclusion: Half of the nursing students have inadequate eHealth literacy skills, particularly skills in identifying trusted health resources and using this information in health decision making indicating the need for improving eHealth literacy skills among nursing students. A positive attitude towards the internet has a significant role in developing eHealth literacy skills. Improving competencies in eHealth literacy skills of nursing students is essential. Introducing these concepts into curricula, planning target interventions, and enhancing IT facilities within the educational environment are essential. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The electric transition of the airline industry is emerging, closely following the automobile industry. Nonetheless, very little is known about airline customers' readiness for traveling on the electric alternative of an airplane. This study was designed to examine customers' intricate decision-making process for adopting electric airplanes and paying conventional flight prices for such electric-airplane flights. Our results from the structural analysis revealed that reducing customers' perceived risk and increasing new product knowledge is critical in boosting trust and positive attitude toward electric airplanes that significantly elicit their adoption and pay intentions. In addition, the effectiveness of the higher-order structure of perceived risk was uncovered, and both attitude and trust were significant mediators. Our theoretical framework satisfactorily accounted for behavioral intentions. Our results help airline practitioners invent efficient strategies to boost customers’ willingness to travel on electric airplanes adapting the electric transition of the airline industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rationale: Individuals living in Scotland's most deprived communities experience a higher burden of morbidity and early mortality than those living in more affluent areas. Experiences of poverty-based stigma may be one psychosocial mechanism through which socioeconomic position influences health, although there is little available data on this issue from a Scottish perspective. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify which aspects of poverty stigma are particularly salient to individuals with lived experience of poverty, and may therefore contribute to health inequalities. Methods: Five focus groups were conducted with 39 individuals with experience of living on low incomes in Scotland in order to explore their experiences and perceptions of poverty stigma. Results: Five main themes were identified, reflecting aspects of poverty stigma operating at various structural, public and individual levels: media representations of poverty; negative encounters with social security systems; perceived public attitudes regarding poverty in Scotland; lowered self-esteem and internalisation of negative attitudes, and; emotional responses to stigma. Conclusion: These dimensions of stigma potentially influence public health and health inequalities in Scotland, although future research will be necessary to quantify these and estimate their relationships with health outcomes. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Background: Globally, the use of violent discipline methods by teachers to manage child behavior is still highly prevalent despite enactment of laws that prohibit school violence. In the case of Uganda there is a dearth of accurate prevalence statistics on school violence and factors associated with the use of violence by teachers. Objectives: Therefore, the current study examined the prevalence of and attitudes towards violence. The study also explored the association between teachers’ stress, positive attitudes towards violence and the use of violent discipline management methods. Methods: A representative sample of 291 teachers and 702 students from 12 public secondary schools in southwestern Uganda responded to anonymous self-administered questionnaires. Data were collected from April to November 2017. Results: Findings indicated that 86.5% of the teachers reported having used violent disciplinary methods on students in the past month while 91.5% of the students reported experiencing violence by teachers. Teachers (88.3%, n = 256)endorsed positive attitudes towards violent discipline. Teachers’ stress was related to higher levels of violent discipline (β = 0.20). This relation was mediated by positive attitudes towards violence (0.06, SE: 0.01, 95%-CI: 0.035–0.092). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that teacher reported stress was associated with their use of violent behavior and positive attitudes and that positive attitudes reduced the association between teachers’ stress and violent behavior. Therefore, interventions aiming to reduce violence by teachers may need to integrate effective stress management skills, in addition to nonviolent discipline strategies, and fostering attitudinal change towards the use of violent methods. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Malnutrition is a debilitating and highly prevalent condition in acute hospital settings especially in older person; however international literature revealed negative attitudes in providing nutritional care among nurses and health professionals. Few studies have investigated attitudes towards nutritional care among nursing students, there are no data regarding the Italian context. Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore nursing students' attitudes towards nutritional care in older people. Design: A multicentre cross-sectional survey incorporating a pre post design. Setting and participants: A convenience sample of nursing students of the bachelor's degree in Nursing in the three hospitals were recruited. Methods: Nursing students completed “The Staff Attitudes to Nutritional Nursing Care Geriatric Scale (Italian version) (SANN_G ITA scale)”; first year students completed the scale before (T0) and after (T1) lectures about nutrition and nutritional care. Results: 245 students were enrolled (response rate 88.4%). The overall score of sample attitudes was Median(Me) = 66 (IQR = [60; 72]); at the variation of the year the neutral attitudes are prevalent with a significant tendency to increase the positive attitudes (p &lt;.003) and there is a statistically significant difference (p &lt;.05) in all dimensions except the “habits” dimension “(P =.1126). After two months from the end of the lessons regarding nutritional care there is an increase in subjects with neutral attitudes and a decrease in those with negative attitudes (P =.05). Conclusions: This study revealed a progressive improvement of the attitudes during the three-year course, underling the importance of nutritional contents provided; understanding the most critical aspects about nutritional care can be helpful in understanding in which areas university education should be improved, in order to train nurses able to assess and face with each patients' assistance need. © 2019

AB  - This study analyses the legal action taken for defamation in the case of the ‘human zoo’, an alleged defamatory portrayal of the Paiwan people, a Taiwanese indigenous group, by Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK. The analysis of this case is presented in two stages, the first of which employs a critical discourse analysis (CDA) to examine the covert racist discourse regarding the Paiwan people in a four-episode NHK documentary series on the history of the modernization of Japan. Second, the study evaluates the discursive patterns of the legal documents resulting from the subsequent lawsuits. The analysis incorporates the findings of interviews with key stakeholders in the human zoo case in its investigation of the presence of insidious racial prejudice against the Paiwan people, combined with a lack of sensitivity towards indigenous peoples in general, both in the documentary and in the responses from NHK in the subsequent lawsuits. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Purpose: Combinations of risk behaviors are common in popular media, which make it difficult to understand how exposure to risk content affects adolescent risk behaviors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether media effects associated with exposure to multiple risk behaviors (i.e., combined alcohol and sex, sex only, alcohol only, and no risk) in television content have specific or more general effects on attitudes and norms associated with performing these behaviors. Methods: Adolescents aged 14–17 years from an opt-in Qualtrics panel (n = 338) were randomized into one of four conditions, which varied the presence of risk behaviors (i.e., combined alcohol and sex, sex only, alcohol only, and no risk) that were featured in a brief video clip from a popular television show. We tested the content effects on behavioral attitudes and norms for performing each of the behaviors. Results: Analysis of variance analyses showed that exposure to combined alcohol and sex resulted in more positive attitudes toward engaging in combining alcohol and sex, drinking, and smoking. Exposure to the sex only, alcohol only, and no risk videos did not influence any attitudes or norms. Conclusions: A brief exposure to combined risk behaviors in media may increase positive attitudes related to the combination behavior (alcohol and sex), a component behavior (alcohol), and also more general risk-taking behaviors (smoking). © 2019 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine

AB  - Four studies suggested that social exclusion (vs. inclusion) by ingroups leads interdependents to discard impression management goals because of a lower tendency to identify with ingroups. In contrast, independents do not change their impression management goals when socially excluded (vs. included) by ingroups. Consequently, when included (but not when excluded), interdependents (vs. independents) are willing to pay more, and are willing to expend more effort in the purchase of publicly (but not privately) consumed products. Hence, when promoting publicly consumed products, managers should strive to include interdependent consumers (e.g., via ads or promotional campaigns). Similarly, on social media (Facebook, Twitter), it is easier than ever before to determine whether consumers have been included or excluded by their friends and families at a given time. With that information, managers may be able to selectively target consumers who are likely to pay more for publicly consumed products. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - With the explosion of social media, automatic analysis of sentiment and emotion from user-generated content has attracted the attention of many research areas and commercial-marketing domains targeted at studying the social behavior of web users and their public attitudes toward brands, social events, and political actions. Capturing the emotions expressed in the written language could be crucial to support the decision-making processes: the emotion resulting from a tweet or a review about an item could affect the way to advertise or to trade on the web and then to make predictions about future changes in popularity or market behavior. This paper presents an experience with the emotion-based classification of textual data from a social network by using an extended version of the fuzzy C-means algorithm called extension of fuzzy C-means. The algorithm shows interesting results due to its intrinsic fuzzy nature that reflects the human feeling expressed in the text, often composed of a mix of blurred emotions, and at the same time, the benefits of the extended version yield better classification results. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Rape myth acceptance (RMA) demonstrates association with psychopathic traits, traditional gender role norms, and negative attitudes towards women. However, these RMA correlates have rarely been studied in combination, or examined within military populations. The present study investigated RMA, psychopathic traits, attitudes towards women, and male gender role norms using a convenience sample of 85 active and veteran military personnel recruited through social media. As hypothesized, males and females with in the military did not differ in level of RMA. Results revealed significant associations between the Affective and Interpersonal facets of psychopathy and RMA. Hierarchical linear regression models indicated that traditional male norm ideology and Interpersonal psychopathic features significantly predicted RMA. Affective features to also trended in the prediction of RMA. Results suggest that Affective and Interpersonal traits of psychopathy are salient in account for RMA in a military sample. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Consumers are increasingly watching and sharing promotional and persuasive videos online via YouTube and other social media. Recent research has begun to explore both the content characteristics and the user motivations behind bona fide “viral” hits. The current study explores how both user motivations and emotional content of video messages containing the arousing emotion of disgust influence sharing intention among an undergraduate student sample (N = 456) and representative U.S. adult sample (N = 455). Some results mirror previous research and theory: Greater arousal and emotional response experienced while viewing was predictive of increased sharing intent across video message types and sources, as were positive attitudes and perceived social norms concerning sharing. Unique results also emerged in the data, revealing that advertising video messages elicited greater sharing intent than news videos and user-generated videos. In line with functional theories of disgust, videos which elicited higher-order, socio-moral disgust led to greater sharing intent than those that elicited sexual and pathogen avoidance disgusts. Implications for marketers and content creators are discussed. © 2019

AB  - The predictors of social closeness toward refugees are rarely examined. In this study (N = 337), higher cultural intelligence (CQ) and higher empathy were defined as predictors of higher social closeness (lower social distance [the Social Distance Scale] and warmer feelings [the Feeling Thermometer]) toward refugees from Syria. This is the target group of prejudice and intensive coverage in the European mass media. The obtained results indicated that other-oriented empathy (empathic concern and perspective taking) and the motivational CQ predicted higher social closeness and warmer feelings toward refugees from Syria. Empathic personal distress predicted lower social closeness and colder feelings toward this group. Motivational CQ consistently served as the mediator of the relationship between empathy dimensions and social closeness toward Syrian refugees. Our findings reveal the previously unexplored correlations between empathy dimensions and cultural intelligence factors, including the mediational effects in predicting social closeness toward Syrian refugees. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Many factors contribute to the well-recognized health care disparities experienced by persons with disability, including failure of physicians to understand the lives of individuals with disability. Disability cultural competence considers physicians’ ability to meet the social, cultural, and linguistic needs of this population. Objectives: To assess physicians’ understanding of disability cultural competence and attitudes towards patients with disability. Methods: Qualitative analyses of open-ended individual interviews averaging 41 min with 20 Massachusetts physicians from 5 different subspecialties, in practice for 8–51 years. Interview recordings were transcribed verbatim for conventional content analysis. Results: Most participants defined disability using medically-focused concepts rather than concepts that recognize how social factors contribute to disability. All participants used disability culturally-competent language, such as “person-first language,” at some points throughout their interviews. However, most participants also employed language that is now considered unacceptable or archaic, such as variations on the word “handicap,” “wheelchair-bound,” describing persons with disability as “suffering,” and calling persons by their health condition (e.g., “COPDer”). Participants mentioned persons with mental illness and intellectual disability as particularly challenging, especially around communication and performing even routine tests or examinations. Recommendations for improving care included better listening to patients with disability and seeking their views about their care. Conclusions: In this exploratory study, most participants used language that is considered disability culturally competent at times but also employed many terms and concepts that are considered outdated and may be troubling to some persons with disability. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A longitudinal study (N = 774) explored the short and longer term impacts of anti-Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Trans (LGBT) hate crime experienced directly, indirectly, and through the media. In the short term, being a victim (direct) or personally knowing of a hate crime victim (indirect) was positively associated with vulnerability, emotional responses, and behavioral intentions after reading about a hate crime. Direct victims were also less empathic toward other victims and engaged in more victim-blaming. A structural equation model showed direct experiences (via personal vulnerability and empathy) and media experiences (via group-threat and victim-blaming) to be cross-sectionally associated with behavioral intentions. Media experiences also had lasting demobilizing impacts on actual behaviors, again serially mediated by group-threat and victim-blaming. The findings highlight the emotional and behavioral impacts of hate crimes on both direct victims and on the wider LGBT community. They also raise questions about media reporting of hate crimes and the role of victim-blaming. © 2018 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Despite the definite links between soil and human health, it is likely that most people do not think about soil when considering human health. There is a disconnect between most people in our modern society and soil, and when people notice soil it is often in a negative context. People care for things that matter to them, and creating a more positive public image of soil could improve human health by leading to better treatment and understanding of the soil resource. There are a number of concepts that may be able to connect people to the soil, including terroir, soil health and soil security. While terroir originally established a connection between those who appreciate wine and the soils that produce those wines, the concept has been expanded to many additional products. It might be possible to provide a terroir link to human health benefits if they can be shown to be characteristic of a given soil environment. The concept of soil health has caught on with many farmers, policymakers, scientists and the general public, thus providing another possible approach to improve peoples’ connection with soil. Soil security is a recent concept that has been advanced as a way to take advantage of the connection that concepts such as energy, food and water security have made with policymakers. Therefore, we advocate a concerted effort to investigate terroir, soil health and soil security as concepts to improve overall human health. Soil health and soil security might have the most promise, and some social marketing campaigns that include soil health are ongoing. Highlights: Soil is important to human health. A disconnect exists between the urban population and soil. Education about soil can rebuild these connections. Concepts such as terroir, soil health or soil security might help make connections. © 2018 British Society of Soil Science

AB  - This article has examined how the Hallyu phenomenon is integrated into a transnational global cultural landscape, focusing on Chilean reception of K-pop. It analyzed how Hallyu fans engage with a social media-saturated environment in Chile, mapping out transnational pop cultural flows within the digital media environment through which the participatory culture of media users is spread. What is interesting is that Chilean society, in general, shows negative attitudes toward K-pop fans. More importantly, while many Chileans consider K-pop fans weird and strange, often disparaging their family members and friends for liking such music, the marginalization of K-pop fans in Chile promotes a greater sense of bonding among them through the affinity spaces of social media. Under this circumstance, most of our interviewees explained that digital media plays a vital role in the dissemination of K-pop in Chile and Latin America. Unlike Hallyu fans in other regions, K-pop fans in Chile have developed cultural intimacy specific to digital site-media, primarily in the realm of social media, and K-pop generates the creation of affinity spaces via different social media platforms. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - When expert advisors have conflicts of interest, disclosure is a common regulatory response. In four experiments (three scenario experiments involving medical contexts, and one field experiment involving financial consequences for both parties), we show that disclosure of a financial or nonfinancial conflict of interest can have a perverse effect on the advisor–advisee relationship. Disclosure, perhaps naturally, decreases an advisee’s trust in the advice. But disclosure can also lead to concern that failure to follow advice will be interpreted as a signal of distrust. That is, rejecting the advice could suggest that the advisee is insinuating that the advisor could be biased by the conflict of interest. We show that this insinuation anxiety persists whether the disclosure is voluntary or required by law and whether the disclosed conflict is big or small, but it diminishes when the disclosure is made by an external source rather than directly by the advisor. © 2018 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - We investigated how gatekeepers sometimes arrive at discriminatory hiring selections to accommodate prejudiced third parties due to role demands (i.e., the "third-party prejudice effect"). Studies 1 and 2 show that individuals in charge of personnel decisions were significantly less likely to select a woman when a relevant third party (the chief executive officer of the company in Study 1; the "proposer" in an ultimatum game in Study 2) was prejudiced against women. Gatekeepers accommodate third-party prejudice in this way in order to avoid conflict in relations and task-related problems that would likely occur if the gatekeeper introduced a member of the target of prejudice into an organization. Studies 3 and 4 demonstrated that both interpersonal and task-focused concerns significantly mediated third-party prejudice accommodation. Furthermore, experimentally reducing task-focused concerns significantly reduced the accommodation of third-party prejudice against women (Study 4). We also found that gatekeepers accommodate third-party prejudice regardless of their own beliefs and attitudes (Studies 5 and 6), or their own desire to get along or affiliate with the third party (Study 7), and despite leading to feelings of guilt (Studies 4 and 5). Both men and women accommodated third-party prejudice against women. A role-based framework can be useful to understand the persistence of gender inequality in various fields and organizations, even as individuals endorse increasingly gender-egalitarian views. © 2019 American Psychological Association.

AB  - As Virtual Reality (VR) continues to have an increased presence in the consumer marketplace, charitable and non-profit organizations are looking to VR to stimulate charitable giving (monetary or volunteering). The objective of this research is to investigate the effects of VR on empathy, guilt, responsibility, and donation of time and money in the social marketing context. Supported by the media richness theory (MRT) and the social presence theory (SPT), the results of three experimental studies suggest that content viewed on a VR platform, when compared against a traditional two-dimensional video media platform (VM), increases empathy, increases responsibility, and instigates higher intention to donate money and volunteer time towards a social cause. For socially excluded individuals, VR enhances the level of guilt and social responsibility, ultimately leading to a higher intention to volunteer. Although, this did not manifest for monetary donations. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Anti-immigrant attitudes are not only widespread among Eurosceptic nationalists, but also among people who feel that immigration threatens European values and identity. We therefore assumed that the connection between nationalism and xenophobia can only partially explain the rise of hostile attitudes in the post-2015 period. In two online surveys (N = 1,160), we compared how (a) glorification versus attachment and (b) national versus European identity can predict anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim attitudes in Hungary. In the first study, national and European glorification predicted higher anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim prejudice. However, attachment with Europe predicted positive, while attachment with Hungary predicted negative attitudes towards immigrants. We replicated this pattern in a second study and found that the different predictions of national versus European identities were mediated by attitudes towards the EU. Eurosceptic attitudes were associated with increased hostility towards both immigrants and Muslim people and reflected a perceived contradiction between the interest of the nation and that of the EU. We conclude that for a better understanding of intergroup hostility towards Muslim immigrants in Europe, we need to simultaneously consider the psychological phenomenon of ingroup glorification and the values and norms of the social categories with which people identify. © 2018 The British Psychological Society

AB  - Gamification and serious games are increasingly employed for attitude change purposes. However, they frequently exploit a limited set of game elements, such as points, badges and leaderboards, and scarcely explore the use of more complex elements that make games engaging. In this paper, we focus on game elements from the arcade genre, and their use in serious games for attitude change. In particular, we propose a serious game for mobile devices that employs arcade game elements for attitude change in aviation safety, and we assess its effects with two different studies. The first study compares the immediate effects of the serious game vs. the traditional approach (safety card), showing that the game is more engaging and can improve attitudes towards aircraft emergencies in terms of users’ self-efficacy and perceived vulnerability to the risk. The second study assesses the effects of the serious game when used over time (1-week) in a naturalistic setting, showing that the game can engage users and increase knowledge about correct and wrong behaviors. In both studies, engagement turned out to play a mediating role that we analyze in detail. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Studies on the social role of transport disadvantage have influenced the policy discourse, especially in the developed world. However, the potential of information and communication technologies (ICT) to improve access to opportunities has been rarely explored. In a scenario where disparities exist in both physical proximity and access to ICT, this study aims to analyse the interrelationships between three key areas viz. ICT, social disadvantage, and activity participation behaviour. A time use survey representative of Mumbai's housing disparity was conducted for 1205 individuals. The data showcased the differences in household socio-economic characteristics, individual personal characteristics, ICT use patterns, activity participation, and time allocation patterns. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate exclusionary factors and their interconnectedness. It was found out that ‘social advantage’ had a significant positive relationship with ‘access to ICT’ and ‘farness to services’. The effects of exclusionary factors, along with activity and individual specific variables were tested on activity participation and time allocation behaviour using type II Tobit models. Finally, marginal effects of ‘access to ICT’ and ‘farness to services’ on activity participation and time allocation behaviour were estimated. The findings suggested that an increase in access to ICT increased in-home leisure participation and travel time allocation. However, no significant positive relationship was established between access to ICT and in-home mandatory activities. Policy implications of the findings were discussed highlighting the importance of an integrated framework to improve both physical access and the access to ICT to tackle the issue of social exclusion. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purposes of this study were to investigate the influence of social norms on intentions to intervene in dating violence situations and, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, to examine whether these effects were mediated by attitudes, perceived behavioral control/self-efficacy, and subjective social norms. Method: College student participants were exposed to independent manipulations of descriptive norms (i.e., whether helping victims of dating violence is common) and injunctive norms (i.e., whether helping victims of dating violence is approved of) and then completed measures of attitudes toward helping, perceived behavioral control/self-efficacy regarding helping, subjective social norms regarding helping, and intentions to help. Results: Elevating descriptive norms caused greater helping intentions, and this effect was mediated by more positive attitudes, perceived behavioral control/efficacy, and subjective norms regarding helping. Conclusions: These results represent the first causal evidence suggesting that descriptive social norms motivate people to help victims of dating violence. Furthermore, results suggest that they do so by causing people to evaluate helping behaviors more positively, believe that similar others help, and feel more confident in their ability to help. These findings suggest that the Theory of Planned Behavior is a useful framework for understanding social influence in the context of dating violence, and that dating violence interventions may benefit from manipulating descriptive social norms. © 2017 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Background and aim: Communication with healthcare professionals is challenging for those with hearing loss. This study aimed to determine the impact dedicated deaf awareness training could have on medical student's attitudes to and knowledge of deafness, and to explore ways of incorporating deaf awareness training into the core undergraduate medical curriculum. Methods: A validated questionnaire was used to measure attitudes to and knowledge of deafness in those taking an optional deaf awareness and basic sign language module for second year medical students compared to students who took another module. Previous students on this module were also contacted and asked to complete the same questionnaire. Focus groups with these students explored ways to incorporate deaf awareness training into the core undergraduate medical curriculum. Results: After completing the module, students had a more positive attitude to deaf individuals (p < 0.001), and higher knowledge scores (p = 0.027) in comparison to the control group. Examination of data revealed a significant negative association between years since undertaking the module and attitudes score (r = - 0.29, p = 0.04, n = 51), with no significant association for knowledge score (r = 0.22, p = 0.11, n = 52). Focus groups suggested integrating deaf awareness training into existing undergraduate communication skills teaching, with the inclusion of deaf tutors. Conclusions: This study indicates that incorporating a specialist module on deafness can improve attitudes to and knowledge of deafness. Importantly, this effect decreases over time, demonstrating the need for refresher training amongst junior doctors. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: HIV/AIDS has emerged as a serious public health issue across the globe, and particularly in developing countries. Comprehensive knowledge and positive attitudes are cornerstones for the prevention, control and treatment of HIV/AIDS. However, there are various misconceptions associated with HIV/AIDS transmission, which lead to negative attitudes towards people living with AIDS. The present study aims to explore the effects of these determinants, related to socio-demographic characteristics and autonomy, on women's overall knowledge and attitudes regarding HIV/AIDS in Pakistan. Methods: Secondary data analysis was carried out using the national representative dataset of the 2012-13 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey. A series of questions related to HIV/AIDS was asked of 13,558 ever-married women aged 15-49 years to assess respondents' knowledge regarding modes of HIV/AIDS transmission and preventative measures, as well as their attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were used to identify associations with socio-demographic and autonomy-related variables. Furthermore, bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between multiple factors and overall HIV/AIDS knowledge as well as attitudes towards people living with AIDS. Results: The results show that only 42% of Pakistani women have heard about HIV/AIDS. Amongst these women, the majority (68%) have good overall knowledge of HIV/AIDS and more than 55% have positive attitudes towards people living with AIDS. Furthermore, women residing in urban areas, having at least secondary-level education, with high autonomy, belonging to the richest wealth quintile and having exposure to mass media had high overall knowledge and positive attitudes towards people living with AIDS. Conclusion: The findings of this research support the relevance of women's autonomy, education and exposure to mass media, particularly in rural areas of Pakistan, to address the lack of knowledge and eliminate various myths and stigmatisation of people living with HIV/AIDS. Furthermore, it reveals a need to increase focused and targeted interventions to enhance women's knowledge and positive attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS. In this regard, the media can play a proactive role to gauge wider audience in creating awareness and eradicating the myths and misconceptions regarding HIV/AIDS. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Tobacco industry denormalization (TID) seeks to expose the industry’s misconducts. Research on TID beliefs, meaning negative attitudes toward the tobacco industry (TI), may inform TID programs, but was limited to western populations. We investigated TID beliefs and their association with smoking and sociodemographic characteristics in Hong Kong adolescents. Methods: In a school-based cross-sectional survey of 14214 students (mean age 15.0 years, 51.5% boys), TID beliefs were assessed by two questions: (1) whether the TI was respectable and (2) whether the TI tried to get youth to smoke, each with four options from “definitely no” to “definitely yes.” Smoking susceptibility and behaviors were also assessed. Sociodemographic characteristics included age, sex, perceived family affluence, highest parental education, numbers of co-residing smokers, and school-level smoking prevalence. Results: Of all students, 77.6% considered theTI not respectable and 56.6% believed that theTI tried to get youth to smoke. StrongerTID beliefs were inversely associated with smoking susceptibility and behaviors. For example, students considering the TI definitely not respectable (vs. definitely yes) were 56% (95% confidence intervals [CI] = 45% to 66%), 49% (95% CI = 41% to 56%), and 53% (95% CI = 36% to 65%) less likely to be susceptible to smoking (among never-smokers) and be ever- and current smokers, respectively. Of all correlates examined, only younger age and having no co-residing smoker were associated withTID beliefs. Conclusions: Substantial proportions of Hong Kong adolescents did not holdTID beliefs, but those who did were less likely to smoke. Our results suggest thatTID programs may help reduce adolescent smoking. Implications:TheTI’s misconducts and responsibility for the tobacco epidemic were not well known by Hong Kong adolescents.TID beliefs in this population were inversely associated with smoking. These findings suggest that TID programs in local adolescents may be of value. The investigation into the correlates of TID beliefs found that socioeconomic status and school-level smoking prevalence were not associated with TID beliefs. This suggests that local TID programs targeting adolescents in general, for example, mass-media campaigns, may be more appropriate than those targeting particular schools or selected groups of adolescents. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The 20th and 21st centuries have been marked by a number of traumatic events: With the two World Wars, Korean War and, especially in the last twenty-five years, with conflicts in the Middle East and in Africa, as well as others, vast numbers of people have been displaced and have had to journey far and wide to find not only a new home but a safe haven from the atrocities of war. While discrimination against newcomers to a country, prejudice, racism, nationalism, religious fundamentalism, and authoritarian dictatorships are not new phenomena, what makes the recent reactions to the current worldwide human influxes different is the use of language manipulation, propaganda and hate speech via social media to re-stigmatize and re-traumatize the new refugees, asylumseekers, immigrants and migrants. Social media platforms give everyone the opportunity to express their views, whether positive or negative, about anyone who could be considered the other. Both right-wing and left-wing parties and governments also see the usefulness of using the manipulation of the labels given to newcomers and inciting fear of them for their own agendas. In this paper we will investigate how the use of linguistic labels and stereotyping about the other contribute to the rise of hate speech worldwide and how the presence of hate speech about the newcomers has re-traumatized many refugees who had thought they had reached a safe haven after fleeing the source of their original trauma. For the purpose of this study, we will be using data that primarily refers to Italy and Poland, as well as some other examples. © 2019 Estonian Academy Publishers. All rights reserved.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper describes the author’s practical experiences regarding implementation of the RFID system and integration of middleware RFID software with library management software. Findings: From the present study, it was found that the library staff are having a positive attitude toward embracing RFID technology in their library. The present implementation of RFID technology in the studies area gives a clear picture about integrating a third-party software/tool like RFID to the existing systems and how the new system has helped the library to provide better service to their users Research limitations/implications: There were some teething problems at the start between the Koha ILMS SIP2 software and the RFID system. The main issue faced while integration was with setting up the hostname, integrating the instance (i.e. database) and with setting up the port. Practical implications: This paper will help librarians to implement RFID technology in a practical way to their libraries. The author implemented Koha ILMS with RFID system at the Central Library, Fakiragram College within 1 month and the author migrated data from common communication format (CCF) format to MARC 21 formats. CCF is basically used in SOUL 2.0 developed by INFLIBNET. Originality/value: This study discusses issues and possible solutions in the process of implementing RFID applications for two innovative applications in library services. This will influence library professionals to learn Koha ILMS and RFID technology implement it in their libraries. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: We evaluate the reliability and feasibility of weight-adapted ultra-low-dose pancreatic perfusion CT. Methods: A total of 100 (47 men, 53 women) patients were enrolled prospectively and were assigned to five groups (A, B, C, D, and E) with different combination of tube voltage and tube current according to their body weight. Radiation dose parameters including volume CT dose index (CTDI) and dose-length product (DLP) were recorded. Image quality was evaluated both subjectively and objectively (noise, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio). Perfusion parameters including blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), and permeability (PMB) were measured. The dose, image quality measurements, and perfusion parameters were compared between the five groups using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Radiation dose reached 8.7 mSv in patients under 50 kg and was 18.9 mSv in patients above 80 kg. The mean subjective image quality score was above 4.45 on a 5-point scale with good agreement between two radiologists. Groups A–D had equivalent performance on objective image quality (P > 0.05), while Group E performed even better (P < 0.05). No significant differences emerged in comparison with perfusion parameters (BF, BV, PMB) of normal pancreas parenchyma between the five groups. Conclusion: Weight-adapted ultra-low-dose pancreatic perfusion CT can effectively reduce radiation dose without prejudice to image quality, and the perfusion parameters of normal parenchyma are accurate and reliable. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Peer victimization is associated with increased risk for depression, as well as increased neural response to social exclusion in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the amygdala. Altered functional connectivity (FxC) of fronto-limbic circuitry is associated with risk for various affective disorders. The present study examined the relationship between fronto-limbic FxC during social exclusion, prior peer victimization experience and depressive symptoms. Methods: Three mutually exclusive groups were formed: peer victimized (with a history of peer victimization), defenders (history of defending peers), and controls (no prior peer victimization experience) (n = 15/group; Mage = 17.7 years). Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data were collected while participants completed the Cyberball paradigm (simulating the experience of social exclusion). FxC between the Medial Prefrontal Cortex (MPFC), ACC, right insula and left amygdala, was compared between groups and examined in relation to depressive symptoms. Results: Prior peer victimization experience was associated with differences in fronto-limbic FxC across social inclusion and exclusion. Defenders displayed distinct shifts in FxC across the transition from being included to excluded. Peer victimized individuals exhibited a unique pattern of amygdala-specific FxC during inclusive interaction with peers, and in the continuous FxC across inclusion and exclusion. FxC of the MPFC-amygdala across inclusion and exclusion moderated the relationship between peer victimization and depressive symptoms. Limitations: Small sample size and cross-sectional design limit interpretation of the findings. Conclusions: Peer victimized individuals who exhibit continuous positive FxC of the MPFC-left amygdala across inclusion and exclusion may be at greater risk for depressive symptoms. © 2019

AB  - This study uses data from two independent surveys of three communities in Colorado and Wyoming in 1997 and 2012 and examines how environmental attitudes and beliefs (as measured by the New Environmental Paradigm Scale) are related to support for a range of environmental policies and self-reported environmental actions. Results of structural equation modeling show that policy support mediates the influences of the NEP on environmental action, compatible with the value-belief-norm theory. In addition, this study finds a weaker relationship between policy support and environmental action in 2012 than 1997, indicating that environmental beliefs play an increasingly weaker role over time in the decision of individuals to engage in environmental actions. Community comparisons suggest that recycling infrastructure may be a significant facilitator for environmental actions. © 2019, AESS.

AB  - Although research has shown that school context has consequences for intergroup attitudes, few studies have examined the role of teacher qualities, such as teacher support. In addition, previous research has paid limited attention to the mechanisms that could help to explain teacher effects. This 5-wave study (2010–2015) examined the effects of perceived teacher support on the anti-immigrant attitudes of Swedish majority youth (N = 671, M age = 13.41, 50.2% girls, 34 classrooms). It also tested whether social trust would mediate these effects. The results of multilevel analyses showed that perceived teacher support was associated with less prejudice at all levels of analysis. At the within-person level, fluctuations in teacher support were related to fluctuations in youth prejudice: in years when, on average, adolescents perceived their teachers as more supportive, they reported lower prejudice. At the between-person level, adolescents who perceived their teachers as more supportive compared to their peers reported lower prejudice. Similarly, classrooms where students shared an experience of teacher support were lower in prejudice than classrooms with weaker teacher support. The results also showed that social trust explained teacher effects: adolescents who experienced their teachers as more supportive displayed higher levels of trust and, in turn, lower levels of prejudice than youth with less supportive teachers. These findings suggest that teachers can counteract the development of prejudice and facilitate social trust in adolescents by being supportive of them. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Three studies examined effects of social exclusion on reactions to receiving an unexpected gift. Trait Psychological Entitlement was also measured as a potential moderator in all studies. In Study 1, participants wrote about a time they felt rejected, accepted, or something neutral. Compared to the control condition, social exclusion increased self-reported gratitude and observer-rated gratitude. These effects were found among people scoring low on narcissistic entitlement. For these participants also, social rejection increased perception of the benefactor’s warmth, and this increase in perceived warmth mediated the increase in gratitude. Study 2 measured trait need to belong (rather than manipulating it via social rejection) and found similar results: participants low in trait entitlement and high in trait need to belong had higher levels of gratitude than those low in trait need to belong. In Study 3 some participants underwent a peer rejection manipulation. Upon receiving a gift, rejected participants low in entitlement were more grateful (according to self and observer ratings) and engaged in more prosocial behavior than nonrejected participants. The main conclusion is that, among people low in entitlement, social rejection stimulates a heightened desire for social connection, which moves them to functionally project warm intentions onto a benefactor, which in turn makes them more grateful. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - While the Internet offers many opportunities to access information, training and communication, it has created new grounds for risks, threats and harm. With the rise of populism and extremism, new forms of cyberbullying emerge, more specifically cyberhate. The Internet has become a privileged tool to disseminate hatred, based on racism, xenophobia, bigotry, and islamophobia. Organized groups use the internet as a dissemination tool for their ideas, to build collective identity and to recruit young people. The presence of these groups has been facilitated worldwide thanks to technology. Yet, little attention has been granted to the way the Internet eases the activities of individuals who promote and propagate hate online. The role they play in spreading racism, xenophobia and bigotry is paramount as they regularly comment online about news and events, interacting with like-minded people with impunity because the web prevents people from being easily identified or controlled. While literature on exposure to hateful contents and cyberhate victimization is growing, little is known about who the perpetrators really are. A survey with young people aged 12–20 (N = 1,889) was completed in France and forms the basis of this article. It provides an understanding of the characteristics and associated variables of cyberhate perpetration. The Structural Equation model shows that cyberhate perpetration is heavily related to time spent online, victimization, belonging to a deviant youth group, positive attitudes toward violence and racism. Results from the SEM further suggest that people who suffered from online victimization will themselves have a greater tendency to belong to deviant youth groups. Multiple mediation analysis further suggests that trust in institutions may however prevent young people from belonging to a deviant youth group and decrease positive attitudes toward violence, thus diminishing the tendency to perform hateful aggression. © Copyright © 2019 Blaya and Audrin.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to explore the use of an appeal, belonging and commitment social marketing intervention to rescue a failing corporate “charity of the year” exercise that involved a mental disability charity. It describes the improvements experienced consequent to the introduction of volunteer “charity ambassadors” (CAs) appointed to champion the charity’s cause. Design/methodology/approach: The study revolved around company employees’ responses to an open-ended question concerning their attitudes towards people with mental disabilities. A semi-automated qualitative research technique (structural topic modelling [STM]) was used to analyse the replies both pre- and post-intervention. Regression analyses were undertaken to explain whether employees’ replies to the question fell in specific categories. Findings: The intervention was successful. Employees’ attitudes regarding mentally impaired people shifted substantially away from fear and towards feelings of benevolence and compassion. Employees’ financial donations to the charity increased significantly consequent to the intervention. Levels of benevolence and compassion depended significantly on participants’ prior exposure to people with mental disabilities, gender and degree of involvement in activities associated with the intervention. Research limitations/implications: Stakeholders other than employees were not sampled. Open-ended responses to a single question can oversimplify complex issues. Practical implications: Outcomes to the research demonstrate how CAs can induce positive attitudes and behaviour towards an “unpopular cause”. Originality/value: The results highlight some of the problems attached to corporate sponsorship of unpopular causes. A relatively recently developed open-ended qualitative research technique, STM, was used to examine employees’ attitudes. Classifications of findings emerged from the data and did not depend on a predetermined coding scheme. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In South Africa, HIV-positive women receiving antiretroviral therapy often are lost to care postpartum; strategies to support long-term engagement are needed. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are emerging as a possible solution for supporting long-term engagement in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV care continuum. In order to explore acceptability and feasibility of mobile health (mHealth) interventions in this context, we conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) to assess trends in smartphone usage in postpartum women. In six FGDs, we interviewed 27 HIV-positive, postpartum women who attended regular care at the Gugulethu Community Health Centre in Cape Town, South Africa, and who use a smartphone. Questions assessed the respondent’s general trends in smartphone use, as well as their exposure to and perceptions of mHealth interventions. We found little turnover in phones and phone numbers, and about half the participants shared their devices with family and friends. Respondents reported high familiarity with smartphone applications, including WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, with WhatsApp as their preferred method of smartphone communication. Data bundles were most often used to connect to the internet, motivated by the perception that data bundles last longer and are cheaper than airtime, but respondents were adept at locating Wi-Fi sources at work or other public spaces. Nearly all participants were familiar with MomConnect, a national mHealth text support service in South Africa, and most described it positively. Respondents expressed interest in future HIV mHealth applications including complementary health information on physical activity, nutrition, mental health and basic social services. Participants were active and engaged smartphone users with reliable internet connections and a positive attitude towards mHealth platforms. Future mHealth interventions show promise in this population. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objective: Based on social cognitive theory, this study has three objectives: i) identify receivers’ attitudes regarding the decision to read or delete a message sent via e-mail; ii) discuss the perceived intrusiveness in the intentions of receivers to respond to the appeals of the message; and iii) identify cognitive factors that predict receivers’ intention, after deciding to read, toward compliance with an e-mail appeal. Methodology: It is quantitative, cross-sectional research with students from a higher education institution, in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. The data were interpreted through three analyses: structural equation modeling, Probit and cross-frequency. Originality / relevance: This research advances the exploratory study of Wilson et al. (2015) by analyzing the attitudes of email recipients based on permission, in addition to considering the perceived intrusive aspect. Results: Evidence show that, although half of the respondents chose to read the e-mail message, their perception of little utility, relevance, and familiarity with the subject may have contributed to negative attitudes towards e-mail. This perception may be interfering with the respondents’ social cognitive factors, preventing them from changing and maintaining new attitudes, especially in regions with low per capita income. Theoretical contributions: The focus of downstream social marketing lies in changing individual behaviour, therefore, reliance on communication strategy is based on sending a social marketing message via e-mail only and may limit its effectiveness to change behaviour, especially to help people in other continents. Management contributions: Results can also act as contributory factors for the formulation of more effective social marketing strategic actions to instigate new attitudes and behaviours, regarding the help of strangers. © 2020 Journal of Nanjing Agricultural University.

AB  - Approval in public opinion polling is an important resource for prime ministers in contemporary Japanese politics. Though it is widely agreed that cabinet approval ratings increased in political significance after the electoral reform and the restructuring of government agencies, little attention has been paid to the fact that public opinion polling in the mass media also experienced a transformation during the same period. This article surveys the history of public opinion polling since 1945. It argues that changes in survey methodology enabled newspapers to conduct and report opinion polling quickly and frequently, which has strengthened the link between approval ratings and ongoing political processes. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - In contemporary democracies, a political party typically needs good press to attract voters. A glum scenario for a party would be that news media systematically stigmatize it. To what extent does stigmatization lower its electoral support? This article examines voters' reactions to news media coverage of the Dutch party PVV. Using a media content analysis linked to a 2014 panel survey of a sample representative of the Dutch electorate, we find that, among voters who held anti-immigrant attitudes, exposure to stigmatization lowered these voters' perceived legitimacy of the PVV. This, in turn, decreased their propensity to vote for that party. This suggests that stigmatization can be a strong tool in the hands of those who intend to damage a party. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - This study examined the relationship between motivations attributed to having a Turkish identity and intergroup attitudes in Turkey. The study dealt with the intergroup attitudes towards the Kurds, Europeans, and Syrian refugees in terms of in-group favoritism and perception of threat or conflict Social identity motivations attributed to having a Turkish identity were self-esteem, distinctiveness, belonging, continuity, and efficacy. One hundred and fifty seven university students participated in the study. They completed the measures of social identity motivations attributed to having a Turkish identity (5), perceived conflict with the Kurds, perceived threat with the Europeans, threat scale for the Syrian refugees, and 2-items for the evaluations of in-and out-groups. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that self-es-teem and belonging predicted in-group favoritism while belonging and distinctiveness predicted perceived conflict for the Kurds. The self-esteem predicted in-group favoritism and belonging predicted perceived threat for the Europeans. The self-esteem and belonging predicted in-group favoritism and distinctiveness predicted perceived threat for the Syrian refugees. According to the mediation analysis, perceived conflict mediated the relationship between belonging and in-group favoritism for the Kurds. The results were discussed regarding the relevant literature and context of the study. © 2019 Turkish Psychological Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Although contemporary health care involves complex interactions among clinicians of varying professions, opportunities to learn together are relatively few. The authors assessed participants' views about the educational value of learning with colleagues of mixed health care professions in communication and relational skills training focused on challenging conversations. Methods: Between 2010 and 2013, 783 participants enrolled in 46 workshops hosted by the Institute for Professionalism and Ethical Practice at Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, USA. Participants received pre-, post-, and 3-month follow-up questionnaires with quantitative and qualitative questions about their experiences learning with clinicians of varying professions ("interprofessional learning"). Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to compare participant groups. Responses to open-ended questions were coded according to standard principles of content analysis. Results: Seven hundred twenty-two (92%) participants completed surveys. Previous interprofessional learning was reported by 60% of respondents, but generally comprised <30% of their education. Clinicians with <3 years of work experience were least likely to have previous interprofessional learning. Nearly all (96%) participants reported interprofessional colleagues contributed valuably to their learning. Asked specifically what they learned, participants described five themes: Stronger Teamwork, Patient-Centered Focus, Specific Communication Skills, Content-Specific Knowledge, and Shared Global Values. After 3 months, 64% of respondents reported that workshop participation helped make their interactions with interprofessional colleagues more collaborative. Discussion: Communication skills training for challenging health care conversations is a valuable opportunity for interprofessional learning and generates sustained positive attitudes about collaboration. Clinicians learn from their colleagues a deeper understanding of each other's professional roles, challenges, and unique contributions; specific communication approaches; and a sense of belonging to a collaborative community reinforcing the patient at the center of care. © 2019 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.

AB  - Objective: In recent years, Vietnam has been recorded as one of the most endemic areas of dengue fever (DF). Thus, controlling DF has become a matter of concern to healthcare professionals and the government. Nevertheless, there has been little research exploring inhabitants' awareness about DF in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The aims of the study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding DF by the population in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Methods: In July 2018, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,175 people in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, using an administered questionnaire. Results: Only 38% of participants had good knowledge, and 55% of the population reached the satisfactory practices score, while 74% showed positive attitudes relating to DF. Unlike many other studies, education level was not associated with KAP score. However, marital status and monthly income seemed to be related to participants' knowledge levels. In addition, the main sources of information in this research were television and the Internet. Conclusions: This study showed that participants lacked knowledge regarding DF and practices to prevent it. These results recommend improving the population's knowledge andpractices through campaigns aimed at preventing breeding of mosquitoes.

AB  - Despite extensive social science research into public perceptions and social responses to fracking, scholars have only begun to examine the relationship between distance to development and support or opposition for it. Importantly, the emerging studies are exclusively from the United States, and focus on communities and regions in which fracking already exists-in contrast to areas where it is proposed and still going through planning approvals. This paper reports public responses to proposed fracking in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom. A total of 120 people participated in an in-person survey with a qualitative follow-up in four locations: The village right next to the development site, two other villages just inside and just outside the wider fracking concession area, and in the capital city of Belfast, 150 km away. A clear spatial pattern of opinion was found, from almost universal opposition to fracking next to the site, to an even three-way split between proponents, opponents and 'neutrals' to fracking in general, in Belfast. Results show that some risks are perceived to be more local than others, whilst perceived (economic) benefits are recognised mainly at the national level. Content analysis of local and national newspapers revealed a very clear and similar pattern. Connections to Fermanagh, through visits or long-Term residence, were also clear predictors of opposition to fracking. The spatial pattern of support for fracking in Northern Ireland differs substantially from each of the contrasting patterns observed in the United States. We discuss likely reasons for this and implications for both research and policy. © 2019 Kerrie Craig et al., published by Sciendo 2019.

AB  - This study examined exposure to three types of e-cigarette marketing—sponsored advertisements, brand pages, and user-created groups—on social networking sites and their influence on health-related outcomes. Results (N = 1,016) indicated that e-cigarette users who joined user-created groups had significantly more negative attitudes toward quitting and lower behavioral control, intention to quit, and self-efficacy than those who were exposed to sponsored advertisements or who followed brand pages. Exposure to two or more types of marketing had an additive effect on health-related outcomes. Social identification, attention to social comparison, and subjective norms also moderated between exposure to e-cigarette marketing and key dependent measures. © 2019, World Advertising Research Center.

AB  - Objectives This study used thematic content analysis to examine submissions to a youth mental health website, www.itsoktotalk.in, in India. Setting We considered submissions made to the It's OK to Talk web platform during the first year of its operation (April 2017-March 2018), focusing specifically on website users based in India. Participants We analysed 37 submissions by 33 authors aged 19-31 years (mean age 22 years) from seven Indian cities (New Delhi, Lucknow, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad and Haryana). Eligible submissions were English-language first-person accounts of self-identified mental health problems, submitted in any media format for online publication by authors aged 18 years or older and who were based in India. Eight study participants were additionally involved in a focus group who contributed to the coding process and preparation of the final manuscript. Results Four themes were identified: (1) living through difficulties; (2) mental health in context; (3) managing one's mental health and (4) breaking stigma and sharing hope. Overall, the participants expressed significant feelings of distress and hopelessness as a result of their mental health problems; many described the context of their difficulties as resulting from personal histories or wider societal factors; a general lack of understanding about mental health; and widespread stigma and other negative attitudes. Most participants expressed a desire to overcome mental health prejudice and discrimination. Conclusions Personal narratives offer a window into young people's self-identified priorities and challenges related to mental health problems and recovery. Such insights can inform antistigma initiatives and other public awareness activities around youth mental health. © 2019 BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

AB  - ICT has brought many challenges and opportunities and influenced the world like no other invention in the recent past. The field of education has also got greatly influenced by ICTs, which certainly altered whole education process. Hence, teacher educators are required to have positive attitude along with adequate knowledge and use of ICT tools and devices in educational process in case they wish to utilize current techniques and technologies effectively for prospective teachers. The purpose of this study is to investigate the attitude of teacher-educators towards the use of ICT along with knowledge and levels of ICT tools and devices usage among teacher-educators in teaching training colleges. A self-prepared interview guide was used in the present study. A purposive sampling technique was employed in the selection of the sample of as many as 50 teacher-educators working in different teacher-training colleges in the State of Haryana, India. The findings of the study revealed that the teacher-educators have positive attitude to some extent towards the ICT and its tools and devices usage in teacher education process. The present finding discloses that teacher-educators have lack of training and technical support. The current study also exhibits that teacher-educators also have some anxiety towards using ICT tools and devices during teaching learning process. As well as teacher-educators are also lacking of motivation and enthusiasm towards the use of ICT tools and devices in teacher-education process. It was found that if ICT-training, technical support, resources of ICTs, motivation, support of management as well as benefits of ICT in education process acquainted to the teacher-educators then they can successfully incorporate ICT in teacher education process. © BEIESP.

AB  - Public attitude surveys are the prime method used to assess public attitudes to science and technology, but can also be very problematic—as evidenced in the number of different polls that come up with different findings. Toward better understanding of what drives public attitudes, it has become more relevant to find out “Why” people think what they do about science and technology than to know “What” they think. Recent research into how values drive attitudes has been very important to our increased understanding. However, in a post-truth, post-trust, post-expert world—where notions of truth, trust, and expertise are now commonly contested—we need to also better understand the social and media environments we are now living in, and how they affect attitudes to new technologies. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Biased transmission of health knowledge has far-reaching effects on information reproduction and health-related cognitions. We examined whether transmissions of different types of disorder and etiological information influence recollections of health knowledge and evaluations of patients, by simulating the digital transmission of information. Transmission chains of four non-interacting persons (i.e., four generations) were formed. The first generation read three vignettes describing fictitious patients with one of three disorders (physiological, psychological, culture-bound) uniquely paired with one of three etiologies (genetic, environmental, unknown etiology). Next, they evaluated patients’ well-being, rated desired social distance, and recalled the vignettes. These written recollections replaced the original vignettes for a second-generation of participants, whose recollections were used for the third generation and so on. The framing of disorders affected recollections of etiology, in which culture-bound framings resulted in the poorest recall of etiologies. Participants also perceived the culture-bound disorder as the least serious but desired the most social distance from patients diagnosed with it, when compared to other disorders. The study showed that health information is selectively attended to and reproduced, possibly affected by perceived self-relevance. Faulty recollections and framing of disorders affect health cognitions, potentially instigating biased transmission of disorder- and patient-related narratives. © 2019 Ganesan et al.

AB  - The political divide between liberals and conservatives has become quite large and stable, and there appear to be many reasons for disagreements on a wide range of issues. The current research sought to explain these divides and to extend the Uncertainty-Threat Model to intergroup relations, which predicts that more dispositional, perceived-threat and uncertainty-avoidance will be related to more political conservatism. Given that conservatism is also often related to more negativity to lowstatus groups such as immigrants, the relationship between political ideology and negative attitudes toward immigrants may be mediated by more threat and uncertaintyavoidance. Study 1 tested this mediational hypothesis in a correlational design and showed that both uncertainty-avoidance and perceived realistic and symbolic threat significantly mediated the relationship between political ideology and attitudes toward immigrants, and that perceived threat was the more influential mediator. Study 2 extended threat management to perceived threats from unspecified outgroups, as opposed to the immigrant outgroup, and it replicated all significant mediations. Study 3 replicated the mediations observed in Studies 1 and 2 for political ideology to attitudes toward immigrants with uncertainty-avoidance and perceived threat from immigrants as mediators; it further replicated the mediations to the negative attitudes measure that had been used in Study 2 and it extended it to an objective and indirect bias measure [i.e., Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP)]. Overall, almost all of the results supported the idea that perceived threat and uncertainty-avoidance both mediate the relationship between political ideology and attitudes toward immigrants, and that threat management, as opposed to negativity bias, may be a central concern separating liberals and conservatives. Within all three studies, we also observed more evidence for the Uncertainty-Threat Model predictions than we did for the alternative Extremity Hypothesis, which predicted a quadratic relationship between political ideology and threat and uncertainty, and between political ideology and attitudes toward immigrants. © 2019 Stewart, Gulzaib and Morris.

AB  - Objectives The Code of Ethics of pharmacy practitioners in Australia recognises the obligation to provide care to patients in a culturally safe and responsive manner. The aim of this exploratory study was to examine how Australian community pharmacists understand and experience the concept of ‘culture’ in their everyday practice environment. Methods Voluntary, semi-structured interviews were conducted at community pharmacy placement sites in South-East Queensland, Australia. Pharmacists were asked to recall an incident that evoked their cultural awareness during the course of their practice. The question stated, verbatim: “We are preparing our students to be pharmacists in a highly multicultural community. Can you think of an incident where you learnt something about another person’s culture or it made you more aware of your own culture? Please briefly describe the incident.” Reportable responses were collected from 59 of the 92 visited pharmacists. These responses were audio-recorded and transcribed. The data were collated and analysed through iterative, reflexive, thematic analysis using constant comparison. Results and significance The responses provided a rich selection of lived experiences within Australian multicultural pharmacy practice, describing professional dilemmas, fears and the strategies employed to overcome practice challenges. Six main response categories were identified: (i) Language/ communication challenges, (ii) Cultural attitudes and behaviours, (iii) Exposure to culture due to pharmacy location, (iv) Religion, gender, and age, (v) Prejudiced/perceived racist attitudes and discrimination towards ‘other’ cultures, (vi) Perceived ‘sameness’ of different cultures. The study has provided valuable insights into community pharmacists’ experiences of culture in their day-to-day professional practice, also highlighting the associated strategies used to maintain a high standard of practice. There is merit in ensuring that the pharmacy curriculum and professional development programs are designed to respond to the ethical obligation of pharmacists to practise in a culturally safe, responsive manner that acknowledges and incorporates the importance of culture, cultural differences and intercultural relations, while addressing culturally unique needs in a skilled and professional manner. © 2019 Fejzic, Barker.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the attitudes of Emirati women aged 30–64 years towards menopause and determine the relationships between these attitudes and their sociodemographic and reproductive characteristics. Study design: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted with 497 Emirati women attending five primary health care centres in Dubai using a multistage stratified and clustered random sampling technique. Emirati women were interviewed face-to-face via a structured questionnaire with two parts: sociodemographic and reproductive characteristics and the attitudes towards menopause scale. Results: The mean ± S.D. of age was 42.06 years ± 8.716 (median 40 years). Mean age at menopause for the study sample (N = 436) was 49.94 years ± 4.593 (median 50 years). Of the respondents, 36.6% had completed high school, and 41.4% had graduated from university. Approximately, 70.8% of the women were premenopausal, 13.1% were perimenopausal and 16.1% were postmenopausal. Sixty-four percent of the respondents had never used oral contraceptive pills, while 32.9% were past users; 44.6% were employed outside the home. Mean average attitudes score ± S.D. was 2.42 ± 0.26 (minimum score of 1 indicates very negative attitudes, maximum score of 4 indicates very positive attitudes). Statistically significant differences in mean average attitudes score were noted for employment and menopausal status, and mean average attitudes score was positively correlated with age. Premenopausal women held more positive attitudes towards menopause than peri- and postmenopausal women. Conclusions: Emirati women displayed neutral to positive attitudes towards menopause and premenopausal women exhibited more negative attitudes towards menopause than postmenopausal women. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - China is expected to become an increasingly important market for global organic food producers. This study aims to obtain a new and deeper understanding of how various antecedents affect organic food purchase behavior. Here, a survey based on validated measures is designed, and a total of 1750 consumers are interviewed. In addition to traditionally held beliefs concerning organic food, three unique perspectives, i.e., that organic foods are "luxuries for the rich", "upscale", and the objects of "marketing hype", are confirmed for the first time. Furthermore, the influence of subjective norms on purchase intention is verified to be completely mediated by purchase attitude, suggesting that up to now, the role of social norms may have been simplified, and even underestimated by marketing researchers. Additionally, for the first time, identity expressiveness is confirmed to play a minor but significant role in purchase intention. Perceived trustworthiness is also confirmed to be the important predictor of purchase intention. Finally, household income is not only the second most important predicator of purchase intention, but it is also the most important predictor of actual purchase. These findings will be valuable for marketing scholars and all stakeholders in the organic food industry, particularly international agribusinesses that are wishing to enter the Chinese market. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Through an experiment, this paper investigates the impact of online page popularity and message valences of user-generated content in social media on pro-Iran visiting attitudes and behavioural intention as well as perceptions of destination risk. Moreover, the mediating role of perceived risk and visiting attitudes in the effect of page popularity and message valences on visiting intention is examined. Six different versions of pro-Iran visiting community Facebook pages with three different message valences and two levels of popularity were created. One hundred twenty participants were randomly exposed to one of the six Facebook pages and then asked to complete a questionnaire that assessed demographic data; visiting attitude; visiting intention; travel risk type; and perceived risk index. The perceived risk index was developed by this study through conducting online open-ended interviews. The findings show that success stories and high popularity lead to more positive attitude, higher level of intention to visit, and lower perceptions of destination risk than failure stories and low popularity. Popularity dampens the negative effect of failure stories on users’ visiting attitudes. Moreover, perceived risk underlies the pathway of page popularity and message valences to individuals’ visiting attitude and intention. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A web-based experiment (n = 960) examined how debunking of publicly shared news on social media affects viewers' attitudes toward the source who shared the fake news, their agreement with the news position, and perceived credibility of social media as a news platform. Exposure to debunking information did not lower participants' agreement with the news position, but led them to derogate (1) the source who shared the misinformation and (2) social media as a news platform. However, participants who initially favored the source were less likely to attribute the sharing of fake news to the source's dispositions, rather than situational factors, thereby maintaining their positive attitudes toward the source. © 2019 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.

AB  - Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) among young suburban people who inject drugs (PWID) is a growing epidemic in the United States, yet little is known about the factors contributing to increased exposure. The goal of this study was to explore and assess HCV knowledge and attitudes about treatment and identify risk behaviors among a cohort of young suburban PWID. Methods: We conducted interviews with New Jersey (NJ) service providers and staff from the state’s five syringe service programs to inform a semistructured survey addressing HCV knowledge, treatment, and risk factors among young suburban PWID. We then used this survey to conduct qualitative interviews with 14 young suburban PWID (median age 26 years) in NJ between April and May 2015. Data were analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach and coded to identify thematic relationships among respondents. Results: Most participants had substantial gaps in several aspects of HCV knowledge. These included: HCV transmission, HCV symptoms, and the availability of new direct-acting antiviral therapy. Participants also downplayed the risk of past and current risk behaviors, such as sharing drug paraphernalia and reusing needles, which also reflected incomplete knowledge regarding these practices. Conclusion: Young suburban PWID are not receiving or retaining accurate and current HCV information. Innovative outreach and prevention messages specifically tailored to young suburban PWID may help to disseminate HCV prevention and treatment information to this population. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Two studies tested whether social exclusion can increase gambling behavior. In Study 1, participants were asked to relive a socially painful instance, a physically painful instance or a control condition and were then presented with a real online gambling device (i.e., a slot machine). The results revealed that participants who relived a socially painful instance played longer on the gambling device. In Study 2, we induced actual feelings of social disconnection and manipulated slot machine anthropomorphization. The results revealed a significant interaction between inclusionary status and anthropomorphism in predicting gambling. More specifically, excluded participants gambled longer when presented with an anthropomorphized slot machine. However, the gambling behavior of excluded and included participants was no different when participants were reminded that slot machines are inanimate objects. Finally, positive and negative game experience mediated the influence of both inclusionary status and anthropomorphism on gambling. Overall, this research identifies another potential vulnerability produced by experiences of social exclusion, namely, gambling behavior. Implications for pathological gambling and future research directions are outlined.

AB  - Introduction: In healthcare, there is ongoing flux in expectations for students and practitioners. Establishing integrated systems of monitoring and evidencing students’ development is imperative. With current trends towards the use of technology in tertiary education, online learning environments (OLEs) could constitute more effective evidencing of student progress in the clinical environment. However, there is little research exploring clinical educators' experiences with implementing technology in clinical education. The research aimed to: Examine clinical educators’ attitudes towards technology and its use in clinical education. Explore clinical educators’ experiences of implementing technologies in a clinical environment. Methods: A mixed methods approach was taken to explore the aims. A previously validated technology attitude survey (TAS) was used with slight modifications, as well as open-ended qualitative responses. These explored clinical educators’ experiences of the implementation of one specific OLE (PebblePad™) in their clinical environments. The survey was sent to clinical educators involved in the supervision of Medical Imaging students on clinical placement. Results: Clinical educators play pivotal roles in students’ professional development and, given current trends in tertiary education, are under increasing pressure to utilise OLEs. This poses particular challenges in clinical environments. Irrespective of the challenges, successful implementation of technology in any environment is dependent on the attitudes of the users. Conclusions: Clinical environments have specific challenges when implementing technology such as access to computers and time constraints on practitioners. Even with positive attitudes towards technology, a change in pedagogical outlook when using technology in clinical teaching is necessary. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - South Africa ranks third among 22 high burden countries in the world. TB which remains a leading cause of death causes one in five adult deaths in South Africa. An in-depth understanding of knowledge, attitudes and practices of young people towards TB is required to implement meaningful interventions. We analysed young men and women (18–24 years)’s TB knowledge including TB/HIV coinfections, testing rates and factors associated with them. A cross sectional cluster-based household survey was conducted in two provinces. Participants completed computer-assisted self-interviews on TB knowledge, testing history and TB/HIV coinfections. A participant was regarded as knowledgeable of TB if s/he correctly answered the WHO-adopted TB knowledge questions. We built three multivariate regression models in Stata 13.0 to assess factors associated with knowing TB alone, testing alone and both knowing and testing for TB. 1955 participants were interviewed (89.9% response rate). Their median age was 20 years (IQR19-22). Sixteen percent (16.2%) of the participants were social grant recipients, 55% were enrolled in a school/college and 5% lived in substandard houses. A total of 72% had knowledge of TB, 21% underwent screening tests for TB and 14.7% knew and tested for TB. Factors associated with TB knowledge were being female, younger, a student, social grant recipient, not transacting sex and having positive attitudes towards people living with HIV (PLWH). Factors associated with TB testing were being a student, receiving a social grant, living in OR Tambo district, HIV knowledge and having a family member with TB history. Factors associated with both TB knowledge and testing were being female, a student, using the print media, living in OR Tambo district and having a family member with a TB history. The study demonstrates the importance of demographic factors (gender, economic status, family TB history, and location) and HIV factors in explaining TB knowledge and testing. We recommend extending community TB testing services to increase testing. © 2019 Shamu et al.

AB  - Consumption of insects has gained interest because it may provide a more sustainable and healthier alternative for conventional meat. However, in Western societies, insect consumption is met with resistance due to negative attitudes based on fear and disgust. To further understand consumers' willingness to try insect meat, a 2 (meat type: bovine vs. insect) × 2 (product type: common vs. uncommon) experiment was conducted (n = 130). Four food choice factors were expected to mediate the effect of meat type and product type on willingness to try: health, sensory appeal, risk perception, and disgust. Results indicate that meat type had no effect on willingness to try. Relative to bovine meat, insect meat was perceived as both healthier and more disgusting, which could explain the absence of a meat type effect. Unexpectedly, use of insects in common products (burgers) as compared to uncommon products (skewers) was met with a lower willingness to try. Also, common products with insect meat was considered to be less healthy and more disgusting, compared to uncommon products with insect meat. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Despite increasing anti-Muslim sentiments, the implications of religious discrimination for Muslim-American adolescents’ well-being remain understudied. Drawing on the rejection identification and disidentification models, we examined the mediating role of multiple group identities (i.e., religious and national) in the cross-sectional associations between individual-level religious discrimination and internalizing and externalizing problems among 13- to 18-year-old (M = 16.7 years, SD = 1.6) Muslim-American adolescents with immigrant backgrounds. Moreover, building on the attributional ambiguity perspective, we examined the moderating role of group-level religious discrimination in the form of Islamophobia. Religious identity did not mediate the relations between individual-level discrimination and internalizing and externalizing problems, and these relations did not depend on youths’ perceptions of Islamophobia. However, individual-level discrimination was associated with American identity, depending on perceptions of Islamophobia. In turn, adolescents’ Muslim and American identities were linked to less internalizing and externalizing problems. Implications of our findings for the development of programs and policies are discussed. © 2019 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - This article adds to the understanding of men’s discursive resistance in relation to gender-equality interventions at work. Using Swedish men forestry professionals as the empirical base, the result shows how discursive resistance were performative acts, part of the construction of the same gender-equality interventions and organizational contexts that they were perceived to describe. In this case, direct opposition to gender equality provided a limited discursive position and sets of logics available in practice. Instead, the possibilities to renegotiate gender-equality interventions as unjust and unnecessary required, we conclude that the industry’s ambition to hire and promote more women was perceived to have led to the use of affirmative action and the disruption of meritocratic principles and that the problems of gender equality were placed in the traditional forestry and among “prejudiced old men,” as oppose to the more “modern” and “women friendly” forestry of today. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Objective Unconscious bias may result in a prejudicial evaluation of another person and lead to unfair treatment. Potential gender bias risk exists in the scoring process on the American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation oral examination (Part II) because of the face-to-face interactions between candidates and examiners. This study was undertaken to determine whether performance on the American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Part II examination differed based on candidate gender or configuration of examiner/candidate gender pairings. The impact of examiner unconscious bias training on candidate performance was also assessed. Design This is a retrospective observational study of first-time Part II physical medicine and rehabilitation certification examination test takers between 2013 and 2018. Results There were significant differences in pass rates (men 84%, women 89%) and mean scaled scores (men 6.56, women 6.81) between men and women (P < 0.001) with the biggest domain score differences in data acquisition and interpersonal and communication skills. Implementation of examiner unconscious bias training did not impact candidate performance. Conclusions Women candidates scored higher and had a higher pass rate than men candidates overall on the American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Part II examination. This difference does not seem to be due to scoring gender bias by the Part II examiners or due to candidate aptitude as measured on the Part I examination. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Introduction: The stigma of epilepsy continues to negatively impact people with epilepsy (PWE) in many Arab Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia. Socioreligious, cultural, and philosophical ideas prevalent in the region may contribute to the underpinnings of stigma toward PWE, but this has not been sufficiently studied. Materials and methods: This study recruited a convenience sample of people without epilepsy from clinic waiting rooms and through social media. Participants completed a questionnaire with questions about demographics, mind–body dualism (MBD), supernatural beliefs (SB), attitudes toward epilepsy (ATE), and religiosity. Results: A total of 210 participants were recruited. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant difference in the mean total ATE scores, indicating better ATE with higher education (p < 0.001). Despite the relatively high level of education and a high proportion of participants with medical training, only slightly more than half rejected the possibility that demonic possession may be a cause of epilepsy. Attitudes toward epilepsy were correlated with MDB and SB but not with religiosity. Mind–body dualism and religiosity correlated significantly with negative attitudes toward PWE (p < 0.05). A linear regression model using ATE as the dependent variable and MDB, SB, and educational level as independent variables significantly predicted ATE (F = 15.6, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.24), although SB dropped out as a predictor of ATE in that model. Another regression used SB as the dependent variable, and MBD, religiosity, and educational level as independent variables were also significant with all three variables predicting SB (F = 64.0, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Mind–body dualism was related to the cognitive process leading to supernatural misconceptions about epilepsy and negative attitudes toward PWE in Saudi Arabia. Although misconceptions that supernatural possession was the cause of epilepsy (justifying treatment by religious healing) and was likely derived from prevalent religious beliefs of the region, religiosity was not associated with negative attitudes toward PWE. The merits and efficacy of an intervention focused on reducing the negative effects of MBD and SB on ATE warrants further investigation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Debates about immigration policy have sparked increasingly negative attitudes toward refugees, particularly those of Muslim identification. Research to date has found that post-immigration prejudice and discrimination, often reinforced at a systemic level, pose an additional psychological burden to refugees. The present study explored associations between cultural humility, moral foundations, political orientation, religious commitment, and xenophobia toward Syrian refugees. Data were collected from adults (N = 996) in the United States during the 2016 presidential election cycle. Cultural humility was positively correlated with openness to immigration and moral foundations of care and fairness, and inversely related to prejudicial attitudes, perceived real and symbolic threat, and moral foundations of loyalty, authority, and purity. Over and above political identification and religiosity, cultural humility was found to be uniquely associated with more positive attitudes toward Syrian refugees. Additionally, the relationship between the moral foundations of care and fairness and positive attitudes toward refugees was mediated by cultural humility. Findings are discussed in light of the biblical mandate within Christianity to welcome foreigners and advocate for the vulnerable, while balancing compassion with wisdom. In addition to approaching psychological care with refugees through the lens of cultural humility, psychologists have a unique opportunity to advocate for this population through systems-level intervention. We discuss ways to cultivate the moral foundations of care and fairness at church and community levels, which may facilitate greater cultural humility. © Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Nowadays to post online review is becoming a common practice. However, apart from limited studies, little is known how online reviews can prejudice subsequent reviews. Our three experimental studies demonstrate that following negative service experiences, reviewers are influenced by earlier posted reviews when writing their own reviews. Exposing reviewers to negative (positive) valence reviews encourages them to write reviews with a higher (lower) intensity level of negative word of mouth (n-wom). Their level of immersion in the earlier posted reviews (i.e., perceived transportation) is the underlying explanatory mechanism behind this relationship. However, this mediating effect is stronger for novice (vs. expert) reviewers. Illuminating the potential influence of online reviews, this research suggests that online reviews should not be embraced literally by consumers and firms but should be utilized judiciously to enhance their service experiences and service quality. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Objective: Although negative news portrayals can influence attitudes and beliefs about immigrants, little is known about how different types of threat narratives influence Americans’ emotions and perceptions of Latino immigrants specifically. This study examines cognitive and emotional responses to Latino threat narratives in the news media. Method: We conducted an online experiment using a posttest-only randomized design to assess participants’ perceptions of Latino immigrants and their emotional responses to threat narratives in news media. Participants (N = 208) were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. In one experimental group, participants (n = 68) read a news story about Latino immigrants as economic threats; in the other, participants (n = 70) read a news article about Latino immigrants as cultural threats. In the control group, participants (n = 70) read an article that did not implicate Latinos as threats. We used ANCOVA to test mean differences in responses to threat narratives across the experimental and control groups. Results: Participants who read the story about a Latino economic threat reported more intense negative emotions and significantly higher levels of perceived realistic threats from Latino immigrants than participants in the control group. Participants who read the article discussing a Latino cultural threat reported more intense positive emotions and significantly higher levels of perceived symbolic threats from Latino immigrants than the control group. Conclusions: Findings suggest that different types of Latino threat narratives have distinct influences on individuals’ emotions and threat perceptions of Latino immigrants. Implications for social work practice are discussed. © 2019 by the Society for Social Work and Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To explore the attitude of health care providers about screening for and dealing with domestic violence in the health care setting and to assess the physicians screening behavior. Methods: We surveyed physicians and nurses working in different departments of Assiut University Hospital using a self-administered questionnaire. Two focus group discussions with physicians and nurses were also conducted. Results: 44.3% and 46.5% of physicians and nurses mentioned time constraints as a barrier for DV screening. Physicians believed that it is not important to screen for DV because it is a socially accepted problem and because of the unavailability of the necessary referrals to help victims (30.2% and 20.0%, respectively). The unsuitability of the outpatient clinics to screen for DV was also mentioned by 65.6% and 75.5% of physicians and nurses respectively. Only 36.7% of physicians perceived having the communication skills to facilitate disclosure of DV exposure. Regarding practice, only 35.0% of physicians have screened for DV in the three months preceding data collection. Urban residence, perception of the negative health consequence of DV exposure and perception of the physicians to have the required communication skills predicted positive attitude towards DV screening, while feeling distressed to discuss exposure to DV was associated with negative physicians’ attitude. Conclusion: In-service training of health care providers to identify and manage victims of DV and establishing supportive system would have great implications for reducing the physical and mental negative consequences of DV exposure. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this qualitative study was to explore the perspectives of school and preparedness officials on the feasibility of implementing a range of social distancing practices to reduce influenza transmission during a pandemic. In the summer of 2017, we conducted 36 focus groups by teleconference and webinar lasting 90 min with school and preparedness stakeholders from across the United States. We identified and characterized 11 themes arising from the focus group protocol's domains as well as unanticipated emergent themes. These themes were: the need for effective stakeholder communication, the importance of partnering for buy-in, the role of social distancing in heightening anxiety, ensuring student safety, how practices work in combination, challenges with enforcement, lack of funding for school nurses, differing views about schools' role in protecting public health, the need for education and community engagement to ensure consistent implementation, the need for collaborative decision-making, and tension between standardizing public health guidance and adapting to local contexts. Addressing several crosscutting considerations can increase the likelihood that social distancing practices will be feasible and acceptable to school stakeholders. © 2019

AB  - Despite the importance of examining how adolescents and young adults contribute solutions to society's pressing problems, gaps in the literature leave unanswered the question of how young people become politically engaged. Research suggests that youth learn to be political by forming attachments to their communities and accessing opportunities in the settings of their everyday lives. Settings operate as mini-polities through which youth develop a sense of what it means to be a member of a collective. Meaningful opportunities to practice political skills and behaviors can be fostered in schools and communities, via social media, and through policy change. Historic events, particularly elections, can also influence political attitudes and behaviors in lasting ways. Cultural and contextual variability in experiences, access to opportunities, and reactions to historic events shape youth's political developmental pathways. Research that is developmentally and culturally informed and that uses rigorous study designs can identify more effectively what determines the formation and growth of youth political engagement. © 2019 Society for Research in Child Development

AB  - Objectif: Informer les fournisseurs canadiens de soins de santé périnatale des critères diagnostiques de la microcéphalie fœtale et fournir l'information sur les analyses pertinentes, le pronostic, et la prise en charge prénatale et périnatale en lien avec a cette observation prénatale. Destinataires: Tous les fournisseurs de soins de maternité (fournisseurs principaux de soins de santé)et de soins de pédiatrie; les conseiller(e)s en génétique; les infirmièr(e)s en soins de maternité; les infirmièr(e)s practicien(ne)s, les administrateur(trice)s provinciaux de soins de maternité; les étudiant(e)s, en médecine; les résident(e)s postdoctoraux et les stagiaires (fellows). Résultats: Fournir de meilleurs conseils et une prise en charge clinique adéquate aux femmes et aux familles qui ont reçu un diagnostic prénatal de microcéphalie fœtale. Données probantes: La documentation publiée est tirée de recherches effectuées en 2018 dans le moteur PubMed et les bases de données Medline, CINAHL et Cochrane Library au moyen de mots-clés anglais pertinents (prenatal ultrasound, prenatal imaging, fetal, antenatal ou prenatal microcephaly). Des publications supplémentaires ont été sélectionnées à partir des notices bibliographiques de ces articles. Période de recherche: Sept ans (2010-2018); la dernière recherche a été effectuée le 19 avril 2018. L'auteur principal a terminé la validation des articles. Avantages, préjudices et coûts: Le présent document renseigne les lecteurs au sujet (1)des critères diagnostiques de la microcéphalie fœtale, (2)de ses étiologies potentielles et (3)des analyses et options de prise en charge avant et après la naissance. Il propose une méthode fondée sur des données probantes pour établir le diagnostic et déterminer la prise en charge de la microcéphalie détectée avant la naissance. Ces recommandations sont fondées sur l'opinion d'experts, mais n'ont pas fait l'objet d'une évaluation économique de la santé. Une mise en œuvre aux échelles locale ou provinciale sera requise. Les auteurs reconnaissent que l'accès aux services et ressources mentionnés varie au Canada. Par conséquent, ces recommandations ont été formulées dans la perspective de promouvoir l'accès et de fournir une orientation pour toutes les provinces et tous les territoires du pays. Critères: La solidité des données probantes indiquées s'appuie sur les critères décrits dans le rapport du Groupe d’étude canadien sur les soins de santé préventifs. Recommandations: 1 Quand une microcéphalie fœtale est soupçonnée, la patiente doit être orientée rapidement vers une unité tertiaire d’échographie afin d'effectuer une évaluation approfondie et d'optimiser les options de prise en charge clinique (II-2A). 2 Dès que la microcéphalie est confirmée après avoir déterminé que la mesure du périmètre crânien est inférieure ou égale à trois (3)écarts types (déviations standards, DS)sous la moyenne, un examen morphologique fœtal détaillé et approfondi devrait être effectué et se concentrer sur l'anatomie cérébrale et les signes extracérébraux associés à une infection congénitale, aux expositions potentielles à des agents tératogènes, ou aux possibles anomalies chromosomiques possibles ou conditions monogéniques (II-2A). 3 Lorsqu'une microcéphalie fœtale est identifiée, la femme enceinte devrait avoir rapidement accès à une consultation auprès de spécialistes en médecine fœto-maternelle et en génétique médicale, idéalement au sein d'un milieu multidisciplinaire (III-A). 4 L’évaluation de la grossesse avec microcéphalie fœtale devrait s'appuyer sur les éléments suivants: a une évaluation de la santé maternelle et la documentation de possibles conditions maternelles associées à une faible croissance cérébrale fœtale (par exemple la phénylcétonurie)(II-2A); b un questionnaire détaillé des expositions potentielles à des agents tératogènes et environnementaux (II-2A); c les antécédents familiaux détaillés et une évaluation du périmètre crânien des parents (III-A); d l’évaluation des causes infectieuses potentielles (II-2A); e une discussion sur les analyses supplémentaires potentielles, notamment les analyses monogéniques ou chromosomiques, lorsqu'elles sont indiquées sur le plan clinique (III-B). 5 Lorsqu'une microcéphalie fœtale est détectée à l'échographie, une imagerie par résonance magnétique du fœtale lorsqu'elle est accessible et si les observations potentielles sont susceptibles d'avoir des répercussions sur la prise en charge de la grossesse. Les données de l'imagerie par résonance magnétique fœtale devraient être révisées par un radiologiste ayant une expertise dans ce domaine (III-A). 6 Lors de l'évolution d'une grossesse avec microcéphalie fœtale, un examen échographique doit être répété de manière périodique afin d’évaluer la progression de la microcéphalie et de tenter de détecter d'autres anomalies non relevées précédemment, car ces observations peuvent avoir une influence sur le conseil prénatal ainsi que sur la prise en charge obstétricale ou périnatale (II-2B). 7 Il est essentiel de pratiquer un examen exhaustif du nouveau-né aux fins de diagnostic et de conseil sur l’étiologie, le pronostic et le risque de récurrence pour les prochaines grossesses, particulièrement lorsque l’étiologie n'a pas été clairement déterminée en période prénatale (III-A). 8 Dans les cas d'interruption de grossesse, de mortinaissance ou de décès néonatal, le fournisseur principal de soins de santé devrait encourager la pratique d'une autopsie complète par un anatomopathologiste pédiatrique ou en périnatalité afin d'obtenir le maximum de renseignements sur le diagnostic et l’étiologie de la microcéphalie. Lors d'un refus de l'autopsie complète, il convient d'offrir la pratique d'une autopsie au moins partielle ou externe (dont des photographies et une imagerie par résonance magnétique postnatale, si disponible)(III-A). 9 Selon l’étiologie sous-jacente ou en l'absence d'un diagnostic sous-jacent établi lors d'une grossesse antérieure avec microcéphalie, pour les prochaines grossesses, une orientation vers une unité tertiaire d’échographie aux fins d’évaluation de la croissance de la tête du fœtus fœtale devrait être envisagée (III-A). © 2019

AB  - In an attempt to improve organ donation rates, some countries are considering moving from “opt-in” systems where citizens must express their willingness to be an organ donor, to “opt-out” systems where consent is presumed unless individuals have expressed their wishes otherwise, by, for example, joining an “opt-out” register. In Wales—a part of the United Kingdom—the devolved government recently legislated for an “opt-out” system. For the change to be effective, a public awareness campaign was critical to the policy's success. Using quantitative and qualitative content analysis, we explored media coverage of the change to better understand the relationship between the state, policy actors, media and the public when such policy changes take place. Our findings illustrate how a state communication campaign can effectively set the media agenda within which we saw a degree of interdependency created with the state using the media to promote policy, and the media relying on the state for credible information. Yet we also found that the media is not uncritical and observed how it uses its autonomy to influence policy setting. Over the period of study, we found that a change in tone and view towards deemed consent organ donation has taken place in the media. However, while this may influence or reflect public attitudes, it is yet to be seen whether the media campaign translates into behavioural change that will result in increases in organ donations. © 2019 The Authors Health Expectations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Understanding how exposure and information affect public attitudes towards returning large carnivores in Europe is critical for human-carnivore coexistence, especially for developing efficient and de-escalating communication strategies. The ongoing recolonization of wolves (Canis lupus) in Germany provides a unique opportunity to test the role of different information sources and trust on people's attitudes towards wolves. We conducted a phone survey (n = 1250) and compared country-wide attitudes towards wolves with attitudes in a specific region where wolves initially recolonized and have been present since 2000. In particular, we investigate the relationship between information sources, trust and people's attitudes while accounting for factors like knowledge, exposure and socio-cultural determinants of respondents. We found significant differences in attitudes and knowledge about wolves as well as in the use and frequency of information sources between the two population samples. Higher knowledge, information from books and films, science-based information, and higher trust in information sources related positively with positive attitudes towards wolves. Comparatively, information from press or TV news was associated with more negative attitudes. Providing science-based information to the public and building trust in information is likely to be one measure, among others, to dampen extreme attitudes and improve people's appreciation of costs and benefits of human-carnivore coexistence. Management of conflictual situations emerging from large carnivore recolonization in Europe and beyond should consider incorporating assessments of people's use of and trust in information in addition to existing tools to pave new ways for constructive human-carnivore coexistence. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Large investments have been made in the development of information technology-based healthcare solutions for older adults, with expectations for increased efficiency and effectiveness of preventive healthcare and chronic disease management. This study aims to explore factors influencing older adults’ willingness to share their personal and health information when using healthcare technologies and services such as wearable electronic devices and relevant services, with a focus on information type and requesting entity. Methods: Data came from a survey on older adults at local senior centers in South Korea (N = 170; mean age = 77; 45.9% women). Questions asked participants their willingness to share information about socioeconomic, health status, and medical service information with six entities: family, hospital, researcher, government agency, device developer/corporation, and insurance company. A series of logistic regressions were estimated to examine the associations of socio-demographic factors, self-rated health, and attitude towards technology with the willingness to share by information type and requesting entity. Results: Higher proportions of older adults reported being willing to share their information with family and hospitals than with researchers, government agencies, device developer/corporations, or insurance companies (80.4%, 66.1% vs. 39.9%, 23.5%, 25.2%, 19.0%, respectively). Education and age were the most common factors affecting older adults’ willingness to share across information types and requesting entities. Higher education consistently showed a negative effect on the willingness to share; however, older age showed a positive effect. Older adults with positive attitudes towards technology were more likely to share their information with device developer/corporations. Women were less likely to share their information with government agencies than men. Older adults with poorer self-rated health were more likely to share their information, in particular medical service information, with hospitals. Conclusions: Older adults are selective about sharing their personal and health information when using healthcare technologies and relevant services in order to maintain and promote health, depending on the specific type of information and the entities asked to share with. The findings suggest that information granularity and empowering older adults with control over sharing each type of personal information will become more and more important in the practice of healthcare technology and services among older adults for the next decades. Also, it is notable that older adults have a relatively low level of trust in government agencies in relation to sharing their information. Healthcare technology and relevant services, particularly in public health, need to be designed and developed considering the privacy concerns and diversity among older adults, especially older women. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study examined the efficacy of a Photovoice-based video as a novel online anti-stigma video in reducing mental illness stigma, as well as the role of empathic concern in stigma reduction. Photovoice is a grassroots process by which members of a marginalized group, such as people with a mental illness, document and convey their experience; in this study’s context, the experience of living with a mental illness and the stigma associated with this experience. Canadian undergraduate university students (n = 303; average age = 21) were randomly assigned to view either a Photovoice-based anti-stigma intervention video (n = 156) or a control video (n = 147). Compared to the control condition, the Photovoice-based video was efficacious in reducing mental illness stigma, including reduced fear and anger toward people with a mental illness, decreased perceptions of dangerousness, and decreased desired social distance. In addition, the intervention was efficacious in maintaining reduced desired social distance relative to the control at 1-month post-intervention. Finally, empathic concern was found to mediate the relationship between the Photovoice-based video and reduced mental illness stigma, suggesting that one way the intervention reduced mental illness stigma was by eliciting empathy in the viewer. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Large purpose-built retirement complexes including continuing care options are increasingly popular ways to ‘age in place’ for older people in New Zealand and internationally. Promoted by their corporate owners as a lifestyle choice offering a wealth of activities and social interaction in manicured settings along with security and increasing care on site as needed, these entities offer new ways for wealthier older people to age. Applying an ethnographic approach to a case study residential complex in Auckland, New Zealand, we explore how residents experience inclusion and exclusion, and sense of community within such environments with a diversity of fit and frail residents. Data was collected from interviews, walk-about conversations, social site mapping and a selection of media material to gain an understanding of the social issues important to the residents. The twelve participants, aged between 70 and 87, were all independent residents living in the independent part of the complex, which is situated in a socio-economically wealthy suburb of Auckland. We identified that social connections were often fragile, and existing social group membership was key to shared community experiences and a sense of belonging. Residents who found themselves on the social fringes, particularly as newcomers or through health decline, were at risk of marginalisation, stigma, and social exclusion. Further, we identified how the design and layout, and tensions in the structure of the resident-management relationship potentially hinder inclusiveness and sense of community. These findings shed light on alternative experiences at odds with the commercial and populist framing of these places as age-friendly and inclusive communities promoting active lifestyles. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aims and objectives: To identify the intention of nurses to dual practice (DP) and inform policymaking in centralised government settings. Background: DP is pervasive worldwide but was not permitted in China until 2009, with a primary goal of encouraging nurses from over-staffed health services to work additional shifts in understaffed settings. Design: A descriptive cross-sectional survey. Methods: A DP questionnaire based on the theory of planned behaviour was developed and issued to nurses from three comprehensive public hospitals in 24 units selected by stratified random cluster sampling (n = 526). This study was reported based on STROBE checklist. Results: The mean for intention was 3.47 with strongly disagree as one point, neutral as three point and strongly agree as five point in scaling. Nurses with any of these characteristics: female, aged between 40 and 49, married, working more than 15 years, and managers were significantly reluctant to undertake DP. The structural equation model showed that the level of positive attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control could positively predict intention, and attitude had highest effect value. Perceived behavioural control and attitude acted as sequential mediators between subjective norm and intention. Nurses preferred large or private hospitals if conducting DP without restriction from the government. Conclusions: Nurses' intention to undertake DP was not strong, which was impacted by attitude, subjective norm, time and energy. Nurses preferred large or private hospitals; therefore, the goal of improving equity by DP in developing countries might be undermined. Relevance to clinical practice: To encourage DP, attitude and subjective norm are important paths, the latter being the initial step. Reasonable incentives or restrictions, such as specifying regulations on practice place and time limitation, qualifications and legal liability and remuneration are recommended to ensure successful DP implementation from over-staffed health services to understaffed settings. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Children with special educational needs often feel lonely in classrooms, are less accepted by their classmates and have fewer friendships. Their classmates’ positive attitudes towards them are important for their social participation in inclusive classrooms. According to the theory of social referencing, children’s attitudes towards peers with special educational needs are influenced by the role model behaviour of their parents. Therefore, we examined the relevance of children’s perceptions of parental behaviour in terms of their attitudes towards peers with learning disabilities. This was done by investigating N = 753 children’s attitudes, depending on their perceptions of parental behaviour towards peers with special educational needs, their contact experiences and their self-efficacy beliefs concerning their interpersonal skills. The results indicate that their attitudes are predicted by their perceptions of parental behaviour, their contact experiences and their self-efficacy beliefs. The effect of perceived parental behaviour on children’s attitudes is mediated by their self-efficacy beliefs. © 2019 NASEN

AB  - ology could enable consumers to circumvent the ethical and environmental issues associated with meat-eating. However, consumer acceptance of IVM is uncertain, and is partly dependent on how the product is framed. This study investigated the effect of different names for IVM on measures of consumer acceptance. Participants (N = 185) were allocated to one of four conditions in an experimental design in which the product name was manipulated to be ‘clean meat’ ‘cultured meat’ ‘animal free meat’ or ‘lab grown meat’. Participants gave word associations and measures of their attitudes and behavioural intentions towards the product. The results indicated that those in the ‘clean meat’ and ‘animal free meat’ conditions had significantly more positive attitudes towards IVM than those in the ‘lab grown meat’ condition, and those in the ‘clean meat’ condition had significantly more positive behavioural intentions towards IVM compared to those in the ‘lab grown meat’ condition. Mediation analyses indicated that the valence of associations accounted for a significant amount of the observed differences, suggesting that anchoring can explain these differences. We discuss these results in the context of social representations theory and give recommendations for future research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Requirements to integrate societal considerations into research and development practices began appearing throughout the democratic industrialized world in the early 2000s and eventually became a central feature of responsible innovation. Examining one of the earliest and most prominent policy examples, this paper investigates the conceptual basis of the U.S. nanotechnology program's mandate for socio-technical integration. It argues that policy makers adopted this innovative response to addressing the societal issues of an emerging technology due to their heightened awareness of potential interactions among public attitudes, research directions, and technological trajectories. Integration thus emerged as a governance mechanism for mediating the interaction between these dynamic sources of uncertainty. The mandate emerged in a self-consciously experimental and anticipatory manner and thus provides a practical instance of tentative governance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Experiences of prejudice, discrimination, internalized homonegativity, and poor social support contribute to an increased risk for psychosocial distress among sexual minority individuals (King et al., 2008; Meyer, 2003). While much is known about factors predicting psychosocial distress in LGB populations, less is known about the factors that predict psychosocial well-being among bisexuals. The present study used structural equation modeling to investigate the effect that minority stress processes (e.g., discrimination, internalized homonegativity) have on positive psychosocial health outcomes (e.g., positive affect, meaning in life) in bisexual men. Additionally, the study's model examined how positive sexual identity factors and universal protective factors (e.g., social support and resilience) directly affect the psychosocial well-being of bisexual men and mediate the relationship between minority stress processes and well-being. Results of the study showed that social support and resilience had the largest effect on psychosocial well-being, while holding positive views on various aspects of one's minority sexual identity were not significant predictors of well-being. No mediation effects were observed. Implications of these findings, limitations to the study, and future research directions are discussed. © 2018 American Psychological Association.

AB  - This paper explores community dialogues as social interaction in search for sexual diversity in Lesotho, in an effort to influence positive and more directional thinking towards sexuality and sexual behaviour. Guided by queer theory, we firstly explore cultural and religious dimensions defining acceptable and unacceptable sexual behaviour; their influence on attitudes towards the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning (or queer) and intersex (LGBTQI) community, leading to their daily negative encounters; and, lastly, we suggest community dialogues as a mediator that influences more positive attitudes and guides acceptability towards this vulnerable population. Three main themes emerged after the adoption of a thematic analysis: there is denial of the LGBTQI existence; stigma and discrimination towards this minority population also prevail; and the LGBTQI population in Lesotho experience emotional and physical attacks. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Background: Positive attitudes for end-of-life (EOL) care along with adequate education are key factors for the provision of quality EOL care. This national study was conducted to identify the factors that influence attitudes toward EOL care on medical students. Method: An anonymous survey was designed and administered to fourth-year medical students at all 41 medical schools in Korea. Topics related to EOL care were assessed in classroom teaching, bedside teaching, and feedback experiences during clinical clerkships. Seven questions for self-rated attitudes and affecting factors were analyzed toward EOL care. Results: With a response rate of 49.2%, the median number of topics recognized by the students as having been delivered was 5 of 11 topics in classroom lectures and 1 of 8 topics in clinical experience. Although few (21.2%) participants indicated that they felt ready for EOL care practice, nevertheless, most felt that they should have adequate knowledge of and preparation for clinical competency in EOL care. Several parameters including respondent’s demographics and exposure to EOL care topics in classroom and in bedside teaching influenced the responses to all 7 attitude questions. However, having more than 1 bedside experience was the only factor positively affecting all attitudinal measures. Conclusions: Clinical experience related to EOL care seems to be the utmost priory in fostering positive attitudes and competency among medical students. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Introduction: Given increasing efforts to regulate e-cigarettes, it is important to understand factors associated with support for tobacco regulatory policies. We investigate such factors found in social media and hypothesize that greater online engagement with tobacco content would be associated with less support for e-cigarette regulatory policies. Methods: We constructed social networks of Twitter users who tweet about tobacco and categorized them using a combination of social network and Twitter metrics. Twitter users were identified as representing leaders, followers or general users in online discussions of tobacco products, and invited to complete an online survey. Participants responded to questions about their engagement with tobacco-related content online, degree of support for e-cigarette regulations, exposure to tobacco marketing, e-cigarette use and other demographic information. We examined links between their reported engagement with tobacco-related content and support for e-cigarette regulatory policies using structural equation modelling. Results: The analytic sample consisted of 470 participants. The conceptualized structural equation model had a good fit (χ2 (32) = 24.85, p = 0.09, CFI = 0.99, RMSEA = 0.03). Findings support our hypothesis: engagement with online tobacco content was negatively associated with support for e-cigarette policies, while controlling for e-cigarette use, tobacco marketing exposure, social media use frequency and demographic factors. Conclusions: Findings suggest that our hypothesis was supported. Twitter users engaging with tobacco-related content and harboring negative attitudes toward e-cigarette regulatory policies could be an important audience segment to reach with tailored e-cigarette policy education messages. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Research shows that both entertainment and news media coverage of Islam and Muslims generate anti-Muslim attitudes in the wider U.S. public. In this article, I explore how this media trend shaped Taqwacore punks’ struggle to define what it means to be American, Muslim, and punk rock on their own terms. Upon their first U.S. tour, Taqwacore started getting the attention of both independent and mainstream media outlets. Taqwacores initially welcomed this because it helped them expand their audience to other (potential) Taqwacores as well as to a larger non-Muslim public. Their perspective changed, however, as they started to realize that most mainstream media stories were turning their punk protest into sensationalist stories about Americanized “Muslim punks” who oppose Islamic conventions. It was around this time that Taqwacores began imagining their audience as either with them or against them, enemies or allies. This study shows how this understanding of their audience shaped an internal dispute among Taqwacores about whether or not to identify as “Muslim punk.” Findings reveal that their internal debate over the Muslim punk label is structured by a racist media frame that defines Muslims as either good or bad, with or against the United States. © The Southern Sociological Society 2018.

AB  - Aim: People with psychosis are at risk of social exclusion. Research is needed in this area due to the lack of direct measurement of social inclusion, which becomes salient in adolescence and is relevant to first-episode psychosis (FEP; the onset of which typically occurs during or shortly after adolescence). Social inclusion may be impacted by impaired social cognition and social functioning, which are related features observed in psychosis. The aim of this study was to explore interrelationship(s) between social cognition, social functioning and social inclusion in FEP while controlling for symptomatology (positive, negative and depressive symptoms) and demographic characteristics. Methods: A series of cross-sectional hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted to examine whether: social cognition (theory of mind, emotion recognition) predicted social functioning; social functioning predicted social inclusion, and whether social functioning mediated the relationship between social cognition and social inclusion in people aged 15 to 25 (M = 20.49, SD = 2.41) with FEP (N = 146). Age, sex, premorbid IQ, positive and negative psychotic symptoms and depression were control variables. Results: Poor facial emotion recognition (β = −.22, P <.05) and negative symptoms (β = −.45, P <.001) predicted lower social functioning. Role-specific social functioning (ie, current employment) predicted greater social inclusion (β =.17, P <.05). Higher depression symptomatology predicted lower social inclusion (β = −.43, P <.001). Social functioning did not mediate the relationship between social cognition and inclusion. Psychotic symptoms were unrelated to social inclusion. Conclusions: Employment and depression may influence social inclusion somewhat independently of psychotic symptomatology in FEP. Inferences should be viewed with caution given this study did not involve longitudinal data. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - Japanese workers suffer high rates of mental health symptoms, recognised recently by the Japanese government, which has enacted workplace well-being initiatives. One reason for poor mental health concerns negative attitudes about mental health problems such as shame, which may be mediated by self-reassurance and self-criticism. This study aimed to evaluate shame-based attitudes toward mental health problems and explore the relationship between mental health attitudes, self-criticism, self-reassurance, and mental health symptoms. Japanese workers (n = 131) completed three measures: attitudes toward mental health problems, mental health symptoms, and self-criticism/reassurance. A high proportion of workers reported negative attitudes about mental health problems. There were strong relationships between mental health attitudes, mental health symptoms, self-criticism, and self-reassurance. Path analyses revealed that the total and indirect effects (through self-criticism and self-reassurance) of mental health attitudes on mental health were larger than the direct effect alone. Hated-self and family reflected shame were identified as predictors for mental health symptoms. The findings suggest the importance of self-criticism and self-reassurance in mental health and mental health attitudes. Implications for help-seeking behaviours also are discussed. Interventions aimed at reducing self-criticism and enhancing self-reassurance are recommended to improve mental health attitudes and increase help-seeking in Japanese workers. © 2018 Asian Association of Social Psychology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - The main purpose of this study is to explore which factors of users’ perceived gratifications and technology attributes are associated with changes in the usage level of Facebook and Instagram during the past three months. We identified common gratifications (social interaction, entertainment, passing time, browsing, need for recognition) as well as technology attributes (visual element, recommendation algorithm, privacy setting, openness, simultaneousness) of Facebook and Instagram and surveyed respondents who have both Facebook and Instagram accounts (n = 613). Respondents who were more gratified with entertainment and need for recognition aspects and those who have positive attitudes toward Facebook's recommendation algorithm features were more likely to report that they have increased use of the platform during the past three months. Meanwhile, respondents who were gratified with the browsing aspect of gratifications and those who have positive attitudes toward levels of openness on Instagram tended to report that they have increasingly used the platform during the past three months. © 2018 Western Social Science Association

AB  - Intergroup contact is a known remedy for complicated intergroup relations. At the same time, contact is rare in postconflict settings. In the present article, we examine whether exposure to narratives about moral exemplars (i.e., members of a perpetrator group who acted morally and in opposition to the passivity or aggression displayed by majority) could increase openness to contact among historical adversaries. In Study 1 (N = 73), presenting members of a historical perpetrator group with information about ingroup moral exemplars led to a decrease of prejudice towards individuals from a historical victim group, which, in turn, resulted in higher openness to contact with them. In Study 2 (N = 100) and 3 (N = 92), exposure to narratives about outgroup moral exemplars in a historically victimized group increased openness to contact with members of a perpetrator group. These effects were mediated by a decrease in prejudice (Studies 2 and 3) and by an increase in trust towards historical perpetrators (Study 2). © 2018 International Society of Political Psychology

AB  - Informed by the third-person effect hypothesis, this study used a survey of 1,060 Chinese university students to analyze the impact of anti-corruption news on Chinese audiences’ attitudes and political participation. This study found that university students tended to think the influence of anti-corruption news on others was greater than on themselves. In addition, issue involvement and new media attention to such news were found to reduce the self-other perceptual gap. Furthermore, the perceived effects of such news on self were positively associated with supportive attitude toward the anti-corruption policies. Meanwhile, perceived effects on others were negatively related to respondents’ political participation. © 2018 AEJMC.

AB  - A growing literature documents racial disparities throughout the American criminal justice system. Yet, even as this evidence accumulates and garners increasing media attention, we know relatively little about the consequences of this type of information for public opinion. We incorporate insights from attribution theory to suggest that people differ in the cause they attribute to racial disparities in the justice system, and these different causal attributions profoundly affect attitudes and responses to information. Using two survey experiments, we find that attributions for the cause of racial disparities in pulled-over rates have a substantial impact on trust in police, and perhaps more importantly, alter susceptibility to persuasion and attitude change. Learning about racial disparities in pulled-over rates reduces trust in police, but only for predictable subsets of the citizenry. © 2018 University of Utah.

AB  - This study examined various parental racial socialization messages as mediators between school-based racial discrimination and racial identity formation over 4 years for African American boys (N = 639) and African American girls (N = 711). Findings indicated that school-based racial discrimination was associated with racial identity beliefs. For African American boys, behavioral racial socialization messages mediated the relation between school-based racial discrimination and racial centrality over time. Mediation also resulted for African American girls, but for a different set of race-related messages (negative messages and racial barriers) and racial identity beliefs. The developmental significance of the findings and implications for future research are discussed. © 2018 Society for Research on Adolescence

AB  - An examination of a Crime Stoppers initiative – a weekly page published in a major city-based tabloid newspaper – afforded a rare glimpse into this understudied global entity. It also offered a means of reflecting on the co-option of CCTV images; partnerships between police, media organisations, and diverse publics; and the harnessing of citizen labour in a culture of surveillance. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted on the images, accompanying texts, and rhetoric of this feature page for a two-year period. From a media criminology perspective, the portrayals underscore the abrogation of the presumption of innocence, a focus on mundane property offences, with the potential to exacerbate fear of crime and to engender more punitive public attitudes. From a conceptual frame, this article proffers the notion of surveil-labour where the repurposing of CCTV data in the context of a Crime Stoppers scheme reinforces an alliance of police, media, and the public to enhance an infrastructure of informing. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Problem & aim: Cultural beliefs that equate birth technology with progress, safety and convenience contribute to widespread acceptance of childbirth technology and interventions. Little is known about attitudes towards childbirth technology and interventions among the next generation of maternity care users and whether attitudes vary by country, age, gender, childbirth fear, and other factors. Methods: Data were collected via online survey in eight countries. Students who had never had children, and who planned to have at least one child were eligible to participate. Findings: The majority of participants (n = 4569) were women (79.3%), and the median age was 22 years. More than half of students agreed that birth technology makes birth easier (55.8%), protects babies from harm (49.1%) and that women have a right to choose a medically non-indicated cesarean (50.8%). Respondents who had greater acceptance of childbirth technology and interventions were from countries with higher national caesarean birth rates, reported higher levels of childbirth fear, and were more likely to report that visual media or school-based education shaped their attitudes toward birth. Positive attitudes toward childbirth technology and interventions were also associated with less confidence in knowledge of birth, and more common among younger and male respondents. Discussion/conclusion: Educational strategies to teach university students about pregnancy and birth in ways that does not frighten them and promotes critical reflection about childbirth technology are needed. This is especially true in countries with high rates of interventions that reciprocally shape culture norms, attitudes, and expectations. © 2018 Australian College of Midwives

AB  - Despite its global rise in popularity, a significant number of people still oppose democracy. The current study evaluates three competing theories of opposition to democracy–developmentalist, culturalist, and elitist – using a series of multi-level regression models that combine individualand country-level variables. Results of our statistical analyses suggest that: 1) country-level indicators of social, political, and economic development are not consistently related to individual support for democracy; 2) macro-cultural factors have mixed effects on individual support for democracy; and 3) individual income and education have strong effects on individual support for democracy, but this relationship is mediated by country-level economic development. Specifically, we find that high-income individuals in relatively underdeveloped countries are more likely to oppose democracy than high-income individuals in wealthier countries. These results suggest that economic, social, and political development do not necessarily go together. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Guided by the attribution theory and sensation seeking (SS), this study found that a news article featuring an athlete celebrity endorser’s drug scandal resulting from a controllable cause (e.g., taking performance-enhancing substance) generated stronger punitive opinions, stronger attribution of the scandal to the athlete, and lower sympathy for the athlete. When a news article presented the drug scandal as due to an uncontrollable cause (e.g., taking a medication to relieve a health problem), low sensation seekers had more negative attitudes and were more in favor of punishment than high sensation seekers. Attributions and sympathy were found to be mediators of the interaction effects of controllable versus uncontrollable messages and SS on punitive opinions. This study contributes to research on the attribution theory and SS in the sports communication context and provides practical implications for sports marketers and public relations professionals. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Despite a near unanimous agreement that human trafficking is a morally reprehensible practice, there is confusion around what qualifies as human trafficking in the United States. Adopting a mixed-method strategy, we examine how human trafficking is defined by the public; how contemporary (mis)understanding of human trafficking developed; and the public opinion consequence of this (mis)understanding. The definition of human trafficking has evolved over time to become nearly synonymous with slavery; however, we demonstrate that media and anti-trafficking organisations have been focussing their attention on the sexual exploitation of foreign women. We show that general public opinion reflects this skewed attention; the average citizen equates human trafficking with the smuggling of women for sexual slavery. Using a survey experiment, we find that shining light on other facets of human trafficking - the fact that human trafficking is a security problem and a domestic issue - can increase public response to the issue. © Cambridge University Press, 2018.

AB  - Objective: The aim of our study was to assess the knowledge and attitude and to find out the statistics regarding public awareness of organ donation in Karachi. This convenient based, cross-sectional study was conducted from the general population of Karachi, Pakistan from December 2015 to December 2016. The respondents were evaluated through a face to face questionnaire. The questionnaire contained variables regarding knowledge and attitude towards organ donation. Result: 420 people were approached; amongst them 25 refused to participate, so a total number of 395 respondents consented in the research. The mean age of about 77.5% of the population was in the 18-27 range. More than half of the respondents happened to be students and female (51.1%) (55%) respectively. Our results indicate that there was inadequate knowledge among the general population (25.8%). There was a positive attitude regarding organ donation (75.2%). Television was a popular source of information (27%). 29.90% respondents knew that "Kidney" can be donated. 43.80% of the respondents were oblivious to the allowance of organ donation in their religion. More than half (57.2%) were in favor of the promotion of organ donation. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - As the overdose crisis in North America continues to deepen, public health leaders find themselves responding to sensational media stories, many of which carry forms and themes that mark them as urban legends. This article analyzes one set of media accounts - stories of misuse of naloxone, an opioid overdose antidote distributed to people who use drugs - through the lens of social science scholarship on urban legends. We suggest that these stories have met a public need to feel a sense of safety in uncertain times, but function to reinforce societal views of people who use drugs as undeserving of support and resources. Our field has a duty to speak out in favour of evidence-based programs that support the health of people who use drugs, but the optimal communication strategies are not always clear. Drawing attention to the functions and consequences of urban legends can help frame public health communication in a way that responds to needs without reinforcing prejudices, with application beyond naloxone to the other urban legends that continue to emerge in response to this crisis. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be influenced by knowledge, perception and perception regarding ART. The purpose of this study was to assess knowledge, attitude/perception and practice regarding ART among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV). Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess knowledge, attitudes, perception and practices ART in PLHIV. The survey was suggested to all PLHIV of at least 18 years old and who were on ART for at least 1 month. PLHIV who were unable to answer questions correctly and those who did not complete the survey for any reason were excluded. Results: During the study period, 234 PLHIV were included. Participants were mostly men (75.2%). The median age was 33 years (IQR: 27-41). The median time since HIV diagnosis was 25 months (IQR: 9-56) and the median duration of ART was 18 months (IQR: 8-48). 87.6% had an overall good knowledge of ART. However, only 3.2% knew the name of their ART, 31.2% were aware that ART should be taken at a fixed time and 17.1% knew how to take ART in relation to food intake. 75.6% of participants had an overall positive attitude/perception of ART. However, 10.7% were convinced that other methods were more effective than ART for treating HIV and 42.7% thought that taking ART was shameful. The assessment of practices showed that in case of missed dose, 48.3% of participants routinely skipped this dose instead of trying to take it as soon as possible. In multivariate analysis, good knowledge of ART was independently associated with high level of education (aOR: 4.7, IC95%: 1.6-13.7, p = 0.004) and disclosure of HIV status (aOR: 2.7, IC95%: 1.1-6.6, p = 0.029). Conclusions: This study showed an overall good knowledge and a predominantly positive attitude/perception of ART. However, accurate knowledge of ART intake was insufficient and the stigma associated with taking ART remained very present. Furthermore, very heterogeneous practices may reflect lack of instruction given by the physician regarding ART intake. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Organ donation is a life-saving process for patients suffering from an advanced organ failure. A disparity between donated organs and required organs for transplantation is one of the major problems in Iran. Since personal attitudes about organ donation is a main factor influencing willingness to donate organ, the present study sought to provide a deeper understanding of the attitudes of university students in Iran regarding organ donation. Methods: This qualitative study was conducted in 2016. Semi-structured interviews were held for collecting data from eighty five students from various universities in Hamadan city, Iran. Using a purposive sampling method, the students were selected based on the maximum variation. The content analysis method was used for data analysis by the research team and criteria for the study's rigor was considered. Results: Overall, the students had positive attitudes toward organ donation by brain-dead patients. Nevertheless, not of them stated that they would become an organ donor. During the data analysis, 376 primary codes, 13 categories, and 6 themes were developed. Themes were "cognitive readiness", "mediators of decision making", "beliefs and motivations", "interactions with the health system", "dependency", and "integrity of the body". Also, thirteen sub-themes were developed. Conclusion: Many factors influence the students' attitudes toward organ donation. Identification and explanation of these factors can help healthcare managers and policymakers for planning and improving the organ donation culture in the society. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - American newsrooms are adopting social media as an innovation for greater engagement. However, several organizational and individual factors may affect the extent to which news outlets adopt social media innovations. In particular, there is assumed to be a divide among different age groups of journalists in embracing social media. Utilizing a structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, the study seeks to understand how social media culture in newsrooms affects journalists’ strategies of taking social media as an innovation, and how journalists of different age groups differ in the SEM model fit. The analyses indicated Twitter engagement mediates social media culture and journalists’ attitude toward social media. However, that was not the case with Facebook. Additionally, while younger journalists favored Twitter, older journalists embraced Facebook and middle-aged journalists adopted both Facebook and Twitter. The analyses showed the more that middle-aged journalists interacted on Twitter, the more they tended to have a positive attitude toward social media. However, the more that younger and older journalists engaged on Twitter, the more they tended to have a negative attitude toward social media. Journalists from all three age groups tended to hold a negative attitude toward social media if they engaged more on Facebook. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Cycling-inclusive urban planning is attracting attention worldwide because of the environmental, health, economic, and transport benefits inherent to cycling from the individual and the societal perspectives. The Czech Republic is one of the emerging cycling countries that are trying to promote and support cycling, but cycling mode shares are low because of the poor quality of the scarce infrastructure and the psychological barrier of the perceived lack of safety when cycling in mixed traffic. This study takes a multimodal approach based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour and focuses on the factors underlying the willingness to share the road from the perspective of cyclists and drivers: positive attitudes toward cycling, positive attitudes toward cyclists’ behavior, social norms toward cycling and anxiety to share the road. A web-based questionnaire was tailor-designed and administered in the Czech Republic via social networks, web forums, and the Civinet network, and a hybrid bivariate-ordered model tested the behavioral framework. Results show that the willingness to share the road as a cyclist or as a driver relates positively to positive attitudes towards cycling and cyclists’ behavior, and negatively to the anxiety of sharing the road. Moreover, mediator effects are observed and a clear relation emerges between the experience on the road as both a cyclist and a driver on the willingness to share the road as a cyclist. Lastly, results show that the factors underlying road sharing intentions are related significantly to gender, travel habits, and perceived personal and infrastructure-related barriers to cycling. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objectives: To explore the discursive construction and social actions achieved by accounts given by men following a birth in which the mother developed life-threatening complications. Background: Existing qualitative research employing interpretative thematic analysis of men’s accounts of births in which the mother developed life-threatening complications highlights men’s expressions of distress and marginalisation. This paper extends this, adopting different epistemological and analytic approaches to those accounts. Methods: Audio recordings and transcripts of semi-structured interviews collected by Hinton et al. were re-analysed using an approach informed by narrative analysis, discursive psychology and the discursive action model. Participants were four white British men whose partners experienced a maternal ‘near-miss’ event. Results: This analysis illustrates how men in this study draw on cultural narratives of ‘normal’ birth to construct experiences. Narrative constructions highlight separation of health professionals from laymen. These men use a discourse of self-reliance within families to construct their path to recovery. Conclusion: The strength of available narratives of birth and limited accessibility of alternative ones may impact how men tell their experience. Men in this study discursively attend to issues of power, agency and male identity, re-establishing entitlement to speak about their experience, but construct emotional support as unavailable to them. © 2018, © 2018 Society for Reproductive and Infant Psychology.

AB  - Background: Majority of causes of maternal and newborn mortalities are preventable. However, poor access to and low utilization of health services remain major barriers to optimum health of the mothers and newborns. The objectives of this study were to assess maternal and newborn health services utilization and factors affecting mothers' health service utilization. Methods: A community based cross-sectional survey was carried out on randomly selected mothers who gave birth within a year preceding the survey. The survey was supplemented with key informant interviews of experts/health professionals. Multivariable logistic model was used to identify factors associated with service utilization. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were used to assess the strength of the associations at p-value ≤0.05. The qualitative data were summarized thematically. Results: A total of 789 (99.1% response rate) mothers participated in the study. The proportion of the mothers who got at least one antennal care (ANC) visit, institutional delivery and postnatal care (PNC) were 93.3, 77.4 and 92.0%, respectively. Three-forth (74.2%) of the mothers started ANC lately and only 47.5% of them completed ANC4+ visits. Medium (4-6) family size (AOR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 4.9), decision on ANC visits with husband (AOR: 30.9; 95% CI: 8.3, 115.4) or husband only (AOR: 15.3; 95%CI: 3.8, 62.3) and listening to radio (AOR: 2.5; 95%CI: 1.1, 5.6) were associated with ANC attendance. Mothers whose husbands read/write (AOR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.), attended formal education (AOR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.1, 6.8), have positive attitudes (AOR: 10.2; 95% CI: 25.9), living in small (AOR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.2, 7.6) and medium size family (AOR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.2, 4.1) were more likely to give birth in-health facilities. The proportion of PNC checkups among mothers who delivered in health facilities and at home were 92.0 and 32.5%, respectively. The key informants mentioned that home delivery, delayed arrival of the mothers, unsafe delivery settings, shortage of skilled personnel and supplies were major obstacles to maternal health services utilization. Conclusions: Health information communication targeting husbands may improve maternal and newborn health services utilization. In service training of personnel and equipping health facilities with essential supplies can improve the provider side barriers. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Grounded in Transformative Service Research, the purpose of this paper is to explore the mechanisms by which bank information transparency influences consumer’s financial well-being (FWB). The authors propose that customer attitudes toward the brand and the subjectively perceived ability of individuals to deal with the financial challenges explain the enhancement of FWB driven by bank information transparency. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. In total, 400 bank customers of five commercial banks in Colombia were approached and asked to fill out a pen and paper questionnaire. Serial mediation analysis was applied to test the hypotheses. Findings: This research shows that bank information transparency can uplift the FWB of customers. Furthermore, the positive effect of bank information transparency on the FWB occurs because the shared information improves the positive attitudes toward banks and the perceived financial self-efficacy of customers. Research limitations/implications: This paper heeds the call of current literature for improved explanations of the relationship between attempts to inform consumers about financial services and their FWB. Practical implications: This research shows that managers who embrace the challenging task of improving the FWB of their customers should design strategies for more transparent information sharing with their customers. However, these strategies should be designed not only to deliver information to customers but also to increase the perceived disclosure, accuracy and clarity of shared information. Originality/value: This pioneering study aims to explain the effects of bank information transparency on the FWB of consumers by drawing on interdisciplinary literature. This research is important as many banks aim to increase their information transparency without a clear understanding of the effects of these actions on consumers and therefore in many instances their efforts fail. A key contribution of this study is identifying concrete mechanisms (i.e. brand attitudes and self-efficacy) that help managers to improve customers’ FWB via information transparency. Accordingly, the authors offer suggestions for better information transparency strategy implementation. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This article is a historical empirical study of the Albanian Muslim migrant community of Shepparton. Through analysing newspaper reports, the authors discuss how these migrants were portrayed as liminal between their first arrival and acceptance as Australians a generation later. This is characteristic of a practice which the authors term “migrant hazing”, where a migrant group is demonized as a threat to the society during the liminal phase. Migrant hazing occurs in public discourse, particularly the media, and ceases with the replacement of the group by newer migrants, who are subjected to the same process. Furthermore, migrant hazing remains present in contemporary depictions of Australian Muslims. In this longitudinal study, media reports on Albanian Muslims revolved around three persistent themes: their supposed criminality, the wrongful use of land and the threat of dual-loyalty. These three items constituted the main weapons of the media in hazing the first, liminal generation. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This research explores influential factors of using narratives of Chernobyl in media reporting about the Fukushima nuclear accident: radiological consequences, geographical distance from the accident, status of a nuclear energy production, public opinion about nuclear energy and the level of a nuclear accident (INES scale). This study applies a large-scale media content analysis of newspapers articles (N = 1340) published in the first two months of the accident in twelve press opinion leaders in Belgium, Italy, Norway, Russia, Slovenia and Spain. The results show that the memory on the Chernobyl nuclear accident appeared in more than in every third article reporting of the present Fukushima nuclear accident despite the fact that Fukushima carried no direct radiological hazard for the newspaper’s audience and, a frequent use of narratives is related to negative attitudes towards nuclear energy, a higher risk perception of nuclear power plants and to an active nuclear energy industry in the newspaper’s country. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Policy-makers often refer to media reports and public opinion polls when advocating immigration policies. A good example of this is provided by Hong Kong, an international financial hub that prides itself on its multiculturalism and pluralism, but whose government officials and pro-establishment legislators have been calling for tougher measures because of a plethora of negative news reports on immigrants. This study examines how print media frames the issue of asylum seekers and refugees, with the findings indicating that the majority of local Chinese news articles portray asylum seekers negatively as “fake refugees” and “criminals.” The study also examines newspapers’ framing of the causes of requests for asylum and their recommendations for dealing with the “problem”: (1) setting up detention camps, (2) enforcing stricter border control, and (3) withdrawing from the UNCAT. It argues that the negative framing provides justifications for anti-refugee policy-makers to suggest tougher policy solutions to the issue of asylum seekers and refugees. Policy implications are discussed which may affect Hong Kong’s position as a first-class global city. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Women leaders in the workforce are adversely affected by two sets of stereotypes: women are warm and communal but leaders are assertive and competent. This mismatch of stereotypes can lead to negative attitudes toward women leaders, however, not all individuals will be equally sensitive to these stereotypes. Men and women characterized by a need for cognitive closure (the desire for stable and certain knowledge) should be particularly sensitive to these stereotypes because they can be stable knowledge sources. We hypothesized that (a) negative attitudes toward women leaders in the workforce would vary with individuals’ need for closure, independent of their gender, and that (b) binding moral foundations (a concern for the larger group and its norms and standards) would mediate this association. In two studies, MTurk workers completed measures of negative attitudes toward women managers (Study 1, n = 149), stereotyped beliefs of women as not wanting or deserving high status positions in the workforce (Study 2, n = 207), as well as need for cognitive closure, moral foundations, social desirability, gender, and political orientation. Our results were consistent with our hypotheses and suggest that attitudes toward woman managers can reflect acceptance of pre-existent norms. If these norms can be changed, then changes in attitudes could follow. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - With the high frequency and intensity of worldwide disasters, cause-related marketing campaigns with sudden disasters are becoming increasingly popular. However, little is known about whether and how cause acuteness may influence consumer attitudes. This research aims to extend this research area through investigating the relationship between cause acuteness and consumer attitudes toward the product, as well as its underlying mechanism and boundary conditions. Based on a moral psychology perspective, we propose a theoretical model focusing on the mediating role of moral elevation in influencing consumer attitudes. This model also incorporates product-cause fit and information transparency as moderators underpinning necessary conditions that are likely to lead to positive consumer attitudes. Four empirical studies were conducted to test our model. Our research results reveal that consumers have more positive attitudes toward the product associated with a sudden disaster than with an ongoing tragedy. Furthermore, the positive effect of cause acuteness on consumer attitudes is mediated by enhanced moral elevation, which occurs under the conditions of high product-cause fit and high information transparency. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The risk perception attitude (RPA) framework was tested as a message tailoring strategy to encourage diabetes screening. Participants (N = 602) were first categorized into one of four RPA groups based on their diabetes risk and efficacy perceptions and then randomly assigned to receive a message that matched their RPA, mismatched their RPA, or a control message. Participants receiving a matched message reported greater intentions to engage in self-protective behavior than participants who received a mismatched message or the control message. The results also showed differences in attitudes and behavioral intentions across the four RPA groups. Participants in the responsive group had more positive attitudes toward diabetes screening than the other three groups, whereas participants in the indifferent group reported the weakest intentions to engage in self-protective behavior. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Limited research exists on school social work that addresses the issues, needs and concerns facing Hong Kong’s sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth. This qualitative study interrogates how heteronormativity produces gender and sexuality oppression within the secondary school system. It situates Hong Kong schooling in a heteronormative context shaped by the intersecting influences of Chinese cultures, intimate family life, Christianity and media/public attitudes. It also highlights how heteronormativity is enforced and reproduces gender and sexuality oppression in multiple ways (through peer relations, curriculum and class teacher relations and school social work practices). Understanding how heteronormativity manifests and works is urgently needed to challenge heteronormativity through Hong Kong schooling. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Post-Apartheid South Africa has been characterized by fractious relationships between the races that compose this society and also between the rulers and the ruled. Society has devised many strategies to cope with, understand, resist, and oppose this, but also to bring about change. One of these strategies is the expression of personal viewpoints through elections, social media, protests and humour. This paper is concerned with the deployment of near-pornographic satirical humour in South African politics, satire created to challenge the powerful. Using critical discourse analysis of paintings, citizens’ comments and news media reports, this paper questions the use of ‘genital art’ and offers different readings of these images in the broader context of South African identity politics. Race seems to be the most dominant lens through which the paintings that are the foci of this paper are read. In a racially charged South Africa race is not a funny subject. The paper concludes that the refusal to see humour in South African race relations might be due to the shocking manner of aesthetic representations in these paintings. That the artworks capture the grave levels of the socio-political and economic situation is indisputable but what remains contested could be the modes of representing these situations. All this seems to interplay with race politics and South Africa’s problematic Apartheid past. © 2019, © 2019 Centre of African Studies, University of Edinburgh.

AB  - This paper discusses the role of design and material practices on the weaponization of quietness through the deployment of sound bombs by the Military Police of São Paulo, Brazil. Probing the contradiction of using a device that produces loudness to enforce silence laws, I offer an account of how designed artifacts and techniques can be instrumentalized by the State for the policing of racialized bodies and their sonic and musical practices. These artifacts and techniques create and reproduce mechanisms that produce both physical and social distance between bodies perceived to be “loud” and their silence-enforcing counterpart (i.e. the police). This extends the reach and scope of the segregation of (auditory) space with techniques besides architecture and urban planning alone. I begin with an analysis of a few, violent strategies employed by the Military Police to enforce silence laws in lower-class neighborhoods in the city, as depicted in a filmed raid edited and posted on their own social media channels. I then read these practices through the history of the so-called “stun grenade,” or sound bomb, and its use in both military and civilian contexts. Lastly, I examine a semi-fictional proposition found in Adirley Queirós’ 2015 film Branco Sai, Preto Fica (White Out, Black In) for disrupting the enforcement of silence, which in turn proposes a decolonizing shift in the perception of loudness and noise vis-à-vis racialized bodies. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The paper argues that problematic race relations in the country today should be analysed within a certain historical context and should be seen as part of a historical continuum. This paper places a lot of importance on this historical continuum. In this connection, the British colonial policies of divide and conquer, politicians and their obsession with Buddhism and trying to make it the state religion shortly after independence in 1948, and the xenophobic policies followed by the military junta after 1962 deserve special mention. The paper further argues that the current state of affairs and escalation in violence has happened recently because of the convergence of the activities and ideologies of certain political groups like the military junta, the National League for Democracy, the Arakan League for Democracy, and the role played by certain Buddhist extremist groups like the MaBaTha in Burmese politics. To ease the existing tension in the Rakhine, the central government would need to take a more federally minded approach and introduce meaningful democracy and development in the frontier parts of the country where there is a strong ethnic minority presence. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study assessed attitudes of undergraduate healthcare students in Nigeria toward interprofessional practice. A cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of 489 dental, medical, medical laboratory science, nursing, physiotherapy, and radiography students from a public university was conducted. The 14-item Attitudes Toward Healthcare Teamwork Scale was used to assess the students’ attitudes. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics while differences in attitudes based on students’ age, gender, year of study, and course of study were identified using inferential statistics. The findings showed that there were more (n= 281; 57.5%) male respondents and mean age was 25 years. Mean attitude score was 53.75 (±7.41) out of 70 depicting an overall positive attitude. Year and course of study resulted in statistically significant (p< .001) differences in attitudes with students in the sixth year of study, and medical students having more positive attitudes than their colleagues in junior years and other courses respectively. Most students agreed that interprofessional practice facilitates optimal patient care but also agreed with statements that portray interprofessional practice as unnecessarily time consuming. Integration of interprofessional education into existing undergraduate healthcare professions curricula in Nigeria could help address misconceptions and reinforce positive attitudes toward interprofessional practice. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: The burden of mental illness (MI) is exacerbated when adolescents with MI are confronted with stigma and social exclusion. Adolescents face the difficult decision whether or not to disclose their MI. Focus groups (FGs) were conducted with parents of adolescents with MI as well as with teachers, mental health professionals (MHPs) and adolescents without MI. Aim: To collect information from relevant stakeholders on secrecy versus disclosure of MI among adolescents. Methods: Thirteen FG sessions with 87 participants were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using qualitative content analysis to identify major themes. Results: Selective disclosure and social media as a potential way of disclosure emerged as dominant themes. Negative aspects of disclosure on social media were discussed. Stigma and labeling were seen as disadvantages of disclosure. Social support was perceived as one advantage of disclosure. Distinctive features of adolescence, such as self-discovery, appeared as specific problems. Parents, teachers, MHPs and adolescents without MI were considered important for disclosure. Participants discussed how to help adolescents with their dilemma between disclosure and secrecy. Conclusions: The findings suggest that disclosure decisions are personal and influenced by the individual’s environment. Implications for interventions that aim to support adolescents with MI in this regard are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Using a pretest–posttest and delayed recontact experimental design with a national sample, this study examines shifts in U.S. public attitudes about Syrian refugees after watching a topical satirical news segment on Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, compared with a CNN news segment. To investigate synergistic effects between satire and news, the design varied whether the news and comedy segments were viewed alone or in sequence (news before comedy or comedy before news). The results show that all four treatments (news only, comedy only, news-comedy, comedy-news) significantly increased support for refugees from pretest to posttest, and these effects were maintained after a 2-week delay. However, the effects were significantly greater in the three comedy conditions relative to news only. Finally, a serial mediation analysis demonstrated that perceived entertainment value is a positive mediator of comedy’s persuasive effects and serves as a buffer against negative indirect effects through message discounting and argument quality. © 2019, © 2019 Mass Communication & Society Division of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.

AB  - In the Australian context, the development of a ‘situated politics of mixedness’ is complicated by the fact that there are (at least) two main categories of mixed race populations–the Indigenous and the migrant/settler. For those with mixed Aboriginal/non-Aboriginal ancestries, and those with mixed White and other migrant ancestries, life chances and identities differ significantly. This paper outlines some of these differences using the trope of pride and prejudice. For those of mixed migrant/settler heritage, evidence is growing that the mixed experience is predominantly one of pride. For them, misrecognition, or being asked about their racial background, is an opportunity for play, often resulting in ‘the big reveal’ of a valorised mixed identity associated with something other than a bland ‘white bread’ Australian-ness. For those of mixed Indigenous heritage however, there remains a significant level of prejudice, not (only) for being Aboriginal, but for not being visibly Aboriginal enough. Using existing studies and a number of media controversies as examples, this paper interrogates the implications of these differences for understandings of the ways in which race is recruited in the construction of legitimate identity claims. It asks particularly how ‘mixed race’ is helpful analytically to describe the identity constructions within these two very different experiences. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Exposure to an outgroup member voicing criticism of his or her own group fosters greater openness to the outgroup’s perspective. Research suggests that this effect owes its influence to a serial process in which participants’ perception of the risk involved in voicing internal criticism leads to an increase in the perceived credibility of the speaker. The credibility makes it possible for the speaker to be viewed as open-minded, which subsequently inspires greater hope. This process culminates in an increased openness to the outgroup. These findings have been restricted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but here we examine their generalizability to racial conflict in the United States. Results reveal that White Americans exposed to internal criticism expressed by a Black authority figure express greater openness to African-American perspectives on race relations and are more willing to support policies of racial equality. Replicating past research, this effect is serially mediated by risk, credibility, and hope. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - We investigated the connection between moral exclusion of outgroups and on the one hand, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), and social dominance orientation (SDO) on the other. We assumed that both RWA and SDO would increase the tendency to place other groups out of the scope of justice. However, we also tested whether negative stereotypes about an outgroup’s threatening and norm-violating misbehavior would serve as a justification for moral exclusion. These assumptions were tested in connection with Roma, Jewish, and Muslim people as target groups in the Hungarian context (N = 441). In line with our hypotheses, we found that both RWA and SDO had an indirect effect on moral exclusion mediated by negative stereotypes about the particular target group. Our findings suggested that negative stereotypes were more important legitimizing factors for RWA than for SDO. Our results highlight the benefits of interpreting the process of moral exclusion as an outcome of motivated social cognition. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Massive social media data produced from microblog platforms provide a new data source for studying human dynamics at an unprecedented scale. Meanwhile, population bias in geotagged Twitter users is widely recognized. Understanding the demographic and socioeconomic biases of Twitter users is critical for making reliable inferences on the attitudes and behaviors of the population. However, the existing global models cannot capture the regional variations of the demographic and socioeconomic biases. To bridge the gap, we modeled the relationships between different demographic/socioeconomic factors and geotagged Twitter users for the whole contiguous United States, aiming to understand how the demographic and socioeconomic factors relate to the number of Twitter users at county level. To effectively identify the local Twitter users for each county of the United States, we integrate three commonly used methods and develop a query approach in a high-performance computing environment. The results demonstrate that we can not only identify how the demographic and socioeconomic factors relate to the number of Twitter users, but can also measure and map how the influence of these factors vary across counties. © 2018, © 2018 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.

AB  - Objective: Describe variation in sentiment of tweets using race-related terms and identify themes characterizing the social climate related to race. Methods: We applied a Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier to conduct sentiment analysis of 1,249,653 US tweets using race-related terms from 2015–2016. To evaluate accuracy, manual labels were compared against computer labels for a random subset of 6600 tweets. We conducted qualitative content analysis on a random sample of 2100 tweets. Results: Agreement between computer labels and manual labels was 74%. Tweets referencing Middle Eastern groups (12.5%) or Blacks (13.8%) had the lowest positive sentiment compared to tweets referencing Asians (17.7%) and Hispanics (17.5%). Qualitative content analysis revealed most tweets were represented by the categories: Negative sentiment (45%), positive sentiment such as pride in culture (25%), and navigating relationships (15%). While all tweets use one or more race-related terms, negative sentiment tweets which were not derogatory or whose central topic was not about race were common. Conclusion: This study harnesses relatively untapped social media data to develop a novel area-level measure of social context (sentiment scores) and highlights some of the challenges in doing this work. New approaches to measuring the social environment may enhance research on social context and health. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Video game playing is a daily activity for many youths that replaces other media forms (eg, television); it serves as an important source of knowledge and can potentially impact their attitudes and behaviors. Researchers are, thus, concerned with the impact of video gaming on youth (eg, for promoting prosocial or antisocial behavior). Studies have also begun to explore players' experience of gameplay and video game messages about violence, sexism, and racism; however, little is known about the impact of commercial video games in the sharing and shaping of knowledge, and messages about mental illness. Objective: The aim of this review was to identify how mental illness, especially psychosis, is portrayed in commercial video games. Methods: We performed keyword searches on games made available between January 2016 and June 2017 on Steam (a popular personal computer gaming platform). A total of 789 games were identified and reviewed to assess whether their game content was related to mental illness. At the end of the screening phase, a total of 100 games were retained. Results: We used a game elements framework (characters, game environment/atmosphere, goals, etc) to describe and unpack messages about mental health and illness in video games. The majority of the games we reviewed (97%, 97/100) portrayed mental illness in negative, misleading, and problematic ways (associating it with violence, fear, insanity, hopelessness, etc). Furthermore, some games portrayed mental illness as manifestations or consequences of supernatural phenomena or paranormal experiences. Mental illness was associated with mystery, the unpredictable, and as an obscure illness; its treatment was also associated with uncertainties, as game characters with mental illness had to undergo experimental treatment to get better. Unfortunately, little or no hope for recovery was present in the identified video games, where mental illness was often presented as an ongoing struggle and an endless battle with the mind and oneself. Conclusions: The game elements of the identified commercial video games included mental illness, about which many perpetuated well-known stereotypes and prejudices. We discuss the key findings in relation to current evidence on the impact of media portrayals of mental illness and stigma. Furthermore, we reflect on the ability of serious video games to promote alternative messages about mental illness and clinical practices. Future research is needed to investigate the impact that such messages have on players and to explore the role that video games can play in fostering alternative messages to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness. © 2019 JMIR Mental Health

AB  - Patients with stroke admitted at the neurology/neurosurgery ward of the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, may experience problems in communication, such as aphasia, severe confusion/delirium or severe language barriers. This may prevent self-reported pain assessment; therefore, pain behaviour observation scales are needed. In this project, we therefore aimed to implement the Rotterdam Elderly Pain Observation Scale (REPOS) by video training. We used a stepped-wedge cluster design with clusters of four to five nurses with intervals of 2 weeks, for a total study duration of 34 weeks. Primary endpoint was the proportion of shifts in which nurses used the REPOS when caring for an eligible patient. A questionnaire was send biweekly to assess self-perceived competence and attitude on pain measurement in patients able or unable to self-report pain intensity. No other strategies were used to promote the use of the REPOS. Though the proportion of shifts in which trained nurses cared for eligible patients increased from 0% at baseline to 83% at the end of the study, the proportion of cumulative shifts where the REPOS was used decreased from 14% to 6%, respectively. Process evaluation suggests that this decrease can (in part) be attributed to low and varying prevalence of eligible patients and opportunities for practice. In total, 24 (45.3%) nurses had used the REPOS at least once after 34 weeks, with a median of two times (1-33). Nurses perceived themselves 'competent' to 'very competent' in pain behaviour observation. There was no negative attitude towards pain measurement. This study shows that education alone may not be effective when implementing a pain behaviour observation scale for non-communicative patients with Acquired Brain Injury. Individual motivation of health professionals and individual patient factors may be of influence for the use of the REPOS. © 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)). Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In contemporary times, employers use information available on the social media (SM) to assess attitudes before interviews and recruitment of potential employees. It is used as one of the criteria to rank applicants for acceptance as residents in the Middle East. In this study, an evaluation was done of this new practice in which program directors (PDs) take into account e-professionalism for the acceptance of applicants. It was a national study of all 41 hospitals in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia involved in Saudi board family medicine training programs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 36-item questionnaire was administered to PDs. Next, a focus group discussion (FGD) was held, after which there was social listening. We recorded the FGD. There was verbatim transcription and coding of the qualitative data. We held social listening using Keyhole. The percentage of positive attitudes (PPAs) was normally distributed; we tested its relationship with different factors by comparing the mean score values among categories using the Student’s t-test and one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: The average PPA toward the ranking of applicants by using their SM was 55.5% ± 17.3% (median: 56.6%). The average PPA was higher in those who used SM to communicate with residents (60.2% ±19.5%) than those who did not (49.4% ±12%; P= 0.04), even after adjusting for familiarity with Internet use. Directors in hospitals of the Ministry of Education had higher percentages; these figures, however, are not statistically significant. PDs considered the importance of establishing culturally acceptable guidelines for the assessment of e-professionalism and social reputation. CONCLUSIONS: Culturally appropriate, bioethical regulations that meet the needs of modern times should be designed. We need to solve ethical dilemmas, especially with regard to privacy in SM. © 2019 Journal of Family and Community Medicine.

AB  - Background: There are controversial views on accepting a reproductive donation in the world. Objective: This study aimed to determine the relationship between the sociocultural beliefs and infertile couples’ attitude toward reproductive donation in Mashhad, Iran. Materials and Methods: This descriptive correlational study was conducted out on 115 infertile couples visiting Milad Infertility Center in Mashhad, Iran with using convenience sampling. The research instruments were valid and reliable sociocultural beliefs and attitude questionnaires, which were completed by the respondents on a self-report basis. Results: The mean score of attitude toward reproductive donation in infertile women and men was 58.3 ± 12.6 and 57.8 ± 12.0, and the mean score of sociocultural beliefs in infertile women and men was 67.7 ± 11.5 and 67.6 ± 12.4, respectively. There was a direct correlation between sociocultural beliefs and attitude toward reproductive donation in infertile women (p < 0.001) and men (p < 0.001), that is, women and men with a higher score of sociocultural beliefs had a higher score of attitude as well. A direct correlation was also seen between sociocultural beliefs and infertile women and men’s public attitude, their attitude towards genetic bound between parents and children, their attitude regarding the issue of confidentiality of the donation process, as well as attitude in relation to oocyte donation, embryo donation, and surrogacy (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The findings suggest that sociocultural beliefs that surround reproductive donation could influence infertile couple’s attitude toward accepting these therapeutic alternatives in infertile couples. It is therefore recommended to take steps to incorporate sociocultural beliefs into the routine care of infertile couples with the help of social media to give them ability for making more pragmatic decision in relation to their chosen options. © 2019, Research and Clinical Center for Infertitlity.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude and care-seeking practices of parents towards childhood ear infections in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Methods: This quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between April and June 2018. An online survey was sent to a random selection of parents who were ≥18 years old with children of ≤10 years old. Associations between parental knowledge, attitude, care-seeking practices, socioeconomic status, level of education and age were assessed using the chi square test and logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 782 subjects participated in this study (response rate: 78.2%). Most respondents were knowledgeable (76.2%), had a positive attitude (78.9%) and had positive care-seeking practices (89.5%). There was a statistically significant difference on both bivariate and multivariate analyses (P <0.05) between parental care seeking practice and knowledge. Parents who sought modern approaches to treatment were found to be almost nine times more likely to have a good attitude towards ear infections than those who did not seek treatment (odds ratio = 8.907, 95% confidence interval = 2.655–34.928; P <0.001). A statistically significant relationship was found between good care-seeking practice and age, as well as socioeconomic status (P <0.05 each). Conclusion: This study showed that knowledge, attitude and practice regarding paediatric ear infections were positive in the majority of parents in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Future studies should assess other factors that enhance the knowledge, attitude and practices regarding ear infections. © 2019, Sultan Qaboos University. All rights reserved.

AB  - In any migratory context individuals are faced with several challenges as a result of having to live in a different geographical location, function in a different cultural setting and use a different language. The migrants' use of language plays a crucial role in mediation of their identity, especially in the domain of pronunciation (Kobialka 2016). When non-native users of language adapt their speech to resemble that of the host community, it may suggest their strong identification with the target community (Hammer and Dewaele 2015). This papers focuses on the pronunciation patterns among Polish adult migrants living in the west of Ireland. The aim of the study is to investigate the link between positive attitudes of the migrant community towards Ireland, Irish culture and community, their acculturation strategies and language identity, and the tendency to use one of the most characteristic features of Irish English - slit-t. The theoretical framework includes acculturation theory (Berry 2005), social identity theory (Tajfel and turner 1987) and language identity (Block 2007). The qualitative and quantitative analysis of data indicates a certain correlation between the use of Irish English slit-t and the participants' strategies of acculturation, identity and attitudes to the host community. © 2019 Izabela Grabarczyk, published by Sciendo.

AB  - Role of the knowledge-based resources in promoting sustainability in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is currently a topic of debate. Financial literacy has been identified as a vital knowledge resource for financial decision making, but insufficient attention has been given to how SMEs' financial literacy affects their sustainability. Drawing upon a knowledge-based perspective, peaking order theory and dual process theory, we constructed an integrated model to examine the impact of financial literacy, access to finance and financial risk attitude on SMEs' sustainability. The sample included 291 chief financial officers (CFOs) of SMEs in Sri Lanka. The output of structural equation modelling revealed direct positive effects of financial literacy, access to finance and financial risk attitude on sustainability. Financial literacy also emerged as a predictor of access to finance and financial risk attitude. Moreover, access to finance and financial risk attitude were found to be partial mediators of the relationship between financial literacy and SMEs' sustainability. Theoretical implications and practical implications for policymakers, industry practitioners and academics interested in promoting sustainability amongst SMEs are discussed. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In a location-based social network, users socialize with each other by sharing their current location in the form of "check-in," which allows users to reveal the current places they visit as part of their social interaction. Understanding this human check-in phenomenon in space and time on location based social network (LBSN) datasets, which is also called "check-in behavior," can archive the day-to-day activity patterns, usage behaviors toward social media, and presents spatiotemporal evidence of users' daily routines. It also provides a wide range of opportunities to observe (i.e., mobility, urban activities, defining city boundary, and community problems in a city). In representing human check-in behavior, these LBSN datasets do not reflect the real-world events due to certain statistical biases (i.e., gender prejudice, a low frequency in sampling, and location type prejudice). However, LBSN data is primarily considered a supplement to traditional data sources (i.e., survey, census) and can be used to observe human check-in behavior within a city. Different interpretations are used elusively for the term "check-in behavior," which makes it difficult to identify studies on human check-in behavior based on LBSN using the Weibo dataset. The primary objective of this research is to explore human check-in behavior by male and female users in Guangzhou, China toward using Chinese microblog SinaWeibo (referred to as "Weibo"), which is missing in the existing literature. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is utilized to explore the spatiotemporal distribution geographically and weighted regression (GWR) method was applied to observe the relationship between check-in and districts with a focus on gender during weekdays and weekend. Lastly, the standard deviational ellipse (SDE) analysis is used to systematically analyze the orientation, direction, spatiotemporal expansion trends and the differences in check-in distribution in Guangzhou, China. The results of this study show that LBSN is a reliable source of data to observe human check-in behavior in space and time within a specified geographic area. Furthermore, it shows that female users are more likely to use social media as compared to male users. The human check-in behavior patterns for social media network usage by gender seems to be slightly different during weekdays and weekend. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives:- To analyse the impact of different variables on re-peated episodes of homelessness. Method: The study was conducted based on data obtained from a representative sample of homeless people in Ma-drid (Spain) (n=188). Results: Suffering from a serious or chronic illness has an effect on the revolving door to homelessness, which is mediated by a highly negative subjective perception of the individual's own health, which is in turn mediated by suffering from a disability. Excessive alcohol con-sumption has an effect on the revolving door to homelessness, mediated by access to treatment for problems caused by alcohol consumption. Suf-fering from a serious or chronic illness correlates with having problems caused by excessive alcohol consumption. Experiencing multiple stressful life events has a direct effect on the revolving door to homelessness. Con-clusions: To prevent the revolving door to homelessness, it is necessary to remove the barriers that hinder access to normal health resources which are experienced by people suffering from social exclusion, while imple-menting ongoing support programmes for homeless people or those at risk of homelessness, which primarily deal with health issues. © 2019, Universidad de Murcia Servicio de Publicaciones.

AB  - Our research framework, built on the norm activation model (NAM), was designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the formation of consumers' pro-environmental behavioral intentions in an eco-friendly coffee shop. We employed theNAMto test its mediating effect of personal environmental norms (PEN), social environmental norms (SEN), and ascription of responsibility (AR) and the moderating effect of the overall green image (OGI) on pro-environmental behavioral intentions. Data were collected through a survey of 530 customers who frequently visited a coffee shop in Korea, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the research hypotheses. The findings generally supported the hypothesized associations of the study variables within our proposed theoretical framework (PEN, SEN, and AR in order of the mediating effect on pro-environmental behavioral intentions) and confirmed OGI's moderating effect. In addition, the study's results have important (1) theoretical and (2) practical implications for the environment. (1) They expand the originalNAMby explaining the effect of the relationship between SEN and PEN on pro-environmental customer behavioral intentions (PCBI) and confirm the mediating effect of the NAM (SEN, PEN, AR) on PCBI, as demonstrated in previous studies. (2) Moreover, the findings herein may encourage coffee shops to participate in the prevention of environmental problems by restricting the use of products such as plastic coffee cups and straws. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In many countries, such as the US, Germany, France, and the Netherlands, governments are dealing with a great shortage of organ donors. Even though people generally show positive attitudes towards organ donation, they often do not actually register as organ donors themselves. This study’s objective was to explore prevailing viewpoints among the Dutch population on deceased organ donation and the relation between aspects of the viewpoints potentially influencing the decision to register as an organ donor. Although substantive research about attitudes on organ donation has been conducted, this is the first study investigating people’s viewpoints focusing on the relation between beliefs, tastes, preferences, motives, goals and other constituents underlying people’s viewpoints on organ donation, such as the role of the media and public policies. This Q-methodology study revealed four viewpoints: “not donating your organs is a waste”, “it does not go with my religion”, “my family should decide”; and “it’s a good deed, but I’m doubtful”. These viewpoints convey information on potential reasons for the gap between people’s favourable attitudes towards organ donation and the low number of actual registrations, and opportunities for policy makers to address certain target groups more adequately. © 2019 Truijens, van Exel.

AB  - The manipulation problem in the media has been still pressing. Processes and techniques intended for making an influence on public opinion and behaviors are in ongoing improvement, making it difficult to access an objective image of the world. Therefore, this research aims at emphasizing the importance of speech (language) means that form a basis of manipulations in mass communications. To achieve this, authors have provided the systematization of social influence processes in the media and made techniques and means of speech influence clearer. Authors provided a content analysis of texts of 2018 from the media using news resources of different countries (‘Russia Today,’ ‘RIA Novosti,’ ‘Ukrinform’ and ‘Fox News Channel’) as an example. The research subject consists of news materials of a politico-social nature on Russia’s participation in the Syrian conflict. Authors have empirically revealed a clear desire to influence readers of the media resources using covert means of the manipulative influence. In total, they have found five types of manipulative speech influence in texts of the media. There are self-presentation, semantic speech strategies, persuasive strategies, hit piece and information manipulation. A lexical toolkit of speech manipulation includes euphemisms, dysphemisms, slogan words, speech metaphorization, etc. Media texts have become more and more complicated as they contain hints, precedent phenomena, irony, as well as metamessages of informative presentation. Each media of the selected ones more or less uses means of speech manipulation in varying degrees. Applications of such methods of influence (in number) almost directly depend on a political attitude towards an object. © Media Watch.

AB  - In an online Qualtrics panel survey experiment (N = 1620), we found that scientists posting self-portraits (“selfies”) to Instagram from the science lab/field were perceived as significantly warmer and more trustworthy, and no less competent, than scientists posting photos of only their work. Participants who viewed scientist selfies, especially posts containing the face of a female scientist, perceived scientists as significantly warmer than did participants who saw science-only images or control images. Participants who viewed selfies also perceived less symbolic threat from scientists. Most encouragingly, participants viewing selfies, either of male or female scientists, did not perceive scientists as any less competent than did participants viewing science-only or control images. Subjects who viewed female scientist selfies also perceived science as less exclusively male. Our findings suggest that self-portraiture by STEM professionals on social media can mitigate negative attitudes toward scientists. © 2019 Jarreau et al.

AB  - Objectives To translate and validate the Communication Skills Attitude Scale in the Polish language (CSAS-P) and its adaptation for use among registered nurses. Design A cross-sectional descriptive design was used in order to translate and validate the CSAS-P. The following psychometric properties of CSAS-P were evaluated: content validity (content validity index), theoretical relevance (exploratory and confirmative factor analysis), one-dimensionality of subscales (principal component analysis), internal consistency (Cronbach's α), test-retest reliability and discriminant validity. Setting Participants were identified and recruited from the Centre for Postgraduate Education for Nurses and Midwives in Warsaw, Poland. Participants The validation group comprised 2014 registered nurses who were undertaking a spring specialisation exam in 2017. Results The overall content validity index was >0.80, which was interpreted as indicating validity. The factor structure of CSAS-P differed from the original version, and removing three items from the scale better fit the data. The positive attitude subscale (11 items) and negative attitude subscale (12 items) were characterised by one-dimensionality and high internal consistency (Cronbach's α=0.901 and 0.802, respectively). Test-retest analysis confirmed the stability of the measurement for both subscales and particular items. Nurses with prior participation in communication courses scored significantly higher than those without such education (p<0.05), confirming the discriminant validity of CSAS-P. Conclusions The psychometric properties of CSAS-P were comparable to the English language original. Further validation of CSAS-P in other groups of healthcare professionals may increase its applicability. CSAS-P can be used to evaluate attitudes towards learning communication skills among registered nurses. © 2019 Author(s).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine mediators of improvements in infant safe-sleep (SS) practices in a mobile health intervention. METHODS: In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, mothers received SS intervention or breastfeeding control videos for 60 days. Maternal responses about infant sleep position and location (outcomes) and mediators (attitudes, perceived social norms, and perceived control) from the theory of planned behavior were assessed. Intervention effects on mediators and association between mediators and outcomes were examined. RESULTS: Of 1600 recruited, 1263 mothers participated. Mothers receiving SS videos were more likely to have positive attitudes and norms for supine sleep (attitudes: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.35 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 3.20]; norms: aOR = 1.75 [95% CI 1.27 to 2.42]) and recommended sleep location (attitudes: aOR = 1.91 [95% CI 1.54 to 2.36]; norms: aOR = 1.37 [95% CI 1.13 to 1.66]). Positive attitudes and norms toward supine sleep and room-sharing without bed-sharing were associated with higher odds of both practices (supine: aOR = 8.25 [95% CI 4.72 to 14.43] for positive attitudes and aOR = 6.67 [95% CI 4.25 to 10.46] for norms; room-sharing: aOR = 7.14 [95% CI 5.35 to 9.53] for positive attitudes and aOR = 4.44 [95% CI 3.03 to 6.51] for norms). Both positive attitudes and positive norms mediated the effect of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention achieved success in improving adherence to SS recommendations by changing maternal attitudes and norms about supine sleeping and room-sharing without bed-sharing. Recognition that these attitudes and norms appear to be the main drivers of mothers’ choices regarding infant-sleep practices should inform health messaging strategies to promote SS.

AB  - Cancer survivors manage their new status using a multitude of coping mechanisms. Coping strategies vary by individual, but are also socioculturally mediated. Scarce evidence on coping strategies adopted by Hispanic male cancer survivors (HMCS) is available to date. The purpose of this study was to explore the reaction to diagnosis and subsequent coping strategies employed by HMCS. Data were gathered through focus groups (n = 18), cognitive interviews (n = 12), and phone interviews (n = 84). Coping strategies included positive attitudes, humor, optimism and social support, use of home remedies, lifestyle changes, and faith. Findings are consistent with research on non-cancer-related coping showing that HMCS use active coping strategies, such as religion and support from family and friends. The analysis of existing strategies and needs points to the need to develop evidence-based psychosocial services that build on strengths and coping behaviors already employed by HMCS. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - This study aimed to improve our understanding of what constitutes a healthy organizational change process among university employees. Positive attitudes and proactive participation toward organizational change were presumed to affect and be affected by personality resources measured via core selfevaluations and work-related motivational well-being (vigor). The study used 3-wave longitudinal data collected in 2 large Finnish universities during their recent process of organizational change (N = 926). Structural equation modeling was used to establish the direction of the relationships between the variables. The results showed that high levels of both core self-evaluations and vigor were associated with more favorable perceptions of organizational change: employees high in core self-evaluations and vigor were more satisfied with the changes and the information provided about the changes, and were also more likely to be actively involved in the change process. It was further found that positive attitudes to change mediated the relation between vigor and core self-evaluations: vigorous employees perceived the organizational changes more positively, which in turn strengthened their internal self-evaluations. Overall, these longitudinal results show that, among university employees, core self-evaluations and vigor are both important resource factors influencing perceptions and reactions to organizational changes. © 2019 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Objectives: Although immigration policies have shifted dramatically over the course of U.S. history, few have examined their role as a source of health heterogeneity among immigrants. We address this gap by evaluating whether exposure to U.S. Immigration Policy Regimes (IPRs) corresponds with later-life disability disparities among Mexico-U.S. migrant women and men, and assess the degree to which observed differences may also be associated with immigration policies and occupational composition. Method: We analyze 8 waves of data from the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (3,044 individuals and 14,474 observations from 1993/1994-2013). Using hierarchical linear models, we estimate trajectories of physical disability associated with gender, occupation, and IPR. Results: We find differences in disability trajectories by IPR. Associations are not different between men and women, and are not mediated by occupational composition. We also observe an additive effect for certain occupations among women, but not among men. Discussion: Findings demonstrate that exposure to different IPRs is associated with disparate disability trajectories among Mexico-U.S. migrants. Future research is needed to contextualize the role of IPRs amid other mechanisms of gendered racialization that powerfully contribute to cumulative health differences across the life course. © 2019 Gerontological Society of America.

AB  - To inform the field of rehabilitation psychology about the sociocultural implications of the term disability, and explain the rationale behind the #SaytheWord movement, a social media call to embrace disability identity. Method: Review of the literature on disability terminology, the history of language use, and the relationship between attitudes toward disability and language. We reflect on the role of disability within the field of psychology and within the American Psychological Association (APA), including the underrepresentation of disabled psychologists and trainees with disabilities and the lack of mentorship opportunities available in the field. Implications: The authors argue that erasure of the word disability can have unintended and adverse consequences. We describe how erasure of disability identity in the context of current sociopolitical efforts to reduce and eliminate public services and supports for people with disabilities is especially threatening to members of the disability community. To move forward, the authors postulate that the disability movement must reconcile its own history of exclusion and adopt a disability justice framework. Conclusion: The field of psychology has a rich tradition of appreciation of cultural diversity and individual difference; yet, disability has largely been left out of these efforts. The disability movement is moving toward the status of a diverse cultural group with a social justice agenda parallel to those of other marginalized communities. The authors posit that psychology must play a stronger role in advancing the human rights of people with disabilities. © 2018 American Psychological Association.

AB  - To analyze the consequences for self-esteem of perceived discrimination against people with physical disabilities, as individuals and as a group. Method: A structural model based on the psychosocial literature was tested in a sample of 288 Spanish participants with different degrees of physical disability. This model predicted that personal perceived discrimination would be associated with the internalization of stigma that, in turn, would be negatively associated with the self-esteem of people with physical disabilities. On the other hand, group perceived discrimination, was predicted to enhance group identification and promote intention to contribute to collective action and hence have a beneficial effect on the self-esteem of people with physical disabilities. Results: The model provided a good fit to the data. The relationship between personal discrimination and the self-esteem of people with physical disabilities was completely mediated by internalized stigma. The model also showed that group perceived discrimination had only an indirect effect on self-esteem. Conclusion: This research makes two main contributions. From a theoretical perspective we found that perceived personal and group discrimination influence self-esteem through different paths. From an applied point of view, our results may contribute to the design of interventions to enhance the quality of life of people with physical disabilities. © 2018 American Psychological Association.

AB  - The unfinished Arab revolutions produced unsettling conditions, sectarian wars, counter-revolutionary wars, proxy wars and transitional democracies. US and Arab media responses could not find effective words to describe them and their underlying geopolitical implications. Whether to name them ‘protest’ or ‘unrest’, American mainstream media initially welcomed the events with a cautious curiosity while Arab media favoured a romanticized coverage. But as the protests spread fast and continued, a more dominant popular narrative in the US shaped by the ‘exceptionalist’ perspective about the Middle East emerged. This article explains how dominant discursive framings deployed a form of ‘nature talk’, specifically through names, phrases and locutions such as ‘Arab Spring’, ‘Jasmine revolution’, ‘Arab transition’, and horticultural words like ‘flower’, ‘rose’ and ‘blossom’ to describe the Arab uprisings. Because of an intellectually limiting media-produced racial vernacular during the period of mass protest, this dominant mainstream narrative spoke about the events either by using neo-imperial language that characterized the revolutions as an Islamist threat or by employing culturally reductionist vocabulary which infantilized protesters. The goal here is to place specific media frames and images that such linguistic constructions create and disseminate within the context of power relations, the politics of naming and knowledge production. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The existence of propaganda is inexorably bound to the nature of communication and communications technology. Mass communication by citizens in the digital age has been heralded as a means to counter elite propaganda; however, it also provides a forum for misinformation, aggression and hostility. The extremist group Britain First has used Facebook as a way to propagate hostility towards Muslims, immigrants and social security claimants in the form of memes, leading to a backlash from sites antithetical to their message. This article provides a memetic analysis, which addresses persuasion, organisation, political echo chambers and self-correcting online narratives; arguing that propaganda can be best understood as an evolving set of techniques and mechanisms which facilitate the propagation of ideas and actions. This allows the concept to be adapted to fit a changing political and technological landscape and to encompass both propaganda and counter-propaganda in the context of horizontal communications networks. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This study develops a model that contributes to our understanding of the complex relationship between economic motivations and anti-Muslim attitudes by analyzing the underexplored role of news consumption. Using a large-scale Dutch panel dataset (n = 2694), we test a structural equation model theoretically grounded in group conflict theory, in which the relationship between news consumption and anti-Muslim attitudes is mediated by perceptions and emotions about the economy. Findings offer sound empirical support for the hypothesized model: news consumption increases pessimistic economic perceptions and negative emotions about the economy, which in turn strengthens anti-Muslim attitudes. The mechanism, however, largely depends on the type of news outlet and genre: watching television seems more decisive than reading newspapers; moreover, especially exposure to soft and popular news formats plays a dominant role. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - It is well accepted that visits to parks improve peoples' well-being. Numerous studies highlight the positive social consequences of more intensive visits to parks, and thus its impact on well-being. Other studies emphasize the relaxing effects of parks visitors. Some studies are rooted mainly in deep ecology and Biophilia and focus on the relevance of park visits to eudemonic aspects of well-being, which may be fulfilled more by discrete visits to parks. However, their arguments are rarely empirically tested. In this study that is based on Internet and face to face samples of more than four hundred visitors to parks in Israel, we test the contribution of discrete visits to parks on well-being in general and in its eudemonic aspect, particularly, with respect to social visits. The results show that once mediated by connectedness to nature, discrete visits improve a person's well-being compared to a social visit. This result hints at the possibility that while all visitors to parks enjoy improvement in well-being, discrete visitors to parks who were socialized to feel strong sense of connectedness to nature enjoy higher levels of well-being relative to the rest of the visitors. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - This paper provides insight into strategies used by social care initiatives to create caring environments for people with a variety of abilities and disabilities. The analysis is guided by the concept of ‘micropublic places’ and builds on research about changing spaces of care and three types of spatial, symbolic and public-private boundary logics. Using ethnographic methods, we map three hybridization strategies that challenged spatial separations of functions, professional diagnostic labels, and public-private distinctions While these hybridization strategies have been analyzed separately in literature about specific vulnerable groups like psychiatric patients, this analysis shows how they combined to form new spaces of care. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: Transgender women (TGW) and cisgender men who have sex with men (cisMSM) across sub-Saharan Africa experience health inequalities relative to other adults. Recent research has also revealed health inequalities between these often-conflated groups. Among TGW and cisMSM in Côte d'Ivoire, we sought to determine whether transgender female identity was associated with probable depression, and whether sexual behavior stigma mediated this association. Methods: In 2015–2016, a cross-sectional respondent-driven sampling survey of adult TGW and cisMSM was conducted across five cities. We conducted a three-way decomposition of mediation and interaction of gender identity and sexual behavior stigma. Depression was measured by the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Results: Of 1301 participants, 339 (26.1%) were TGW. The prevalence of probable depression was 22.7% among TGW and 12.2% among cisMSM (P < .001). After confounder adjustment, the relative risk of depression attributable to transgender female gender identity was 1.68 (95% CI = 1.36, 2.00) with 69.9% (95% CI = 42.6, 97.1) of this effect mediated by sexual behavior stigma. The effect of stigma on depression did not differ significantly by gender. Conclusions: These data suggest that stigma mitigation interventions specifically addressing the stigma affecting transgender women may also address mental health inequalities between transgender women and cisMSM in Côte d'Ivoire. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia is one of the most stigmatized psychiatric disorders, and disclosing it is often a source of stress to individuals with the disorder. The Coming Out Proud (COP) group intervention is designed to reduce the stigma’s negative impact and help participants decide if they want to disclose their disorder. Aims: To assess the effect of the COP intervention in individuals with the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Methods: A pilot study of 3 2-hour group lessons (6–12 participants) per week. Individuals were selected from three specialized outpatient services in São Paulo, Brazil; 46 people were willing to participate, 11 dropped out during the intervention and 4 were excluded due to low intelligence quotient (IQ), resulting in a final sample of 31 participants. Outcomes were assessed before (T0/baseline) and after (T1/directly) after the COP intervention, and at 3-week follow-up (T2/3 weeks after T1). We applied eight scales, of which four scales are analyzed in this article (Coming Out with Mental Illness Scale (COMIS), Cognitive Appraisal of Stigma as a Stressor (CogApp), Self-Stigma of Mental Illness Scale-Short Form (SSMIS) and Perceived Devaluation-Discrimination Questionnaire (PDDQ)). Results: People who completed the COP intervention showed a significant increase in the decision to disclose their diagnosis (22.5% in T0 vs 67.7% in T2). As to the perception of stigma as a stressor, mean values significantly increased after the intervention (T0 = 3.83, standard deviation (SD) =.92 vs T2 = 4.44, SD = 1.05; p =.006). Two results had marginal significance: self-stigma was reduced (T0 = 3.10, SD = 1.70 vs T2 = 2.73, SD = 1.87; p =.063), while perceived discrimination increased (T0 = 2.68, SD =.55 vs T2 = 2.93, SD =.75; p =.063). Conclusion: This study suggests that the COP group intervention facilitated participants’ disclosure decisions, and the increasing awareness of stigma as a stressor in life may have facilitated their decision to eventually disclose their disorder. The results raise questions that require further analysis, taking sociocultural factors into account, as stigma is experienced differently across cultures. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - We examined the effect of political rhetoric on the targets of that rhetoric. Drawing from scholarship on anti-Mexican and anti-immigrant rhetoric found readily in various media and scholarship on emotions, we tested four hypotheses. Hypotheses 1 and 2 predicted that positive and negative political rhetoric would increase and decrease positive and negative emotions, respectively. Hypotheses 3 and 4 then predicted that emotional responses to positive or negative political rhetoric would influence perceived stress, subjective health, and subjective well-being. Data collection occurred between August 2016 and June 2017 at a university in California. A sample of 280 Mexican-origin youth, defined broadly as having at least one ancestor born in Mexico or the participant themselves born in Mexico, participated in an experiment where they were randomly assigned to one of three study conditions: viewing (1) positive or (2) negative political rhetoric about immigrants and Latinos in general, or (3) neutral rhetoric as a control condition before providing qualitative responses to open-ended questions and completing measures of positive and negative affect, perceived stress, subjective health, and subjective well-being. Qualitative responses indicated that negative and positive political rhetoric elicited a range of negative emotions and positive emotions, respectively. Quantitative analysis with independent samples t-tests, ANOVA, and linear regression models found that negative political rhetoric elicited higher negative affect than positive and neutral rhetoric, and positive rhetoric elicited higher positive affect than negative and neutral rhetoric. Negative emotional responses, in turn, were associated with participants’ higher perceived stress, lower subjective health and lower subjective well-being. Conversely, positive emotional responses were associated with lower perceived stress, higher subjective health, and higher subjective well-being. Positive political rhetoric, by eliciting positive emotions, can have a salubrious effect. Altogether, these findings suggest that political rhetoric matters for the targets of that rhetoric. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Why do people have anti-immigrant attitudes? We proposed that individuals’ need for cognitive closure—an epistemic motivation associated with an aversion to change in established environments—is predictive of a dislike of immigrants through increased binding to powerful groups. In four studies, collected in both Italy (Study 1) and the United States (Studies 2–4), we found that there were effects of need for cognitive closure on anti-immigrant attitudes, as well as indirect effects through binding. These results were significant controlling for participants’ political orientation (Studies 2–4), when either dispositional measure (Studies 1–3) or an experimental induction (Study 4) of need for cognitive closure was used, and when both general attitudes toward immigrants (Studies 1, 2, 4) and attitudes toward immigrants’ economic impact (Studies 3 and 4) were assessed. © 2019

AB  - Parasitic diseases are among the major health problems of various societies, especially people in developing countries, causing high economic and mortality burdens. Many researchers have reported that awareness and knowledge of a disease are effective in preventing and controlling the disease. The aim of the present study was to assess the knowledge and attitudes on parasitic diseases of the population in Ahvaz County, southwestern Iran. This community-based cross-sectional study was carried out in 2017 on 3500 subjects above 15 years old of Ahvaz County. First, participants were provided the necessary information regarding the study, and then data were collected using a constructed questionnaire. Of the 3500 participants, 1732 (49.5%) were female and 1768 (50.5%) were male, 348 (9.9%) said that they had been infected with a parasitic disease at least once in their lifetime. Almost half of the participants (42.8%) knew malaria was a parasitic disease and 50.2%, 48.9%, and 41.5% were aware of the possible transmission of parasitic diseases through uncooked meat, dirty hands, and close contact with animals. Regarding clinical symptoms, 73.2% and 32.6% of the respondents knew diarrhea and abdominal pain respectively were clinical symptoms of intestinal parasitic diseases. However, only 31.3% were aware of the close contact with cats and the risk of human toxoplasmosis and possible abortion in pregnant women. The findings reveal that the attitude of most participants toward treatment was positive (93.9%), but only 47.5% of believed that disinfecting fruits and vegetables could prevent intestinal parasitic infections. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The phenomenon of scandal(ization) has become omnipresent in contemporary political media discourses – at the latest since the 2016 US presidential election. Our article addresses causes and effects of this recent prevalence of scandal narratives. By connecting concepts from social systems theory and media theory, we consider crucial practices and processes of scandal construction in the 2016 US presidential election, focusing on the much-noticed emailgate and trumptape scandals. Both examples serve to illustrate how the emergence of partial public spheres in social media may lead to a fight for sovereignty over scandal discourse, political attitudes, and the negotiation of social norms, morals, and values. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are a non-native invasive species in the United States that cause significant economic loss, transmit disease, and inflict damage upon natural resources, agriculture, livestock, and property. Geographic distribution of wild pigs in the United States has nearly tripled since 1982, with anthropogenic influences playing a significant role in the expansion. In this regard, there is speculation that a driver of the expansion may be human-mediated movement of wild pigs to new areas for the purpose of sport hunting. In response, states have implemented a variety of wild pig control policies, including legal restrictions on their transport. The success of such policies depends, in part, on their level of public support, which in turn may be influenced by individuals’ attitudes concerning wild pigs, their interest in maintaining wild pig populations (e.g., for sport hunting), and their knowledge and awareness of the threats wild pigs pose. Multiple regression was used to analyze data collected from a nationwide survey concerning attitudes toward wild pigs and policies that restrict their transport. Results indicate that a majority of individuals in the United States have negative attitudes toward wild pigs and support policies that restrict their transport and penalize transgressors. Consistent with other invasive species research, findings suggest that as knowledge and awareness of wild pigs increase, so too does support for policies restricting and penalizing transport of wild pigs. Contrary to previous studies, this research also finds that hunters are more likely to support restrictions on wild pig transport than are non-hunters. Overall, these findings suggest that legal restrictions on the transport of wild pigs, even in states with large hunter populations, enjoy broad public support and may help to curb the expansion of wild pig populations. © 2019

AB  - Recently, second language (L2) instruction has benefitted from the development of instructional technology such as synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC). The present study was conducted to investigate learner perception of the effectiveness of SCMC interactions for L2 learning and building intercultural competence. Students (n = 55) from three different universities in Korea, Japan, and Taiwan participated in a joint online class for one semester. The purpose of the class was to facilitate students’ development of linguistic and intercultural competence by interacting with peers from different cultures online. This study set out to examine the relation between learner perception and interactional features during group discussions. A range of data collection instruments were employed, including a questionnaire to track change in learner perception over time, interviews, and transcripts of interactions during each chat session. Results from linear mixed effect models suggest that among various interactional features, the following two variables were found to be significant predictors of positive attitudes towards SCMC: the amount of students’ attention to language and cultural issues during online discussion. Findings are discussed in light of developing effective SCMC-based language courses. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Attitude change and persuasion are among the most studied topics in social psychology. Surprisingly, though, as a field we have virtually zero insight into perceived attitude change—that is, how people assess the magnitude of a shift in someone's attitude or opinion. The current research provides an initial investigation of this issue. Across 6 primary experiments and a series of supplemental studies (total N = 2880), we find consistent support for a qualitative change hypothesis, whereby qualitative attitude change (change of valence; e.g., from negative to positive) is perceived as greater than otherwise equivalent non-qualitative attitude change (change within valence; e.g., from negative to less negative or from positive to more positive). This effect is mediated by ease of processing: Qualitative attitude change is easier for people to detect and understand than non-qualitative attitude change, and this ease amplifies the degree of perceived change. We examine downstream consequences of this effect and discuss theoretical, methodological, and practical implications. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Research on de-radicalisation has been primarily concerned with the efficacy of de-radicalisation programmes and their negative consequences. However, there has been little research on how the public perceives de-radicalisation programmes and whether they are viewed as effective or desirable. It is important to understand public attitudes to de-radicalisation programmes because public opinion can affect the capacity to deliver the programmes. The following article takes a first step towards understanding these issues by examining how The Daily Mail has framed de-radicalisation in terms of whether or not the programmes are effective or desirable. We argue that an assumption of potential efficacy exists throughout the newspaper’s framing of de-radicalisation which presents the policy as desirable, despite also framing de-radicalisation as ineffective. While practitioners are reluctant to promote de-radicalisation programmes, The Daily Mail’s framing of de-radicalisation as natural, logical and desirable reflects the concept’s ideological flexibility as both a rehabilitative and normative endeavour. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - In this study, we test to what extent an educational video on the intricacies of antibiotic resistance affects public attitudes towards antibiotic resistance and how such information is absorbed by the most likely targets of public health campaigns. We use a representative sample of 2037 individuals (from 2016) to test how people respond to a video educating them about antibiotic resistance. Our results show that receiving information does increase the general awareness of antibiotic resistance among our respondents. Yet, these effects are most profound for those who are the most likely targets of such information: the least knowledgeable group and those who have a more apathetic worldview. Our results are in line with suggestions made by the knowledge deficit model and show that the influence of cultural predispositions on the uptake of information about antibiotic resistance should not be ignored in future campaigns. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - During the past decades, studies of acculturation and ideology have received great attention in social psychology, especially among western countries. But few such investigations have been conducted in Asia. In this study, we measured personal and normative support of three intergroup ideologies in the context of mainland China, and explored their mediating roles between social dominance orientation and prejudice. Surveys were conducted among 158 Chinese university students in Hangzhou, China. Results of the present study showed that the dominant societal ideology among Chinese respondents was multiculturalism, rather than assimilation or colorblindness. Moreover, based on the proposition that support for different ideologies was likely to have different effects in different countries, mediation model of personal support for ideologies was examined in the current context. As revealed, when the social norms were salient, personal support for multiculturalism mediated the relationship between social dominance orientation and prejudice, while personal support for assimilation or colorblindness did not. The present study provided additional evidence to the previous theory, implications and suggestions were further discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The impact of knowledge on public attitudes toward scientific issues remains unclear, due in part to ill-defined differences in how research designs conceptualize knowledge. Using genetically modified foods as a framework, we explore the impacts of perceived familiarity and factual knowledge, and the moderating roles of media attention and a food-specific attitudinal variable (food consciousness), in shaping these relationships. Based on the differential effects on “negative attitudes” toward genetically modified foods, we provide further evidence that the measures of knowledge are separate concepts and argue against a one-dimensional view of scientific knowledge. We discuss implications for understanding the relationship between knowledge and science attitudes. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Recently, the restaurant industry has witnessed an unprecedented rise of healthy restaurant brands. However, the existing literature offers little guidance on how to effectively leverage such brands in the marketplace. To address this gap, the current research examines a novel marketing strategy (i.e., using handwritten typeface on menus) that enhances consumer responses to healthy restaurant brands. The results show that handwritten typeface creates a competitive advantage by conveying a sense of human touch, which subsequently induces the perception that love is symbolically imbued in the restaurant's offerings. The belief that “menu contains love” leads to a wide range of favorable consumer responses including positive attitudes toward the menu, enhanced perceived healthiness of the brand, and higher social media engagement. The results show that these positive effects occur only when the restaurant brand is health-focused. Moreover, the handwritten typeface effect with healthy restaurants is observed in both social and solo dining contexts. Implications for branding, visual design, and menu psychology are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Expanded carrier screening (ECS) aims to inform couples’ reproductive choice, preferably before conception. As part of an implementation study in which trained general practitioners (GPs) offered a population-based ECS couple-test, we evaluated the feasibility of the test-offer and degree of participant informed choice (IC). Trained GPs from nine practices in the northern Netherlands invited 4295 female patients aged 18–40 to take part in couple-based ECS. Inclusion criteria were having a male partner, planning for children and not being pregnant. We evaluated the feasibility of the organizational aspects, GP competence and the content of the pre-test counselling. Participant satisfaction, evaluation of pre-test counselling and degree of IC were measured using a longitudinal survey. We explored GP experiences and their views on future implementation through semi-structured interviews. 130 consultations took place. All participating GPs were assessed by genetic professionals to be competent to conduct pre-test counselling. Most (63/108 (58%)) consultations took place within the planned 20 min (median 20, IQR 18–28). GPs considered couples’ prior knowledge level an important determinant of consultation length. 91% of patients were (very) satisfied with the GP counselling. After pre-test counselling, 231/237(97%) participants had sufficient knowledge and 206/231(88%) had a positive attitude and proceeded with testing. Our pilot demonstrates that offering couple-based ECS through trained and motivated GPs is feasible. Future large-scale implementation requires a well-informed general public and a discussion about appropriate reimbursement for GPs and health care coverage for couples. Providing (more) test information pre-appointment may help reduce average consultation time. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - The authors illustrate how applied theater practices were used in media literacy classes to educate students about acts of religious discrimination in their societies. These practices helped students acknowledge their role in reifying or dismantling these prejudices in and through their classroom interactions with their peers from other religions (in academic discourse, the religious other). The analysis demonstrates how students created and performed plays in interfaith teams with the objective of examining their prejudice about the other. In scripting and performing together, students developed new, affective bonds based on personal experiences of working as teammates. This change in their interpersonal relations with their classmates encouraged students to imagine new possibilities of coexisting with differences. © 2019 International Literacy Association

AB  - Five studies illuminate how the demands of the roles that people occupy can sometimes contribute to the maintenance of group inequality by promoting the accommodation of others’ biases, even when those biases disadvantage an in-group or clash with personal views. When role demands to maximize candidate fit in hiring selections were strong, preference for job candidates of a given group tended to be lower when there were cues to third-party prejudice against that group (vs. no cues), irrespective of in-group favoritism effects (Studies 1–5) or participant attitudes (Studies 4 and 5). We found supporting evidence for the underlying processes in the context of hiring selections involving fictional groups (Study 1) as well as female job candidates (Studies 2–5). A concern with meeting the demands of the gatekeeper role was at the root of prejudice accommodation: When role-demands to prioritize candidate fit were strong, role-relevant considerations (interpersonal and task-focused) mediated the accommodation effect (Studies 1 and 4). The more gatekeepers in charge of hiring sought to meet role demands by considering the preferences of relevant third parties, the more they accommodated third-party prejudice (Study 2). Moreover, role-based concerns mediated the accommodation of prejudice—but not other potential considerations that were unrelated to role demands (Study 3). Finally, the accommodation effect was eliminated when the role definition did not prioritize candidate fit (Study 4) and when we experimentally reduced the strength of role-related concerns (Study 5). These findings illustrate the relevance of the role concept for understanding the social transmission of bias. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Contents published on social media have an impact on individuals and on their decision making. Knowing the sentiment toward diabetes is fundamental to understanding the impact that such information could have on people affected with this health condition and their family members. The objective of this study is to analyze the sentiment expressed in messages on diabetes posted on Twitter. Method: Tweets including one of the terms “diabetes,” “t1d,” and/or “t2d” were extracted for one week using the Twitter standard API. Only the text message and the number of followers of the users were extracted. The sentiment analysis was performed by using SentiStrength. Results: A total of 67 421 tweets were automatically extracted, of those 3.7% specifically referred to T1D; and 6.8% specifically mentioned T2D. One or more emojis were included in 7.0% of the posts. Tweets specifically mentioning T2D and that did not include emojis were significantly more negative than the tweets that included emojis (–2.22 vs −1.48, P <.001). Tweets on T1D and that included emojis were both significantly more positive and also less negative than tweets without emojis (1.71 vs 1.49 and −1.31 vs −1.50, respectively; P <.005). The number of followers had a negative association with positive sentiment strength (r = –.023, P <.001) and a positive association with negative sentiment (r =.016, P <.001). Conclusion: The use of sentiment analysis techniques on social media could increase our knowledge of how social media impact people with diabetes and their families and could help to improve public health strategies. © 2018 Diabetes Technology Society.

AB  - Background: Advance care planning for end-of-life care emerged in the mid-1970’s to address the need for tools, such as the advance directive (AD) legal document, to guide medical decision-making among seriously ill patients, their families, and healthcare providers. Objective: Study aims examine providers’ perspectives on AD education that involve examining (1) a range of attitudes about educating patients, (2) whether prior knowledge was associated with practice behaviors in educating patients, and (3) specific factors among healthcare providers such as characteristics of work setting, knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors that may influence AD education and documentation. Design: To examine providers’ views, we conducted a cross-sectional, online survey questionnaire of healthcare providers using social media outreach methods for recruitment. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional survey design to examine the proposed aims. Healthcare providers, recruited through a broad approach using snowball methods, were invited to participate in an online survey. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine providers’ views toward AD education. Results: Of 520 participants, findings indicate that most healthcare providers said that they were knowledgeable about AD education. They also viewed providing education as beneficial to their practice. These findings suggest that having a positive attitude toward AD education and experiencing less organizational barriers indicate a higher likelihood that providers will educate patients regarding ADs. Conclusion: Various disciplines are represented in this study, which indicates that attitudes and knowledge influence AD discussions. The importance of AD discussions initiated by healthcare providers is critical to providing optimal patient-centered care. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of the current study is to examine the determinants of wage floors set by state governments in the United States, with a particular focus on the effects of income inequality and ethnic diversity. Method: We estimate the effects of income inequality, ethnic diversity, and their interaction on real state minimum wages using a state-level panel of Census demographic data from 1981 to 2010. We also control for state-level demographics and additional state-level information, such as measures of voter and government liberalism, along with time and state fixed effects. Results: We find that the impact of income inequality is mediated by ethnic diversity. When states are highly ethnically homogeneous, increases in income inequality are associated with higher state minimum wages. When states are highly ethnically heterogeneous, increases in income inequality are associated with lower state minimum wages. The impact of income inequality lacks statistical significance when levels of ethnic diversity are either average or somewhat below average. Conclusions: Overall, our results suggest that the negative impact on state minimum wages in heterogeneous states could stem from rising income inequality, which increases the social distance between whites and other ethnic groups and weakens mass support for wage policies that are believed by the public to be beneficial to the poor. © 2019 by the Southwestern Social Science Association

AB  - Studies that have engaged parasport broadcasting, particularly through a narrative lens, have almost exclusively relied on textual and/or content analysis of the Paralympic Games as the source of cultural critique. We know far less about the decisions taken inside Paralympic broadcasters that have led to such representations. In this study – based on interviews with senior production and promotion staff at the United Kingdom’s Paralympic broadcaster, Channel 4 – we provide the first detailed examination of mediated parasport from this vantage point. We explore the use of promotional devices such as athletes’ backstories – the ‘Hollywood treatment’ – to both hook audiences and serve as a vehicle for achieving its social enterprise mandate to change public attitudes towards disability. In so doing, we reveal myriad tensions that coalesce around representing the Paralympics, with respect to the efforts made to balance the competing goals of key stakeholders and a stated desire to make the Paralympics both a commercial and socially progressive success. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The current research investigates whether automatic associations between race and social class predict deliberative attitudes toward wealth redistribution policies. In three studies, we found that participants were significantly more likely to associate African Americans (vs. White Americans) with the concept of poor in an implicit task. In addition, we found that this implicit association between poor and African Americans predicted explicit attitudes toward wealth redistribution (Study 1)—an effect mediated by the belief that redistributive policies benefit African Americans over White Americans (Study 2). Further, these associations held when controlling for implicit affective associations and explicit prejudice. Manipulating people's metacognitive beliefs about the validity of their implicit associations shifted whether implicit Black-poor associations predicted support for wealth redistribution (Study 3). Overall, these findings suggest race/class associations are well-learned, spontaneously activated, and may predict explicit policy attitudes toward wealth redistribution above and beyond implicit or explicit affective prejudice. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aim: The objective of this study was to elucidate the effects of a sense of attachment to the community (attachment) and participation in community activities (participation) on motivation to participate in dementia prevention and support activities (motivation). Methods: We conducted a nationwide Web-based questionnaire survey of 1693 men and women aged ≥20 years. The questionnaire items used in the analysis asked about the following: (i) demographic characteristics (i.e. gender, age, marital status, household income (monitor-registered data), elderly family members, number of years of residency); (ii) attachment; (iii) participation; (iv) self-assessment of dementia knowledge; (v) nursing care experience; (vi) contact with individuals with dementia; (vii) attitudes towards dementia and people with dementia; and (viii) motivation. Results: Positivity towards dementia and negativity towards dementia were extracted as factors in exploratory factor analysis of attitudes towards dementia and people with dementia. Multiple regression analysis with extracted factors as dependent variables showed that attachment and participation exerted positive effects on attitudes towards dementia (both P < 0.001). The direct effects of attachment and participation on motivation were significant in hierarchical multiple regression analysis (both P < 0.001), and path analysis demonstrated the paths of the effects of attachment and participation on motivation (both P < 0.001). The bias-corrected bootstrap method showed that both attachment and participation exerted direct and indirect (via the mediation of attitudes towards dementia) effects on motivation to participate in the community (all P < 0.001). Conclusion: The results showed that attachment and participation were both determinants of positive attitudes towards dementia and, thus, exerted effects on motivation, both directly and indirectly. These findings suggested that the enhancement of attachment and promotion of participation could lead to the promotion of dementia prevention and support activities in communities and increase dementia awareness. © 2018 Japanese Psychogeriatric Society

AB  - Prejudice against people with mental illnesses remains a significant problem in the United Kingdom and in many other countries despite sustained efforts by governments and charities. This is particularly so for people with schizophrenia, who are seen as dangerous and unpredictable. The present study investigated the effect of brief, casual, stereotypical representations on prejudice and behavioural intentions towards people with schizophrenia. Participants viewed Halloween costumes in an online environment under the guise of product research. In the experimental condition, they were exposed to a “Psycho Ward” Halloween outfit identical to one sold online by a leading supermarket chain in the United Kingdom. Participants in the control condition saw a neutral “pumpkin” Halloween costume. Exposure to the Psycho Ward outfit resulted in more negative behavioural intentions towards people with schizophrenia, mediated by increased prejudice. These findings confirm and extend earlier research that implicates adverse media stereotypes in the persistence of prejudice against people with mental illness. More research is warranted on the relative effects of different influences on community attitudes to mental illness. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study investigated the associations among reading strategy instruction, student motivational factors (i.e., attitudes toward reading, reading self-concept, and motivation to read), gender, and reading achievement. The analyses were conducted using the Hong Kong sample (students at Level 1, n = 3,875 and teachers at Level 2, n = 133) from the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study 2011 through multilevel structural equation modeling. The results showed that, first, the relation between the frequency of reading strategy instruction and student reading achievement was mediated by student attitudes toward reading. Second, the frequency of reading strategy instruction was significantly related to student attitudes toward reading and motivation to read and student attitudes toward reading was significantly associated with reading achievement. Finally, girls had more positive attitudes toward reading, more positive reading self-concept, higher motivation to read, and higher reading achievement than boys. These findings may shed light on how teachers should arrange their reading strategy instruction to interplay with student attitudes toward reading and motivation to read and to help improve reading achievement. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective: Our objective is to examine the relationship of patient and provider characteristics and communication with chronic non-cancer pain and opioid management in primary care. Method: We conducted an observational study using audio-recorded primary care appointments (up to 3/patient)and self-reported assessments of primary care providers (PCPs)and patients. We coded visit transcripts for 1)opioid and pain management talk and 2)mental health and opioid safety talk. Results: Eight PCPs and 30 patients had complete data for 78 clinic visits. PCPs and patients engaged in more opioid and pain management talk when patients reported greater pain catastrophizing and PCPs reported higher psychosocial orientation. PCPs and patients engaged in talk about mental health and opioid safety when patients reported greater anxiety, higher working alliance with their PCP, and when PCPs reported higher burnout. PCPs’ negative attitudes about opioids were associated with fewer discussions about mental health and opioid safety. Conclusions: Our results should facilitate design of interventions that improve communication and, ultimately, pain outcomes for patients. Practice Implications: Clinicians can use our results to increase patient engagement in discussions about opioid use and pain management or mental health and safety discussions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With the use of genetic technology, researchers have the potential to inform medical diagnoses and treatment in actionable ways. Accurate variant interpretation is a necessary condition for the utility of genetic technology to unfold. This relies on the ability to access large genomic datasets so that comparisons can be made between variants of interest. This can only be successful if DNA and medical data are donated by large numbers of people to ‘research’, including clinical, non-profit and for-profit research initiatives, in order to be accessed by scientists and clinicians worldwide. The objective of the ‘Your DNA, Your Say’ global survey is to explore public attitudes, values and opinions towards willingness to donate and concerns regarding the donation of one's personal data for use by others. Using a representative sample of 8967 English-speaking publics from the UK, the USA, Canada and Australia, we explore the characteristics of people who are unwilling (n = 1426) to donate their DNA and medical information, together with an exploration of their reasons. Understanding this perspective is important for making sense of the interaction between science and society. It also helps to focus engagement initiatives on the issues of concern to some publics. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: Currently, consumers can easily access social media to share information and experiences. How a relationship between these consumers influences their decisions has not been clearly investigated. When consumers participate in information sharing activities, they usually communicate with each other and can perceive their social distance from others. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore the direct and indirect effects of perceived social distance on eWOM sharing intentions. Design/methodology/approach: Specifically, a moderated mediation model was validated, in which the indirect effect of perceived social distance on eWOM sharing intentions through reciprocity expectations was moderated by trust. Findings: Perceived social distance had a positive indirect effect on eWOM sharing intentions through reciprocity expectations, which was found to be negatively moderated by trust. Originality/value: This study integrates the concept of perceived social distance into the eWOM research area. Moreover, this result adds to the s-commerce literature by specifying the conditions of the indirect effect of perceived social distance through reciprocity expectations on eWOM sharing intention. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Functional foods which enhance satiety and hence offer appetite control can support weight loss efforts, but consumers’ perceptions of such products are not fully understood. Urban-dwelling Australian consumers (n = 1629) trying to lose or to maintain weight rated written product concepts offering appetite control benefits for purchase intent and believability. In general, all product concepts were rated moderately for purchase intent, although products that were more likely to be commonly consumed, and that were a solid format received significantly higher ratings. Believability of product concept statements was found to vary significantly depending on product category. Compared to consumers trying to maintain their weight, consumers actively trying to lose weight tended to rate product concepts higher for purchase intent, despite similar scores for believability of concept. Age, gender and a sceptical attitude towards functional foods did not tend to strongly influence purchase intent and believability of product concepts offering appetite control. Actively trying to lose or maintain weight also had little influence over the degree to which consumers believed the product concept would deliver the benefits it was claiming. The association between a positive attitude towards functional foods and both purchase intent and believability was significant across all product concept categories, although the impact on purchase intent was largely mediated through believability. In assessing information provided about the active ingredients and functionality of the products, consumers rated as the two most important attributes that the products were clinically tested and that the active ingredient was derived from fruits and vegetables. In a broader perspective, careful communication of the clinical efficacy and effective consumption of appetite control products to assist with weight loss seems warranted. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Children with autism are more likely to be socially excluded than their neurotypical peers. Since the majority of children with autism attend mainstream schools, interventions are needed to improve the attitudes and behaviours of their peers. Many studies highlight the influence of contact on positive attitudes and reduced discrimination. Group music-making provides an ideal opportunity for positive contact to occur in the classroom. This study evaluated the impact of music-based contact with autistic peers on the attitudes, emotions and behaviours of neurotypical children. Changes in those with autism were also assessed. Neurotypical participants (n = 55) aged 10–11 years took part in an 11-week music programme designed to increase social interaction, which either did or did not include contact with autistic children (n = 10). Measures of attitudes, emotions and behaviours were assessed at baseline and follow-up. In response to a hypothetical scenario depicting social exclusion of a child with autism, neurotypical participants in the contact group showed a greater increase in prosocial emotions and a greater decrease in tendency to be a victim than those in the no-contact group. Participants with autism also showed a 19.7% decrease in victimisation. Implications of group music-making for tackling social exclusion of children with autism are discussed. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The field of social robotics offers an unprecedented opportunity to probe the process of impression formation and the effects of identity-based stereotypes (e.g. about gender or race) on social judgements and interactions. We present the concept of fair proxy communication-a form of robot-mediated communication that proceeds in the absence of potentially biasing identity cues-and describe how this application of social robotics may be used to illuminate implicit bias in social cognition and inform novel interventions to reduce bias. We discuss key questions and challenges for the use of robots in research on the social cognition of bias and offer some practical recommendations. We conclude by discussing boundary conditions of this new form of interaction and by raising some ethical concerns about the inclusion of social robots in psychological research and interventions.

AB  - Introduction: This study explored what influences the use of social media platforms within the CPD of occupational therapy students and qualified occupational therapists. It also considered perceived barriers to its use and whether age in line with generation theory, in particular digital natives vs digital immigrants impacted on willingness to utilise social media within CPD. Method: A mixed method survey design was utilised to collect qualitative and quantitative data through an online questionnaire. Content analysis was used to code and identify themes. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify the findings and consider variations across the digital native/immigrant divide. Findings: Results highlighted that there was a predominantly positive attitude to social media use within CPD. Accessibility, networking and learning were highlighted advantages to its use. The results suggest that the digital native/immigrant divide does not impact on willingness to use social media within CPD but does impact on confidence in using platforms professionally. Conclusion: The study has highlighted a need for more structured teaching on professional social media use within the occupational therapy curriculum in both undergraduate and post graduate programmes. It has also highlighted a need for more training among qualified occupational therapists if platforms are to be embraced more universally. © 2017, © 2017 UCU.

AB  - The German Democratic Republic (GDR; East Germany) had an ambivalent relationship with homosexuality. Under the principles of socialism, everyone was welcome to contribute to the greater good. The situation for queer people, here lesbians and gay men, was different: one of illegality and invisibility. A difficulty in analyzing these experiences is the theory and methodology necessary to find them and draw them together in a historical narrative. This essay offers a mode of analysis in which theories of affect illustrate long-term trends in East German conceptualizations of same-sex sexuality. By discussing a 1950 court ruling and a 1989 film, the essay demonstrates the persistence of homophobic prejudice and fear of homosexual seduction of young people and the links to historical and legal developments. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) populations experience disparities in health outcomes, both physical and mental, compared to their heterosexual and cisgender peers. This commentary confronts the view held by some researchers that the disparate rates of mental health problems reported among LGBT populations are the consequences of pursuing a particular life trajectory, rather than resulting from the corrosive and persistent impact of stigma. Suggesting that mental health disparities among LGBT populations arise internally, de novo, when individuals express non-heterosexual and non-conforming gender identities ignores the vast body of evidence documenting the destructive impact of socially mediated stigma and systemic discrimination on health outcomes for a number of minorities, including sexual and gender minorities. Furthermore, such thinking is antithetical to widely accepted standards of health and wellbeing because it implies that LGBT persons should adopt and live out identities that contradict or deny their innermost feelings of self. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Extant literature on social media in education highlights the importance of improving social media-supported learning environments. This study adds to the literature by examining students’ perception and participation for three types of Twitter-based instrumental activities—backchanneling, exploring hashtags, and topics discussion—in two unique undergraduate classrooms (education vs. communication) over the period of a 14-week semester. By employing a comparative case study research design, this study revealed insights into how students may respond to the same Twitter classroom integration activities to a varying degree according to their differences in pre-class perceptions and behavioral patterns. We found that both classes manifested an overall positive attitude toward the integration of Twitter in class along with active participation. However, the communication students manifested a more favorable pre-perception of Twitter and showed a higher participation pattern in class. We also provide pedagogical implications and recommendations for instructors intending to apply or replicate the three instructional activities employed in this study. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - AIM: As communication skills are essential for medical practice, many medical schools have added communication skills training to their curricula in recent years. The aim of this study was to determine and compare the attitudes to communication skills of family medicine, internal medicine and general surgery residents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Family medicine, internal medicine and general surgery residents of three training and research hospitals and one university hospital in Ankara were included in this cross-sectional study. A questionnaire was used for obtaining information about age, gender, marital status, graduation date and whether receiving any training for communication skills. The Turkish version of the Communication Skills Attitude Scale was used. RESULTS: In all, 58 (50%) family medicine, 30 (25.9%) internal medicine, and 28 (24.1%) general surgery residents were accepted to participate in the study. Of the 116 residents, 58 (50%) were female and 58 (50%) were male, with a mean age of 29.47±4.63 years, and 68 (58.6%) of them were married; 59.5% of the participants received training about communication skills and 56.5% of them received it at medical school. The mean positive attitude scale (PAS) score was 3.85±0.58, and the mean negative attitude scale (NAS) score was 2.42±0.52. The PAS scores of female residents were higher than those of males (P=0.01). The PAS scores of residents who received communication skills training were higher than the scores of those who had not (P=0.01). The PAS scores of family medicine residents were higher and the NAS scores were lower than those of internal medicine and general surgery residents. CONCLUSION: The communication skill attitudes of family medicine residents were better than those of internal medicine and general surgery residents.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the mediating role of work atmosphere which have a positive influence on job satisfaction. Specifically, it focuses on how supervisor’s cooperation and career growth affect job satisfaction mediating through work atmosphere in a private corporate entity. Design/methodology/approach: To attain this objective, a research framework with a mediating variable of work atmosphere was formulated. Using measurement scales created to assess different aspects of job satisfaction, career growth, supervisor’s cooperation and work atmosphere, a survey instrument was developed to test the various relationships implied by the framework. Data (n = 325) were collected from the employees of a local chemical company in Bangladesh following convenience sampling procedure. The analysis has been done by bootstrapping procedure following structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings: The result shows that work atmosphere has a significant mediating role in linking supervisor cooperation and job satisfaction of the employees in the organization. Research limitations/implications: As with any study, there are limitations to the study described here. One possible drawback is the use of a single company’s employees as respondents. Second, the sample size is not very large, because respondents were observed to be negligent in filling the questionnaire provided to them. If the sample size could be increased a bit more, then the authors might have better outcomes as postulated in the paper. Nevertheless, the usual cautions about over-generalizing findings from this sample, to populations for which it is not strictly representative, apply. The sample was not randomly drawn to represent a population to which findings could be generalized. Instead, it was a convenience sample, and as such, the ability to generalize the findings very far beyond the sample is limited. Practical implications: From a practical perspective, as a cumulative body of work on job satisfaction with mediating variable of work atmosphere emerges, the authors will be better able to advise employers on the elements they need to address to increase their employee retention rate. In this study, the one area of findings that may help business and commercial organizations the most concerns work environment in the workplace. The authors found that supervisor cooperation and work atmosphere were associated with positive path value toward job satisfaction. Similarly, career growth and work atmosphere also exhibit positive path value towards job satisfaction. The implication is that employers can focus on supervisor cooperation in rightly and duly promoting the deserving employees, and in doing so, they can generate positive attitudes toward these activities. Originality/value: This paper will add immense importance of work atmosphere to the organizational learning and behavior. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: In remote rural Tanzania, the rate of linkage into HIV care was estimated at 28% in 2014. This study explored facilitators and barriers to linkage to HIV care at individual/patient, health care provider, health system, and contextual levels to inform eventual design of interventions to improve linkage to HIV care. Methods: We conducted a descriptive qualitative study nested in a cohort study of 1012 newly diagnosed HIV-positive individuals in Mbeya region between August 2014 and July 2015. We conducted 8 focus group discussions and 10 in-depth interviews with recently diagnosed HIV-positive individuals and 20 individual interviews with healthcare providers. Transcripts were analyzed inductively using thematic content analysis. The emergent themes were then deductively fitted into the four level ecological model. Results: We identified multiple factors influencing linkage to care. HIV status disclosure, support from family/relatives and having symptoms of disease were reported to facilitate linkage at the individual level. Fear of stigma, lack of disclosure, denial and being asymptomatic, belief in witchcraft and spiritual beliefs were barriers identified at individual’s level. At providers’ level; support and good patient-staff relationship facilitated linkage, while negative attitudes and abusive language were reported barriers to successful linkage. Clear referral procedures and well-organized clinic procedures were system-level facilitators, whereas poorly organized clinic procedures and visit schedules, overcrowding, long waiting times and lack of resources were reported barriers. Distance and transport costs to HIV care centers were important contextual factors influencing linkage to care. Conclusion: Linkage to HIV care is an important step towards proper management of HIV. We found that access and linkage to care are influenced positively and negatively at all levels, however, the individual-level and health system-level factors were most prominent in this setting. Interventions must address issues around stigma, denial and inadequate awareness of the value of early linkage to care, and improve the capacity of HIV treatment/care clinics to implement quality care, particularly in light of adopting the ‘Test and Treat’ model of HIV treatment and care recommended by the World Health Organization. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Applying selected psychoanalytic constructs from Freud and Klein to recent pervasive rhetoric around anti-immigration in the United States, we conducted a critical discourse analysis of media and policy representations of immigrants in recent news coverage in the United States regarding the Trump Administration’s response to (1) asylum claims related to domestic violence and gang violence and (2) undocumented immigrants. We illustrate how feared bad object/immigrants are constructed alongside the imagined good object/nationalism, as exemplified by Trump’s motto–“Make America Great Again” (MAGA). We argue how this paranoid-schizoid position reifies racism veiled under nationalism and discuss how social workers could work together toward the depressive position re-imagining America-as-the-whole. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - With the rise in nationalism and anti-immigration sentiments in Europe, debate has arisen in several national media when minority ethnic athletes opt to play for the national team of their country of origin. This article aims to examine how minority ethnic athletes who opt to play for the national team in their country of destination express and are ascribed national belonging. To do so, the article draws on Nira Yuval-Davis’ distinction between belonging and the politics of belonging as well as perspectives from transnational migration studies. The article is based on a single case study of Danish newspapers’ representations of the Danish women’s football player of Afghan origin, Nadia Nadim. In the build-up to, duration and aftermath of the UEFA Women’s Euro in 2017, Nadim was ascribed Danish identity, while her popularity as a player rose. However, the article points out how athletes who become exemplary others along ethnic and national lines are deprived of their transnational belonging and of their potentially critical voice. Further, the article discusses how ideas of national unity in sport are enacted in the media through apparently innocent descriptions of patriotism and national archetypes seeking to reconcile current divisions in European societies. © 2019 The British Society of Sports History.

AB  - African-American Muslims are well-known for their prison reform ministries and initiatives aimed at assisting disenfranchised men and women in inner city communities. In media discourse, the redemption narratives of young African-American Muslim men in these environments have often been stimulated by African-American Muslim leaders who function as highly influential fatherly figures that usually stress an importance of fatherhood in ameliorating juvenile delinquency and hopelessness. While fatherhood is a cherished institution among Muslim families, this analysis focuses on depictions of father-son relationships among African-American Muslim men in film and television. This study examines relationships between Muslim sons and non-Muslim fathers, Muslim fathers and non-Muslim sons, and fathers and sons who both embrace Islam throughout these visual narratives. In exploring these relationships, the article examines the impact of African-American Muslim fathers on their sons’ faith and spiritual development, negotiation of masculinity, management of racism, confrontation of Islamophobia, and maintenance of discipline, social mobility, and life skills. © 2019, © 2019 University of Birmingham.

AB  - Though Central Asia is often studied through the prism of its relationships with external powers, research on local public perceptions of these different actors has largely been overlooked. The literature on Kazakhstanis’ perceptions of their neighbours, for instance, is scarce, and mostly focused on analysis of official discourse on Kazakhstan’s multi-vector policy, with little exploration of how this is received, appropriated or refuted by the population. On the basis of Gallup data spanning the last decade, and several other surveys, we test most of the main hypotheses usually advanced to explain attitudes to the US and Russia–age, ethnicity and access to information–and draw five main conclusions: (1) Kazakhstanis are not defined by an exclusive pro-US/pro-Russian dichotomy; (2) they nevertheless largely choose Russia over the US if forced to pick; (3) age does not have a significant effect on foreign policy attitudes; (4) ethnicity does affect some of the attitudes under consideration, but its effects are not large enough to produce markedly different opinions among ethnic Kazakhs and ethnic Russians in aggregate; and (5) consumption of media from Russia and access to non-governmental and Western sources of information do not seem to have significant effects on the attitudes under consideration. © 2019, © 2019 Southseries Inc.

AB  - This study examines how the issue of game regulation has been discussed and influenced public perception by exploring ideologically differing media outlets’ distinct uses of frames by analyzing news contents (N = 1,217) and public opinion survey of the national sample of Korean gamers (N = 1,362), who play games currently. The analyses include the influence of media on attitudes toward game regulation, perception of games, and frame adoption, based on the results of news content analysis. The study found that (a) mainstream media was ambivalent about game issues and tended to define gaming and gamers in sensationalistic ways; (b) while the dynamics of media effects on public attitudes toward game regulation are complex, exposure to game-related news content significantly impacted public attitudes; mass media that highlight the negative aspects of games have strong impacts on public perception toward games, which may ultimately affect attitudes toward game regulation. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The contribution of cross-age peer e-mentoring on reported experiences of participation during online conversations using social media was explored in this pre-experimental study. Young people (n = 4, aged 13; 4–18;3 [years; months]) who used augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) participated in an e-mentoring intervention. Two mentors who also used AAC had regular conversations with the participants via Facebook1, email, or Skype2. It was predicted that the mentoring support would contribute to experiences of participation in online conversations outside of the e-mentoring intervention. Reported experiences of participation in online conversations with communication partners other than the mentor were measured at four time points. The Self-Reported Experiences of Activity Settings was used for this purpose because it consists of five domains: Personal Growth, Psychological Engagement, Social Belonging, Meaningful Interactions, and Choice and Control. These domains are associated with the construct of involvement in activity settings. Results showed varied scores between participants and across the domains. Reported experiences of choice and control increased slightly across time. Despite some variation in self-ratings, the participants reported experiencing choice and control, psychological engagement, and social belonging in online conversations. There is need for more research in this emerging area. © 2019, © 2019 International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication.

AB  - This study examines the role of personalized charity advertising in promoting empathy, attitude change, and helping intentions toward stigmatized social groups. Based on theories of message involvement, empathy, and reactance, we predicted that higher levels of involvement elicited by a personalized charity advertisement would reinforce empathy and prosocial outcomes. An online experiment was conducted using a personalized and a nonpersonalized version of a charity advertisement for a campaign soliciting donations of winter coats for homeless people. As expected, structural equation modeling revealed a positive indirect effect of personalization on prosocial outcomes (attitudes and behavioural intentions toward homeless people, and willingness to donate to the campaign) that was mediated by involvement and empathy. However, in addition to promoting involvement and empathy, personalization also led to heightened reactance, which detracted from the positive effects. Theoretical as well as practical implications of the findings for personalized charity advertising are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Advertising Association.

AB  - Studies on historical episodes of intergroup violence and conflicts have underlined the complicit role of bystanders in extreme intergroup dynamics. In regard to contemporary multicultural societies, the concept of intergroup indifference has recently been introduced, defined as being uncaring vis-à-vis arbitrary policies affecting other social groups. In the present manuscript, the reasons why an indifferent position towards minorities may imply some prejudicial attitudes towards them will be analyzed. In particular, moral disengagement and lack of social responsibility are considered to be variables that could explain why indifference might mask prejudicial attitudes and a lack of altruism for out-groups. The results show that moral disengagement and social responsibility are indeed significant mediators of the prediction of intergroup indifference to racism and altruism. In particular, the mediation model shows that moral disengagement partially mediates the path from indifference to racism, while social responsibility partially mediates that from indifference to altruism. © 2018, © 2018 Journal of Moral Education Ltd.

AB  - Background: Much of the research on African-Americans’ HPV vaccine acceptance has largely focused on racial/ethnic differences related to cognitive, socio-economical, and structural factors that contribute to differences in HPV vaccine acceptance and completion. A growing body of literature suggest that cultural factors, such as mistrust of healthcare providers (HCPs) and the healthcare system, religion, and social norms related to appropriate sexual behaviors, also plays a prominent role in their HPV vaccine acceptance. However, these studies were limited in their use of theoretical approaches necessary to conceptualize and operationalize culture. Objective: To explore the influence of culture on African-American mothers’ and daughters’ HPV vaccine acceptance using the PEN-3, a culturally-centered conceptual framework. Methods: Grounded theory techniques were used to explore cultural factors that influenced the acceptance of the HPV vaccine among African-American mothers (n = 28) and their daughters (n = 34). Results: Positive attitudes towards vaccination stemmed from beliefs that the HPV vaccine has cancer prevention benefits and that vaccinations in general protected against infectious diseases. Negative attitudes stemmed from beliefs that the HPV vaccine was too new, not effective, daughters were too young, and that vaccines were not a one-size-fits-all intervention. Majority of mothers and daughters indicated that their religious doctrine did not impede their HPV vaccination decisions. For a few mothers, religious beliefs could not be separated from their HPV vaccination decisions and ultimately deterred HPV vaccine acceptance. HCP recommendations were valued however mothers were often dissatisfied with the detail of information communicated. Support networks provided both positive and negative types of social support to mothers and daughters. The media highlighted the cancer prevention benefits of the HPV vaccine and unintentionally communicated negative information of the HPV vaccine, which deterred HPV vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: Study findings can inform the development of culturally appropriate interventions that advances the evidence on cervical cancer prevention. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Although some previous studies have examined the impact of transformational leadership on safety behavior, those works have paid relatively less attention to the intermediating role of employees’ job strain in the link as well as contingent variables that moderate the relationship. Considering that not only job strain substantially affects employees’ perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors in an organization, but also there are some contextual factors that moderate the relationships, we investigated intermediating mechanisms (i.e., mediator and moderator) in the relationship between transformational leadership and safety behavior. Relying on the context-attitude-behavior framework, we conducted a structural equation modeling analysis with a moderated mediation model. Specifically, we hypothesized that the level of an employee’s job strain would mediate the transformational leadership–safety behavior link. We also hypothesized that an employee’s self-efficacy regarding safety would moderate the association between job strain and safety behavior. Using survey data from 997 South Korean employees, we found that all of our hypotheses were supported. The findings suggest that the level of an employee’s job strain mediates and elaborately explains the transformational leadership–safety behavior link. Moreover, an employee’s self-efficacy regarding safety is a buffering factor which decreases the harmful effects of job strain on safety behavior. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This study examines the role and the impact of new media in the Chapeltown area of Leeds in the North of England. Drawing on in-depth interviews and personal observations, it traces incredible illustrations of mutual cooperation among people of different faiths and ethnicities who come together to celebrate Carnival and Vaisakhi and enjoy food during Ramadan in the local mosques. Also, it finds that despite the differences among communities of various cultural and religious backgrounds the takeaway lesson here in Chapeltown is that communities can be united for a common goal. For instance, people can struggle side-by-side to overcome social ills and challenge negative press by effectively using new media technologies. This study argues that most sections of the British press need to review their  attitude towards ethnic minorities that is to change the reporting approach and practice investigative journalism. Review of the history of Chapeltown’s early migrants, the British Jews, suggests that high levels of education and becoming part of the mainstream literacy circles in both universities and mainstream media can improve the representation of ethnic minorities. Furthermore, unless members of the ethnic minorities become part of the mainstream media it will be difficult for them to improve their media representation. © 2018 Intellect Ltd Article.

It will look at the dual phenomenon of ‘Jihadi Brides’ and ‘Foreign Fighters’, both terms coined by the media, and seek to uncover gender discrimination inherent therein. Beyond gender stereotypes, it will also examine Islamophobic and Orientalist tropes that add an additional layer of othering to Muslim women. The theoretical framework used in this study will be Framing Theory, frameworks which look at women in violent organizations, Systemic Functional Linguistics and Critical Discourse Analysis.

AB  - This article revisits a famous staple of the Vergilian tradition, Servius's heavily contested scholion on the actress Volumnia Cytheris's theatrical rendition of Vergil's sixth Eclogue. By shifting the focus of inquiry from the strictly historical question 'did it happen?' it cuts through, identifies and disentangles a nexus of prejudices which have led to the devaluing of Servius's information. The sidelining or dismissal of this piece of evidence, I argue, has more to teach us about our own culturally entrenched and discipline-inherited assumptions than about what could have happened in late Republican Rome. Scrutiny of the evidence on the stage re-mediation of high poetry suggests it is entirely plausible that Cytheris would have performed a theatricalized version of Vergil's masterpiece. Indeed at the very heart of the story lies the convergence between élite poetry and the world of professional stage artists. Moreover, Cytheris's possible performance of a repertoire that coincides with the mythological core of pantomime dancing in its artistic maturity opens pivotal questions concerning what Plutarch (Mor.748a) aptly calls the “full association and mutual entanglement” between the arts of poetry and dance. Taking Servius seriously gives us the impetus to explore more decisively dimensions of Roman life that have been messily sidelined as a result of the systematic privileging of “texts” in our surveys of Roman intellectual landscapes over the centuries. Even if Servius's extract turned out to be no more than a “myth”, an “anecdote”, as such narratives go, this is an incredibly helpful one, provided we are willing to press it into the service of larger inquiries regarding the “circulation” of cultural energy between élite and popular culture. © 2019 by The Regents of the University of California.

AB  - The distribution and consumption of transgender time-lapse videos on YouTube have increased over the last few decades, providing trans communities with a valuable resource for self-making. On YouTube, vloggers can present images and videos of their bodies as they document their gender transitions through several practices that rely on temporality and time-space compression. As a genre, time-lapse videos comprise creative worldmaking practices where users document their gender transformations using hundreds to thousands of still photos or video segments which show their social, somatic, and biochemical changes. Although scholars have discussed different worldmaking and community organising practices that take place as trans vloggers display their gendered subjectivities online, there is sparse scholarship studying the recurrent patterns of behaviour on the comment space below these videos. In this article, I draw on critical discourse analytic studies of new media and stance-taking as I review and analyse discriminatory strategies – principally misgendering and ungendering – that YouTubers used to denigrate the self-identified gender of a given vlogger. Stance-taking enables us to identify and track reoccurring attitudes steeped in cisgenderism. At the same time, capturing how vloggers and trans allies respond to (intentional or unintentional) text-based forms of prejudice, can create teachable moments for YouTube spectators. While misgendering stances aim to pressure their targets into certain kinds of gender and sex embodiments, insurrectionary stance-acts co-opt and call out the language of discrimination, lending legitimacy and authority to trans vloggers to create, enact, and live their own genders. © Matthew Bruce Ingram.

AB  - Background: The sexual health of young men in prisons is often among the poorest in any given country. They may have developed sexual behaviors that, from a public health perspective, are considered problematic and burdensome. These include poorer use of condoms and engaging in more frequent casual sex, resulting in higher rates of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV and viral hepatitis. Thus, young incarcerated men are a highly marginalized and socially excluded high-risk group, in greater need of sexual health education and services. Objective: The aim of this study was to create an innovative sexual health promotion intervention, made for and with young men in prisons, to encourage them to avail of regular sexual health checkups. This included developing a Web-based animated-style sexual health promotion intervention (1.42 min) coupled with upskilling the prison nurses to offer a partnership approach to prison health care. This paper focuses on the development of the intervention and the importance of the underpinning rights-based (RB) participatory intervention design. Methods: We employed an RB participatory approach and recruited 14 participants who attended 3 coproduction workshops held within a prison site in Northern Ireland, United Kingdom. A bespoke 3-day training for nurses beforehand, ensured they gained a deeper understanding of the determinants of poor sexual health. The coproduction team comprised young men, prison nurses, nurse sexual health consultant, media company representatives, and facilitator. Workshops focused on content, design, tone and medium of communication for a Web-based intervention that would be appealing and engaging for young incarcerated men. Results: A 1.42-min animation Dick loves Doot was created to promote a positive attitude toward sexual health checkups. The RB approach enabled the young men to participate, have their voices heard and see their stories reflected through the animation. The nurses' capacities to protect, fulfill, and respect the young men's rights to appropriate sexual health services and education was also enhanced. Evaluations confirmed that we successfully provided accurate sexual health information in a way that was engaging and accessible and that encouraged the young men to avail of the new prison sexual health services that were set up in the prison and now provided by nurses. Conclusions: The RB participatory approach to health advanced in this study provided a means to (1) gain invaluable insider knowledge to understand the impact of structural determinants on health and health inequalities and strategies by which to target young incarcerated men (2) create inclusive opportunities for developing bespoke targeted interventions, and (3) galvanize collaborative partnerships to disrupt the structures and processes that lead to and encourage health inequities. To reduce future risk, effective treatment, coupled with coproduced interventions that transmit relevant health messages in a relevant and meaningful way, is key to success. © 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the attitudes toward men who have sexually offended (MSO) between the general public and professionals and paraprofessionals in forensic settings. Background: Existing research shows a number of different factors that appear to be important in the development, maintenance, and deterioration of attitudes toward MSO. The exploration of such factors requires further exploration. Method: A convenience sample was used for the cross-sectional study. Five hundred fifty-three participants were recruited from the general public and forensic hospitals, both private and National Health Service. An online version of the Attitudes Towards Sex Offenders scale (Hogue, 1993) was distributed via email and social media. Results: Gender was not found to have any impact on the attitudes individuals held toward MSO. The general public was found to have significantly more negative attitudes when compared with those exposed to MSO at work (professional and paraprofessional staff). Duration of employment did not make attitudes any more or less positive. Conclusion: The clinical and societal implications of the research are important for MSO to reduce risk within forensic establishments and be supported to reintegrate successfully into the community. Without the support from both staff and the general public at each stage of rehabilitation, desistance is less likely to be maintained. Research continues to provide varying results regarding the factors that influence the nature of attitudes toward MSO. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Background: Doping in sports has become an increasingly prominent issue worldwide. The use of various performance-enhancing substances or methods can be detrimental to health. Aim: The aim of this study was to measure the knowledge, attitude and perception of pharmacy students in Malaysia towards doping in sports. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional study. Final-year pharmacy students studying in seven universities in Malaysia completed a self-administered survey. The questionnaire collected demographic data, as well as information regarding students’ knowledge, attitude and perception of drugs in sport. For the students' knowledge, it was scored over the range 0–8, with higher scores indicating better knowledge. Results: Overall, 273 respondents were included in the study. Most respondents were female, had a Cumulative Grade Points Average of 3.00–4.00, watched sports programs, played sports regularly and attended courses related to drugs in sport. Respondents had a moderate level of knowledge (median score of 5 ± 2). There was a significant difference in the level of knowledge between respondents who did and did not attend courses on drugs in sport (p < 0.01). Generally, respondents had negative attitudes towards statements on doping in sports. Respondents also had a good perception of the need to implement doping prevention initiatives. Conclusion: Pharmacy students in Malaysia had a moderate level of knowledge of and negative attitudes and perceptions towards doping in sports despite not all of them being enrolled in drugs in sport courses. The pharmacy curriculum in Malaysia should incorporate courses on drugs in sport throughout undergraduate studies to better promote the development of this domain. © 2019 The Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia

AB  - Background: Social media play an important role in plastic surgery, yet there are limited studies in the literature to guide plastic surgeons' social networking practices. To address this deficiency and provide further insight, the authors set out to investigate the public's attitude toward plastic surgery using Twitter, a popular social media platform. The authors examined a large body of messages (tweets) related to plastic surgery using novel techniques of natural language processing and sentiment analysis. Methods: The authors collected over 1 million tweets with the keywords “plastic,” “cosmetic,” “aesthetic,” and “reconstruction” surgery spanning from 2012 to 2016 from the Twitter Gardenhose feed. Using hedonometrics, the authors extracted the average happiness/positivity (havg) of tweets and created word-shift graphs to determine the most influential words. Results: The positivity scores for keywords “plastic,” “cosmetic,” “aesthetic,” and “reconstruction” surgery were 5.72, 6.00, 6.16, and 6.09, respectively. In relation to “plastic,” keywords “cosmetic” and “aesthetic” were more positive because they lacked antagonistic words, such as “fake,” “ugly,” “bad,” “fails,” or “wrong.” The keyword “reconstruction,” however, was more positively associated than the term “plastic” because of an increase in positive words, such as “honor,” “amazing,” “successful,” and “respect.” Conclusions: Tweets containing the term “plastic” surgery trended toward negativity, and may be explained by the increase in unfavorable, associative words. Conversely, related terms such as “aesthetic,” “cosmetic,” and “reconstruction” were more favorably regarded because of the lack of antagonistic words and the presence of supportive words. The authors' results are informative and may serve to guide plastic surgeons' social media practices. © 2019 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons

AB  - Slow lifestyles have become a way for individuals to reduce the amount of stress in their lives. Moreover, along with wellness and slow food, slow life seeking is emerging as an area of study, though little research has been studied at Slow Life Festivals (SLFs) associated with consumers' wellness pursuits, slow life seeking, and perceptions of slow food. To address this gap, this study examined visitors' decision-making processes using an extended theory of planned behavior (ETPB) by incorporating wellness pursuit, slow life seeking, and perceptions of slow food at an SLF. Thus, this study developed a theoretically comprehensive framework by applying field survey. Results revealed significant impacts of visitors' wellness pursuits and slow life seeking on their decision-making, indicating that wellness and slow life were important factors to consider for SLF management. The research further identified the perception of slow food as a mediator in predicting behavioral intentions. Results further demonstrated a strong relationship between wellness pursuit and perception of slow food for highly attached visitors while revealing a significant relationship between slow life seeking and perception of slow food for less attached visitors. Consequently, this study shed significant light on our understanding of why visitors intend to revisit SLFs. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Utilizing a quantitative methodological approach, the present study presented and investigated an integrated model embracing environmental corporate social responsibility, image, emotional attachment, attitude, and moral norms in order to explicate airline patrons' intention formation for adopting eco-friendly electric airplanes. Our findings revealed that the proposed associations among research constructs were all significant, and that image, emotional attachment, attitude, and moral norms significantly mediated the effect of environmental corporate social responsibility on intention. In addition, the salient role of image of electric airplanes in building intention was uncovered. Despite the importance of greening airline products in the aviation industry, electric airplanes are a topic that has barely been explored. The results of this study can help airline practitioners and researchers to understand consumer readiness and willingness to adopt such eco-friendly alternatives to conventional air-flights. Implications are discussed. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Population growth (PG) is one of the drivers of the environmental crisis and underlies almost every environmental problem. Despite its causative role in environmental challenges, it has gained little attention from popular media, public and government agenda, or even from environmental organizations. There is a gap between the gravity of the problem and its relative absence from the public discourse that stems, inter alia, from the fact that the very discussion of the subject raises many sensitive, complex and ethical questions. The education system is a key player in filling this gap, and teachers have an opportunity to facilitate the discussion in this important issue. While educators mostly agree to include controversial environmental topics in school curricula, calls for addressing PG remain rare. This study explores teachers' perspectives of PG as a problem and their attitudes towards including it in their teaching, focusing on environmental and non-environmental teachers. While perceiving PG as an environmental problem and supporting its inclusion in schools was significantly higher among the environmental-teachers, similar concerns were reported by all the teachers concerning engaging students in discourse around this controversial issue. This consensus indicates the limited impact of knowledgeability on teachers' intentions to address PG in class. Teachers' challenges reflect the dominant Israeli sociocultural norms, religious values and the national pronatalist ideologies. The findings demonstrate how the absence of PG from the public discourse and from school curricula influences teachers' motivation to address it in class. This study highlights the necessity to encourage teachers to address PG in their teaching, even in this reality, by providing them with appropriate tools that will enable them to successfully engage students in this controversial issue. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Epidemics of infectious disease can be traced back to the early days of mankind. Only in the last two centuries vaccination has become a viable strategy to prevent such epidemics. In addition to the clinical efficacy of this strategy, the behavior and public attitudes affect the success of vaccines. This paper describes modeling the efficacy of vaccination considering the cost and benefit of vaccination to individual players. The model is based on the public goods game and is presented as a spatial game on a lattice. Using this model, individuals can contribute to the public health by paying the cost of vaccination or choose to be protected by the public who is vaccinated rather than pay the cost and share the risk of vaccination. Thus, in this model individuals can choose to stay susceptible, can become infected, or choose to vaccinate once in each episode. This paper presents the behavioral changes of the population and the cost to the society as a function of the cost of vaccines, cost of being infected, and the 'fear factor' created by the public media. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - This study investigated the impact of reading learning strategies (RLS) mediated by smartphone features and applications on the learners' psychological autonomy in English as a foreign language (EFL) reading context among undergraduates in Saudi Arabia. A total of 70 male students in two intact reading classes participated in this study. A questionnaire was used to collect the quantitative data from the participants prior to and after an interventional programme. The findings of the study revealed that employment of RLS mediated by smartphone features and applications promoted the learners' psychologically autonomous features of motivation, self-efficacy, agency, positive attitudes, desire to seek information, need for achievement in EFL reading context. It is recommended that a training programme on strategy use through the technology of smartphones should be highly considered in curricula design, teaching and learning methods, training programmes in order to empower learners to take charge of their own learning of EFL reading skills. © 2019 Eskisehir Osmangazi University.

AB  - In this qualitative study we examine the role of caste, class, and Dalit janitorial labor in the aftermath of floods in Chennai, India, in 2015. Drawing from a variety of sources including interviews, social media, and news coverage, we studied how Dalit (formerly known as 'untouchable') janitors were treated during the performance of janitorial labor for cleaning the city. Our study focuses on two theoretical premises: (a) caste-based social relations reproduce inequalities by devaluing Dalit labor as 'dirty work'; and (b) Dalit subjectivities, labor, and sufferings including occupational hazards become invisible and ungrievable forcing Dalits to provide a counter narrative to preserve the memory of their trauma and dignity injuries. We find that the discursive construction of janitorial labor as dirty work forced Dalit janitors to work in appalling and unsafe working conditions. Janitors suffered several dignity injuries in terms of social exclusion and a lack of recognition for their efforts and accomplishments. Specifically, we examine various ways through which caste, dirty work, and dignity intersected in the narrative accounts of Dalit janitors. We also explore memory and how processes of remembering and forgetting affected the dignity claims of Dalit janitors. Copyright © Society for Business Ethics 2019.

AB  - Background: Normal delivery is a natural and physiological process with numerous benefits for mother and baby. Giving birth by Caesarean Section (CS) should be limited to the cases in which normal delivery is not possible. The purpose of the study was to determine the attitudes of pregnant women towards Normal Delivery and factors driving the use of Caesarian Section in Kermanshah, Iran. Methods: This analytical-descriptive study was conducted on 410 pregnant women referred to the PHC centers in Kermanshah in western Iran. They had been selected through a multi-stage sampling method, including clustering, randomized, and proportional sampling, from among all eligible women. Data was collected using a questionnaire standardized by previous studies. The level of 0.05 was considered significance association, whenever applied. Results: The mean and standard deviation for participant age was 27.65 ± 5.37 years. The median score for participant attitude was 60.7 ± 9.5 (range from 22 to 85). Generally, 21.5% had a negative attitude toward normal delivery and preferred CS. Participant attitude was negatively correlated with a pregnant woman's age, lower age, and a more positive attitude towards vaginal childbirth. The attitude of women with a history of normal delivery was 63 ± 9 and for those with a history of CS was 56.7 ± 9.3, significantly different. Conclusion: Most women had a positive attitude towards normal delivery, particularly those who had experienced normal delivery in their previous childbirth. Although only a quarter of the participants had a negative attitude toward normal delivery, this figure still was of utmost significance, therefore educational interventions, specifically encouraging women with history of normal delivery to consult their peers, are recommended. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Do improvements in health service delivery affect trust in political leaders in Africa? Citizens expect their government to provide social services. Intuitively, improvements in service delivery should lead to higher levels of trust in and support for political leaders. However, in contexts where inadequate services are the norm, and where political support is linked to ethnic or religious affiliation, there may be weak linkages between improvements in service delivery and changes in trust in political leaders. To examine this question empirically, we take advantage of a national intervention that improved health service delivery in 500 primary health care facilities in Nigeria, to estimate the impact of residence within 10 km of one or more of the intervention facilities on trust in the president, local councils, the ruling party, and opposition parties. Using difference-in-difference models, we show that proximity to the intervention led to increases in trust in the president and the ruling party. By contrast, we find no evidence of increased trust in the local council or opposition parties. Our study also examines the role of ethnicity and religious affiliation in mediating the observed increases in trust in the president. While there is a large literature suggesting that both the targeting of interventions, and the response of citizens to interventions is often mediated by ethnic, geographic or religious identity, by contrast, we find no evidence that the intervention was targeted at the president's ethnic group, zone, or state of origin. Moreover, there is suggestive evidence that the intervention increased trust in the president more among those who did not share these markers of identity with the president. This highlights the possibility that broad-based efforts to improve health services can increase trust in political leaders even in settings where political attitudes are often thought to be mediated by group identity. © 2019

AB  - Interpersonal sexual objectification experiences are pervasive in online communication contexts, and their influence on positive eating behaviors should not be ignored. Broad conceptualization of beauty refers to how widely women and girls define female beauty in terms of both internal and external characteristics, and body appreciation refers to loving, respecting, and holding a positive attitude toward the body. This study examined the association between online interpersonal sexual objectification (OISO) experiences and intuitive eating, as well as the mediating role of broad conceptualization of beauty and body appreciation. Participants were 1152 Chinese adolescent girls aged 11 to 15 years who completed a questionnaire survey measuring OISO experiences, broad conceptualization of beauty, body appreciation, and intuitive eating. The results showed a negative association of OISO experiences with broad conceptualization of beauty and intuitive eating. Mediation analysis using structural equation modeling showed a negative association of OISO experiences with intuitive eating through broad conceptualization of beauty and body appreciation. These results suggest that programs aiming to improve healthy eating behaviors could direct adolescent girls to criticize the appearance-focused mindset in online interaction and encourage them to focus on body functionality, such as health, creative endeavors, and communication with others. © 2019

AB  - Although jihadist threats are regarded as foreign, most Islamist terror attacks in Europe and the United States have been orchestrated by Muslims born and raised in Western societies. In the present research, we explored a link between perceived deprivation of Western Muslims and endorsement of extremism. We suggest that Western-born Muslims are particularly vulnerable to the impact of perceived relative deprivation because comparisons with majority groups’ peers are more salient for them than for individuals born elsewhere. Thus, we hypothesized that Western-born, compared with foreign-born, Muslims would score higher on four predictors of extremism (e.g., violent intentions), and group-based deprivation would explain these differences. Studies 1 to 6 (Ns = 59, 232, 259, 243, 104, and 366, respectively) confirmed that Western-born Muslims scored higher on all examined predictors of extremism. Mediation and meta-analysis showed that group-based relative deprivation accounted for these differences. Study 7 (N = 60) showed that these findings are not generalizable to non-Muslims. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - This study examines the extent to which three types of online media (i.e., consumer reviews, personal references, advertisements) change consumers' attitudes toward a tourism product. Using a 3 × 3 × 2 fractional factorial design, this study also tests how visual format and message framing interact with media type to influence attitude change. Findings indicate that online consumer reviews change tourists' attitudes more than the other two media types, with empathetic persuasiveness playing the most influential role in negative product reviews and information involvement playing a critical role in positive online consumer reviews and advertisements. Moreover, visual format influences the effects of media type and message framing on attitude change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Gateway Belief Model describes a process of attitudinal change where a shift in people's perception of the scientific consensus on an issue leads to subsequent changes in their attitudes which in turn predict changes in support for public action. In the current study, we present the first large-scale confirmatory replication of the GBM. Specifically, we conducted a consensus message experiment on a national quota sample of the US population (N = 6,301). Results support the mediational hypotheses of the GBM: an experimentally induced change in perceived scientific consensus causes subsequent changes in cognitive (belief) and affective (worry) judgments about climate change, which in turn are associated with changes in support for public action. The scientific consensus message also had a direct effect on support for public action. We further found an interaction with both political ideology and prior attitudes such that conservatives and climate change disbelievers were more likely to update their beliefs toward the consensus. We discuss the model's theoretical and practical implications, including why conveying scientific consensus can help reduce politically motivated reasoning. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper empirically explores the link between mass media coverage of migration and immigration worries. Using detailed data on media coverage in Germany, we show that the amount of media reports regarding migration issues is positively associated with concerns about immigration among the German population. This association is strongest when immigrants are the protagonists of media reports. The established relationship is robust to the inclusion of time-variant individual control variables and individual fixed-effects. We address endogeneity concerns by employing media spillovers from the neighboring country of Switzerland, which occur due to referendum decisions on immigration, as an instrumental variable. The IV estimates suggest that media coverage has a causal impact on immigration worries. The effect of media coverage persists even when worries concerning unemployment, crime or the level of xenophobia are accounted for. Exploring subgroups of respondents reveals that the link between coverage and immigration worries is particularly relevant for women and respondents who are not active in the workforce. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recent research suggests that meaning in life relates to processes of social judgments and could facilitate relationships between racially diverse individuals. At this time however, there is no study that examines factors that influence the relationship between meaning, racial prejudice, and values. To fill this gap, the present study examined whether (1) self-transcendence and (2) psychological inflexibility mediates the relationship between perceived meaning in life and prejudice. The study was conducted with 253 White students (females, 77.9%; males, 22.1%) from a university located in the southern United States. Standard path-analytic approaches through the macro PROCESS program were used to examine a parallel mediational model. Results evidenced that self-transcendence and psychological inflexibility had a significant indirect effect on the relationship between meaning in life and prejudice, and that reversely, meaning also functioned as a mediator of self-transcendence and prejudice and psychological inflexibility and prejudice. Findings suggest that among White college students the effect of meaning on prejudice changes in the context of self-transcendence and psychological inflexibility, and that without self-transcendence and psychological flexibility, meaning could actually result in greater prejudice. © 2018

AB  - The growth of partisan news sources has raised concerns that people will increasingly select attitude-consistent information, which might lead to increasing political polarization. Thus far, there is limited research on the long-term mutual influences between selective exposure and political attitudes. To remedy this, this study investigates the reciprocal influences between selective exposure and political attitudes over several years, using a three-wave panel survey conducted in Sweden during 2014–2016. More specifically, we analyse how ideological selective exposure to both traditional and online news media influences citizens’ ideological leaning. Findings suggest that (1) people seek-out ideologically consistent print news and online news and (2) such attitude-consistent news exposure reinforces citizens’ ideological leaning over time. In practice, however, such reinforcement effects are hampered by (3) relatively low overall ideological selective exposure and a (4) significant degree of cross-cutting news exposure online. These findings are discussed in light of selective exposure theory and the reinforcing spirals model. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - A lightning victory by combined Austro-German forces in October 1917 threatened to knock Italy out of the war. This was the Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo, often called ‘Caporetto’. General Luigi Cadorna, the chief of general staff, branded army units as cowards and blamed them for the disaster. His accusation met with dismay at home and sympathy mixed with disdain abroad. Investigation quickly gave the lie to Cadorna, yet the stain persisted. In Britain, the prime minister and the head of the armed forces disagreed about the causes of Caporetto, as did also the historian G. M. Trevelyan and the future politician Hugh Dalton. Analysis of the dissemination, reception and legacy of Cadorna’s message in Italy and Britain reveals something about military-political relations, class attitudes, media systems and national prejudice. ©2019 The Historical Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - High social anxiety is associated with increased attentional bias, and difficulties disengaging from relevant threat information, though social anxiety may also be associated with avoidance of threat. Few mechanisms of this relationship have been empirically evaluated, whereas theories and treatment manuals implicate avoidance and/or safety behaviors as significant agents of negative reinforcement for anxiety symptoms and search for threat. The current study sought to investigate one safety behavior, excessive reassurance seeking, as a mediator of the relationship between social anxiety and attention bias to disgust facial stimuli. Support was found for our hypotheses, such that social anxiety symptoms had an indirect effect on attention bias to disgust faces through increased reassurance seeking. These results suggest that reassurance seeking may result in disengagement of attention to threat stimuli. Specifically, social anxiety may result in a decreased threshold for negative social cues and therefore seek out reassurance feedback and avoid threatening stimuli. Future studies should test these directly and utilize a prospective design. The current study suggests that reassurance seeking may be involved in the attention bias process, providing additional data for current cognitive theories of social anxiety and additional support for reinforcement patterns of anxiety symptoms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The borders of Europe are erected and guarded through cultural practices as much as through border control and security technologies. Cultural Studies have been crucial in revealing how everyday, particularly media-oriented practices, make and unmake this ‘Fortress’. Yet, until now, the focus has been mostly on how migrants use or are represented through media discourses and technologies. This introduction essay argues that the signifier ‘Fortress Europe’—and its central premise of restraining mobility for some in order to enable freedom for others—also gains meaning in and through socio-cultural practices that we may not (as) immediately associate with the physical crossing of European borders. Particular practices that are discussed in this introduction and examined in the seven original articles of the special issue are: public opinion research, the public mobilization of emotions, negotiating identity in an ‘ancestral homeland’, the consumption of (sports) media, the production of a radio talk show and film archives, as well as the activist use of social media. Broadening scholarly attention to these kinds of sociocultural practices provides an important addition to understanding how power operates across social spheres and discursive orders. In addition, their identification also offers valuable opportunities to understand how and why some practices are particularly pertinent or effective in cementing or destabilizing Fortress Europe. This line of inquiry is visible throughout this special issue, despite the diversity of theoretical frameworks and empirical sites used in the contributing articles. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Similar to the rest of Europe, multicultural programming in Finland has become risky for public broadcasting. Programs aimed at encouraging social inclusion may not attract sufficiently large audiences and may be attacked by ever louder anti-immigration voices. This article focuses on what seems to be an exception in this respect: Ali and Husu. Hosted by immigrants from Iran and Somalia – a stand-up comedian and a politician – this popular talk show aired on Finnish public radio between 2013 and 2016. Through interviews with the producers and the analysis of a selection of episodes, we examine Ali and Husu’s daring and unapologetic ethnic/racial humor as well as its combination of funny and serious talk. Our findings underscore specific ways in which multicultural programming can use humor strategically to engage relatively large and diverse audiences in discussions meant to humanize immigrants and challenge social prejudices, while minimizing right-wing criticism and unintended readings. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Despite the continued attention on the distinct behavioral and relational outcomes of narcissism and self-esteem, limited academic research has been devoted to investigating the influences of those individual differences upon behaviors of seeking and retaining a romantic relationship concurrently in the digital environment. The present study aimed to test the role that narcissism and self-esteem play in predicting individuals' attitudes toward behaviors in current and possible romantic relationships. The results demonstrated that individuals high in narcissism showed positive attitudes toward interacting with potential romantic partners on Instagram. Furthermore, they showed positive attitudes toward current relationship-related postings on Instagram. In contrast, individuals high in self-esteem exhibited negative attitudes toward interacting with potential romantic partners, whereas they showed positive attitudes toward posting photographs taken with their current romantic partners on Instagram. This study provides empirical evidence for the associations between individual differences and attitudes toward various behaviors on social networking sites (SNSs) in relation to both potential and current romantic relationships. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.

AB  - Objective: Nativism, or anti-immigrant preferences, is increasingly evident within democratic mass publics. In this article, we explore whether economic concerns, perceptions of social decline, or some combination of the two shape these attitudes. Method: Our data are comprised of more than 8,000 survey respondents from nine Western, industrial democracies (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United States). Using mediation analysis, we test for the extent to which economic anxiety and perceptions of cultural decline exert direct and indirect effects on nativism. Results: On balance, the effect of economic anxiety—concern regarding job loss and negative economic assessments—on nativism is mostly indirect, affecting nativism by influencing perceptions of cultural decline. Conclusion: Given the strong association between perceptions of social decline and nativism, it appears as though anti-immigrant sentiments draw from cultural rather than economic concerns. The story, however, does not end there. Perceptions of societal decline are strongly influenced by economic anxiety. © 2019 by the Southwestern Social Science Association

AB  - Racial and ethnic prejudice is one of the most pressing problems in modern societies. Although previous social neuroscience research has suggested the amygdala as a key structure in racial prejudice, it still remains elusive whether the amygdala activity reflects negative attitudes toward an outgroup or other unrelated processes. The present study aims to rigorously test the role of the amygdala in negative prejudice toward an outgroup. Seventy Japanese individuals passively viewed images related to an ethnic outgroup (South Korea) inside a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Using Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA), we found that Japanese individuals’ level of implicit (but not explicit) evaluations of South Korea could be predicted from neural signals in the left amygdala. Our result further suggested that the medial and lateral parts of amygdala play different roles in implicit evaluations. In contrast to the MVPA findings, conventional univariate analyses failed to find any reliable relationship between brain activation and both implicit and explicit evaluations. Our findings provide evidence for the amygdala's role in representing an implicit form of prejudice and highlight the utility of the multivariate approach to reveal neural signatures of this complex social phenomenon. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study employed digital footprints to explore why people engage in genetically modified (GM) food rumormongering on Chinese social media, Sina Weibo at both the group level and individual level. 9070 posts about GM food were obtained from 1 million users. Social network analysis was used to analyze the effect of peer influence on GM food rumormongering at the group level, and we did not find any effect that users would depend on their friendship network on social media to spread GM food rumors. To determine the effect of social media extravert, reputation and attitude on scientific rumormongering at the individual level, we used logistic regression. Results revealed that people who hold negative attitudes towards GM food and who are social media extraverts are more likely to spread rumors, while social reputation did not influence the spread of rumors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We test a novel framework for how ingroup members are perceived during intergroup interaction. Across three experiments, we found that, above and beyond egalitarian attitudes and motivations, White observers’ automatic responses to Blacks (i.e., their implicit anti-Black bias) shaped their affiliation toward ingroup targets who appeared comfortable engaging in interracial versus same-race interaction. White observers’ implicit anti-Black bias negatively correlated with liking of White targets who were comfortable with Blacks (Experiments 1-3). The relationship between implicit bias and liking varied as a function of targets’ nonverbal comfort in interracial interactions (Experiment 1). Specifically, implicit bias negatively correlated with liking of targets when targets’ nonverbal behaviors revealed observers felt comfortable with interracial contact, irrespective of the nature of those behaviors (Experiment 2). Finally, the relationship between implicit bias and target liking was mediated by perceived similarity (Experiment 3). Theoretical implications for stigma-by-association, social network homogeneity, and extended contact are discussed. © 2018 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Extreme partisan animosity has been on the rise in the US and is prevalent around the world. This hostility is typically attributed to social group identity, motivated reasoning, or a combination thereof. In this paper, I empirically examine a novel contributing factor: the “unmotivated” cognitive bias of overprecision (overconfidence in precision of beliefs). Overprecision could cause partisan hostility indirectly via inflated confidence in one's own ideology, partisan identity, or perceptions of social distance between the parties. Overprecision could also cause this hostility directly by causing excessively strong inferences from observed information that is either skewed against the out-party or simply misunderstood. Using a nationally representative sample, I find consistent support for direct effects of overprecision and mixed support for indirect effects. The point estimates imply a one standard deviation increase in a respondent's overprecision predicts as much as a 0.71 standard deviation decline in relative out-party favorability. © 2018

AB  - Background. Peer crowds are macro-level, reputation-based subcultures with shared preferences, values, and behavior. The Country peer crowd has been the focus of tobacco industry research and marketing but has yet to be the primary focus of public health research. The current study explores the utility of Down and Dirty, a Social Branding tobacco education campaign, in changing Virginia Country teens’ chewing tobacco-related attitudes and behavior. The relationship between chew use and Country peer crowd identification was also explored. Method. To evaluate the campaign, a cross-sectional survey was administered online for 3 years from 2014 to 2016. Responses were collected via social media advertisements targeting 13- to 18-year-old Country youth from Virginia (total n = 1,264). Participants reported peer crowd identification, chew-related attitudes and behavior, and campaign engagement and appeal. Results. Compared with Wave 1, Waves 2 and 3 Country teens who engaged with Down and Dirty had greater odds of holding strong attitudes against chew. Among campaign-engaged Country teens, odds of chew use were lower at Waves 2 and 3, and lower odds were associated with liking the campaign. Related to chew prevalence, Country teens demonstrated greater odds of past 30-day chew use compared to non-Country teens, and higher Country identification was associated with greater odds of chew use. Discussion. Down and Dirty is a promising intervention associated with positive attitudinal and behavioral outcomes for high-risk Country teens. Additionally, this study helps document tobacco-related behavioral patterns of the Country peer crowd, a priority for ongoing tobacco education, especially around chew. © 2018 Society for Public Health Education.

AB  - This article describes how autism spectrum disorder is experienced in the context of immigrant families and how the meaning of this condition, proposed by professionals in the host country, is negotiated between families and healthcare providers. The study sample consists of 44 parents of different nationalities and their 35 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) living in a socioeconomically deprived neighborhood of Montreal, Canada. Individual parent interviews were audiotaped and transcribed for subsequent analysis. Results suggest that – although they may sometimes be a source of anxiety – the uncertainties regarding the etiology of ASD, as well as the gap between the explanatory models (EMs) proposed by host country professionals and the impressions of parents, seem to increase the capacity of families to resist the imposition of what they perceive as external categories. Parents perceived the day-to-day difficulties associated with their child's condition as a form of social exclusion that compromised their child's future and independence. These day-to-day difficulties were also described as directly affecting the parents' social life, constituting an important emotional and physical burden. When talking about their children, parents described the painfulness of their experiences, but also discussed how their autistic child had transformed and shaped their lives. Overall, these results show how the disease is “enacted” in the day-to-day life of parents; and suggest that such an embodied understanding of ASD may sometimes represent a form of re-appropriation of power by families faced with adversity. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Two studies were conducted to examine user perceptions of content effects and behavior on social media. Study 1 employed interviews with Millennials and Baby-Boomers (N = 17) and found that some behaviors on Facebook were seen as undesirable (e.g., excessively posting photos of food). Users held third-person perceptions (TPP) such that they believed that they personally posted content on Facebook less frequently than others did, especially pertaining to undesirable content. A follow-up online survey in Study 2 (N = 140) showed empirical support for the distinction between desirable and undesirable behaviors on Facebook in user perceptions. TPP was found for all undesirable behaviors, but first-person perception (FPP) emerged for some desirable behaviors on Facebook. Results also indicated users' TPP in the perceived effects of content including news, advertisements, and brand communications on Facebook, with social distance moderating TPP's magnitude (i.e., TPP increases as the distance of the comparison group from self increases). Overall, the two studies suggest that there exists a robust self-other discrepancy in the perceived effects of media content and the frequency of behavior on social media. These findings contribute to the understanding of TPP and FPP, especially with regard to judgment of social media impact and behavior. © 2018

AB  - A common feature among populist parties and movements is their negative perspective on the media’s role in society. This paper analyzes whether citizens with a populist worldview also hold negative attitudes toward the media. From a theoretical point of view, the paper shows that both the anti-elite, anti-outgroup and people centrism dimension of populism contradicts the normative expectations toward the media. For instance, the assumption of a homogeneous people and the exclusion of a societal outgroup is incompatible with a pluralistic media coverage. The results of a representative survey in Germany predominantly confirmed a relation between a populist worldview and negative media attitudes. However, the three populism dimensions influenced the evaluations not in a consistent way. A systematic relation could only be found for antielite populism, which is negatively associated with all analyzed media evaluations such as media trust or satisfaction with the media’s performance. This indicates that in a populist worldview, the media are perceived as part of a detached elite that neglects the citizens’ interests. However, the results confirm the assumption of a natural ally between populism and tabloid or commercial media. Individuals with people centrist and anti-outgroup attitudes have higher trust in these media outlets. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - While there is a proliferation of research on emotion detection, little research has focused on emotion induction in HCI literature. We propose an emotion-induction model that points out the two fundamental design goals (i.e., sensemaking vs. exploration) as antecedents of the four different types of emotions, which, in turn, introspectively reinforce cognitive outcomes (i.e., attitude; behavioral intention). Design elements that facilitate the sensemaking goal (i.e., coherence; legibility) induce emotions along a low-arousal-positive (LAN) to a high-arousal-negative (HAN) continuum (e.g., “quiescence” to “agitation”). By contrast, the design elements that facilitate exploration goal (i.e., mystery; complexity) induce emotions along a high-arousal-positive (HAP) to a low-arousal-negative (LAN) continuum (e.g., “cheerfulness” to “dejection”). Among them, only the two types of emotions (i.e., HAP; HAN) have a significant mediation effect of reinforcing attitude. The HAP emotions (e.g., cheerfulness) signal a success in exploration efforts. The HAN emotions (e.g., agitation) signal a failure in sensemaking efforts. Thus, the design elements for sensemaking goals are responsible for the emotions that enhance positive (but not negative) attitude, while the design features for exploration are responsible for the emotions that enhance negative (but not positive) attitude. Incidentally, our data reveals that people place more weight on emotional signals that are consistent with their concurrent motivational concern than those inconsistent with it. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - After several significant nuclear accidents, public attitudes toward nuclear energy technologies and facilities are considered to be one of the essential factors in the national energy and electricity policy-making process of several nations that employ nuclear energy as their key energy resource. However, it is difficult to explore and capture such an attitude, because the majority of prior studies analyzed public attitudes with a limited number of respondents and fragmentary opinion polls. In order to supplement this point, this study suggests a big data analyzing method with K-LIWC (Korean-Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count), sentiment and query analysis methods, and investigates public attitudes, positive and negative emotional statements about nuclear energy with the collected data sets of well-known social media and network services in Korea over time. Results show that several events and accidents related to nuclear energy have consistent or temporary effects on the attitude and ratios of the statements, depending on the kind of events and accidents. The presented methodology and the use of big data in relation to the energy industry is suggested as it can be helpful in addressing and exploring public attitudes. Based on the results, implications, limitations, and future research areas are presented. © 2018

AB  - Background Bariatric surgery is regarded as the most effective treatment of morbid obesity in adults. Referral patterns for bariatric surgery in adults differ among general practitioners (GPs), partially due to restricted knowledge of the available treatment options. Reluctance in referral might be present even stronger in the treatment of morbidly obese children. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the current practice of GPs regarding treatment of paediatric morbid obesity and their attitudes towards the emergent phenomenon of paediatric weight loss surgery. Methods All GPs enlisted in the local registries of two medical centres were invited for a 15-question anonymous online survey. Results Among 534 invited GPs, 184 (34.5%) completed the survey. Only 102 (55.4%) reported providing or referring morbidly obese children for combined lifestyle interventions. A majority (n = 175, 95.1%) estimated that conservative treatment is effective in a maximum of 50% of children. Although 123 (66.8%) expect that bariatric surgery may be effective in therapy-resistant morbid obesity, only 76 (41.3%) would consider referral for surgery. Important reasons for reluctance were uncertainty about long-term efficacy and safety. The opinion that surgery is only treatment of symptoms and therefore not appropriate was significantly more prevalent amongst GPs who would not refer (58.3% vs. 27.6%, p \ 0.001). Conclusion There is a potential for undertreatment of morbidly obese adolescents, due to suboptimal knowledge regarding guidelines and bariatric surgery, as well as negative attitudes towards surgery. This should be addressed by improving communication between surgeons and GPs and providing educational resources on bariatric surgery. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Across three studies, we investigated whether threats to belongingness influence the tendency to use social relationships as a source of meaning in life (MIL), and in turn, perceived levels of MIL. This study builds on previous similar work in this area (e.g.; Hicks and King in J Posit Psychol 4:471–482, 2009), by explicitly measuring the tendency to base MIL on social relationships. In Study 1, we found that belongingness was positively associated with both the tendency to base MIL on social relationships and overall levels of MIL. Meanwhile, an exploratory mediation analysis was consistent with the idea that basing MIL on social relationships partially mediated the association between belongingness and MIL. In Study 2, we found that an experimental manipulation of social exclusion reduced both the importance attached to social relationships as a source of MIL and MIL levels (and a similar mediation pattern as Study 1). Moreover, participants experiencing threats to belonging tended to reaffirm MIL through autonomy in a compensation type process. In Study 3, we found that the effect of social exclusion on MIL levels and basing MIL on social relationships was attenuated when the value of social relationships was negated. Implications for future research on social relationships and compensation processes in MIL judgments are discussed. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study focuses on the public opinion on the naturalization policy for Syrians in Turkey. It analyses news media coverage in the religious, far-right newspaper (Yeni Akit), a centre-right newspaper (Hürriyet), a social democrat newspaper (Cumhuriyet), and a socialist-left news portal (Solportal). The research question is: What are the metaphors, arguments, and omissions produced by media of different ideologies about the possible citizenship of Syrians in Turkey? The results show that metaphors and arguments differ according to ideological stance, suggesting that the current political polarization in Turkey affects the public's acceptance of Syrians and challenges Turkey's established migration policy. Each ideological stance accepts Syrians on a selective basis, implying that universal naturalization of Syrians is not welcome; instead, there seems to be consensus favouring naturalization according to socio-economic criteria. These results indicate a need for a change in migration policy, especially concerning disadvantaged Syrians. © 2018 The Author. International Migration © 2018 IOM

AB  - Background: Many pro-smoking videos on YouTube reach view counts in the hundreds of thousands and more.Yet, there is limited information on who is viewing these potentially misleading videos.This study attempts to understand the viewership of online pro-smoking videos to examine if youth at high risk for smoking are more likely to watch these videos. Methods: We conducted a selective exposure experiment with a national sample of youths (ages 15-21 years; n = 614) to identify characteristics that make individuals more likely to select pro-smoking videos. During a 10-min browsing session, participants were given a set of 16 videos (eight smoking and eight nonsmoking) and were asked to view video(s) of their choice. Exposure to videos was unobtrusively logged. View count was manipulated such that smoking videos had either high or low views. Results: Behavioral data revealed that youth with higher interest in smoking were more likely to select and spend more time watching pro-smoking videos than youth with lower interest in smoking.The view count manipulation did not affect selection patterns. However, exposure to high view count smoking videos was associated with more positive attitudes toward smoking. Conclusions: The findings of this study call into question the existence and prominence of pro-smoking videos onYouTube and bring to attention the need for regulatory or monitoring efforts of such content. Implications: Given the presence and prevalence of misleading pro-smoking videos online, this is the first study to ask the practical and important question of who is viewing these videos. Using behavioral data, we are able to demonstrate that youth who are high at risk for smoking are more susceptible to select and spend more time viewing pro-smoking videos than youth who are low at risk for smoking. Findings also show that when pro-smoking videos appear to be “popular,” they affect attitudes toward smoking. Our findings provide policy implications regarding regulation of smoking promotion videos online. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) describes a suite of controversial approaches to mitigating climate change that involve removing existing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Through an online survey experiment with US adults (N = 980), we examine three factors that may shape public support for different types of CDR strategies: (1) perceptions that CDR tampers with nature, (2) individual-level variation in the degree to which people are uncomfortable with activities that tamper with nature, and (3) information about the risks and benefits associated with each CDR strategy. Using a moderated mediation analysis, we find that support for different CDR strategies is, in part, a function of how much each strategy is perceived to tamper with nature. Support for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air capture (DAC) was lower than support for afforestation and reforestation (AR), as BECCS and DAC were perceived to tamper with nature more. These effects were particularly strong among individuals generally opposed to the idea of humans interfering with natural processes. Moreover, we find evidence that describing the risks and benefits of each CDR strategy dampens support; for AR and BECCS, this effect was again mediated through perceptions of tampering, while for DAC, the effect of describing these tradeoffs appeared to operate independently of perceived tampering. We conclude that policymakers and science communicators need to be mindful of how CDR strategies are described to the public, as perceptions of tampering with nature may be an important driver of their acceptance. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the factors that contribute to stigmas held by mental health practitioners about people with mental health issues. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews was adopted to collect data from one focus group discussion comprised of six healthcare practitioners representing different aspects of health provision. Data were analysed using Nvivi.10 thematic content analysis, and major themes were identified. Participants also complete a demographic data sheet. This study was conducted in February 2018 at the medical city in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Findings: The focus group discussed the stigmas they held about people with mental health issues and the factors they perceived as heightening their prejudices. Factors identified included professional experiences, the media and community. Practitioners working in mental healthcare are vulnerable to developing stigmas about people with mental health problems. This research has begun to explore the factors that contribute to this phenomenon. Research limitations/implications: The participants were drawn from several different mental healthcare providers, so attitudes expressed cannot be generalised. Practical implications: Practitioners healthcare providers of all types including clinical practitioners, administrators and programme planners have a duty to confront the stigma of mental health among the community and healthcare providers, by expanding the volume of academic literature being authored, improving continuing professional education and enhancing employment opportunities in that sector. Originality/value: The outcomes of this study were mainly applicable to the professional mental health team, educator of healthcare practitioners, clinical practitioners, community mental healthcare services and research related to this topic, especially for improved ethical and professional values for healthcare providers and enlightenment of society as a whole. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Police agencies have cited difficulty recruiting qualified candidates, especially minority and women applicants. This may be because minorities and women less often have friends who are police officers or know a police officer by name who they can call upon for assistance. The extent and nature of the association between the police and the public is one way to measure police-public social distance - the subjective perception of closeness or lack thereof the public feels with their police. Given the low public opinions of police among minority populations and negative media coverage resulting from police use of force incidents, low social distance may be one way police agencies can attract more women and minority applicants. This assertion was tested by surveying a sample of 533 university students in the fall of 2015. As a whole, respondents were more likely to report wanting to be a police officer when they had a police officer in the family or as a friend - with one exception. While having a family member or friend who is a police officer were not significantly related to women's desire to seek a career in policing, knowing a police officer by name reached significance. Men, especially non-Hispanic white men, also were more likely to report wanting to be a police officer. Proactive and targeted recruitment strategies that decrease social distance between the police and the public can help attract qualified women and minority candidates, thus contributing to the diversity of police agencies. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Storytelling is widely believed to be an effective strategy in innovation communication. The use of high-quality narratives in particular is recommended to facilitate the understanding of an innovation, facilitate trust in it, and promote the perception of innovative strength as well as the development of positive attitudes. However, to date virtually no empirical evidence has been presented to support these assumptions. Therefore, we conducted an experiment in which participants were exposed to messages about an innovation that varied in narrative quality (low vs. medium vs. high), and the messages were told in different forms that are typical of social media (nonserial vs. serial) to take account of the ever-increasing importance of these channels in innovation communication. The results show that the understanding of an innovation increases linearly with a message’s narrative quality, serial storytelling impedes understanding, and narrative quality is conducive to the attitude towards the innovator when the story is told in nonserial form and has a detrimental effect when told in serial form. Thus, the results show that the current view on storytelling’s potential is overly optimistic and that using high-quality narratives can, under certain conditions, also have adverse effects. The practical implications of these findings are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Why are certain individuals persistent in opposing immigration? The behavioral immune system framework implies that a psychological mechanism, which adapted to detect and avoid pathogen threats, is also reflected in contemporary social attitudes. Moreover, prejudice towards outgroups might be partially driven by implicit pathogen concerns related to the perceived dissimilarity with these groups’ hygiene and food preparation practices. Disgust, a universal core emotion supposedly evolved to avoid pathogen threats, as well as olfaction, both play a pivotal role in evoking disgust. In an online study (N = 800), we investigated whether individual differences in body odor disgust sensitivity (BODS) correlate with negative attitudes towards a fictive refugee group. The data analysis plan and hypotheses were preregistered. Results show that body odor disgust sensitivity is associated with xenophobia: BODS was positively associated with negative attitudes towards the fictive group. This relationship was partially mediated by perceived dissimilarities of the group in terms of hygiene and food preparation. Our finding suggests prejudice might be rooted in sensory mechanisms. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Recovery-oriented transformation of mental health service systems not only necessitates changes in mental health policies and practices, it also requires an adoption of recovery-oriented mindset, which includes knowledge and attitudes, among service providers. It is also important that service users are informed about the changes and can fully participate in the process. The present study developed and evaluated the efficacy of a recovery psychoeducation program in enhancing recovery-oriented knowledge and attitudes among mental health service providers and users in Hong Kong. In study 1, 111 service providers were randomly assigned to 2-day psychoeducation group or control group. Results showed that participants in psychoeducation group had significantly better recovery knowledge and more positive attitudes towards recovery after the intervention than the control counterparts. The effect of the recovery psychoeducation program on recovery attitudes was fully mediated by the improvement in recovery knowledge. In study 2, 93 people with mental illness were randomized into 2-week psychoeducation group or control group. Participants in the psychoeducation group had a significant improvement in the level of recovery-oriented knowledge immediately after the workshops, but the effect could not be sustained at follow-up. To transform into a recovery-oriented service system, having an effective program to orient service providers and users to recovery is essential. This study provided initial support to the use of a brief psychoeducational program for recovery-oriented knowledge enhancement. Given the short-term efficacy and feasibility of the interventions, service leaders and managers in different clinical and social service settings should consider implementing the programs as part of staff and users’ service orientation to build a recovery-supporting workforce and empower their service users early in the recovery process. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: Timebanking is a generalized, voluntary service exchange that promotes use of otherwise idle resources in a community and facilitates community building. Participants offer and request services through the mediation of the timebank software. In timebanking, giving help and accepting help are both contributions; contributions are recognized and quantified through exchange of time-based currency. The purpose of this paper is to explore how users perceive timebank offers and requests differently and how they influence actual use. Design/methodology/approach: This survey study, conducted in over 120 timebanks across the USA, examines users’ timebanking participation, adapting dimensions of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Findings: The authors found that perceived ease of use in timebanking platforms was positively associated with positive attitudes toward both requests and offers, whereas perceived usefulness was negatively associated with positive attitudes toward requests and offers. The authors also found that having positive attitudes toward requests was important to elicit behavioral intention to make a request, but that positive attitudes toward offers did not affect behavioral intentions to make offers. Practical implications: The authors discussed these results and proposed design suggestions for future service exchange tools to address the issues the authors raised. Originality/value: The study is among the first few studies that examine timebanking participation using large-scale survey data. The authors evaluate sociotechnical factors of timebanking participation through adapting dimensions of TAM. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The criminal justice system has increasingly been relied upon to address immigration apprehension, resulting in concerns that this institution will be abused in an effort to indirectly address this perceived social problem. The consequences of such an approach will likely extend to Latino/a populations as a result of rhetoric linking ethnicity, immigration, and crime. Despite popular theoretical frameworks suggesting that disadvantage will vary according to the size of the population and the extent of perceived threats toward this minority, many neglect attitudinal measures or fail to measure actual criminological outcomes. This project addresses this oversight by exploring potential mediating effects of attitudes on the relationship between population measures and ethnic sentencing disparities. After fitting multilevel models nesting cases within counties and states, the results indicate that there is significant variation across all levels. While greater disparities in Latino/a sentencing were found in counties with greater Latino/a populations, this relationship was nonlinear. Additionally, state level measures of immigrant threat attitudes appear to be stronger predictors of Latino/a sentencing disparities. These contextual effects are more influential than offender level ethnicity, supporting threat hypotheses and suggesting that measurement of this concept should not be limited to offender ethnicity and population characteristics alone. © 2018, © 2018 Midwestern Criminal Justice Association.

AB  - HIV and sexuality stigma impede HIV prevention and care efforts. HealthMpowerment.org (HMP) is an interactive mobile phone- and web-based HIV prevention and care intervention for young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM; ages 18–30) in the United States. HMP included three forums where participants could share their experiences. In this study, we explored whether engaging in stigma-related discussions was associated with changes in YBMSM’s stigma-related scores throughout the trial. YBMSM (ages 18–30; N = 238) participating in HMP completed surveys at baseline, and 3 and 6 month follow-ups that included a series of scales focused on HIV and sexuality (internalized homophobia; sexual prejudice) stigma. Sixty-two participants contributed to the forums (1497 posts). We coded instances where YBMSM’s conversations were stigma related (915 posts, 61.1%), including discussions of anticipated (74/915, 8.1%), experienced (125/915, 13.7%), internalized (410/915, 44.8%), and/or challenged (639/915, 69.8%) stigma regarding sexuality and HIV. Using a mixed methods approach, we examined whether changes in YBMSM’s stigma scores were associated with stigma-related discussions within the forum. We controlled for age, HIV status, income, and educational attainment in these multivariable models. YBMSM who discussed experiencing HIV stigma in the forums reported decreases in perceived HIV stigma over time (b = − 0.37, p ≤ 0.05). YBMSM whose forum posts indicated anticipated HIV stigma reported increases in HIV stigma over time (b = 0.46, p ≤ 0.01). Participants who challenged sexuality-related stigma in forums had lower internalized homophobia (b = − 0.68, p ≤ 0.01) at baseline. YBMSM whose discussions focused on experiencing sexuality-related stigma reported increases in internalized homophobia (b = 0.39, p ≤ 0.01) and sexual prejudice (b = 0.87, p ≤ 0.05) over time. Developing strategies to combat stigma remains a key priority. HMP created an online space where YBMSM could discuss HIV and sexuality stigma. Although a limited number of HMP participants authored the majority of these forum discussions, the discussions were associated with changes in the sample’s stigma scores over time. Online interventions (e.g., social media, apps) should consider the inclusion of forums to address stigma and test the efficacy of forums to improve YBMSM’s HIV prevention and care continuum outcomes. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Both HIV positivity and African American (AA) ethnicity are associated with increased incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Poor immune response to pneumococcal polysaccharide-based vaccines may contribute to the race related increased frequency of IPD in African American HIV positive individuals. Methods: Caucasian and AA HIV-infected (HIV+) individuals 40–65 years old with CD4 + T cells/µl (CD4) &gt;200 on antiretroviral therapy (ART) received either the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) followed by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) or PPV only. Serum IgG, IgM and opsonophagocytic antibody responses to serotypes 14 and 23F as well as serum IgG and opsonophagocytic antibody responses to serotype 19A were measured pre- and post-vaccination. We measured serum markers of inflammation in all participants and performed single cell gene expression profiling at the baseline by HD Biomark in Caucasians and African Americans. Results: There were no significant differences in pre-immunization inflammatory markers or post-vaccination IgG and IgM concentrations between Caucasian and African American participants. However, we found significantly lower opsonophagocytic activity in response to serotypes 14 and 19A in the AA group compared to the Caucasian group. There was no association between inflammatory markers and immune response to vaccination, however we found extensive biomodal variation in gene expression levels in single IgM+ memory B cells. Differentially expressed genes may be related to differences in the immune response between ethnic groups. Conclusions: Distinct racial differences were found in the functional immune response following either PPV and/or PCV/PPV immunization in HIV-positive adults, although these differences were serotype dependent. Decreased ability to respond to vaccination may in part explain racial disparities in pneumococcal disease epidemiology. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03039491. © 2019

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effect of metaphor “Digital India-Power to Empower” on citizens’ intention to adopt the e-governance while taking citizens’ attitude and emotional attachment with Digital India as mediating variables between citizens’ involvement and intention to adopt e-governance. Design/methodology/approach: After reviewing the extant literature and using the learning from Technology Acceptance Model-Extension (TAME), a conceptual model has been proposed. The model is empirically tested on 224 respondents from India using structural equation modeling technique. Findings: The paper suggested that the metaphoric promotion of E-Governance leads to a higher intention to adopt E-Governance. Metaphoric promotion has a positive influence on citizen involvement with E-Governance, which leads to positive attitude toward E-Governance. This positive attitude leads to citizens’ emotional attachment with E-Governance, which in turn leads to citizens’ positive behavioral intention to adopt E-Governance. In addition, there is a significant difference in attitude toward E-Governance with respect to education level and metro city dwelling, but there is no difference in intention to adopt E-Governance with respect to education and metro city dwelling. Research limitations/implications: As there is a dearth of research on the usage of metaphor by government and its effect on citizens’ adoption of E-Governance, a conceptual model has been prepared by using learning from metaphor studies majorly in non-government services. Originality/value: As marketing and metaphors are rarely spoken words in E-Governance research, present study starts the much-needed conversation. In the past, adoption of E-Governance is studied in terms of technology attributes using TAM Model. The present study is first to explore the behavioral impact of E-Governance metaphoric promotion on citizens’ intention to adopt E-Governance based on TAME model. It raises the issue of marketing foundation of E-Governance in mobilizing the citizens’ intention to adopt the E-Governance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This study relied on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to assess factors that affected event fans’ decisions regarding their intention to attend events by using social network websites. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of event fans’ attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control on their intentions to go to events based on social networking sites (SNSs) marketing. In addition, the researchers examined the impact of perceived enjoyment on event fans’ attitudes towards events pages on SNS. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a quantitative research method and used an online survey distributed on Qualtrics and based on the TPB. Populations in the study were followers of events pages on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The sample was convenience. Findings: By using the partial least square-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), the study found that all the research hypothesis were supported except (H2). While event fans’ attitudes had not a statistically significant impact on their behavioral intentions towards using social media to go to events (H2), perceived enjoyment had a statistically significant impact on event fans’ attitudes towards events pages on SNS (H1). According to the research findings, event fans were influenced by their subjective norms (H3) and perceived behavioral control (H4). These factors significantly influenced event fans’ behavioral intention, which led to their actual behavior (H5). Practical implications: This study provided evidence supporting that subjective norms and perceived behavioral control were effective in forming intention towards events page, which in turn affected actual behavior, while perceived enjoyment was effective in forming events fan attitudes towards events’ social media pages. This may indicate a need for positive images of the events depicted through social media. In addition, when using social media as a marketing medium for events, event marketers and organizers should understand how other important people’s opinions and perceptions affect the intention and behavior formation. This implies the need to stress the social acceptance of the events, and use family ties, family and other social-units elements of events. Social implications: This study provided statistical evidence supporting the applicability of the TPB within the context of event marketing and using social media. This implies a better understanding of the rational decision-making process, along with the social factors affecting the process of forming behavioral intentions and intentions. Furthermore, perceived enjoyment was incorporated within the model. Perceived enjoyment was effective in forming positive attitudes towards events’ social media pages. This highlights the need to provide information and contents in an enjoyable and user-friendly way. Originality/value: The value of this study is derived from its aim to highlight the importance of social media as an effective marketing tool for events. Moreover, this study sought to contribute to the literature on social media by exploring how social media affected event attendees’ behavior and attitudes and by gauging the impact of social media on the event industry. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mediating role of organizational identification in the relationship between emotional exhaustion and turnover intention. It also examines the moderating roles of worker cooperatives in the relationships of emotional exhaustion with organizational identification and turnover intention. Design/methodology/approach: Surveys of worker cooperatives and capitalist firms in the Seoul metropolitan area were conducted in 2016. The hypotheses of this study were tested through multilevel moderated mediation analyses. Findings: This study revealed that organizational identification partially mediated the relationship between emotional exhaustion and turnover intention. The findings of the study provided evidence that worker cooperatives alleviated the adverse relationships of emotional exhaustion with organizational identification and turnover intention. Research limitations/implications: Since it was conducted with a cross-sectional data set, this study is not free from the issue of causality. However, the findings provide insights into how emotional exhaustion may be associated with organizational identification and turnover intention, and how worker cooperatives may alter these relationships. Practical implications: Capitalist firms should provide their employees with more autonomy and more opportunities to participate in organizational decision-making, as in worker cooperatives, to induce their employees to hold more positive attitudes. Originality/value: There is no extant research on the mechanism through which emotional exhaustion is associated with turnover intention via organizational identification, and on the moderating roles of worker cooperatives in this mechanism. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to provide a conceptual model that elucidates the role of cognitive absorption in explaining behavioural intentions in virtual health communities. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 361 contributing members of virtual health communities from Gauteng, South Africa, using a structured questionnaire. Structural equation modelling using AMOS software was used to analyse the data. Findings: The findings show that cognitive absorption has a significant direct positive influence on content posters’ intentions to continue participating on virtual health community platforms. Cognitive absorption was also found to have an indirect influence on behavioural intentions through its influence on members’ attitude. It was also found to play a mediating role in the influence of perceived usefulness and behavioural intention. Research limitations/implications: The study shows the value of linking flow theory and the technology acceptance model to provide a comprehensive understanding of behavioural intentions in virtual health community forums. Practical implications: Managers of virtual health communities need to pay attention to experiential aspects of their sites. Success in ensuring that community members are cognitively absorbed is key to the development of positive attitude and intentions towards virtual health community forums. Originality/value: Virtual health communities play a new and growing role in the way health-related information and support is offered and accessed by those in need. Despite their importance, not much research has been done to explain the role of consumer experience in member behavioural intentions on such forums. The study contributes to this understanding by demonstrating the value of cognitive absorption in directly explaining users’ attitude and behavioural intentions. The study also sheds light on the role played by cognitive absorption in explaining the influence of perceived usefulness on behavioural intentions. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This article examines how Marvel Comics’ Ms Marvel, in her newest iteration as a Pakistani Muslim young woman, challenges the conventions of race and American citizenship in the post-9/11 United States. I place Ms Marvel in conversation with the webcomic Qahera the Superhero, which was created by an Egyptian artist, in order to demonstrate the ways in which both texts have an ability to reach readers on a global scale and powerfully reimagine visual representations of Muslim women and female superheroes. My investigation includes an analysis of the comics and the epitexts that surround these works, such as author and editor interviews and various forms of public response in order to demonstrate how these media engage with a specific racial, ethnic, and (inter)national community in a meaningful way; one which complicates the definition of ‘fans,’ ‘comic book readers,’ and ‘heroes.’ When juxtaposed Ms Marvel and Qahera emerge as artifacts of visual, digital culture whose significance is particularly salient when read in our current political era, as a means of uncovering and combating racism, xenophobia, and Islamophobia. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The thousands of deaths and disabilities due to workplace accidents and injuries each year emphasize the importance of safety research. Despite occupational safety research that has contributed to identifying antecedents of safety, little is known about why and how safety knowledge leads to safety behaviours and how personal and situational factors interact to promote occupational safety. Using a multilevel, multisource, and time-lagged research design, the present study investigates whether safety knowledge affects safety behaviours through safety attitudes and further tests whether supervisory safety attitudes can impact the strength of these relationships and play a role as moderators of the proposed mediated relationship. Data were collected from workers (N = 177) and supervisors (N = 42) in a construction company in the energy industry at two time points. Results indicate full support for the moderated mediation model, demonstrating that worker safety attitudes partially mediate the relationship between safety knowledge and safety behaviours. Moreover, when supervisors had positive attitudes towards safety, both the direct relationship between worker safety attitudes and safety behaviours and the indirect relationship between safety knowledge and safety behaviours were more positive compared to when supervisors had negative safety attitudes. Theoretical and practical implications for occupational safety are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Contemporary recognition theory overemphasizes the role of rationality in human relations and fails to adequately consider the pathological valences that influence psychological motivation and social dynamics, particularly those that are unconsciously mediated. In offering an alternative Hegelian revisionist perspective, I will examine how capacities for recognition are informed by early developmental contingencies in attachment, self-formation, social relations, and the negation of difference, thereby addressing the psychodynamics of how dysrecognition and refutation of alterity lead to insidious pathologies within society and the clinic. The systemic failure to develop recognition within social collectives is rooted, I suggest, in a lack of empathy for the other. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Objective: The current investigation extends ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and daily diary weight stigma research in internalised weight bias (IWB). This investigation used daily diaries to examine the relationship between IWB, mood, coping, body appreciation, exercise behaviours and eating behaviours. Design: The study sample consisted of individuals who were overweight or obese (85% female) with M BMI = 36.0, SD BMI = 6.2. Participants completed a daily diary each evening and wore a Fitbit for 30 days. Main Outcome Measures: Participants reported on IWB, mood, coping, body appreciation, exercise behaviours and eating behaviours. Results: Both within- and between-subjects IWB were significantly related to positive affect, negative affect, several coping responses, body appreciation, eating behaviours and the urge to avoid exercise. Exploratory analyses indicated that positive and negative affect mediated many of the associations between IWB and coping responses, body appreciation, and eating and exercise behaviours. Conclusion: This investigation provides evidence that IWB experiences have daily impacts on psychological well-being, body appreciation, coping, eating and exercise behaviours. Also, this study raises awareness about IWB and its potential impact on psychological well-being and health behaviours. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Using a cross-sectional, correlational design, the present study examined the moderating roles of perceived social support and community connectedness in the relationship between minority stress and viewing frequency of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB)–inclusive television shows among LGB adults. Participants identified predominately as White and female, and the largest group identified as bisexual. Participants completed self-report measures of minority stressors, social support, LGB community connectedness, and viewing frequency. A multiple linear regression was conducted to examine the relationships among these variables. Findings revealed that perceived social support moderated the effect of prejudice events on viewing frequency, such that LGB viewers who reported high levels of prejudice events and low perceived social support endorsed the highest levels of viewing frequency. These findings provide further insight into the ways in which LGB individuals consume media content and may be informative for clinicians in understanding coping strategies for minority stress among LGB clients. © 2019, © 2019 Mass Communication & Society Division of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.

AB  - With the developing acceptance of gay equality in the west, it is assumed that we live in a post-shame era, with ‘the world we have won’. However, this is a chimeric cliché of neoliberalism (rather like the idea that we are all postfeminist now). The ‘proud’ homosexual of the west is discursively constructed against the ‘shamed’ homosexual of the east, a typecasting resonant with postcolonial clichés of the primal, religious, and homophobic savagery of the global south in contrast with the civilising, liberal evolution of the secular global north. Shame displacement is of course a dynamic of shame itself. The perceived failure in achieving the ‘proud iconic gay’ of media cultures in the global North results in a traumatic double bind of being ashamed of being ashamed. This article will reconsider the cultural politics and temporality of shame for primarily white gay identities after the ‘War on Terror’. As Islamophobia has exponentially increased, some western gays translocate their unacknowledged shame onto a misconceived ‘brown threat’ in a complex, aggressive, and racist shame loop [Lewis, H.B., 1971.

AB  - Formally a taboo subject, public sexual harassment in Egypt has received increased media attention since the 2011 revolution. The scholarly literature on the topic, however, remains thin, particularly with regard to the social mechanisms that sustain an environment permissive of street harassment. Drawing on the rape myths literature, this article argues that naturalised and stereotyped understandings of the causes and implications of street harassment provide discursive resources to excuse harassers and blame victims for the harassment they suffer. It argues, however, that these understandings are better understood as narrative masterplots to be contested than as myths to be debunked, emphasising that falsity and prejudicial impact must not be conflated. It concludes with recommendations for activism and future research, arguing that it may be more effective to promote alternative interpretive frames than attempt to directly challenge currently dominant understandings. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In October 2014 the author arrived at work to find one of his company's big-rig trucks aflame in the parking lot, obviously a victim of arson. This was an extreme manifestation of a corrosive problem: Traeger's culture had become poisonous, characterized by lack of trust, negative attitudes, and a stubborn refusal to collaborate. Very early in his tenure, employees would ignore Andrus when he asked for data, or simply refuse to work together on a project. Once, when he was visiting headquarters, the CFO said he couldn't find any time in his schedule to meet with the new CEO. Although the majority owner had no operating role, he talked daily to people at all levels of the company and was aggressive and abusive. People were afraid of him, but they acted as if he were in charge. After the truck fire, Andrus resolved to start from scratch. He bought out the majority owner, moved the headquarters from Oregon to Utah, carefully winnowed the employees, worked to create a physical environment that feels true to the brand, and built a community of fans and influencers on social media. The company's strategy, marketing, and product line were all overhauled. In just five years, sales grew from $70 million to nearly $400 million. © 2019, Harvard Business School Publishing.

AB  - In today’s digital era, social media communications have a significant impact on the consumer decision-making process. This new age phenomenon also impacts the tourism industry in India. Indian consumers (here travelers) surf through multiple social media platforms for finding travel related information before making a destination choice. Hence, a deeper understanding of the dimensions of social media communication and its impact on the consumer (traveler’s) behavior needs to be developed from an emerging market perspective. Here, the researchers observe the comparative effect of user-generated content; the firm generated content and social media advertising on consumers7 message involvement, the formation of an attitude towards the travel destination, and finally the destination choice. The descriptive research design was used to conduct the study. Responses were collected from 208 respondents using a well-designed survey instrument. Statistical tools like Cronbach’s alpha, factor analysis, and regression were conducted to arrive at empirical results. The results established the importance of user-generated content towards creating consumer involvement, further resulting in the formation of a positive attitude towards the travel destination and finally leading to destination choice. The mediating role of message process involvement and attitude is also evident between the independent variables and destination choice. © Media Watch.

AB  - Online education is expanding within higher education. However, attrition rates for African American males enrolled in higher education in general, and in online courses specifically, is on the rise. Because the future of our nation depends on how well our educational institutions develop, nurture, and deploy talent, this study identified factors that promoted online course completion among African American male undergraduate students. The researchers interviewed 10 males who successfully completed online courses and identified significant themes. Factors that contributed to online course completion were financial assistance, prior academic achievement, previous information technology (IT) training, continuous academic enrollment, student selection of topics perceived as uncomplicated and less demanding or familiar due to sufficient prior knowledge, use of handheld digital devices, and a non-prejudicial learning environment. This study also revealed challenges and obstacles encountered by participants. Based on these findings, the researchers made recommendations that include strategies policymakers and educationalists can implement to promote academic achievement and degree attainment among African American males in higher education. © 2019, The Online Learning Consortium.

AB  - In recent years, the interest in lucid dreaming (dreaming with the conscious knowledge that one is dreaming) was stimulated by blockbuster films like "Inception" and the media interest in studies indicating that lucid dreaming can be beneficial. However, systematic studies regarding the attitude toward lucid dreams are lacking. An online survey was completed by 1,380 persons (777 women and 603 men), whose mean age was 51.63 ± 14.13 years. The six-item scale measuring attitude toward lucid dreams showed high internal consistency. The attitude toward lucid dreams was highly correlated with the general attitude toward lucid dreams and decreased with age; women reported a more positive attitude. However, the attitude toward lucid dreams was markedly lower than the attitude toward dreams in general. It would be interesting to study what the bases of the attitude toward lucid dreams are, for example, information in the media, personal experience, and reports of friends. © 2019 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Background: Effective leadership and change management are thought to contribute to the successful implementation of health information technology innovations. However, limited attention has been paid to the role of frontline leaders in building health professional support for new technical innovations. Objective: First, we examined whether frontline leaders’ positive expectations of a patient portal and perceptions of its implementation were associated with their support for the portal. Second, we explored whether leaders’ positive perceptions influenced the same unit’s health professional support for the portal. Methods: Data were collected through an online survey of 2067 health professionals and 401 frontline leaders working in 44 units from 14 health organizations in Finland. The participating organizations run a joint self-care and digital value services project developing a new patient portal for self-management. The survey was conducted before the piloting and implementation of the patient portal. Results: The frontline leaders’ perception of vision clarity had the strongest association with their own support for the portal (ß=.40, P<.001). Results also showed an association between leaders’ view of organizational readiness and their support (ß=.15, P=.04). The leaders’ positive perceptions of the quality of informing about the patient portal was associated with both leaders’ own (ß=.16, P=.02) and subordinate health professionals’ support for the portal (ß=.08, P<.001). Furthermore, professional participation in the planning of the portal was positively associated with their support (ß=.57, P<.001). Conclusions: Findings suggest that assuring good informing, communicating a clear vision to frontline leaders, and acknowledging organizational readiness for change can increase health professional support for electronic health (eHealth) services in the pre-implementation phase. Results highlight the role of frontline leaders in engaging professionals in the planning and implementation of eHealth services and in building health professionals’ positive attitudes toward the implementation of eHealth services. ©Sari Kujala, Iiris Hörhammer, Tarja Heponiemi, Kim Josefsson.

AB  - Introduction A review of international and Australian school-based resources suggests that teaching of the ovulatory-menstrual (OM) cycle is predominantly couched in biology. A whole-person framework that integrates spiritual, intellectual, social and emotional dimensions with the physical changes of the OM cycle is needed to facilitate adolescent OM health literacy. This paper describes the protocol for a study that aims to develop and trial an intervention for adolescent girls aged 13-16 years that enhances positive attitudes towards OM health coupled with developing skills to monitor and self-report OM health. These skills aim to foster acceptance of the OM cycle as a 'vital sign' and facilitate confident communication of common OM disturbances (namely, dysmenorrhoea, abnormal uterine bleeding and premenstrual syndrome), which are known to impact school and social activities. Methods and analysis Phase I will comprise a Delphi panel of women's health specialists, public health professionals and curriculum consultants and focus groups with adolescent girls, teachers and school healthcare professionals. This will inform the development of an intervention to facilitate OM health literacy. The Delphi panel will also inform the development of a valid and reliable questionnaire to evaluate OM health literacy. Phase II will trial the intervention with a convenience sample of at least 175 adolescent girls from one single-sex school. The mixed-method evaluation of the intervention will include a pre-intervention and post-intervention questionnaire. One-on-one interviews with teachers and school healthcare professionals will expand the understanding of the barriers, enablers and suitability of implementation of the intervention in a school-based setting. Finally, focus groups with purposively selected trial participants will further refine the intervention. Ethics and dissemination The study findings will be disseminated through local community seminars, conferences, peer-review articles and media channels where appropriate. The Curtin University of Human Research Ethics Committee has approved this study (approval HRE2018-0101). This project is registered with the 'Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry'.

AB  - In retail settings, social perception of other peoples' preferences is fundamental to successful interpersonal interactions (e.g., product recommendations, gift-giving). This type of perception must be made with little information, very often based solely on facial cues. Although people are capable of accurately predicting others' preferences from facial cues, we do not yet know how such inferences are made by crossmodal correspondence (arbitrary sensory associations) between facial cues and inferred attributes. The crossmodal correspondence literature implies the existence of sensory associations between shapes and tastes, and people consistently match roundness and angularity to sweet and sour foods, respectively. Given that peoples' faces have dimensions characterized by roundness and angularity, it may be plausible that people infer others' preferences by relying on the correspondence between facial roundness and taste. Based on a crossmodal correspondence framework, this study aimed to reveal the role of shape-taste correspondences in social perception. We investigated whether Japanese participants infer others' taste (sweet/sour) preferences based on facial shapes (roundness/angularity). The results showed that participants reliably inferred that round-faced (vs. angular-faced) individuals preferred sweet foods (Study 1). Round-faced individuals and sweet foods were well matched, and the matching mediated the inference of other person's preferences (Study 2). An association between facial roundness and inference of sweet taste preferences was observed in more natural faces, and perceived obesity mediated this association (Study 3). These findings advance the applicability of crossmodal correspondences in social perception, and imply the pervasiveness of prejudicial bias in the marketplace. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - There are some factors affecting people’s perceptions towards other countries. Information obtained from textbooks and teachers, especially during a student’s primary school education, is arguably amongst the most important factors affecting these perceptions. In addition, media, social media, and family and friendship groups are also among the factors affecting the opinions of students towards other countries [1]. Although few studies have been conducted examining the perceptions and opinions of the international students studying in Turkey, there are fewer studies determining perceptions of other countries’ students towards Turkey who are not studying in Turkey (whether in their home country or elsewhere). In this context, the primary aim of this research is to determine Malay university students’ perceptions towards with Turkey and its history. In accordance with this purpose, a solution has been created for the identified subproblems in this study. The study is carried out using qualitative research methods. The study is designed as a case study because it is aimed to determine the current situation. Case studies are a preferred method when it is aimed to present the situation in detail. In this context, it aimed to gather data with semi-structured interviews, because it is compatible with the nature of the study. The sample of the study is determined according to the convenience sample method because it is the most easily accessible. In light of the findings obtained from the study, it was understood that information about Ottoman history was included in Malaysian school textbooks and students were aware about the Ottoman Empire. In addition, it was found that some of the students had a positive attitude towards Turkey and up to date information about the country. In order to better comprehend the perception of non-Turkish students towards Turkey, it is advisable that similar studies be carried out in other countries. © 2019 by authors, all rights reserved.

AB  - While research has indicated that perceiving alcohol-related posts on Facebook can be predictive of future alcohol consumption for college students, little research has considered the consequences of posting about alcohol on future behavior. The purpose of this study was to consider the pathways through which alcoholrelated posts on Facebook may lead to increased drinking among the college students who make these posts. Incoming college freshmen (310 participants) from 2 universities were interviewed before their freshman year of college (T1) and again 1 year later (T2), and their Facebook profiles were evaluated for alcohol-related posts during the academic year. A positive attitude toward alcohol before freshman year was positively related to drinking activity before sophomore year. This relationship was mediated by alcohol-related Facebook posts during the academic year and the percentage of friends reported to be drinkers before sophomore year. Theoretically, this is evidence of identity shift online, as well as a Facebook-induced friend shift. These findings highlight the role that Facebook may play in both identity development and friendship cultivation for college freshmen, and offer insight into future collegiate drinking prevention and intervention initiatives. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Place emotion is an important factor in studying the behavioral intention of tourists. Based on the planning behavior theory and goal-oriented behaviormodel, this article combines the actual situation of rural tourist, expands the behavioral theory, and constructs the tourist behavior of place emotion. This paper takes the World Cultural Heritage Sites Xidi and Hongcun as research cases and uses Structural EquationModeling (SEM) researchmethods. The results indicate that the constructed behavior intention of tourists traveling in rural areas gives a good explanation and goodness of fit. The influence of place emotion on behavioral intention is stronger than attitude, subjective norm, and perceptual behavior control. Through multiple mediation analysis, attitudes have partial mediating effects on place emotions, perceptual behavior control, and subjective norms, and the place emotion has the most significant among the indirect effects, followed by subjective norms and perceptual behavior control. The results provide reliable advice for the sustainable development of rural tourism. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Recent green advertising research has focused on the effectiveness of different advertising claims and people's interactions with the environment or environmental concerns, indicating the significant role of visual appeals in influencing people's environmental attitudes. However, surprisingly, only a limited amount of research has addressed the effect of lettering case in green advertising on people's perceptions and their consequent environmental concerns. This study tries to fill in this research gap by showing that uppercase (vs. lowercase) advertising taglines on environmental threats could improve people's fear arousal, advertising congruence, environmental concern and the mediating role of fear arousal and congruence in this process. The managerial implications and limitations are also discussed in this study. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Social campaigns focusing on health are commonly used within an attempt to change behavior. To date, there has not been a targeted analysis of societies’ general perception about social campaigns. The aim of this study is to assess citizens’ opinions on the effectiveness of health-related social campaigns. Methods: The data set used in the analysis was obtained from Poland’s nationwide “Social Diagnosis” study. The determinants of public opinion were assessed using a multivariate logistic regression. The independent variables included socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle, social participation, and the use of digital media. Results: The logistic regression model was developed using 23,593 cases. Opinions about the effectiveness of campaigns depended on all the predictors included in the socio-demographic cluster, smoking, self-declared excessive alcohol consumption, physical activity, the use of mobile phones, and watching TV. A significant impact was found in all but one variable related to social participation. Conclusions: The analysis revealed that opinions about social campaigns present in the media “landscape” are influenced by many factors. Interestingly, persons exhibiting unhealthy behaviors are more resistant to health-related campaigns and surprisingly the need to make use of healthcare resources is not accompanied by an acceptance of the interventions. © 2019 by the author.

AB  - Australian Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Peter Dutton, has framed the mid-1970s immigration of Lebanese affected by civil war as Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser's “mistake”. His remarks sparked controversy in the parliament and the media. The issue became a contest of frames between the Murdoch media, which supported the Minister's “mistake” frame and argued his right to “tell the truth”, and the Fairfax media, which viewed the Minister as being “racist” for “scapegoating” the Lebanese community. Along with archival documents, this article examines the context and coverage of the Minister's remarks, noting that the frames presented in the media “indexed” those adopted amongst political elites, while failing to re-examine the historical record. This case study demonstrates the power of framing and the media's tendency to accept rather than challenge frames used by those in the political contest, with the result that errors in the representation of history were never corrected. This article draws on framing theory and indexing theory and concludes that the “mistake” frame for the Lebanese feeds into narratives that serve to “other” Muslim and Arab groups, fanning fears and mobilising a discourse of Islamophobia around the exclusion of “undesirable” immigrants on the basis of “cultural fit”. © 2019 The University of Queensland and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

AB  - Recognition of same-sex marriage and parenting has increased in the last two decades but remains a controversial issue in which public opinion plays a role, as it can influence political leaders but also determine the immediate environment of same-sex families. The literature highlights the effect of religiosity, political orientation, beliefs about etiology of homosexuality, and social contacts with gay men and lesbians on attitudes toward same-sex marriage and parenting (ASSMP). The aim of this study was to explore the under-studied mediation role of sexual prejudice in this process and how participants’ gender moderated the mediation effects. Data were collected from 1416 heterosexual French students and analyzed with moderated mediation models in accordance with recent recommendations from Hayes (2013). Sexual prejudice mediated the effects of religiosity, political orientation, and etiological beliefs on ASSMP more strongly in men than in women. It also mediated the effect of contact with gay and lesbian persons and same-sex couples on ASSMP in men but not in women. The results highlight the need to explicitly deconstruct negative beliefs about homosexuality during debates about same-sex marriage and same-sex parenting, even when prejudice against homosexuality itself is not explicit in opponents’ discourse. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This meta-analysis examines propositions derived from Intergroup Threat Theory (ITT; Stephan, Ybarra, & Morrison, 2009) regarding the role of symbolic and realistic threats on the relationship between contact and prejudice. Specifically, analyses examined whether threat has an indirect effect on the contact-prejudice relationship (aka mediation). Thirty-nine papers comprising 54 samples and over 25,000 participants provided 347 effects for analysis. Supporting ITT predictions, results clearly demonstrated the presence of an indirect effect. Tests of several moderators, including type of contact measure, type of threat, dimension of prejudice, and target of bias suggest that indirect effects are largely consistent across each domain of comparison. Findings are consistent with ITT's propositions that contact influences threat and feelings of threat lead to prejudice. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.

AB  - Introduction The recent introduction of red tabards aimed at avoiding interruptions during medication rounds has generated scientific and media debate, which is still ongoing. The principal aim of this study was to evaluate patients' perceptions of 3 different red tabards; the secondary aim was to explore individual factors associated with the negative perceptions that emerged. Methods Eligible patients had to be admitted to the selected general surgical department and give written informed consent. A total of 104 patients were interviewed. Three real-sized red tabards, made with laminated paper and displaying different messages, were shown over 3 days to each patient involved. Results Despite displaying different messages, from asking everyone not to disturb to allowing only patients to interrupt, patients perceived the tabards as directed at themselves. A different risk of preventing patients from communicating urgent needs emerged. The first tabard I am administering medication-Please do not interrupt me was most at risk to inhibit the patient. A negative impact was reported by 44 patients (42.3%) for the first tabard, 50 (48.0%) for the second tabard, and 40 (38.4%) for the third. In the logistic regression, only 2 independent factors were significantly associated with the negative perception of the message reported on the tabards: a positive attitude to interrupting nurses and receiving medication during their time in hospital. However, the variance explained by these factors ranges from 9.4% to 18.3%. Conclusions On the basis of the findings that emerged, the adoption of the tabards should be evaluated considering the benefits already documented, and the potential negative effects that emerged on patients, which may be influenced by cultural and linguistic aspects. Wearing the tabard with the message reported on the back, directed to the staff and not the patients, may have less negative effects on patients; in addition, using a different color not to alarm the patients may be useful. In addition, comparing the red tabard effects with other strategies introduced to deal with avoidable interruptions (e.g., "no interruption zone") to gain a comprehensive picture regarding benefits/harm is also important. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Transference occurs when one generalizes perceptions or feelings that originate from one or more persons, the source, onto one or more other persons or entities, the target—those perceived as similar to, or symbolic of, the source (e.g., Berenson & Andersen, 2006; Langer, 1943/1972). The authors propose a mediational model in which (a) negative attitudes towards parents lead to (b) negative attitudes toward authority figures, in general, which lead to (c) beliefs consistent with 9/11 conspiracy theories. The model was tested with a sample of American college students (n = 86). Multiple regression analyses examining the hypothesized indirect effect of (b) above with bootstrapping (e.g., Mallinckrodt et al., 2006) supported the model—but only concerning students’ attitudes towards their mother or mother figure growing up. Variables not associated with 9/11 conspiracy beliefs were: attitudes toward dad, attitudes toward mom and dad, political party affiliation, political liberalism/conservatism, and broken vs. intact families. Negative maternal transference appears to be a viable yet under-recognized explanation for beliefs in conspiracy theories. © NAJP.

AB  - For several decades now, neoliberalism has been the dominant economic and political ideology throughout large parts of the world. In many places, its rise has gone hand in hand with growing social inequality and a cultural emphasis on individualism and competition. Lately, concerns are being raised about the effects of these developments on politics and societies. The renewed rise of populism in Europe, the United States, and other countries has been attributed to economic insecurity among the working and middle classes by politicians, journalists, and academics alike. Similarly, the spread of nationalist and anti-immigration sentiments is frequently interpreted as a result of fears over job security and perceived competition in a hostile economic climate. We examined the effect of neoliberalism on two types of prejudice (anti-elitism and anti-immigrant prejudice) across two studies in Germany (N = 198) and the UK (N = 173). Results show that priming neoliberalism leads to higher levels of anti-elitism but not anti-immigrant prejudice and that this effect is mediated by anomie and negative psychological reactions (feelings of threat, unfairness, and hopelessness). Thus, our research suggests that while neoliberalism is linked to lower social cohesion and increased outgroup derogation, this is not primarily directed against disadvantaged social groups but against those at the top. © 2019 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - This article explores the gendered process that leads to women informal miners’ restricted access to natural resources, their exclusion and their stigmatization in one village in the Muslim post-Soviet space. Drawing on eight months of ethnographic work in the village of Kante in Northern Tajikistan, this article seeks to understand how and why this process is mediated through notions of honor and shame traditionally seen as anchored in Muslim religion. A focus on changing masculinities and their relationship with women miners’ exclusion in this extractive landscape where informal coal mining developed alongside male migration and the setting up of a Sino-Tajik coal mine after the fall of the Soviet Union, allows us to develop a feminist political ecology of honor and shame. Here, I reveal how these cultural notions are mobilized in the wake of embodied and emotional work and resource struggles and the gendered impacts of broader politico-ecological changes. I particularly link women miners’ exclusion and its mediation through notions of honor and shame to men's loss of sense of self since the fall of the Soviet Union and the reconfiguration of masculinities with new work and resource struggles. By doing so, this article challenges the idea of Muslim men as fixed into codes of honor and patriarchy anchored in religion. Instead, it develops a re-theorization of Muslim masculinities which highlights instances where men oppress women at the same time as it challenges culturalist readings of gender and Muslimness that overemphasize culture/religion to the detriment of the economic/ecological. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rationale: Childhood vaccination is a safe and effective way of reducing infectious diseases. Yet, public confidence in vaccination is waning, driven in part by the ‘manufacture of doubt’ by anti-vaccination activists and websites. However, there is little research examining the psychological underpinnings of anti-vaccination rhetoric among parents. Objectives: Here, we examined the structure and moral roots of anti-vaccination attitudes amongst Australian parents active on social media parenting sites. Methods: Participants (N = 296) completed questionnaires assessing their vaccination attitudes, behavioural intentions, and moral preferences. Results: Using Latent Profile Analysis, we identified three profiles (i.e., groups), interpretable as vaccine “accepters” “fence sitters” and “rejecters” each characterised by a distinct pattern of vaccination attitudes and moral preferences. Accepters exhibited positive vaccination attitudes and strong intentions to vaccinate; rejecters exhibited the opposite pattern of responses; whilst fence sitters exhibited an intermediate pattern of responses. Compared to accepters, rejecters and fence sitters exhibited a heightened moral preference for liberty (belief in the rights of the individual) and harm (concern about the wellbeing of others). Compared to acceptors and fence sitters, rejecters exhibited a heightened moral preference for purity (an abhorrence for impurity of body), and a diminished moral preference for authority (deference to those in positions of power). Conclusion: Given the sensitivity of fence sitters and rejecters to liberty-related moral concerns, our research cautions against the use of adversarial approaches—e.g., No Jab, No Pay legislation—that promote vaccination uptake by restricting parental freedoms, as they may backfire amongst parents ambivalent toward vaccination. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Decades of research in behavioral endocrinology has implicated the gonadal hormone testosterone in the regulation of mating effort, often expressed in primates in the form of aggressive and/or status-striving behavior. Based on the idea that neuroendocrine axes influence each other, recent work among humans has proposed that links between testosterone and indices of status-striving are rendered conditional by the effects of glucocorticoids. The Dual Hormone hypothesis is one particular instance of this argument, predicting that cortisol blocks the effects of testosterone on dominance, aggression, and risk-taking in humans. Support for the Dual Hormone hypothesis is wide-ranging, but considerations of theoretical ambiguity, null findings, and low statistical power pose problems for interpreting the published literature. Here, we contribute to the development of the Dual Hormone hypothesis by (1) critically reviewing the extant literature—including p-curve analyses of published findings; and, (2) “opening the file drawer” and examining relationships between testosterone, cortisol, and status-striving personality features in seven previously published studies from our laboratories (total N = 718; median N per feature = 318) that examined unrelated predictions. Results from p-curve suggest that published studies have only 16% power to detect effects, while our own data show no robust interactions between testosterone and cortisol in predicting status-striving personality features. We discuss the implications of these results for the Dual Hormone hypothesis, limitations of our analyses, and the development of future research. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Thirty-six participants were given three social discounting surveys, and each survey was preceded by one of three contrived hypothetical scenarios. In each scenario, the participant was asked to consider situations in which either the participant (SELF), a hypothetical other (OTHER), or both the participant and the hypothetical other (BOTH) were experiencing economic hardship (i.e., needed money to avoid a negative outcome). Results replicate previous research suggesting that the probability of participants foregoing the money decreased across social distance in the BOTH and OTHER conditions; however, no discounting was observed for median responses in the SELF condition. In addition, the highest area under the curve and lowest s values were associated with the OTHER condition, and the inverse results were observed for the SELF condition. Taken together, these results suggest that relative economic hardship may act as a motivating operation affecting social discounting with the potential for further translational utility. © 2019 Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior

AB  - This study investigated the association between perceived parental positive and negative contact and adolescents’ own positive and negative contact experiences and tested perspective-taking, intergroup anxiety, outgroup attitudes, and approach behavioral tendencies as potential mediators. A total of 325 7th and 8th Year Turkish students completed questionnaires in classrooms (Mage = 13.46, SD = 0.75). Structural equation models demonstrated that percieved negative parental contact was directly and strongly associated with negative, but not positive, adolescent contact, whereas parental positive contact had a direct positive association with adolescent positive contact. We further found that perceived parental positive contact was related to higher perspective-taking and lower intergroup anxiety which promoted approach behavioral tendencies which was, in turn, related to more positive and less negative contact among adolescents. The study highlights the critical function of parental positive and negative contact on the formation of adolescents’ contact behaviors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Transitioning into a new professional role is challenging. Unfortunately, little is currently known about how to reduce experiences of stress among new professionals. The socialization processes role clarity, task mastery, and social acceptance are assumed to reduce experiences of stress as they mediate new professionals’ acquisition of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors. However, little prospective data is available on the actual effect of the processes on stress. Objectives: To prospectively investigate how the socialization processes relate to experiences of stress among new nurses during the first three months of professional working life. Specifically, to investigate development over time, as well as how episodes of increased or decreased levels of the socialization processes relate to concurrent levels of stress. The general purpose of this investigation was to examine the suitability of the socialization processes as targets of an intervention seeking to reduce stress among new professionals. Design: An intensive longitudinal study with weekly data collections over three months. Participants: 264 newly graduated Swedish nurses who started their first job during the period of the study. Methods: The participants were followed prospectively during 14 consecutive weeks after their professional entry. Data on stress (Stress and Energy Questionnaire), role clarity (General Questionnaire for Psychological and Social Factors at Work), task mastery, and social acceptance (Needs Satisfaction and Frustration Scale) were collected weekly using digital surveys (mean response rate 82.7%). Data was analyzed using a multilevel model for intensive longitudinal data. Results: For the typical nurse, stress decreased by 0.13 units per month, role clarity and task mastery increased by 0.08 and 0.05 units, and social acceptance decreased by 0.08 units. In addition, the slopes of 95 percent of the new nurses varied within 1.18 (stress), 0.72 (role clarity), 0.44 (task mastery), and 0.86 (social acceptance) units of the typical nurse. Most importantly, when the new nurses experienced higher levels of task mastery, role clarity, and social acceptance, they experienced lower levels of stress (within-person parameter estimates: task mastery −0.40, p =.001; role clarity −0.34, p =.001; and social acceptance −0.33, p =.001). Conclusions: Supporting the development of the socialization processes could be one theoretically based strategy to reduce levels of stress among new nurses. As stress among new professionals is not unique to the nursing profession, and the processes are considered important mediators of new professionals’ adaptation in general, the results from this study should likely be generalizable to other professions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sentiment analysis of social media data is crucial to understand people's position, attitude, and opinion toward a certain event, which has many applications such as election prediction and product evaluation. Though great effort has been devoted to the single modality (image or text), less effort is paid to the joint analysis of multimodal data in social media. Most of the existing methods for multimodal sentiment analysis simply combine different data modalities, which results in dissatisfying performance on sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose a novel image–text sentiment analysis model, i.e., Deep Multimodal Attentive Fusion (DMAF), to exploit the discriminative features and the internal correlation between visual and semantic contents with a mixed fusion framework for sentiment analysis. Specifically, to automatically focus on discriminative regions and important words which are most related to the sentiment, two separate unimodal attention models are proposed to learn effective emotion classifiers for visual and textual modality respectively. Then, an intermediate fusion-based multimodal attention model is proposed to exploit the internal correlation between visual and textual features for joint sentiment classification. Finally, a late fusion scheme is applied to combine the three attention models for sentiment prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both weakly labeled and manually labeled datasets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In response to media reports of increased teasing and bullying in schools following the 2016 U.S. presidential election, we investigated its prevalence with a Virginia school climate survey completed by approximately 155,000 seventh- and eighth-grade students in 2013, 2015, and 2017. Survey results were mapped onto presidential election results for each school division’s locality. In localities favoring the Republican candidate, there were higher adjusted rates of students reporting that (a) they had experienced some form of bullying in the past year (18% higher) and (b) “students in this school are teased or put down because of their race or ethnicity” (9% higher). For these two outcomes, there were no meaningful differences prior to the election. These results provide modest support for educator concerns about increased teasing and bullying since the 2016 presidential election in some schools and warrant further investigation. © 2019 AERA.

AB  - Substantial efforts devoted to decreasing the burden of transport-related injuries (TRIs) in Canada, including public awareness campaigns aiming to influence attitudes and behaviors, may lead the public to perceive other types of injuries differently. This study examined the relationship between public perception of the preventability of injuries and the type of injury (TRIs vs. non-transport unintentional injuries (NTUIs)); and assessed whether exposure to a social marketing campaign (Preventable) influenced this association. A cross-sectional study design employed survey data collected by Preventable between 2015 and 2016 from 1501 British Columbians aged 25–54 years. A multiple linear regression model was applied to examine the relationship between the type of injury (TRIs vs. NTUIs) and attitudes towards preventability, controlling for socio-demographic variables. Exposure to the campaign was tested as an effect modifier. On a scale from 1 to 10, respondents perceived TRIs to be 1.08 points more preventable than NTUIs (95% CI: 1.00 to 1.16, p-value < 0.0001). Campaign-exposed participants scored 0.31 points higher on preventability of injuries overall (95% CI: 0.16 to 0.47, p-value < 0.0001); and recorded a smaller difference between the perceived preventability of TRIs and NTUIs, relative to those not exposed to the campaign (B = −0.163, 95% CI: –0.28 to −0.04, p-value = 0.008). While respondents believed that most injuries are preventable, exposure to considerable road traffic interventions in Canada may have influenced public attitudes towards a higher perceived preventability of TRIs. Social marketing may be a useful tool to emphasize the preventability of all injuries to further reduce their burden in Canada. © 2018

AB  - This article explores technologically integrated relationship practices among college students. Analyzing interviews of 52 participants at two very different US colleges, I explore how they construct, establish, and maintain technologically mediated social networks. This research focuses specifically on the practice of “doing homework,” in which participants conduct social media investigations of potential friends and use that data to determine if a relationship continues. Findings suggest the establishment of offline relationships includes the use of social media profiles to collect social and political attitude data on potential friends. Participants report the use of such data as essential to their decision-making processes about friendship, resulting in a potential increase in social and political homogeneity within offline social networks. These findings contribute to our ongoing understanding of the role of informational echo chambers within a technologically integrated social environment. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Researchers have shown that prejudice encourages explanations for inequality that attribute stigmatized groups’ negative outcomes to internal-controllable causes. We extended this research by investigating how ambivalent sexism affects attributions for gender income inequality. Hostile sexism should facilitate acceptance of gender income inequality through attributions that emphasize individual choice. We tested this hypothesis in two web-based samples of predominately White American men and women, ranging in age from 18 to 82 years (M age = 33.8). In Study 1 (N = 650), hostile sexism, but not benevolent sexism, positively predicted acceptance of gender income inequality. Attributions of choice and societal unfairness mediated this effect. In Study 2 (N = 242), following exposure to hostile sexism, participants increased acceptance of gender income inequality; choice explanations mediated this relation, although these effects occurred for political conservatives only. Consistent with prior work on attributions, hostile sexism was linked to victim-blaming attributions for gender income inequality. Overall, hostile sexism creates an attitudinal barrier—especially for conservatives—to supporting equal pay for women. To overcome this barrier, organizations could implement strategies aimed at ensuring more objective performance evaluations and pay decisions. Further, policy makers and communicators should be careful in choosing how they frame the gender pay gap.

AB  - The current studies aimed to reveal the potential role of imagined intergroup contact on collective action tendencies within a context of intergroup conflict. Study 1 (disadvantaged Kurds, N = 80) showed that imagined contact increased collective action tendencies and this effect was mediated by increased perceived discrimination and ethnic identification. Study 2 (advantaged Turks, N = 127) demonstrated that imagined contact also directly increased collective action tendencies, as well as perceived discrimination and relative deprivation among the advantaged group. No significant mediation emerged. At the same time, in line with literature, imagined contact led only the advantaged group members to display more positive outgroup attitudes. Findings suggest that in settings where ingroup identities and conflict are salient, imagined contact may not readily undermine motivation for social change among group members. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cultural diversity due to immigration has become a key topic in many societies today. The question of how the native population experiences these developments is of prime importance for intercultural relations and sets the base for acculturation of immigrants. Drawing on attachment and multiculturalism research, we supposed here that general and specific feelings of security might be related to more positive attitudes toward cultural diversity, whereas feelings of threat might be related to less openness. More precisely, the present study investigated how natives’ general attachment (secure or fearful) as well as their specific feelings of (cultural or economic) security might be related to their expectations about acculturation of immigrants in the multicultural context of Luxembourg. The sample included N = 134 Luxembourg nationals with an average age of M = 45.02 (SD = 17.41) who filled out an online questionnaire. Results revealed that self-reported fearful general attachment was positively related to more unwelcoming acculturation orientations. Relations between general attachment and acculturation orientations were mediated by feelings of cultural security, which had strong effects on host nationals’ (un)welcoming acculturation orientations over and above general attachment. Findings suggest that (un)welcoming orientations toward immigrants, entailing openness for cultural contact and exchange, are related to feelings of cultural and economic security which are partly biased by a general secure or fearful attachment. Feelings of security seem thus to provide a secure base for tolerance and openness to cultural diversity which are needed in order to deal successfully with the challenges of today's multicultural societies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the aim of analyzing relationships between photography, empathy, viewing contexts, and circulation, this article examines two case studies where contemporary photographers have depicted injection drug users over a period. It uses Gruen's theory of entangled empathy, a way of practicing empathy that derives from an ethics of care, to analyze them. In the online series The Faces of Addiction, 2011–2015, Chris Arnade documented the lives of several subjects in the Hunts Point area of the Bronx, New York City. Arnade's goals were to use photography to reach a wide audience, to humanize drug users, and to reveal the structural inequalities that he believed caused addiction. Viewers engaged with the photographs on social media. In the second case, Canadian photographer Tony Fouhse depicted Stephanie MacDonald, a woman he met on the street in Ottawa, as she struggled through drug dependence, a health crisis, and recovery. This project is entitled Live Through This, 2013. Fouhse's audience viewed the photographs in the more traditional spaces of art gallery and photography book. He also workshopped some of the photographs on his blog. These differing projects and viewing contexts elicit a range of empathic engagements with the photographs and the subjects depicted in them. Examining such photographic projects through the lens of entangled empathy reveals potential policy implications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: : Depression is associated with difficulties in interpersonal relationships, of which communication is an integral part. Communication can not only be effected by verbal means, but also non-verbally by touch. Against this background, the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between depression, interpersonal problems and the attitude towards social touch. Methods: : 147 individuals (115 females; 21–71 years old) seeking treatment in a clinic for outpatient psychotherapy took part in the survey. Three questionnaires evaluating the level of depression (Beck Depression Questionnaire), the degree of interpersonal problems (Inventory of Interpersonal Problems) and the attitude towards social touch (Social Touch Questionnaire, were administered. Results: : Highly depressed individuals had a more negative attitude towards social touch than non-to lowly depressed individuals. Highly depressed individuals particularly reported to dislike physical touch by not well-known people, but not by close ones. Highly depressed individuals also reported more interpersonal problems, with the level of depression predicting the degree of interpersonal problems. This relationship was partially mediated by the attitude towards social touch in general and, to a greater extent, by the dislike of physical touch by people not well-known in particular. Discussion: : Given the role of social touch in the relationship between depression and interpersonal problems, the attitude towards touch may be taken into consideration in the therapy of depressed patients. We assume that a more positive attitude towards social touch can influence the ability to create and maintain interpersonal relationships. © 2018

AB  - The purpose of this research is to investigate how the green image of a city can affect potential visitors' attitude toward the city in the context of user-generated content. The study adopts a 2 × 2 experimental design in which the greenness of the city image and the social distance between the users and the authors of social media content are examined. The results demonstrate that green image has a significant effect on attitudes toward cities. Moreover, the effects of social media content vary according to the perceived social distance between the author of the post and potential visitors. This study contributes to the literature by assessing the role that social media content plays in place branding and communication. Furthermore, it provides relevant insights on how institutions should enhance the sustainable resources of cities with their environmental policy and encourage the generation of content from various stakeholders to contribute to the development of a city's image. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

AB  - Direct training of selected individuals as disseminating farmers (DFs) can help to implement a farmer to farmer extension approach. This study systematically examines the relationship between social distance and the likelihood of information exchange, subsequently evaluating effects on awareness, knowledge, and adoption of drought-tolerant (DT) varieties of maize, disease-resistant varieties of groundnuts and conservation farming. Using a panel dataset from northern Uganda, the study combines matching techniques with difference-in-difference (DID) approach and employs two-stage least squares regression (2SLS) to identify causal effects. The study finds an increased likelihood of information exchange when the DF is female, regardless of the sex of the neighbour. The likelihood of information exchange increased when distance in farm size cultivated with maize was larger than the median in the sub-village. In terms of non-agricultural assets index, there was an increased likelihood of information exchange both when the distance was smaller and greater than the village median. Information exchange links improved awareness and knowledge for all of the technologies, but only increased adoption of maize varieties. Together, these findings suggest that social distance shapes the diffusion of agricultural knowledge even when DFs are selected by the community to be “representative” and reinforces that social learning can help to address informational constraints to adoption of agricultural technologies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Creativity is a commonly assumed characteristic of entrepreneurs. It is proposed to be a necessary, although not sufficient, prerequisite for entrepreneurship. This study aimed to deepen our understanding of the relationship between self-perceived creativity and entrepreneurial intentions. To do so, we conducted a cross-sectional survey study among 559 university students. We tested an expanded model based on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), which included self-perceived creativity as a distal antecedent of entrepreneurial intentions. In addition, we examined both the role of perceived family and university support for creativity, as well as taking a creativity course, in boosting self-perceived creativity. While some empirical evidence has indicated a direct link between (perceived) creativity and entrepreneurial intentions, the TPB posits that three antecedents (attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control/self-efficacy) would be the only direct determinants of intentions. All other factors are theorized to indirectly influence intentions through one or more of these components. The results of partial least squares structural modelling refuted this assumption. Entrepreneurial self-efficacy and positive attitudes did indeed mediate the self-perceived creativity – entrepreneurial intentions link, but self-perceived creativity explained additional variance in entrepreneurial intentions, beyond these TPB components. In addition, our results showed that family and university support for creativity, as well as taking a creativity course, were significant predictors of self-perceived creativity. Postgraduate students, and particularly male students, perceived greater university and family support and reported greater self-perceived creativity than did undergraduate students. We conclude that teaching creativity contents and practice are a useful way to enrich entrepreneurship programmes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective: We assessed how third-year medical students’ written reflections on home visit experiences with families of children with special needs demonstrate evidence of exposure to 9 selected competencies for pediatric clerkships designated by the Council on Medical Student Education in Pediatrics. Methods: We reviewed written reflections from 152 third-year medical students. For each competency (2 related to communication were combined), we tabulated the number of reflections in which a given competency was demonstrated. Within each competency, themes are described and presented with exemplary quotes to provide a more robust picture of students’ exposure and experience. Results: Of 152 reflections, 100% demonstrated at least 1 of the 8 expected competencies. Each reflection exhibited an average of 3 (3.1) competencies (range: 1–7). The competencies most frequently mentioned were demonstration of respect for patient, parent, and family attitudes, behaviors, and lifestyles (90%) and demonstration of positive attitude toward education (76%). Less frequently mentioned competencies included demonstration of behaviors and attitudes that promote patients’ and families’ best interests (41%), demonstration of effective verbal and nonverbal communication skills (a combination of 2 communication-related competencies) (33%), and description of barriers that prevent children from accessing health care (37%). The following competencies were least often mentioned: description of a pediatrician's role and responsibility in advocating for patients’ needs (10%), description of the important role of patient education (8%), or description of the types of problems that benefit from a community approach (17%). Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates that community-based home visits can provide medical students with opportunities to meet required pediatric clerkship competencies. © 2018 Academic Pediatric Association

AB  - Aims: To assess the impact of social deprivation, demographics and centre on HbA 1c outcomes with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in adults with Type 1 diabetes. Methods: Demographic data, postcode-derived English Index of Multiple Deprivation data and 12-month average HbA 1c (mmol/mol) pre- and post-CSII were collated from three diabetes centres in the north west of England, University Hospital of South Manchester (UHSM), Salford Royal Foundation Hospital (SRFT) and Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI). Univariable and multivariable regression models explored relationships between demographics, Index of Multiple Deprivation, centre and HbA 1c outcomes. Results: Data were available for 693 (78%) individuals (UHSM, n = 90; SRFT, n = 112; and MRI, n = 491) of whom 59% were women. Median age at CSII start was 39 (IQR 29.5–49.0) years and median diabetes duration was 20 (11–29) years. Median Index of Multiple Deprivation was 15 193 (6313–25 727). Overall median HbA 1c improved from 69 to 64 mmol/mol (8.5% to 8.0%) within the first year of CSII. In multivariable analysis, higher pre-CSII HbA 1c was significantly associated with higher deprivation (P = 0.036), being female (P &lt; 0.001), and centre (MRI; P = 0.005). Following pre-CSII HbA 1c adjustment, post-CSII HbA 1c or HbA 1c change were not related to demographic factors and deprivation, but remained significantly related to the centre; UHSM and SRFT had larger reductions in HbA 1c with CSII compared with MRI [median −7.0 (−0.6%) vs. −6.0 (−0.55%) vs. −4.5 (−0.45%) mmol/mol; P = 0.005]. Conclusions: Higher pre-CSII HbA 1c levels were associated with higher deprivation and being female. CSII improves HbA 1c irrespective of social deprivation and demographics. Significant differences in HbA 1c improvements were observed between centres. Further work is warranted to explain these differences and minimize variation in clinical outcomes with CSII. © 2018 Diabetes UK

AB  - Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a well-touted term in management disciplines that connects the business goals and societal values. CSR is used as a strategic approach that gives competitive differentiation through coagulation of both business and overarching societal goals. Organizations believe that goodwill created by CSR activities bestows the strategic competitive advantage and sustainable development. The objective of the study is to measure the impact of CSR activities on purchase intention either directly or indirectly; for this purpose, the study has administered a structured questionnaire and collected responses from Indian citizens purchasing products from FMCG companies topping the CSR spending list and used structural equation modeling to validate the results. The findings suggest that customers process CSR details unconsciously and may not remember the explicit detail, but they are more likely to include the brand in the consideration set evokedby positive attitudes trailing behind. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

AB  - Background: Bangladesh has implemented school-based mass drug administration (MDA) bi-annually since 2008 aimed to control soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection. Despite several rounds of MDA, the government is still facing challenges to achieve the target coverage and utilization of the intervention. This study was done to explore and explain the barriers and gaps that hinder the utilization and coverage of MDA for STH. Methods: This research was a mixed method study, was conducted in two selected districts of Bangladesh. A total of 160 questionnaire surveys, 12 in-depth interviews, 8 focus group discussion, and 2 key-informant interviews were done among 238 study participants which included school-age children with relevant parents, school teachers, health workers, community leaders and MDA program managers. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to analyze the quantitative data while thematic analysis was applied for the qualitative data. Results: It was revealed that the participants have positive attitudes towards MDA but they pointed out the limitations in reaching all target population especially non-school going children. The level of knowledge regarding STH and MDA were found different among the study population. The evaluated coverage of MDA was also found lower than that reported. Some major barriers associated with MDA coverage found in this study were drug distribution policy, accessibility to schools, poor record keeping, follow-up, and information dissemination. Inadequate information about population dynamics and rumors about side effects of MDA drugs adversely affected the compliance of the intervention. Insufficient training of drug distributors and poor motivation among stakeholders also added to the barriers. Conclusion: There is the need to re-strategize drug distributing methods and create effective policies to include all targeted population. Use of local channels for community sensitization, adding local distribution points, regular monitoring and follow-up and promotion of health education can possibly enhance both treatment coverage and program infrastructure. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Background and Aim: This study evaluated trauma-related shame as a mediator of the association between sexual assault severity and perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. Method: A total of 164 female undergraduates who reported attempted or completed sexual assault completed self-report measures of sexual assault, trauma-related shame, perceived burdensomeness, and thwarted belongingness. Results: Using path analysis, trauma-related shame mediated the association between sexual assault severity and perceived burdensomeness, and between sexual assault severity and thwarted belongingness. Limitations: The findings of this study are limited by the retrospective, self-report, and cross-sectional nature of these data, and do not allow for causal inference. Conclusion: Trauma-related shame warrants additional investigation as a mechanism that explains the association between sexual assault and psychosocial risk factors for suicidal ideation and behavior. © 2018 Hogrefe Publishing.

AB  - Previous research has evaluated public risk perception and response to a natural hazards in various settings; however, most of these studies were conducted either with a single scenario or after a natural disaster struck. To better understand the dynamic relationships among affect, risk perception, and behavioral intentions related to natural disasters, the current study implements a simulation scenario with escalating weather intensity, and includes a natural experiment allowing comparison of public response before and after a severe tornado event with extensive coverage by the national media. The current study also manipulated the display of warning information, and investigated whether the warning system display format influences public response. Results indicate that (1) affect, risk perception, and behavioral intention escalated as weather conditions deteriorated, (2) responses at previous stages predicted responses at subsequent stages of storm progression, and (3) negative affect predicted risk perception. Moreover, risk perception and behavioral intention were heightened after exposure to the media coverage of an actual tornado disaster. However, the display format manipulation did not influence behavioral responses. The current study provides insight regarding public perception of predisaster warnings and the influence of exposure to media coverage of an actual disaster event. © 2018 Society for Risk Analysis

AB  - Hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) has recently become a very intensely debated process for extracting oil and gas. Supporters argue that fracking provides positive economic benefits and energy security and offers a decreased reliance on coal-based electricity generation. Detractors claim that the fracking process may harm the environment as well as place a strain on local communities that experience new fracking operations. This study utilizes a recently conducted survey distributed to a sample of policy elites and the general public in Arkansas and Oregon to examine the role of cultural value predispositions and trust in shaping the perceptions of risks and benefits associated with fracking. Findings indicate that cultural values influence both trust and benefit-risk perceptions of fracking for both policy elites and the general public. More specifically, we found that trust in information from various sources is derived from the intrinsic values held by an individual, which in turn impacts perceptions of related benefits and risks. We also found that while the overall pattern of relationships is similar, trust plays a larger role in the formulation of attitudes for policy elites than for the general public. We discuss the implications of the mediating role of trust in understanding value-driven benefit-risk perceptions, as well as the disparate role of trust between policy elites and the general public in the context of the policy-making process for both theory and practice. © 2018 Society for Risk Analysis

AB  - Background: It is a common prejudice that anaesthetic doctors are believed to have high coffee consumption. In this study, we aimed to assess the association between coffee drinking and work satisfaction among Scandinavian anaesthesiologists. We hypothesised that coffee consumption was positively correlated with work satisfaction. Methods: We invited anaesthesiologists attending the 34th congress of The Scandinavian Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine in Malmö, Sweden, September 2017 to participate in a paper-based survey. We collected data on characteristics of the respondents, coffee drinking and work satisfaction, and compared coffee vs non-coffee drinkers with regard to work satisfaction scored on a modified Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (Visual Analogue Scale from 0 to 10). Results: A total of 271 anaesthesiologists participated in the survey, of which 265 (97.7%) of the questionnaires contained valid data. Some 143 (54.0%) of the respondents were women, the median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 41.0 (35.0-49.5) years, and 242 (91.3%) were coffee drinkers. Coffee drinkers consumed median 4.0 (IQR: 2.5-5.0) cups of coffee daily. Overall work satisfaction was median 8 (IQR: 8-9), with no difference between respondents drinking coffee and those who did not (median 8 (IQR: 8-9) vs 8 (IQR: 8-9), Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 0.62). Also, we found no association between work satisfaction and the number of cups of coffee consumed daily (r 2  = 0.005, P = 0.24). Conclusion: In this survey, we found high work satisfaction among Scandinavian anaesthesiologists, with no difference between coffee and non-coffee drinkers. © 2018 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

AB  - The effects of intergroup contact on prejudice are well established. However, its effects on minority group well-being have been rarely studied. We hypothesized that contact with members of the majority culture will be related to better well-being, and that this is facilitated by majority language proficiency. We tested this hypothesis in a three-wave longitudinal study of refugees over 2 years (N = 180). Cross-lagged path modeling confirmed that intergroup contact at earlier time points was associated with increased well-being at later time points; the reverse associations (from earlier well-being to later contact) were not reliable. Self-rated earlier English language competence was positively associated with later intergroup contact (but not the reverse), suggesting that improving majority language proficiency might be the key to better well-being of refugees, with intergroup contact being the mediator between language and well-being. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Nonprofit soccer clubs are currently facing many ethical challenges, such as abuse, doping and match fixing. While research suggests that organizational (board) ethical leadership may be effective to tackle these ethical issues, empirical support in the context of sport remains limited. Drawing on the perceptions of a sample of nonprofit soccer players (n = 438) and coaches (n = 106), we indicate that the coaches play an important mediating role regarding the associations between board ethical leadership and ethical climate. The theoretical underpinnings of ethical leadership—formed by social learning theory and social exchange theory—and the social distance between the board and the players in nonprofit soccer clubs provide support in this regard. In sum, our results demonstrate that the influence of board ethical leadership in nonprofit soccer clubs partly trickles down to the players via coach ethical leadership. Finally, practical implications for nonprofit soccer club management are discussed. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Northern Ireland is characterised by extensive segregation between its predominantly Catholic and Protestant communities. With the aim of overcoming this segregation, the current study experimentally evaluated the effectiveness of electronic or E-contact as a novel indirect contact and prejudice-reduction strategy. Here, Catholic and Protestant participants were not required to meet physically but were involved in a collaborative and goal-orientated online interaction with a member of the other community. As predicted, E-contact improved both Catholics’ and Protestants’ outgroup attitudes via improved contact expectancies and reduced intergroup anxiety. These findings provide support for the contemporary role of online interactions in actively overcoming the physical and psychological barriers that often prevent prejudice reduction in segregated communities. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Intention to facilitate individual voluntary product recommendation in online social networking communities has attracted increased attention. However, it is not obvious why individuals recommend products in a community composed of non-transactional users. What are the critical factors influencing such a behavior? To attempt to provide insights into the product recommendation behavior in online social networking communities, we develop a model to investigate the effects of community atmospheric cues on affective social distance and subsequent product recommendations based on the stimulus–organism–response paradigm. By analyzing the results of a survey using a questionnaire, we found that community reciprocity and community receptivity have a direct influence on product recommendation, while community atmospheric cues have an indirect influence through affective social distance. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aims: Quantitative survey research findings reveal that Western countries have lower rates of public stigma surrounding mental illness than other nations. However, qualitative media research across selected Western countries reports differences in stigmatising messages. Here, we take an in-depth look at country-level data exploring both similarities and differences in this stigma across three countries. Specifically, we use previous findings on global differences in public stigma and media to examine whether there is a correspondence between themes in newspaper reporting and variations in attitudes across seven stigma dimensions. Methods: The Stigma in Global Context – Mental Health Study provides nationally representative data from Iceland (N=1033; response rate=71%), Germany (N=1255; response rate=63.16%) and the USA (N=1425; response rate=67.31%). We limit analyses to respondents who received a vignette describing an individual meeting clinical criterion for schizophrenia or depression. Exploratory data analyses are used to examine overall patterns and cross-national differences. Results: Graphical analyses show patterned similarities, especially for more individuals endorsing social distance as contact becomes more intimate. However, results also corroborate cross-national differences documented in media research. More Americans endorse evaluations of dangerousness, to both self and others. Fewer Icelanders report exclusionary tendencies, whilst Germans report the most consistently moderate levels of stigma. Conclusions: While Western nations tend to report similar, lower levels of stigma globally, they each have unique areas of concern. Anti-stigma programs must take note of both similarities and differences to tailor their efforts to the local context. © Author(s) 2018.

AB  - This longitudinal research examined whether children's facial trustworthiness as judged by strangers can predict their real-world trustworthiness and peer acceptance. Adults (Study 1) and children (Study 2) judged the facial trustworthiness of 8- to 12-year-old children (N = 100) solely based on their photographs. The children's classmates were asked to report their real-world trustworthiness and peer acceptance. Children's facial trustworthiness reliably predicted these outcomes both initially when the photographs were taken, as well as 1 year later, and this effect was mediated by the initial ratings of real-world trustworthiness and peer acceptance. These results provide evidence for a long-lasting linkage between children's facial and real-world trustworthiness. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Public attitudes toward immigrants in the UK, especially prejudice against them, form a strong theme in retrospective media postmortems emphasizing the uniqueness of Brexit, yet similarly hostile public opinion on immigrants forms a recurrent theme in populist politics in many European Union nations. Indeed, if UK residents are not uniquely hostile, then the UK's exit from the EU may be only the first symptom of proliferating conflicts over immigration that will plague EU nations in future years. A well-established symptom (or consequence) of prejudice—aversion to outgroups as a neighbors—shows that prejudice against immigrants, other races, Muslims, Hindus, Jews, and Gypsies are all relatively low in the UK. This is as expected from the general decline of prejudice and social distance with socioeconomic development, demonstrated here in broad perspective across many countries. Indeed, UK residents are about as prejudiced against each of these ethno-religious outgroups as are their peers in other advanced EU and English-speaking nations, and much less prejudiced than their peers in less prosperous countries. Confirmatory factor analysis supports the view that a single latent ethno-religious prejudice generates all these specific prejudices, so it is not specific experiences with any one of these groups, nor their specific attributes, that are the wellspring of this deep-seated underlying prejudice. Replication using other measures of prejudice and another cross-national dataset confirms these findings. Data are from the pooled World and European Values Surveys (over 450,000 individuals, 300 surveys, and 100 nations for this analysis) and from the well-known European Quality of Life surveys. Analysis is by descriptive, multilevel (random intercept, fixed effects), and structural equation methods. © Copyright © 2019 Evans and Kelley.

AB  - Background: The I-Change Model for explaining motivational and behavioral change postulates that an awareness phase precedes the motivation phase of a person, and that effects of pre-motivational factors on behavior are partially mediated by motivational factors. This study tests this assumption with regard to physical activity. Methods: Observational longitudinal survey study (baseline, three months, six months) amongst Dutch adults (N = 2434). Structural equation modelling was used to investigate whether the influence of (1) knowledge, (2) cognizance, (3) cues, and (4) risk perception separately on intention and physical activity were mediated by motivational factors (i.e. attitudes, self-efficacy and social influence). Subsequently, a comprehensive model including all pre-motivational factors was estimated to test the same assumption for all pre-motivational factors simultaneously. Results: The results indicate that the associations of cognizance, risk perception and cues with behavior were fully mediated by motivational factors when tested separately. When tested simultaneously only the effect of cognizance remained. Cognizance was most strongly associated with positive attitudes β =.13, p <.01, self-efficacy β =.13, p <.01, and intention β =.14, p <.01. No direct link with behavior was found. Conclusion: The results suggest that pre-motivational factors are important to form a motivation; however, they do not directly influence behavior. The inclusion of factors such as risk perception and cognizance would help to get a better understanding of motivation formation and behavior. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Research frequently demonstrates diverse communities exhibit lower intra-community cohesion. Recent studies suggest there is little evidence perceived ethnic threat plays a role in this relationship. This paper re-examines the roles of ethnic threat and prejudice in the diversity/cohesion relationship. First, we test threat/prejudice as conceptualised in the literature: as mediators of diversity’s effect. Second, we test a reformulation of the roles of threat/prejudice: as moderators of diversity’s effect. Applying multi-level models to cross-sectional and longitudinal data of White British individuals across England and Oldham (a unique English town case-study) we find neighbour-trust lower in diverse communities. However, perceived-threat/prejudice does not mediate this relationship. Instead, we find perceived-threat/prejudice moderate diversity’s impact on neighbour-trust. The result is diversity only reduces neighbour-trust among individuals who already viewed out-groups as threatening. Longitudinal analysis confirms the importance of out-group attitudes in the diversity/neighbour-trust relationship. In diverse communities, residents whose out-group attitudes improve, or worsen, become more, or less, trusting of their neighbours. However, in homogeneous communities, changes in out-group attitudes are not linked to changes in neighbour-trust. We therefore argue and demonstrate that perceived-threat emerges from other societal processes (such as socio-economic precariousness) and it is when individuals who already view out-groups as threatening experience diverse neighbourhoods that local cohesion declines. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - This article examines whether individual differences in chronic regulatory focus (prevention vs. promotion focus) among adolescents influences the way they evaluate targeted advertising on social networking sites. Study 1 (survey) reveals that adolescents with a promotion focus (who are oriented toward achieving positive outcomes) have a more positive attitude and a higher purchase intention toward targeted advertising, as compared to prevention-focused adolescents (who are dispositioned toward avoiding negative outcomes). Study 2 (experiment) investigates how adolescents’ chronic regulatory focus can alter their attitude and purchase intention on a mock social networking site that includes a targeted advertisement. Results show that a low personalized targeted ad is better evaluated (in terms of a more positive attitude and higher purchase intention) among prevention-focused adolescents, whereas a high personalized targeted ad results in better advertising outcomes among promotion-focused adolescents. Contributions to theory and implications for advertising practice are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Advertising Association.

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to examine the multi-functional relationship among pre-service teachers’ art appreciation, attitude toward science, technology acceptance, creative convergence competency, and teaching competency in STEAM education. Data were collected from 238 pre-service teachers in Korea and were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that pre-service teachers’ art appreciation, attitude toward science, and technology acceptance had a significant effect on their creative convergence competency. In particular, their attitude toward science had the greatest effect on the creative convergence competency, which had a significant effect on the teaching competency in STEAM education. In addition, individual characteristics (i.e., art appreciation, attitude toward science) had indirect effects on the teaching competency in STEAM education mediated by the creative convergence competency. Overall, the results of this study show the criticality of supporting pre-service teachers to develop positive attitudes toward art appreciation and science to foster creative convergence skills. In conclusion, we suggest that the current fragmented approach with strict disciplinary boundaries at teaching education institutions does not adequately prepare pre-service teachers to be competent in teaching STEAM education. More holistic and systemic approaches are necessary to support the trajectory of pre-service teachers’ development of STEAM teaching competency. © 2018, De La Salle University.

AB  - This study investigates the moderating effects of consumer personality traits and the mediating effects of social influence susceptibility in consumers on the relationship between individuals' cultural orientations and intentions toward online group buying (OGB). The Big Five personality dimensions, normative social influence, and Hofstede's cultural dimensions are considered. Because understanding what motivates consumer intentions toward OGB is a major focus of firms and OGB website operators, this study contributes to the topic by identifying consumers' personality traits and levels of susceptibility to social influences, which impact OGB intentions. Findings in Study 1 reveal that consumer personality traits (e.g., agreeableness) moderate the impact of individual cultural orientations (i.e., collectivism) on intentions toward OGB. Study 2 describes the mediation process of susceptibility to normative social influences on OGB intentions. The findings from this study bridge a literature gap in the context of OGB by demonstrating how OGB site operators can improve marketing strategies, leading to increase sustainable purchase intention. The article concludes with managerial implications by providing insights for online group buying sites and firms, particularly those that target collectivistic cultural markets. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The livestock sector is a major driver of climate change, accounting for 14.5% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Population growth and rising prosperity are expected to see global consumption of meat rise by 76% by mid-century, a rate which is associated with significant social and environmental costs. There is therefore a compelling case for public measures to promote dietary shifts towards a more sustainable model, but little action has been taken at the international or national level. This article reports on an international study, with research conducted across the UK, US, China and Brazil, which examines the role the media might play in driving social change in this area. The study focused specifically on the negotiation of new information around meat consumption and climate change and its impacts on existing attitudes and behaviours. Findings indicate that perceptions and beliefs on climate change are culturally specific – tending to reflect national political and social priorities - but are contextualised within individually constructed media environments. Key determining factors include assessments of trust and credibility in regard to scientists and other experts, perceptions of the role of government and questions of individual versus collective responsibility. These shape the parameters within which arguments about the impact of meat consumption upon climate change are received, and these responses interact with cultural and structural barriers and opportunities to shape the likelihood of behaviour change. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Peer victimization is a common experience among high school students and is associated with many negative adjustment outcomes, making it necessary to investigate the individual and contextual factors that may ameliorate the consequences of peer victimization. The current study explores whether social competence offline and online mediates the relationship between peer victimization and psychological adjustment for adolescents. High school students (n = 303, M age = 15.83, 65.2% female) reported about their peer victimization experiences, social skills, perceptions of peers’ acceptance offline and social media acceptance, and self-worth. By considering both online and offline contexts, the underlying assumption that there are important differences between the two contexts and that these differences have a unique impact on teens who experience peer victimization was tested. The results indicate that teens who experience peer-victimization have deficits in both their offline and online social competence. Path analysis revealed that offline social skills mediate the relationship between peer victimization and self-worth. Also, there was a modest correlation between the indicators of offline social skills and online social skills indicating that they are not identical and have different associations with self-worth. Since teens are interacting with social media as another context of their everyday life, the implications for interventions aimed at targets of peer-victimization are meaningful. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - With 25% of the world’s coastline, Canada is endowed with enormous potential for marine aquaculture. Its development on both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, however, has come under increasingly intense public scrutiny and generated heated debate over many issues including First Nations territorial rights, impacts on wild fisheries, and environmental impacts. Provincial governments, industry alliances, scientists and ENGOs (environmental non-governmental organizations) have become increasingly embroiled in a communication tug-of-war to win the hearts and minds of the public. To date, however, there has been very limited community-level research into the public’s awareness of aquaculture, the information sources viewed as being most credible, and the issues that resonate the most. This paper reports the results of a study undertaken in small coastal communities on Canada’s Pacific (west) and Atlantic (east) coasts that investigated awareness of aquaculture, and the issues that people associate with its development. While many studies have focused exclusively on attitudes related to either finfish or shellfish farming, this study explores community perceptions related to salmon, shellfish and seaweed farming. Significant differences exist between the Atlantic and Pacific coast respondents in terms of their familiarity with and evaluation of different farming systems, the information sources that they rely upon, and their perceptions of the reliability of different information sources. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is an efficacious treatment for fear and anxiety and has the potential to solve both logistic issues for therapists and be used for scalable self-help interventions. However, VRET has yet to see large-scale implementation in clinical settings or as a consumer product, and past research suggests that while therapists may acknowledge the many advantages of VRET, they view the technology as technically inaccessible and expensive. We reasoned that after the 2016 release of several consumer virtual reality (VR) platforms and associated public acquaintance with VR, therapists' concerns about VRET may have evolved. The present study surveyed attitudes toward and familiarity with VR and VRET among practicing cognitive behavior therapists (n = 185) attending a conference. Results showed that therapists had an overall positive attitude toward VRET (pros rated higher than cons) and viewed VR as applicable to conditions other than anxiety. Unlike in earlier research, high financial costs and technical difficulties were no longer top-rated negative aspects. Average negative attitude was a larger negative predictor of self-rated likelihood of future use than positive attitude was a positive predictor and partially mediated the positive association between VRET knowledge and likelihood of future use, suggesting that promotional efforts should focus on addressing concerns. We conclude that therapist's attitudes toward VRET appear to have evolved in recent years, and no longer appear to constitute a major barrier to implementing the next generation of VR technology in regular clinical practice. © 2019 Lindner, Miloff, Zetterlund, Reuterskiöld, Andersson and Carlbring.

AB  - The study examined factors that affect parental intention-to-vaccinate adolescent daughters with HPV vaccine in Mysore district, India. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1609 parents of adolescent girls attending schools in Mysore District between February 2010 and October 2011. A validated questionnaire was used to assess parental attitudes, beliefs related with HPV infection, cervical cancer, HPV vaccine and vaccination in general. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate parameters and assess whether a model based on the integrative behavior theory would fit the current data. More than two-thirds (78.0%) of parents would accept vaccinating their daughters with HPV vaccine. Intention to HPV vaccination significantly increased with increase in the perception of parents about the benefits (standardized regression coefficient (β) = 0.39) or sources of information about HPV vaccine (β = 0.24), but intention decreased significantly with an increase in the perception about barriers to HPV vaccination β = −0.44). The effect of beliefs about severity of HPV infection or cervical cancer (β = 0.20), and beliefs about benefits (β = 0.20) or barriers (β = −0.25) to vaccination in general on intention to HPV vaccination were significantly mediated by parental attitudes and source of information about the vaccine. Geographical location significantly moderated the awareness about HPV on beliefs about severity of HPV infection or cervical cancer (β = 0.33), and the effect of religion on norms related to HPV vaccination (β = 0.19). Fit of the model to the data was acceptable. This study identified modifiable parental attitudes about HPV vaccine and beliefs related with HPV infection, cervical cancer and vaccination, which predicted parental intention-to-vaccinate their daughters with HPV vaccine in India. Health education interventions tailored to counter parental negative attitudes and beliefs about HPV vaccine and vaccination in general would be important for the community to promote HPV vaccination. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The success of digital longforms in terms of readership and viral spread promotes an optimistic perspective on innovative web journalism with regard to the attention, engagement, and subsequent knowledge acquisition of citizens when consuming news. Since empirical evidence for such effects is scant, this experimental study focuses on visual aesthetics as a signature element of novel news formats that are designed to attract attention in a highly competitive media landscape. Specifically, it draws on the theoretical framework of user engagement and shows that the presence of visual aesthetics contributes to meaningful learning from the news by initiating positive attitudes towards the interface, which in turn leads to deeper involvement with the content. However, when the presence of visual aesthetics fails to affect interface evaluation, the opposite effect occurs. Surprisingly, these effects are not found to be contingent upon individual differences such as issue involvement or issue-specific prior knowledge. Overall, our results suggest that for news organizations, it is worth investing financial and personal resources in innovative news formats in order to support knowledge gain, although they need to be carefully designed as the first encounter with the interface decides about the subsequent engagement with and processing of the news. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Prior research finds that exposure to outgroup exemplars reduces prejudice, but it has focused on most-likely cases. We examine whether salient outgroup exemplars can reduce prejudice under more challenging conditions, such as when they are counter-stereotypical but not well-liked, and the audience is heterogeneous and holds strong priors. Specifically, we assess the impact of the Obama exemplar under the less auspicious conditions of the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign. Using panel data, we find that racial prejudice declined during the campaign, especially among Whites with the most exposure to Obama through political television. Liking Obama proved irrelevant to these effects, as did partisanship. Racial prejudice increased slightly after the campaign ended, but the effects remained largely intact weeks later. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Background: Living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) has several advantages over deceased donor kidney transplantation. Yet rates of living donation are declining in Canada and there exists significant interprovincial variability. Efforts to improve living donation tend to focus on the patient and barriers identified at their level, such as not knowing how to ask for a kidney or lack of education. These efforts favor those who have the means and the support to find living donors. Thus, a Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)-organized workshop recommended that education efforts to understand and remove barriers should focus on health professionals (HPs). Despite this, little attention has been paid to what they identify as barriers to discussing LDKT with their patients. Objective: Our aim was to explore HP-identified barriers to discuss living donation with patients in 3 provinces of Canada with low (Quebec), moderate (Ontario), and high (British Columbia) rates of LDKT. Design: This study consists of an interpretive descriptive approach as it enables to move beyond description and inform clinical practice. Setting: Purposive criterion and quota sampling were used to recruit HPs from Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia who are involved in the care of patients with kidney disease and/or with transplant coordination. Patients: Not applicable. Measurements: Semistructured interviews were conducted. The interview guide was developed based on a preliminary analytical framework and a review of the literature. Methods: Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data stemming from the interviews. The coding process comprised of a deductive and inductive approach, and the use of a qualitative analysis software (NVivo 11). Following this, themes were identified and developed. Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was obtained. In total, we conducted 16 telephone interviews as thematic saturation was attained. Results: Six predominant themes emerged: (1) lack of communication between transplant and dialysis teams, (2) absence of referral guidelines, (3) role perception and lack of multidisciplinary involvement, (4) HP’s lack of information and training, (5) negative attitudes of some HP toward LDKT, (6) patient-level barriers as defined by the HP. HPs did mention patients’ attitudes and some characteristics as the main barriers to discussions about living donation; this was noted in all provinces. HPs from Ontario and British Columbia indicated multiple strategies being implemented to address some of these barriers. Those from Ontario mentioned strategies that center on the core principles of provincial-level standardization, while those from British Columbia center on engaging the entire multidisciplinary team and improved role perception. We noted a dearth of such efforts in Quebec; however, efforts around education and promotion, while tentative, have emerged. Limitations: Social desirability and selection bias. Our analysis might not be applicable to other provinces. Conclusions: HPs involved with the referral and coordination of transplantation play a major role in access to LDKT.

AB  - This study was aimed at predicting greywater reuse in a municipality of a developing country using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). It sought to identify the beliefs that influence people’s intentions to reuse greywater for potable and nonpotable purposes. Residents within the municipality completed a questionnaire designed with the TPB constructs and other demographic data. Results revealed an excellent fit for potable reuse intention and a mediocre fit for nonpotable reuse intentions. Attitudes and behavioural control were the constructs that significantly influenced intentions to reuse greywater for both potable and nonpotable purposes. Location of the source of water to the respondents and level of education were introduced as background factors. Location of the source of water had no significant direct or indirect influence on intentions to reuse greywater for potable or nonpotable purposes. Level of education had a nonsignificant indirect and direct effect on intentions to reuse greywater for potable purpose but is mediated through attitudes and perceived behavioural control for nonpotable reuse intentions. Strategies aimed at promoting greywater reuse should be targeted at a specific reuse option and not a wholesale intervention that is expected to address all reuse interventions. © 2019 Desalination Publications.

AB  - Since most of the Korean social welfare organizations are not so large in scale, the influence of the leadership of top manager is bigger than other organizations. This study empirically tested the effects of servant leadership, which is contrary to existing vertical leadership, on the organizational effectiveness of social welfare organization members. In particular, this study tried to examine the indirect effects of organizational trust, as well as the direct effects of servant leadership on social workers’ organizational citizenship behavior and organizational commitment. Three hundred ninety-three survey data were analyzed through structural equation modeling. The results of this study showed that the direct effects of servant leadership on organizational commitment and organizational citizenship behavior as well as the mediating effects through organizational trust were statistically significant. In addition, it was found that preceding variables had a greater impact on organizational commitment than organizational citizenship behavior and that the indirect effect of organizational trust was greater than the direct effect of leadership. This study confirmed that leadership not only affects the atmosphere of social welfare organization but also affects the positive attitude of social workers. © Rushing Water Publishers Ltd. 2019.

AB  - With the advancement of technology, social media use increases day by day, especially among university students. This descriptive and correlational research was conducted with the aim of investigating attitudes of nursing and midwifery students towards social media in terms of certain variables. The population of the research comprised students studying at the nursing and midwifery department of a health college (N = 336), and the sample of the research constituted students who were chosen using accidental sampling from the population (n = 254). A Student Information Form and the Social Media Attitude Scale were used for data collection. It was identified that 73% of the students studied nursing and 64.2% used social media for various reasons. The averages scores for total score, social competence, need for sharing, relationship with the teachers, and social isolation dimensions of Social Media Attitude Scale were found as 72.19 ± 10.92 (23–115), 14.17 ± 4.87 (6–30), 27.65 ± 6.08 (8–40), 7.50 ± 3.20 (3–15), and 13.14 ± 5.01 (6–30), respectively. It was observed that nursing and midwifery students had positive attitudes towards social media. Furthermore, although the personal characteristics of students do not affect their attitudes towards social media, the features of social media have a statistically significant effect on students attitudes towards social media. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Understanding the effect of media on disease spread can help improve epidemic forecasting and uncover preventive measures to slow the spread of disease. Most previously introduced models have approximated media effect through disease incidence, making media influence dependent on the size of epidemic. We propose an alternative approach, which relies on real data about disease coverage in the news, allowing us to model low incidence/high interest diseases, such as SARS, Ebola or H1N1. We introduce a network-based model, in which disease is transmitted through local interactions between individuals and the probability of transmission is affected by media coverage. We assume that media attention increases self-protection (e.g. hand washing and compliance with social distancing), which, in turn, decreases disease model. We apply the model to the case of H1N1 transmission in Mexico City in 2009 and show how media influence-measured by the time series of the weekly count of news articles published on the outbreak-helps to explain the observed transmission dynamics. We show that incorporating the media attention based on the observed media coverage of the outbreak better estimates the disease dynamics from what would be predicted by using media function that approximate the media impact using the number of cases and rate of spread. Finally, we apply the model to a typical influenza season in Washington, DC and estimate how the transmission pattern would have changed given different levels of media coverage. © 2019 Kim et al.

AB  - Objective: Organizational strategies have been shown to improve one's ability to recall items from a list. Specifically, use of semantic clustering, the tendency to group items by category when recalling them, predicts better free recall of word lists after short and long delays. The present study utilized a healthy adult sample to examine use of efficient memory strategies as a predictor of differences in neurocognitive findings between African American and white participants. Method: Participants provided demographic information and completed the California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II) and Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence-Second Edition (WASI-2). Results: Groups were matched across socioeconomic status and years of education. White participants used more semantic clustering and performed better on recall measures after short and long delays than their African American peers, and semantic clustering predicted recall in both groups. Regression analyses suggested that use of semantic clustering is a significant partial mediator of the relationship between race and free recall abilities. Intelligence scores from the WASI-2 were correlated with CVLT-II measures in white participants but not African American participants. Conclusions: Despite quantitatively similar backgrounds, white and African American participants differed in recall performance. However, this study showed that African American participants' poorer recall may be partially attributed to less frequent use of semantic clustering as a strategy. These discrepancies may be rooted in inequalities in educational experiences and suggest that providing organizational strategies during early learning may be an area of intervention to mitigate racial differences seen in neuropsychological testing. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Rationale: Although obesity represents a potential public health crisis, our understanding of public perceptions of obesity, emotional responses to the obese, and related policy preferences is limited. Objective: We employed Weiner's attribution theory of controllability (Weiner, 1988, 2011) to examine perceived causes of obesity, emotional responses, and related policy implications. If the perceived cause is controllable (eating and lifestyle habits), we expected less sympathy and greater anger toward obese people and support for prejudicial hiring policies based on weight. If the cause is perceived as uncontrollable (genetic), sympathy is anticipated as well as opposition to such hiring policies. Method: We conducted multivariate analyses with data from two nationally representative surveys of U.S. adults. Conclusion: Our findings supported the hypotheses, showing that sympathy and lack of anger toward obese people are strongly determined by a genetic attribution for obesity. Moreover, sympathy and the genetic attribution are significant predictors of opposition to hiring policies that discriminate against obese people. Finally, in a second study, chief among several causal attributions for obesity—lack of will power, lack of exercise, marketing of foods, and genetics—we discovered biological attribution functions as the key predictor of perceptions that obese people are frequent targets of discrimination. We suggest governments and the food industry should be more attuned to the underlying beliefs of the public about the causes of obesity when formulating programs and policies to address the issue. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Exposure to various types of stress can elevate craving for cocaine and hasten relapse among substance dependent individuals. This investigation evaluated the effects of social exclusion on brain activity in cocaine dependent individuals. Method: Forty three individuals (18 crack-cocaine users, 25 controls) were recruited from the community to participate in functional neuroimaging study in which they performed a simulated 3 person ball-tossing game (Cyberball). Each participant was told that the other 2 players were in nearby MRI scanners. Task blocks included: Inclusion (likelihood of our participant receiving the ball = 50%), Exclusion (likelihood gradually decreases to 0%), and Rest. Self-worth variables (e.g self-esteem, locus of control) were measured before and after the ball-tossing game. General linear model-based statistics were used to measure the brain response to inclusion and exclusion within and between the groups with respect to rest. Results: Relative to controls, cocaine users had significantly more activity during Exclusion versus Inclusion in 3 areas: the right medial frontal gyrus (Brodmann Area 9,10), left ventral lateral frontal gyrus (Brodmann Area 10,47) and right caudate. This was driven by a higher response to social exclusion in the cocaine users. There was no difference between groups in the brain reactivity to social inclusion. Conclusion: Cocaine dependent individuals have an amplified brain response to social exclusion stress in cortical regions associated with emotional regulation, arousal, craving and perception of physical pain. These data suggest that there may be a neurological basis for the well-established relationship between social stress and addiction. © 2018

AB  - This article examines political transportation—the construction of mental models that represent a political world and result in the absorption and positioning of oneself within the constructed world. Specifically, we propose that when citizens become immersed in the political narrative crafted by a politician, they become more likely to see the political world as personally relevant and, subsequently, become more committed to supporting that candidate. Further, the degree of political immersion should depend upon which media platform a campaign message is delivered through. These expectations were tested using an experiment where partisans were exposed to a campaign message delivered in the form of a television ad, a political e-mail, or a series of tweets. Results demonstrate that Twitter was the least likely to lead to political immersion. Further, results provide support for our theoretical model, where there is an indirect effect of campaign messages on political attitudes and behavior through immersion and perceived personal relevance. Taken together, this study demonstrates the utility of applying the concept of narrative transportation to politics. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Research has shown that the form and content of science communications can influence individuals’ responses. This study examines whether individuals’ perceptions of scientific research are influenced by the discipline to which the research is attributed. Two vignette experiments find that neither the perceived scientific-ness nor trustworthiness of a study originating from sociology is affected by attributing the study to a different social science or to a natural or medical science. These null findings contrast with surveys showing sizable disciplinary differences in public attitudes. It is possible that disciplinary attribution is a less salient cognitive shortcut when presented in longer communications as compared to survey questions that only provide the name of a discipline. We conclude with suggestions for further research on the role of disciplinary attribution on public perceptions of science. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - As a result of societal expectations and to avoid societal homophobia, many lesbians and gay men in China marry heterosexual partners and do not disclose their own sexual orientation. This study used qualitative methods to explore why gay men enter into such marriages of convenience. A total of 17 in-depth interviews were conducted with lesbians and gay men who had entered “formality marriages.” All interviews were digitally recorded for transcription; transcripts were analyzed using grounded theory to determine themes. The reasons for engaging in formality marriage can be grouped into broad categories, including: maintaining mianzi (reputation) and lizi (inner reality), avoiding moral distress, social discrimination, working in tizhi (social systems), accounting for their social relationships, and fulfilling filial piety. From our model we can see growing up as a member of a minority sexual orientation group means being discriminated against and marginalized in the family, work place, community, and society at large. Formality marriages not only offer a way to maintain one’s personal and family reputation (mianzi) in different contexts, but also avoid moral distress and maintain a personal private sexual orientation (lizi) with their own homosexual partner. Formality marriage serves as a compromise to ensure cultural continuity, and it harmonizes individuals’ interpersonal relationships and traditional Chinese family values. Understanding the reasons for formality marriage practices can help health professionals to create public health campaigns to dispel stereotypes and stigma about homosexuality, and to develop culturally sensitive services for homosexual populations. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Since the late 1990s public opinion about cannabis legalization has become drastically more liberal, and some states have begun to legalize cannabis for recreational use. Why have attitudes changed so much? Prior research has considered a few of the reasons for this change, but this is the first comprehensive and empirically-based study to consider the wide range of potential causes for how and why this happened. We use data from the General Social Survey, National Study of Drug Use and Health, and word searches from the New York Times. We find that attitudes largely liberalized via intracohort changes. Most Americans developed more liberal views, regardless of their race and ethnicity, gender, education, religious or political affiliation, or religious engagement. Changes in cannabis use have had minimal effects on attitudes, and legalization of cannabis has not prompted attitude change in neighboring states. As to root causes, evidence suggests that a decrease in religious affiliation, a decline in punitiveness, and a shift in media framing all contributed to changing attitudes. © 2018

AB  - Rejection is a direct threat to an individual's need to belong that has serious consequences for mental health. Rejection sensitivity may explain why some individuals are more likely to perceive rejection in social situations and experience subsequent psychological distress. The current study examined suicide ideation among psychiatric inpatients (N = 103) through the lenses of the rejection sensitivity model and the interpersonal theory of suicide. We hypothesized that rejection sensitivity would be indirectly associated with suicide ideation (i.e., a cognitive-affective reaction to social rejection) through greater perceptions of rejection (i.e., thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, constructs from the interpersonal theory of suicide), in parallel. Results from bootstrapped parallel mediation regression procedures indicated that the relation between rejection sensitivity and suicide ideation was significantly indirectly associated through the additive effect of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, such that greater rejection sensitivity was associated with greater thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness and subsequently greater suicide ideation. Further, rejection sensitivity was significantly indirectly associated with suicide ideation independently through thwarted belongingness, but not perceived burdensomeness. These findings provide support for the rejection sensitivity model and the interpersonal theory of suicide in an effort to advance our conceptualization of suicide risk among psychiatric inpatients. © 2018

AB  - Study aim: The main aim of the study was to identify the knowledge and attitudes of nurses towards pressure ulcer prevention in a major public hospital in Cyprus. Material and methods: A descriptive and cross-sectional study design was used to collect the data between December 2014 and February 2015, the sample consisted of n = 102 nurses employed in a major public hospital in Cyprus. Customised and standardised Pressure Ulcer Knowledge Test and an attitudes Likert questionnaire was used to investigate both parameters. Descriptive and inferential statistics, parametric (t-test), non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U) and Pearson test was applied. Statistical significance was set at p = 0.05. Results: The majority of the participants (44.1%) n = 45 were employed in the intensive care unit, were female (61.8%) n = 63, registered nurses (93.1%) n = 95, had more than 5 years of experience (59.4%) n = 32 and 10.8% (n = 11) had a postgraduate title. The mean value regarding the knowledge questionnaire was 16.16, IQR: 17(15–18) correct answers 77%. In the attitudes questionnaire the median value was 41.82, IQR: 43 (40–46). Knowledge and attitudes correlated positively and statistically significantly (Pearson's R = 0,223, p = 0,019). Conclusion: The result suggests that nurses had relatively inadequate knowledge levels and positive attitudes, attitudes and knowledges correlated statistically significantly and positively. It is proposed that through the development of educational programs and the frequent measurement of the two parameters further improvement can be achieved. © 2018 Tissue Viability Society

AB  - Objective: Appalachia—historically a culturally and politically unique region of the United States—has been effectively ignored by contemporary political scientists. Using a unique measure of Appalachian residence, this article analyzes racial attitudes, religion, and Appalachian opposition to the 2008 presidential candidacy of Barack Obama. Methods: I use regression analysis to assess the extent to which Appalachian residents differ in their levels of perceived racial favoritism, identification as born-again Christians, and frequency of church attendance, as well as whether these variables can mediate the seeming regional effect of Appalachia in a standard vote choice model. Results: I first demonstrate higher levels of perceived racial favoritism and, especially, higher levels of a particular type of religiosity in the region. I then assess whether these measures can mediate Appalachian distinctiveness in presidential vote choice. When perceived racial favoritism, church attendance, and born-again Christian status are controlled for in regression models, Appalachian regional opposition to the 2008 Obama candidacy disappears statistically. Conclusion: While race and religion both “matter,” I find it is religion that seems to matter more in explaining Appalachian distinctiveness, particularly relative to traditional southern distinctiveness. This provides a new vantage point from which to assess southern politics debates about subregional variation and the relative roles of race and religion, as well as sets the foundation for further analyses of Appalachia and American politics. © 2018 by the Southwestern Social Science Association

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study is to examine the attitudes of Saudi students towards peers with disabilities. It examines how these attitudes are related to age, attending a school that includes students with intellectual disabilities, and having a relative with a disability. Methods and procedure: Participants included 357 elementary school male students (grades 3–6) who completed the Arabic version of the CATCH scale. Outcomes and results: The students presented positive attitudes towards peers with disabilities. Students in schools that included students with intellectual disabilities had more positive attitudes than other students. Older students were more likely to hold positive attitudes than younger students. Having a relative with a disability had no effect. Conclusion and implications The findings suggest that students generally hold positive attitudes towards children with disabilities. Moreover, including students with intellectual disabilities in schools associated with other students’ awareness about students with differing levels of abilities. Expanding schools to include children with disabilities in society in general will probably help increase the likelihood that they will be accepted and diminish the stereotypes that follow them. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions have attracted extensive attention because of their severe negative impacts on human health and the national economy. Promoting public participation in reducing PM2.5, especially among young people, is one effective manner in which to control PM2.5 emissions. The present study explores the determinants that influence young people's behavioural intentions towards reducing PM2.5 using an extended version of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), which incorporates personal moral norms. Additionally, this paper evaluates and compares the direct and indirect relationships between subjective norms and PM2.5 reduction intentions. This study was tested empirically using survey data collected from 425 respondents in China. The results revealed that young people's attitude towards reducing PM2.5, the subjective norm, was that behavioural control and personal moral norms significantly affect PM2.5 reduction intentions. Furthermore, the indirect effects of subjective norms on PM2.5 reduction intentions via other determinants were 2.5 times greater than the direct effect. In addition, the results also validated the appropriateness of the extended theory of planned behaviour for exploring young people's PM2.5 reduction intention. Based on the results, implications and future research directions are also discussed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives: In the United Kingdom, three people die every day awaiting an organ transplant. To address this, Scotland and England plan to follow Wales and introduce opt-out donor consent. However, emotional barriers, myths, and misconceptions may deter potential registrants. Our objectives were to estimate the number of people who plan to opt-out of the donor register and to test whether emotional barriers (e.g., medical mistrust) differentiated participants within this group. Finally, in an experimental manipulation, we tested whether intention to donate decreased by making emotional barriers more salient and increased following a widely used myth-busting intervention. Design: Mixed between–within design. Methods: UK residents (n = 1,202) were asked whether they would choose opt-in, deemed consent, or opt-out/not sure if legislation changes to opt-out. Participants also completed measures of donor intentions at baseline, following a 12-item emotional barriers questionnaire and again, following a 9-item myth-busting intervention. Results: Findings indicate that 66.1% of participants selected to opt-in to the donor register, 24.3% selected deemed consent, and 9.4% selected opt-out/not sure. Emotional barriers, notably fears surrounding bodily integrity, were significantly elevated in participants who selected opt-out/not sure. Increasing the salience of emotional barriers reduced donor intentions in the opt-out/not sure group. However, dispelling organ donation myths did not increase intention within this group. Conclusions: If opt-out legislation is introduced in Scotland and England, approximately 10% of participants plan to opt-out or are not sure. Dispelling organ donation myths with facts may not be the best method of overcoming emotional barriers and increasing donor intentions for those planning to opt-out. Statement of contribution What is already known about this subject? In the United Kingdom, three people die every day waiting for an organ transplant. Although 90% of the UK population support organ donation, only 38% are registered donors. To address this, Scotland and England have recently proposed to introduce an opt-out system of donor consent. To date, limited research has investigated public attitudes and intentions regarding opt-out consent laws in Scotland and England. Emotional barriers (e.g., medical mistrust) are key factors that may deter potential registrants. However, no research has examined these barriers in relation to proposed opt-out consent laws. Myth-busting is widely used around the world as part of campaigns promoting organ donation. The NHS currently use a myth-busting feature on their webpage to dispel harmful myths about organ donation; however, there is limited evidence of the impact this has on intentions to become an organ donor. What does this study add? Approximately 10% of UK participants plan to opt-out or are unsure of their decision, if the law changes to opt-out. Emotional barriers, notably, bodily integrity fears, are significantly elevated in people who plan to opt-out. Increasing the salience of emotional barriers reduced donor intentions for people who plan to opt-out.

AB  - Wildlife managers and researchers have suspected that urine-based lure products collected from captive cervids could be potential media contributing to the spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer (Odocoileus spp.). Although personnel in multiple wildlife agencies have taken the precautionary approach to prohibit the sales or use of urine-based lure products, it is not well understood whether hunters will accept and willingly cooperate with these policies. To address this gap in the literature, we examine hunters’ attitudes and behavioral intentions toward a hypothetical policy proposing to ban urine-based products and how risk beliefs, trait psychological reactance, and hunting experience affect these responses. In May 2017, we recruited 739 members of an online advocacy group of deer hunters to complete a web-based survey with experimental elements. Overall, participants held positive attitudes toward the proposed policy to ban these products and high intentions to cooperate. Participants also characterized CWD as an increasing risk that was associated with dread, well known to science, and observable. These risk beliefs were positively related to attitudes and behavioral intentions to comply with the policy. In contrast, trait psychological reactance and prior experience using urine-based scents were negatively related to attitudes and behavioral intentions. Findings indicate that wildlife management agency personnel communicating with the public may find better acceptance of controversial CWD policies by first establishing a shared understanding of its risks through thorough risk communication. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018

AB  - Online Social Networking Sites (SNSs) are immensely popular, especially among adolescents. Activity on these sites leaves digital footprints, which may be used to study online behavioral correlates of adolescent psychological distress and to, ultimately, improve detection and intervention efforts. In the present work, we explore the digital footprints of adolescent depression, social rejection, and victimization of bullying on Facebook. Two consecutive studies were conducted among Israeli adolescents (N = 86 and N = 162). We collected a range of Facebook activity features, as well as self-report measurements of depression, social rejection, and victimization of bullying. Findings from Study 1 demonstrate that explicit distress references in Facebook postings (e.g., “Life sucks, I want to die”) predict depression among adolescents, but that such explicit distress references are rare. In Study 2, we applied a bottom-up research methodology along with the previous top-down, theory driven approach. Study 2 demonstrates that less explicit features of Facebook behavior predict social rejection and victimization of bullying. These features include ‘posts by others’ ‘check-ins’ ‘gothic and dark content’ ‘other people in pictures’ and ‘positive attitudes towards others’. The potential, promises and limitations of using digital Facebook footprints for the detection of adolescent psychological distress are discussed. © 2018

AB  - Purpose: University students report high rates of secondhand harm from alcohol (i.e., harm from another person's drinking). The current study investigated the association between students’ exposure to secondhand harm and student mental health and university sense of belonging. We also assessed whether students’ sense of belonging mediated the association between secondhand harm and mental health and sex differences in these associations. Methods: A total of 941 students (70% female) completed an online survey. Path analysis was employed to test our hypotheses. Secondhand harm was assessed across three dimensions; strains (e.g., having sleep/studies interrupted), threats (e.g., physical/sexual assault), and interpersonal harm (e.g., taking care of intoxicated friends). Results: Eighty-nine percent of participants reported secondhand harm exposure in the last 30 days. Interpersonal harm was the most common type of harm experienced by students. Strains were associated with higher levels of anxiety and stress, threats were associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and interpersonal harm predicted higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. Gender moderated these effects, such that only interpersonal harm was associated with men's mental health outcomes. Sense of belonging was associated with fewer mental health symptoms, and significantly mediated the effect of threats on anxiety, depression, and stress for females only, such that threat exposure was associated with reduced sense of belonging, which in turn increased anxiety, depression, and stress. Conclusion: This study supports the growing body of literature demonstrating the high prevalence of secondhand harm exposure among university students and the association of these experiences with poor student mental health. Furthermore, this research provides evidence that sense of belonging may be one mechanism that explains this association. © 2018

AB  - Moralized issues, such as abortion and same-sex marriage, are some of the most polarizing and divisive issues in politics. These topics motivate political engagement but present a barrier to democratic resolution. Yet we know little about how some issues become “moral issues” and others do not. In this article, I argue that exposure to persuasive frames, particularly those eliciting anger and disgust, serves to moralize and polarize public opinion. I test these hypotheses across three experiments on emerging debates over food politics. The results consistently show that persuasive frames increase issue moralization and, in turn, facilitate polarization. A panel analysis demonstrates that the effect of a single exposure lasts at least two weeks. Mediation analyses suggest that feelings of disgust and anger help explain how persuasive frames moralize political attitudes, while anger alone seems to explain the polarizing effects of framing. Overall, the findings provide new insight into framing, emotion, and the development of moral issues. © 2018 International Society of Political Psychology

AB  - We sought to understand how attachment orientation influenced attitudes towards different types of psychological therapies. In two studies, we (1) examined attachment orientation as a predictor of attitudes towards different therapies and (2) tested whether attachment security priming could improve attitudes. Study 1 (n = 339) found associations between attachment orientation and attitudes towards, and likelihood of using different therapies. Positive and negative attitudes about different therapies mediated the relationship between attachment avoidance and likelihood of use. Study 2 (n = 412) showed that primed security (vs. neutral prime) improved attitudes towards relational, non-relational and distanced-relational therapies for those with a fearful-avoidant attachment orientation. For relational and distanced-relational therapies, the mechanism of this effect was increased cognitive openness. Attachment orientation is a determinant of therapy attitudes and anticipated help-seeking behaviour. Priming security may promote open-minded decision-making about some therapies. Findings are discussed with relevance to attachment theory, research and clinical practice. © 2018 The British Psychological Society

AB  - As a result of the rise of online communication and political divisions based on symbols, rather than structure (decrease in the importance of class-based voting), citizens are increasingly linked to news outlets that articulate and reinforce their views. The process is facilitated by the spontaneous processes of bottom–up communication that excludes, in an iterative process, people who express views that are inconsistent with the prevailing opinion. The emergence of “information verticals” is a significant influence on attitudes to some issues covered in political debate. These effects operate with regard to so-called easy issues, that is, those rooted in emotions and in the symbolic sphere. Our article is an empirical test of our hypotheses about the effects of media framing of “hard” and “easy” issues. We apply a survey experiment method to verify whether contact with news coverage has an effect on attitudes, taking into account the political orientation and cognitive skills of citizens. Our empirical analyses confirm that a hostile media framing of migration changes respondents’ attitudes no matter their level of cognitive engagement. The data come from Poland. © 2018 Sage Publications.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether career development in academic medicine is more difficult for women than for men, and, if any, the nature and level of barriers to this progression. Methods: Extraction of full-time medical staff in a Parisian hospital group, through the SIGAPS platform; an online questionnaire survey of career choices and barriers experienced by full-time male and female physicians. The study population comprises 181 hospital practitioners and 141 academic physicians (49 associate professors and 92 full professors). Results: Women represent 49% of the medical staff but 15% of full professors. This underrepresentation of women is more important among intensivists/anesthesiologists than technique-based specialists (such as radiologists, biologists…). There is no difference in scientific output, marital status and parenthood between women and men. On the other hand, there is a difference in attitudes highlighted by the EVAR risk-taking scale as well as in the burden of familial involvement and the prejudices felt by women during the academic selection process. Conclusion: The glass ceiling exists in one of the largest French hospital group. Career development principles promote merit, but should decrease the benefit of “masculine” attitudes in the competition for academic positions. Academic selection criteria should evolve to limit the disadvantage of women related to deeper familial involvement and less competitive strategies and risk-taking attitudes. © 2018 Société Nationale Française de Médecine Interne (SNFMI)

AB  - Vegetarians and vegans comprise a minority of most western populations. However, relatively little research has investigated the psychological foundations of attitudes towards this minority group. The following study employs a dual process model of intergroup attitudes to explore the motivational basis of non-vegetarians' attitudes towards vegetarians and vegans. Participants were 1,326 individuals recruited through advertisements in a national newspaper in New Zealand. Non-vegetarian participants first completed measures of ideological attitudes and social worldviews, and then were randomly assigned to complete a measure of outgroup attitudes towards either vegetarians or vegans. Although non-vegetarians' attitudes towards both vegetarians and vegans were generally positive, attitudes towards vegans were significantly less positive than attitudes towards vegetarians, and male participants expressed significantly less positive attitudes towards both outgroups than female participants. The structural equation model predicting attitudes towards vegetarians and vegans fit the data well and explained a significant amount of the variance in attitudes. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the role of gender ideology, religiosity and political conservatism on attitudes toward same-sex parenting in Italy at a time when same-sex parent families are undergoing attacks from ideological campaigns opposing non-traditional gender roles and families. We collected data from 4,187 heterosexual respondents about attitudes towards two-father and two-mother parenting, homonegativity, attitudes toward traditional masculinity and femininity, religious involvement and political conservatism. We conducted multiple group structural equation model analyses to test whether sex moderated any of the estimated associations among variables. Results showed that traditional beliefs about femininity were directly associated with negative attitudes towards two-mother and two-father parenting, while traditional beliefs about masculinity had a significant direct effect only on two-father parenting. Homonegativity partially mediated the association between religiosity, political conservatism and traditional beliefs about masculinity and femininity on negative attitudes toward both types of same-sex parenting. Gender differences were found for the indirect effects of political conservatism and religiosity on attitudes towards same-sex parenting. The theoretical contributions and implications of the findings are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - We begin this article with a close look at some contemporary pictures of sexual life in the Muslim world that have been painted in certain sections of the Western media, asking how and why these pictures matter. Across a range of mainstream print media from the New York Times to the Daily Mail, and across reported events from several countries, can be found pictures of ‘sexual misery’. These ‘frame’ Muslim men as tyrannical, Muslim women as downtrodden or exploited, and the wider world of Islam as culpable. Crucially, this is not the whole story. We then consider how these negative representations are being challenged and how they can be challenged further. In doing so, we will not simply set pictures of sexual misery against their binary opposites, namely pictures abounding in the promise of sexual happiness. Instead, we search for a more complex picture, one that unsettles stereotypes about the sexual lives of Muslims without simply idealising its subjects. This takes us to the journalism, life writing and creative non-fiction of Shelina Zahra Janmohamed and the fiction of Ayisha Malik and Amjeed Kabil. We read this long-form work critically, attending to manifest advances in depictions of the relationships of Muslim-identified individuals over the last decade or so, while also remaining alert to lacunae and limitations in the individual representations. More broadly, we hope to signal our intention to avoid both Islamophobia and Islamophilia in scrutinising literary texts. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Background: Asperger syndrome (AS) is part of a spectrum of disorders encompassing difficulties with social interaction that may result in specific educational needs for doctors in training. There is currently limited research on the impact of AS on working as a doctor. Methods: This is a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to explore the perceptions of trainees diagnosed with AS following input from a professional support service, and the perspectives of the staff involved in their professional development. Findings: Receiving a diagnosis of AS was viewed as a double-edged sword, allowing the development of insight into lifelong difficulties, but also creating the potential for prejudice. Understanding AS traits provided an explanation for challenges in the workplace and therefore opportunities to find solutions. Understanding AS traits provided an explanation for challenges in the workplace. Discussion: This study explores the benefits and disadvantages of defining and labelling a specific professional support need for a group of trainees. It also reveals the need for improved awareness of AS amongst all clinical educators. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and The Association for the Study of Medical Education

AB  - Extant research on social distance and decision-making under risk has mostly focused on how people reach different decisions for themselves than others under the same circumstances. This research adds to this literature by studying how the social distance between the decision-maker and people in danger influences risk preference in life-saving domain. We found that decision-makers tend to be more risk-seeking when the lives of close others are at stake than distant others regardless of whether the situation is framed in terms of loss or gain. However, the effect of social distance on risk preference was eliminated when it was the responsibility of the decision-makers rather than the chance to pick the potential victims to save. By analyzing the shape of value function, we provided preliminary evidence for the hypothesis that decision-makers engage in feeling-based evaluation when close others’ lives are at stake but calculation-based evaluation when distant others’ lives are at stake, which could account for the effect of social distance on risk preference documented in this research. A final experiment yielded direct evidence that evaluation mode mediates the relationship between social distance and risk preference. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In this essay, I apply a theological perspective to argue that the Paralympic Games, its athletes and the media, unwittingly collude to demonstrate contempt towards the killing of disabled children, whilst claiming that disability equality has been improved or achieved. I argue that British Paralympic athlete Tanni Grey-Thompson was destined to succeed because many of her potential competitors were denied the right to life. British newspapers and publicly available figures related to the killing of disabled children in the United Kingdom are contrasted against the positive narrative about disabled people promoted by the International Paralympic Committee. I make reference to Christian bio-medical ethics to draw attention to the medical profession’s negative attitudes towards disabled people in the early 1900s, which provided execution techniques for the Nazi holocaust. I conclude by contending that the genocide of disabled children continues unabated despite the positive and dominant discourse attached to the Paralympic Games. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study provides a better understand the mechanism underlying the built environment-behavior connection by systematically exploring the relationships between the objective (actual) environment and people’s perceptions of the environment, and their relative effects on travel behavior using the Stimuli-Organism-Response framework. Based on data for the Twin Cities, this study explores (1) How do perceptions mediate the effects of the objective environment on travel behavior? (2) How do travel attitudes influence the effects of perceptions on travel behavior? Among the eight empirical models tested here, six are consistent with the framework: objective built environment affects travel behavior through its influence on perceptions. Moreover, the framework fits walking and bicycling behavior better than transit and driving behavior. Furthermore, travel attitudes greatly moderate the influences of perceptions on travel behavior. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - We analyze the relationship of retail investor sentiment and the German stock market by introducing four distinct investor pessimism indices (IPIs) based on selected aggregate Google search queries. We assess the predictive power of weekly changes in sentiment captured by the IPIs for contemporaneous and future DAX returns, volatility and trading volume. The indices are found to have individually varying, but overall remarkably high explanatory power. An increase in retail investor pessimism is accompanied by decreasing contemporaneous market returns and an increase in volatility and trading volume. Future returns tend to increase while future volatility and trading volume decrease. The outcome is in line with the conjecture of correction effects. Overall, the results are well in line with modern investor sentiment theory. © 2017 German Economic Association (Verein für Socialpolitik)

AB  - Literature on fear-arousing communications has led to divergent conclusions. On the one hand, studies have shown that fear increases attitude change via systematic processing. On the other hand, it has been observed that arousing fear provokes defense-motivated reactions. Nevertheless, few studies have embedded measures of persuasion, information processing, and defensiveness all at once. Consequently, we conducted an experiment to assess the effects of fear-arousal on these three outcomes in order to clarify this ambiguous issue. The participants were instructed to watch a public service announcement video with two conditions of fear. Our results showed that an increase of fear generated a more positive attitude, as well as systematic processing but, surprisingly, more defensive reactions. Further analyses revealed a mediating effect of these reactions between fear and attitude. These results suggest an alternative pathway to understand the effects of fear-appeals, emphasizing the positive influence of defensive responses. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Background: Lesotho has one of the highest rates of tuberculosis (TB) incidence and TB-HIV co-infection in the world. Our study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude and associated factors towards TB in the general population of Lesotho. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis from the Lesotho Demographic and Health Survey (LDHS) 2014 was carried out among 9247 respondents. We used the chi-square test as well as univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to assess the associations of socio-demographic variables with respondent knowledge of and attitude towards TB. Results: The overall knowledge of TB in the general population of Lesotho was adequate (59.9%). There was a significant difference between female and male respondents regarding knowledge about TB (67.0% vs. 41.8%). Almost 95% of respondents had "heard of an illness called tuberculosis", and 80.5% knew that TB can be cured. Only 11.5% knew the correct cause of TB (TB is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Female respondents were relatively aware of TB, knew about the correct cause and mode for transmission of TB and knew that TB is a curable disease compared to male respondents. A higher proportion of respondents (72.8%) had a positive attitude towards TB. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that sex (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.45, 95% CI: 2.10-2.86; p < 0.001), age (AOR) =1.76, 95% CI: 1.29-2.41; p < 0.001), educational level (AOR = 6.26, 95% CI: 3.90-10.06; p < 0.001), formerly married or cohabitated (AOR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.10-1.85; p = 0.008), mass media exposure (AOR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.08-1.64; p = 0.008) and occupation (AOR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.00-1.44; p = 0.049) were strongly associated with respondent knowledge of TB. Sex (AOR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.01-1.41; p = 0.034), educational level (AOR = 1.661, 95% CI: 06-2.60; p = 0.028), mass media exposure (AOR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.06-1.62; p = 0.012) and occupation (AOR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.04-1.52; p = 0.016) were strongly associated with respondent attitude towards TB. Conclusion: Strategies to improve the knowledge of Lesotho's people about TB should focus on males, young residents, those who are illiterate, those who are unmarried and farmers. Special attention should be given to males, young residents, rural residents, those who are illiterate and farmers to improve their attitude towards TB in Lesotho. © 2019 The Author(s).

Social media may be used to assess stigma levels and highlight new trends. This study uses a social media platform, Twitter, to investigate stigmatising and trivialising attitudes across a range of mental and physical health conditions. Methods: Tweets (i.e. messages) associated with five mental and five physical health conditions were collected in ten 72-h windows over a 50-day period using automated software. A random selection of tweets per condition was considered for the analyses. Tweets were categorised according to their topic and presence of stigmatising and trivialising attitudes. Qualitative thematic analysis was performed on all stigmatising and trivialising tweets. Results: A total of 1,059,258 tweets were collected, and from this sample 1300 tweets per condition were randomly selected for analysis. Overall, mental health conditions were found to be more stigmatised (12.9%) and trivialised (14.3%) compared to physical conditions (8.1 and 6.8%, respectively). Amongst mental health conditions the most stigmatised condition was schizophrenia (41%) while the most trivialised was obsessive compulsive disorder (33%). Conclusions: Our findings show that mental health stigma is common on social media. Trivialisation is also common, suggesting that while society may be more open to discussing mental health problems, care should be taken to ensure this is done appropriately. This study further demonstrates the potential for social media to be used to measure the general public’s attitudes towards mental health conditions. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Policy scholars have indicated that the quality of the solution to a perceived social problem depends on the adequacy of its framing. This paper examines how policy stakeholders and local residents frame the issue of the radioactive waste storage facility in Taiwan, the limits of institutional mechanisms in decision-making processes, and the implications of the deliberative forums undertaken by the national Stop Nukes Now organisation. The controversy illustrates the problems of a knowledge gap and the top-down procedures as well as the challenges that Taiwan faces in becoming a nuclear-free country. This case demonstrates civic society organisations’ efforts to challenge the ‘social–technical divide’ and technical experts’ prior definition of the ‘problems’ and selection of a ‘solution’. Deliberative forums enable the participation of affected communities to shape public discourses, which helps to strengthen public communication, improves citizen consciousness of nuclear waste issues, and attempts to link wider communities and public interests. © 2018, © 2018 Newcastle University.

AB  - Health communication strategies to decrease teen pregnancies include the employment of entertainment-education (E-E), which involves embedding health messages in an entertainment media vehicle that is relatable and attractive to the intended audience. MTV’s 16 and Pregnant is an example of such an effort as an E-E documentary-style reality show that aimed to reduce the U.S. teen pregnancy rate. A pretest–posttest experiment was conducted with 147 adolescent girls (ages 14–18) to investigate the effectiveness of 16 and Pregnant on beliefs, attitudes, and intentions to avoid teen pregnancy. Among participants who reported the lowest levels of identification, parasocial relationship, and homophily, viewing 16 and Pregnant resulted in more negative attitudes toward teen pregnancy. Among participants who reported the highest level of homophily, viewing 16 and Pregnant resulted in more positive attitudes toward teen pregnancy. Levels of pregnancy risk and health literacy were examined but were not significant moderators. Results are discussed in light of E-E theory and research. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - “Canadian Experience” is a paradox for many immigrants in Canada and contributes to their exclusion from the labour market. Through an analysis of Canadian English print media, from 2006 to 2011, we illustrate how “Canadian Experience” discourse places the responsibility of immigrant labour market integration on immigrants themselves and constructs their experiences of exclusion as non-racial. This is theorized as a “post-racial” strategy that relies on anti-racialism (avoidance of racial references) to deny the existence and effects of racism, thereby allowing the Canadian public to maintain its façade of innocence but perpetuates “racism without racists”. The discourse de-historicizes postcolonial racial hierarchy and promotes a de-racialized neo-liberal model for immigrant inclusion. This has implications for anti-racism and settlement service provision. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - As a majority of tourist group, the pro-environmental psychological mechanism of mass tourists has not been investigated adequately. Deepening one core facet of the model of goal-directed behaviour, this study investigates the relationships among attitude (i.e. place attachment dimensions), desire, intention and mass tourism value orientation to expound the pro-environmental mentality of mass tourists. Questionnaires were collected from 865 domestic mass tourists visiting Sanya, China. The results partially confirm the validity of the explanation model and delineate the pro-environmental motivating nuance of each place attachment dimension. Place affect and place dependence both significantly motivate the environmental activation of mass tourists. While the motivating effect of the former is rather solid, it is vulnerable to moderation when it comes to the latter. Place identity unexpectedly plays a negative motivating role. The implications of the research findings are discussed. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In a cluster-randomized trial conducted in 22 government secondary schools in Uganda, effects of a school-based intervention aimed at improving aspects of parent/caregiver-adolescent communication on sexuality were examined. The intervention comprised classroom-based education sessions, take home assignments for students to discuss with parents/caregivers and parenting workshops. Baseline and post intervention questionnaires were completed by students and by parents/caregivers. Effect estimates were significant for both students and parents/caregivers on sexuality communication frequency and quality, and for positive and negative attitudes towards sex-related communication, all in the desired direction with effect sizes ranging from 0.17 to 0.38. Effects on four sum scores related to general parenting proved significant only for parents’/caregivers’ legitimacy with regard to rule setting (parents’/caregivers’ reports only). These results suggest that in Uganda, using schools as gateways, parent/caregiver-adolescent communication can be improved through modification of existing school curricula, training teachers in learner-centred approaches and through mobilization and training of parents/caregivers. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - It has been a widely held notion that firms can benefit from using preferential treatment in their customer relationship management strategies. For example, many firms provide select customers (i.e., recipients) with exclusive promotional offers that they purposefully do not extend to other customers (i.e., non-recipients). However, today’s empowered consumers are more socially aware than ever of such divisive practices (via social media, deal websites, etc.), and firms must now better account for the negative backlash from non-recipients that may ensue. In this research, we conceptually define exclusive promotions and outline how they differ from other more heavily-studied customer prioritization tools. We then take a divergent approach from the majority of the extant literature by focusing primarily on how and why non-recipients (rather than recipients) respond to exclusive promotions. Study 1a findings reveal that non-recipients have negative attitudes toward exclusive promotions, as well as negative attitudes and lower patronage intentions toward the firm using them. Perceived social exclusion was shown to underlie these unfavorable responses. In Study 1b, we rule out an alternative equity-based explanation of our findings by assessing loyalty to the firm as a potential moderator. We then extend our investigation to a field setting in Studies 2 and 3. There we replicate our Study 1a results, and assess consumers’ actual purchasing behavior in response to a real exclusive offer for enhanced generalizability. Lastly, in Studies 4 and 5 we empirically test two strategies that firms can potentially use to mitigate the negative effects of exclusive promotions documented here. © 2018, Academy of Marketing Science.

AB  - The influence of social network sentiment on stock market indices and companies has been proven in several studies. However, the influence of social network sentiment on sustainability indices and sustainable companies has not been analyzed so far. Therefore, this study analyzed the influence of social network sentiment on sustainability indices (S & P 500 Environmental & Socially Responsible Index) and focused on variations of this influence on sustainable and non-sustainable companies, namely, in companies included in the Information Technology sector. To this end, two methodologies were used: GARCH (1,1) models and logit-probit models. The results showed that social network sentiment influences S & P 500 Environmental & Socially Responsible Index's volatility; this influence was greater than the influence of social network sentiment when considering the S & P 500 Index. Additionally, the results showed that social network sentiment influences sustainable companies' returns but had no effect on unsustainable companies' returns. These results highlighted the importance of managing the companies' profiles in social networks and their corporate image in general, because investors will consider these aspects to design their investment strategies. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Background: To date, little is known about the association between the use of online social network sites and social isolation among individuals in the second half of life. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine this association among older adults. Methods: Cross-sectional data was drawn from a nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized individuals aged 40 and above (n = 7837) in Germany (German Ageing Survey). Online social network use was assessed using the frequency of social network use (e.g., Facebook) in the preceding 12 months (daily; several times a week; once a week; 1-3 times a month; less often; never). Perceived social isolation was measured using an established scale created by Bude and Lantermann. Results: Adjusting for covariates, linear regressions revealed that daily online social network users reported lower social isolation scores compared with those with less frequent or no social media use. Conclusions: Data suggest that daily users of online social networks aged 40 and over tend to feel less socially isolated than less frequent users or non-users. Future research should concentrate on identifying the direction of this association. Moreover, the reasons underlying this finding should be examined. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Aging is highly correlated with a decline in cognitive abilities. Information and communication technologies are nowadays increasingly used for knowledge acquisition, education, cognitive development, etc. Older adults should be prepared to adopt these technologies and take advantage of their capabilities. The purpose of this study was to analyze the cognitive profile of older adults in order to identify the ways that they learn, as well as to analyze older adults' attitudes, to aid in the development of an e-learning platform adapted to their needs. The sample of the study consisted of 103 older adults, aged 55+, from Greece. According to their responses, older adults seemed to prefer e-learning modules that presented the educational content step-by-step and contained practice questions and examples. In addition, respondents had positive attitudes toward the existence of assessment tests for after the completion of each module. Finally, the utilization of explanatory videos and special graphics in the modules was imperative, according to older adults' preferences. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Because college-aged individuals heavily use social networking sites (SNSs), this study investigates the inclusion of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) on SNSs using consumer socialization theory (CST). In addition, we also examine gender and the continuing influence of family members and peers on individuals’ attitudes toward and purchase intentions for products reviewed on SNSs. Survey results suggest that, compared to men, women rely more often on family members and eWOM on SNSs to gain product information, and women also have more positive attitudes toward products reviewed on SNSs. In addition, purchase intention is based on attitude, peer communication, and eWOM on SNSs. Novel insights include the influence of eWOM on SNSs through the consumer socialization process, which has been found to impact today’s consumer. © 2019, © 2019 American Academy of Advertising.

AB  - The recent humanitarian Rohingya crisis has once again put Myanmar onto the centre stage of global media attention. The aim of this paper is to look into the ethnic minority question in contemporary Myanmar. The paper has a special focus on the Muslim Rohingya community. The paper argues that problematic race relations in Myanmar today should not be viewed in isolation but should be seen as a part of a historical continuum. The British colonial policies of divide and rule, political leaders and their obsession with Buddhism in the post-indepen-dence period and xenophobic tendencies during the long years of the military junta have all collectively contributed to the very complex situation in which the country finds itself today when it comes to race relations. Meaningful democracy and economic development have been advocated as the way forward especially for the more peripheral parts of the country where there is a strong ethnic minority presence. © 2019 Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs.

AB  - It has been suggested that pets provide the opportunity for humans to develop more positive attitudes and relationships toward a wider range of animal types—including toward non-pet animals—this is called the “pets as ambassadors” hypothesis. In this study, we build both on research conducted on human–animal relations and in social psychology to investigate the hypothesis, as well as two likely mechanisms involved in this effect: inter- group anxiety (toward animals) and inclusion of animals in the self. An online questionnaire was completed by 238 Canadian participants (M = 28.6 years old, SD = 8.53; 102 women). Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we tested a model whereby contact with pets predicted greater inclusion of ani- mals in the self and lower intergroup anxiety toward animals in general. In turn, these two psychological processes predicted more positive attitudes toward a broad range of animal types (e.g., wild/pest animals, animals used for human purposes) and animals in general. Finally, these positive attitudes toward animals predicted more pro-social behavioral intentions toward animals. The hypothesized model showed a good fit. Bootstrapping analyses further con- firmed the mediating roles of inclusion of animals in the self and intergroup anxiety toward animals in the associations between contact with pets and attitudes toward animals in general. The hypothesized model also presented a more satisfactory fit compared with an alternative model. Altogether, these findings underline the importance of contact with pets in fostering more positive human–animal relations and promoting animal welfare. These results also support the applicability of social psychological theories and principles in the realm of human–animal relations. © 2019, © 2019 ISAZ.

AB  - Music has been thought of as an art form that expresses ideas and sentiments of the artist. This article examines the relationship between political and non-political rap and Black feminist attitudes. This study includes data from original experiments conducted at Benedict College a historically Black college in Columbia, SC, where Black males and females were exposed to various genres of music and their support of Black feminist attitudes were measured. Blacks exposed to political rap display increased support of Black feminist attitudes compared to those exposed to non-political rap and the control group, subjects who were not exposed to any form of music. Our research finds that those exposed to non-political rap have less affinity for Black feminist attitudes than those in any other group. This research is important to political science because it furthers our knowledge about public opinion and political attitudes. Specifically, this article demonstrates that non-traditional media forms also have an impact on political attitudes. Specifically, exposure to political rap has a significantly positive impact on the agreement with Black feminist attitudes when compared to exposure to non-political rap. Therefore, not all subgenres of rap music are consistently harmful to Black feminist attitudes and attitudes toward women. © 2018 Caucus for a New Political Science.

AB  - RÉSUMÉ: Michel Houellebecq n’est pas seulement un romancier; c’est aussi un personnage. Ce redoublement accompagne un double jeu qui définit sa posture: il suggère le second degré, mais il rappelle qu’il faut l’entendre au premier. En même temps qu’il ambitionne de rendre compte du monde, il revendique son refus de lui rendre des comptes politiquement et devant la justice. On partira de ce double jeu pour penser ensemble l’œuvre et le personnage, la littérature et l’idéologie. On s’attachera donc aux deux enjeux qui ont constitué les deux « scandales » principaux de cette carrière littéraire: le sexe et l’islam. On montrera d’abord comment le large succès de cette œuvre, en France et dans le monde, tient à sa capacité à résonner avec l’actualité, jusqu’à donner le sentiment de la préfigurer. On s’interrogera ensuite sur les tensions qui travaillent cette évolution. En effet, comment concilier la critique initiale du libéralisme sexuel hérité de mai 68 avec la charge contre l’islam qui est prise depuis le 11 septembre 2001 dans la rhétorique mondialisée du « conflit (sexuel) des civilisations » ? C’est dans l’affirmation de la masculinité blanche, dont Michel Houellebecq est le héros paradoxal, que se résout cette contradiction. © 2018, © 2018 Association for the Study of Modern & Contemporary France.
Michel Houellebecq is not only a novelist he is also a character in his own work as well as on the cinema screen and in media. This doubling is accompanied by a double-bluff that defines his literary persona: he is equally dramatically over-the-top and seeking to be taken seriously; his work suggests irony, but he underlines that he should be understood at face value. At the same tame as aiming to make sense of the world, he refuses to be held accountable to it. This article starts from this idea of the double-bluff so as not to be fooled by it: it will consider the work and the character together, but also the literature and the ideology it engages. We will focus particularly on the two major scandals of Houellebecq’s literary career: firstly the sex in Extension du domaine de la lutte and Les Particles élémentaires, then Islam in Plateforme and Soumission. This essay will consider how the success of these novels in France and around the world can be attributed to the way in which they resonate with contemporary news events, almost going as far as anticipating them–such as the return of debates around sexual identity in the French public sphere at the end of the 1990s to the rise of identitarian politics as a result of Islamophobia since the 2000s. It then considers the tensions responsible for this evolution in Houellebecq’s work, speculating how to reconcile the initial critique of post 1968 liberalism with the apparent anti-Islamic turn since 11 September 2001 in the global rhetoric of ‘the clash of civilisations. The affirmation of white male identity, of which Houellebecq is the paradoxical hero resolves this contradiction post ‘Charlie’. © 2018, © 2018, © 2018 Association for the Study of Modern & Contemporary France.

AB  - An interprofessional education (IPE) simulation-based geriatric palliative care training was developed to educate health professions students in team communication. In health care, interprofessional communication is critical to team collaboration and patient and family caregiver outcomes. Studies suggest that acquiring skills to work on health care teams and communicate with team members should occur during the early stage of professional education. The Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC®) competency-based framework was used to inform the training. An evaluation examined attitudes toward health care teams, self-efficacy in communication skills, interprofessional collaboration, and participant satisfaction with the training experience. One-hundred and eleven participants completed pre- and post-training surveys. Overall, a majority of participants (97.3%) were satisfied with the training and reported more positive attitudes toward health care teams and greater self-efficacy in team communication skills. IPE participants had higher collaboration scores compared to observer learners. Further research is needed to explore long-term effects of IPE in clinical practice. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Covert advertising such as embedded paid content (EPC) is flourishing on Israeli TV, but in most cases regulators’ prohibiting rules are not enforced. Though the regulators’ role is to safeguard the public’s right to know, the public’s attitudes and ethical perceptions of EPC on TV is not being addressed. The current survey is an initial attempt to discover TV viewers’ attitudes towards EPC. While respondents’ attitudes towards product placement were indifferent, their attitudes towards EPC were generally negative. Results indicate that after being informed regarding paid TV content, respondents considered EPC to be culturally acceptable in Israeli (relativism), but morally unethical (moral equity). They also considered EPC a violation of the unwritten contract with media creators regarding the authenticity of media content (contractualism). Findings suggest that the Israeli public should be better informed regarding EPC and should be taken into consideration when dealing with its use, regulation and enforcement. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Although Finnish politics relating to the Roma tend to be perceived internationally as fairly successful, several obstacles exist for the Roma in education and the labour market. Training of Roma mediators has been actively promoted in Finland to improve the school performance and equality of Roma pupils. This article, based on ethnographic research, focuses on exploring how the current discursive terrain around the topics of tolerance and prejudice functions in the everyday work of mediators. It is argued that the present discourses in school expose the mediators to unequal power relations of tolerance. The terms for being tolerated are set by the potential tolerating actors, the school community. The mediators aim to supply knowledge about the Roma and try to address prejudices as representatives of the Roma. The study identified three different strategies that the mediators used when encountering prejudice: making sure one does not seem too different, parody and feigning naivety. The analysis suggests that the present discursive terrain creates obstacles to addressing inequalities, discrimination and racism in educational contexts. The responsibility for tackling discrimination is placed on the shoulders of individual Roma–not the whole school community. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Worldwide, homeless girls are a highly vulnerable group. They suffer sexual exploitation and forced labor, discrimination, and social exclusion at a higher rate than the rest of the general population. They often present anxiety and depression, unassertiveness and emotion dysregulation, among other psychosocial characteristics. All of these factors negatively impact subjective well-being, further worsening their mental health. Subjective well-being has both immediate (mental health, health behaviors) and long-term, cumulative effects on health (physical health, mortality), representing opportunities for investment in population health. Despite the relevance of subjective well-being and its associated factors, there is scarce research on the plight of homeless girls in Mexico and Latin America, which leads to ineffective interventions, policy actions and to a diminished quality of life. This study was carried out to develop and test a path model of well-being in 240 Mexican homeless girls ages 6–23 years old. Symptoms of anxiety and depression, assertiveness and emotion regulation strategies were used as factors influencing subjective well-being. Results showed that symptoms of depression and functional emotion regulation strategies have a significant direct influence on subjective well-being. Symptoms of anxiety and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies have an indirect influence on subjective well-being with symptoms of depression as the mediating variable. Assertiveness did not significantly influence well-being directly and indirectly. Functional and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies have a positive significant correlation. Fit indexes obtained indicate an excellent adjustment to data. R square indicates that 38% of the variance in subjective well-being can be explained by this model. Hence, the current study provides unique findings in terms of a model of well-being through which it is possible to design and implement interventions that increase such well-being in order to promote healthier social and emotional developmental trajectories in homeless girls, especially in the context of Latin American cities. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Since the failed 2004 Annan Plan referendum, a special relationship between the Turkish Cypriot community and the EU institutions has been established. Increased unofficial contacts have paved the way for a reinforced role of sub-state actors, including Turkish Cypriot media. The role of the Turkish Cypriot media in shaping public opinion towards the EU has been largely correlated with the course of the Cyprus negotiations. Weak institutionalisation has negatively affected the influence of the local media on advancing the sui generis relationship between the Turkish Cypriot community and the European Union, as well as Europeanisation in the northern part of Cyprus. This article applies the theoretical framework of horizontal and vertical Europeanisation to explore the impact of local media on the relations between the European Union and the Turkish Cypriot community. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Despite research examining the relationship between discrimination and alcohol use and delinquency among adolescents, little is understood about the mechanism behind the relationship. Objectives: On the basis of Strain Theory, the current study examined a new theoretical model in which feelings of alienation (from the self, peers, and Israeli society) mediate the relationship between discrimination and alcohol use and delinquency. Methods: A one-year follow-up study was conducted with 146 at-risk youth from the Former Soviet Union and Ethiopia in Israel (63% male), from disadvantaged low socioeconomic neighborhoods. At Time 1 (T1), adolescents were asked about their experiences of discrimination, feelings of alienation, and levels of problem alcohol use (past month/ever drunkenness, past month binge drinking, and regular daily drinking). At time 2 (T2), the participants were again asked as to their experiences of alienation, alcohol use, and delinquency. Results: Perceived discrimination at T1 significantly predicted feelings of alienation at T2, when controlling for the relationship with alienation at T1. Feelings of alienation (from the self and Israeli society) fully mediated the relationship between discrimination and alcohol use. However, there was a direct relationship between discrimination and delinquency. Conclusions: Findings emphasize the negative impact of discrimination on adolescents. They suggest that during the critical developmental period of adolescence, feelings of discrimination may be internalized into negative emotions which may lead to involvement in deviant behaviors. Results suggest a need to help adolescents process and make sense of the discriminatory experiences they perceive. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In 1964, a small industrial town on the outskirts of Birmingham gained a reputation worldwide as Britain’s most racist town. The Conservative Party’s candidate, Peter Griffiths, bucked national trends in the General Election by winning a seat in Smethwick with a large majority, following a fiercely anti-immigrant campaign. Smethwick’s immigrant population was no larger than that of neighbouring towns, posing the question why such intense anti-immigrant feeling emerged at a local level? This article addresses the impact of local and regional media on public perceptions of immigrants in Smethwick during and immediately after the 1964 General Election, arguing that the local newspaper, the Smethwick Telephone, and ATV Today, ITV’s regional news programme for the Midlands, fuelled hostility and helped legitimise Griffiths’ campaign. By investigating the media’s influence at a local level, we can gain a greater understanding of the development of racial prejudice in British communities and the complex history of twentieth century media. This article further develops the work of Wendy Webster, Sarita Malik and Gavin Schaffer, who examine the framing of immigration by a range of national media forms but overlook the vital role of local and regional reporting in this process. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Assessing the impact of events on the evolution of online public discourse is challenging due to the lack of data prior to the event and appropriate methodologies for capturing the progression of tenor of public discourse, both in terms of their tone and topic. In this article, we introduce a geovisual analytics framework, CarSenToGram, which integrates topic modeling and sentiment analysis with cartograms to identify the changing dynamics of public discourse on a particular topic across space and time. The main novelty of CarSenToGram is coupling comprehensible spatiotemporal overviews of the overall distribution, topical and sentiment patterns with increasing levels of information supported by zoom and filter, and details-on-demand interactions. To demonstrate the utility of CarSenToGram, in this article, we analyze tweets related to immigration the month before and after the 27 January 2017 travel ban in order to reveal insights into one of the defining moments of President Trump’s first year in office. Not only do we find that the travel ban influenced online public discourse and sentiment on immigration, but it also highlighted important partisan divisions within the US. © 2018, © 2018 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.

AB  - Since spring 2017, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China has witnessed the emergence of an unprecedented re-education campaign. According to media and informant reports, untold thousands of Uyghurs and other Muslims have been and are being detained in clandestine political re-education facilities, with major implications for society, local economies and ethnic relations. Considering that the Chinese state is currently denying the very existence of these facilities, this paper investigates publicly available evidence from official sources, including government websites, media reports and other Chinese internet sources. First, it briefly charts the history and present context of political re-education. Second, it looks at the recent evolution of re-education in Xinjiang in the context of ‘de-extremification’ work. Finally, it evaluates detailed empirical evidence pertaining to the present re-education drive. With Xinjiang as the ‘core hub’ of the Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing appears determined to pursue a definitive solution to the Uyghur question. © 2018, © 2018 Southseries Inc.

AB  - Although research suggests that there is no meaningful real-world connection between crime rates and undocumented immigrants, media coverage of this group almost exclusively portrays them as criminals. The present two-study investigation experimentally tests the effects of exposure to crime news depicting undocumented immigrant suspects on White viewers’ social judgments. To this end, assumptions from social identity theory were applied to research and theorizing on mediated intergroup threat and compound penalties for immigrant criminality. Results from Study 1 and Study 2 indicate that when White viewers are exposed to threatening crime news featuring undocumented immigrants, out-group bias emerges in the form of harsher sentencing. In Study 1, when exposed to highly threatening coverage, attitudes toward immigration and in-group identification partially mediated and moderated this relationship, respectively. © 2018, © 2018 National Communication Association.

AB  - The inclusion of children with special educational needs is a major challenge. Amongst the factors linked to a successful inclusive education policy, teachers’ attitude toward inclusion is particularly important. The present paper seeks to understand why general teachers exhibit less favourable attitude toward inclusion than special education teachers. We argue that general teachers’ low sense of efficacy can act as a mediator. To investigate this hypothesis, general and special education teachers were asked to report their attitude and efficacy. Results confirm that general teachers have less positive attitude toward inclusion than special education teachers. In addition, a mediational analysis confirmed that this discrepancy is partly sustained by general teachers’ lower sense of efficacy. Limits as well as future perspective are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - HIV prevention interventions that reduce sexual risk behaviors among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM), the most severely affected population in the United States, are critical for reducing disparities in HIV infection. However, there are few theory-based sexual risk reduction interventions designed specifically for YBMSM. This study tested the applicability of the Integrated Behavioral Model (IBM), which theorizes that behavioral intentions mediate the relationship between psychosocial constructs and health behavior on condomless anal intercourse (CAI) among YBMSM. To test key constructs of the IBM, analyses were conducted with baseline data from the HealthMpowerment (HMP) randomized controlled trial. Logistic regression was used to examine the relationships between condom use self-efficacy, norms, attitudes, intentions, and environmental constraints, and CAI. Mediation analysis was conducted to determine if condom use intentions mediated the relationship between psychosocial constructs (i.e., condom use self-efficacy, norms, and attitudes) and CAI. Overall 55.7% reported one or more acts of CAI with a male partner in the past 3 months. Those who reported CAI in the 3 months prior to the baseline survey reported lower self-efficacy for condom use, lower condom use norms, more negative attitudes toward condom use, and lower condom use intentions at baseline than those who reported no CAI. In mediation analysis, the relationships between CAI and self-efficacy for condom use (estimated indirect effect = −0.004 (SE = 0.002)), condom use norms (−0.002 (SE = 0.001)) and attitudes toward condom use (−0.005 (SE = 0.002)) were mediated by condom use intentions. This study applied the IBM to sexual risk behavior among a sample of YBMSM. Results indicate that the relationships between condom use self-efficacy, norms, and attitudes, and CAI were mediated by condom use intentions. Future theory-informed interventions should focus on increasing self-efficacy for condom use, condom use norms, attitudes toward condom use, and condom use intentions to reduce CAI among YBMSM. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Young people growing up in poverty often have restricted access to out-of-school enrichment activities that are important for generating the soft skills that support post-school transitions. This paper compares young Australians’ accounts of their opportunity structures–their engagement with enrichment activities, their post-school aspirations, and their knowledge of routes to achieve them–in two suburb types–improver suburbs (close to the median on many indicators) and isolate suburbs (severely disadvantaged on most indicators). While young people in improver suburbs felt able to access facilities and networks in equally or more affluent neighbouring suburbs, young people in isolate suburbs felt excluded from neighbouring suburbs, and experienced more restricted opportunity structures than young people living in improver suburbs, even those who were themselves economically disadvantaged. The paper argues that this geographical experience of exclusion prevents many economically disadvantaged young people from accumulating knowledge and skills valued in post-school settings. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - As a reflective activity at niche scale in transition management for system-wide changes in universities for sustainable societies, this study aimed to evaluate student environmental literacy (EL) and assess the effects of sociodemographic variables on the level of EL among students at Shahid Beheshti University in Iran. A total of 1,068 students took the EL test. The test had four parts: knowledge, attitude, sensitivity, and concern. The findings indicated that students had a positive attitude and a high degree of concern and showed sensitivity to the environment, but they had only low-to-moderate levels of knowledge. The sociodemographic variables of gender, age, and environmental experience had a significant effect on EL and mass media served as the main source of environmental information. Finally, recommendations are made regarding the cultivation of the results into effective content (what) and ways of teaching and learning (how) EL at niche level of universities. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Women are frequently depicted as non-human objects or animals. While female animalization has typically been conceptualized in the psychological literature as communicating a unitary perception of women, linguistic research suggests that there are at least two distinct animalizing linguistic metaphors for women that depict women at opposite ends of a sex-based power differential: ‘women-are-predators’ and ‘women-are-prey’. Are these linguistic metaphors able to shape sexist attitudes towards women? US Male and female undergraduates read an article, which concerned women voters in an election year, containing language that described women as predatory, prey-like, or in a humanized manner (baseline). They then reported their ambivalent sexist attitudes towards women in general. Consistent with both metaphors’ emphasis on sex-based power differentials, both male and female participants, who read about predatory women, exhibited greater agreement with hostile sexist attitudes than participants who read about prey-like women. This study suggests that the continued transmission of animalizing metaphors for women may help perpetuate prejudicial beliefs about appropriate roles for women in society. Media communicators might learn to identify and eliminate the use of the animalizing terms in their own work. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Research has considered how exposure to prosocial television narratives influences children’s social inclusion behaviors (e.g., Mares & Acosta, 2010). In these experiments, children typically view a stimulus episode alone; however, we know that children often watch with others at home (Chandler, 1997). Thus, in this study we examined how children’s proximal social context during viewing influenced effects. Using data collected from a 3-condition experiment (control, view-alone, coview with close friend) with Dutch children ages 5 and 6 (N = 80), we found that exposure largely did not influence children’s inclusion judgments or stigmatization beliefs. There was, however, an age × condition interaction, such that 6-year-old children in the coview condition demonstrated greater stigmatization beliefs toward other children, compared to 5-year-olds in the same condition, or all children in the other conditions. We discuss the implications of these findings while considering previous work on learning inclusion from prosocial television shows, reality judgments, and the bystander effect. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Social media offers a new channel to connect political elites with potential supporters. However, the flow of information between the two groups is constrained by a deliberate decision to actively listen only to some politicians based on the messages that users potentially favour. Previous research has posited that, if ideological proximity is an explanatory factor of the decision to follow certain political elites in social media, it should be possible to recover the political preferences of users from following behaviour. Using a unique database with survey data about the demographic characteristics and political attitudes of 5580 Twitter users, I show that, although ideology indeed explains following behaviour on Twitter, interest in politics induces a pattern of selection that limits what we can know about the ideological distribution in the population. My results provide direct validation of a previously hypothesised behaviour in the literature and have implications for the use of a proximity model to infer the state of public opinion using Twitter data. © 2017, © 2017 Academy of Social Sciences.

AB  - Purpose — Reputational crisis negatively affects brands and companies. This chapter, based on a single case study, aims to explore how prejudicial corporate statements directed toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals have affected the Italian multinational Barilla S.p.A., as well as how the company responded both internally and to the market in order to attempt to overcome the highly damaging consequences. Design/Methodology — This chapter uses a single case-study methodology, which constitutes “a research strategy that focuses on understanding the dynamics present within single settings to create theoretical constructs, propositions and/or midrange theory from empirical evidence” (Eisenhardt, 1989, p. 534). The case-study design was chosen as it has been demonstrated to provide a methodological tool for both theory generation and theory testing (Gibbert et al., 2008). Findings — Conclusions from the chapter indicate that negative, incendiary, and oftentimes comments citing either religious or stereotypical-based ideology negatively impact both the consumers and its associated publics in terms of product branding or reputation image. Research Limitations — The study’s limitations, which rely primarily on a single case study and secondary research data, may motivate further investigative avenues, particularly as similarly referenced events continue to unfold almost daily, such as the study’s referenced incident with Philippine boxer Manny Pacquiao, as well as action taken by social media giants (Apple and Facebook) against the controversial media figure Alex Jones. Practical and Social Implications — This chapter also looks at family succession roadblocks and navigating social media gaffes. These contemporary issues highlight challenges, strategies, sales and market share dynamics for the company, and suggestions for navigating the road ahead. The research concludes with possible linkages and insights for both ongoing management issues and potential areas for future research. Other findings indicate that rapid responses, particularly those citing concrete corporate policy changes or tangible actions, help to reverse and mitigate reputational damage, and contemporary approaches utilizing social media appear to buttress these efforts. Originality/Value — This case study of Barilla as well as other firms mentioned, such as Chick-fil-A and Nike (which have experienced parallel situational crises), indicates that in only the last five years of contemporary international business practice, MNEs are continually and at times unexpectedly challenged by the lack of sensitivity demonstrated by their owners and spokespeople who utter comments which may be seen by the public as potentially harmful to the LGBT community. This study hopes to illuminate this challenge while offering tangible solutions to turning around future, similar situational crises. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Though the contemporary media environment is filled with many different sources disseminating communications about science - including journalists, politicians and opinion leaders, and researchers - few studies have examined how messages about science communicated by different sources directly influence audience opinion about scientific research itself. This experiment (N = 170) used stimuli articles that reflected different presentation sources (3: political/public relations/researcher) and types of science research (2: "hard"/"soft") to examine effects on people's attitudes toward the featured research project's (a) utility and (b) worthiness of federal grant funding, while controlling for individual differences in political attitudes and interest in science. Overall, political-source messages suppressed ratings of the project's worthiness of funding and utility, and while messages from the researcher source produced greater utility ratings compared to the public relations source for soft science projects, this pattern was reversed for hard science research. Additionally, different sources influenced people's comprehension of articles they read. We interpret these results within the larger landscape of science communication and conclude with brief practical recommendations for those engaging in science communication. © Tong, Vultee, Kolhoff, Elam and Aniss.

AB  - In 2016, Waleed Aly, a prominent Muslim Australian academic and media personality, made an argument using the Twitter hashtag “Send Forgiveness Viral” that asked for empathy in the face of Islamophobia. While initially appealing, deeper consideration of his use of and appeal to his audience to use Rogerian strategies to combat racism presents problems. Can Rogerian argumentation strategies be utilized to combat racism? Using Aly’s #SendForgivenessViral argument as a case study, this article evaluates Rogerian argumentation and empathic response in therapeutic situations compared to arguments about discrimination, particularly those taking place through social media. While scholarly writing by Lassner (1990) and Ede (1984) is dated, they provide pertinent and influential ideas to consider. More recent scholarship used to evaluate #SendForgivenessViral includes arguments on race, rhetoric, and Twitter revolutions by Brock (2012), D’Cruz (2017), Gerbaudo (2012), Margolin (2017), and Roose (2016). Other sources will be drawn from contemporary social media responses to Aly’s segment. This article concludes that Aly’s use of Rogerian argumentation is flawed because it places the onus of combatting racism onto victims. Furthermore, Rogerian argumentation models have underlying problems with power relations. © 2018 American Forensic Association.

AB  - This research investigates user awareness and attitudes toward potential inferences of information posted on social network sites (SNSs). The study reports how user attitudes change after exposure to inferences made based upon information they have disclosed on an SNS, namely, on Facebook. To demonstrate this, two sub-studies involving three focus group sessions were conducted with Facebook users. In the first sub-study, the users received a general introduction to information that can be inferred from posts by using a prototypical privacy-enhancement tool called DataBait. Then, the second sub-study allowed the users to witness the potential inferences of their own Facebook photos and posts by using the DataBait tool. Next, qualitative content analysis was conducted to analyze the results, and these showed that the participants’ attitudes toward privacy on SNSs changed from affective to cognitive when they became aware of potential inferences from actual information posted on their own Facebook accounts. The results imply that end users require more cognitive awareness regarding their genres of disclosure and the effect of their disclosures on their privacy. Moreover, as privacy awareness is contextual, there is a need for more research and development of online tools that will allow users to manage and educate themselves. © 2019, SAGE Publications Ltd.

AB  - Background: Social media provides people with easy ways to communicate their attitudes and feelings to a wide audience. Many people, unfortunately, have negative associations and feelings about dental treatment due to former painful experiences. Previous research indicates that there might be a pervasive and negative occupational stereotype related to dentists and that this stereotype is expressed in many different venues, including movies and literature. Objective: This study investigates the language used in relation to dentists and medical doctors on the social media platform Twitter. The purpose is to compare the professions in terms of the use of emotional and pain-related words, which might underlie and reflect the pervasive negative stereotype identified in relation to dentists. We hypothesized that (A) tweets about dentists will have more negative emotion-related words than those about medical doctors and (B) pain-related words occur more frequently in tweets about dentists than in those about medical doctors. Methods: Twitter content (“tweets”) about dentists and medical doctors was collected using the Twitter application program interface 140Dev over a 4-week period in 2015, scanning the search terms “dentist” and “doctor”. Word content of the selected tweets was analyzed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software. The research hypotheses were investigated using nonparametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests. Results: Over 2.3 million tweets were collected in total, of which about one-third contained the word “dentist” and about two-thirds contained the word “doctor.” Hypothesis A was supported since a higher proportion of negative words was used in tweets about dentists than in those about medical doctors (z=−10.47; P<.001). Similarly, tests showed a difference in the proportions of anger words (z=−12.54; P<.001), anxiety words (z=−6.96; P<.001), and sadness words (z=−9.58; P<.001), with higher proportions of these words in tweets about dentists than in those about doctors. Also, Hypothesis B was supported since a higher proportion of pain-related words was used in tweets about dentists than in those about doctors (z=−8.02; P<.001). Conclusions: The results from this study suggest that stereotypes regarding dentists and dental treatment are spread through social media such as Twitter and that social media also might represent an avenue for improving messaging and disseminating more positive attitudes toward dentists and dental treatment. © Jan-Are K Johnsen, Trude B Eggesvik, Thea H Rørvik, Miriam W Hanssen, Rolf Wynn, Per Egil Kummervold.

AB  - The accuracy and relevance of United States print news media has been called into question at increasing rates in the post-truth era. Conservatives, in particular, have long expressed concerns that mass and digital media censor conservative as well as Christian viewpoints while promoting a progressive and, more recently, pro-Muslim, platform. They have increasingly turned to alternative-right and alternative right-wing sources for news and discussion within what they deem to be unfiltered and unbiased networks. This article employs a mixed method approach of content and discourse analysis of sources from 1 January to 15 May of 2019 pertaining to discourse concerning the relationship between Christianity and Islam within and in response to articles in three such sources: Breitbart, The Federalist, and FrontPage Magazine. The role of these three websites is considered in the radicalization of those who aim to defend a monolithic form of Christianity rather than a particular Christian denomination or belief. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The people of Cireundeu Village are known to hold firm Sundanese wiwitan customs and traditions of ancestral heritage that contain local wisdom. The tradition of eating cassava rice has been carried out by indigenous peoples for a hundred years since 1918 for generations. The process of introducing and applying the tradition of eating cassava rice was started by this traditional family in carrying out the inheritance of giving culture to the village of Cireundeu. This research uses a qualitative method with a case study approach to three indigenous families in Cireundeu village who have different beliefs and birthplaces. As parents in the family communicate the tradition of eating cassava rice or shortened constellations to children or young people as recipients of cultural heritage. The purpose of this study was to find out 1) Why the tradition of eating constellations was maintained and passed on to children. 2) How is the pattern of communication of indigenous families in applying the tradition of eating constellations to their children The results showed that 1) Children are the younger generation who are expected to be the successors to the tradition of eating racial food (cassava rice) because it bequeathed this tradition so that children have self-identity, self-confidence, and pride in having a local culture that is characteristic of food security in the village of Cireundeu. 2) Communication patterns of inheritance of the tradition of eating constellations in indigenous families are carried out with an interpersonal communication approach (openness, empathy, equality, positive attitude and support) to children. The communication process occurs because of tolerance. Tolerance creates cooperative behavior, wise behavior and adapted behavior among family members © 2020

AB  - Objectives: The better-off-dead belief, the idea that death is preferable for people living with human immunodeficiency virus, is a highly devaluing attitude, but little is known about its determinants among the general population. Guided by the instrumental model of stigma, this study examined the contributive roles of fear of infection and social distance to this stigmatizing belief. Methods: A total of 304 Chinese university students recruited in Guangzhou and Hong Kong responded to questionnaires assessing the better-off-dead belief, fear of infection and social distance. Structural equation modelling was used to test associations among the variables. Results: Fear of infection and social distance were associated with higher levels of the better-off-dead belief. Social distance mediated the association between fear of infection and the better-off-dead belief. Conclusions: Fear of infection and social distance are determinants of the better-off-dead belief, with social distance serving as a mediator. This study highlights the importance of addressing fear and avoidance in future public health efforts to reduce the prevalence of the better-off-dead belief. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - In the digital era, Instagram is used by celebrities to participate in political contestation. Starting from incumbent celebrities to new celebrities who are running for politics, they use Instagram as a campaign media in the 2019 election. The presence of Instagram is a new alternative to revolutionizing political campaigns. Their popularity as a celebrity and celebgram made it easier for them to be able to built their image themselves and be able to win votes in their constituents. This study aims to see the use of Instagram by Indonesian celebrity politicians in influencing public attitudes and views that not only are they popular but they can also carry out their duties as people's representatives. By using the method of text analysis on instagram feeds celebrity women politicians who focus on various elements, including framing political ideologies through personal life displayed in the form of struggles the women politicians is facing in applying political values and ideology of political parties. The result of this study illustrates that the presence of Instagram media has inspired celebrity politicians to use isntagram as a "two-way" campaign media between politicians and voters. The campaign revolution was driven by intense voter behavior in using Instagram, as well as being more aware and reactive to political issues. On isntagram, women celebrity politicians put themselves as "political celebrities" by displaying that they are the main political players in various posts. This analysis highlights the effects and implications of the online political campaign revolution in Indonesia. In general, it offers an indispensable display on image-based e-politicking and contributes to academic literature on social media, permanent campaigns, as well as celebrities and politics in Indonesia. © 2019.

AB  - Contemporary far-right politicians increasingly diffuse messages through social networks. This article argues that online communication may prove effective for political engagement because it can cre-ate emotional reactions against certain groups, in a process that I call "emotional antagonism. " An exam-ple of emotional antagonism is online Islamophobia, which considers Islam as supposedly incompatible with democratic values and tends to conflate Muslims with migrants. Through qualitative observations and textual analyses of tweets, this article explores the following questions: How do certain online exchanges emotionally frame Muslims as the social "others" in relation to European culture? Why and how does the Internet facilitate the spread of emotional antagonism? What type of political propaganda and participa-tion is connected to affective online Islamophobia? The article analyses two case studies: 1) Islamophobic tweets sent in the aftermath of the British referendum in 2016, with the hashtag #Brexit; 2) Anti-Muslim tweets that contain the hashtag #chiudiamoiporti (close the ports), launched by Italian Vice Prime Minister Matteo Salvini in 2018 to support anti-migration measures. The article shows that exploring emotional an-tagonism can add complexity to the current understanding of Islamophobic conflicts, of social media plat-forms' characteristics, and of political participation based on online communication. © 2019-University of Salento.

AB  - One of the most extreme expressions of prejudice is likening groups to non-human beings. Previous research relates disgust to dehumanization of social groups. However, prior studies have not examined other negative emotions in relation to dehumanization. We examined whether three emotions - anger, disgust, and fear - are associated with dehumanization of social groups. In Experiments 1 and 2 we tested these relationships measuring reactions to real groups. We found that all three emotions were uniquely related to animalistic and humanity-denial dehumanization, but only fear was related to mechanistic dehumanization. Using an orthogonal emotion grid measure in Experiment 3, we showed anger to play a primary role in dehumanization among a variety of target groups. Finally, in Experiment 4 we manipulated whether a novel group was abnormal or harmful, and found that both groups elicited more dehumanization than the control group; however, the harmful group elicited dehumanization mediated by anger and the abnormal group elicited dehumanization mediated by disgust. From this evidence, we argue that other emotions besides disgust play an important part in the dehumanization of outgroups. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - All in the Family’s Archie Bunker was a mouthpiece for 1970s white working-class men. Theirs was an anxious decade. Peddling stereotypes, “othering” those unlike them, enabled this group to assert their threatened authority. Analyzed as popular media texts, the show’s many intersections with bigotry and anti-Semitism reveal unique insights into 1970s American life, especially the Jewish American experience. During the series’ decade-long run, Bunker gradually confronted and softened his prejudices. However, this was not the case among all “Archies,” a reality still visible in current times. Surveying the show’s racialist meditations against the backdrop of “tiki torchers” and Trumpism reminds viewers about the fraught nature of American identity, explaining why some Jews may elect to pass. © 2020 Wayne State University Press, Detroit, MI 48201-1309.

AB  - Social media play an important role in emergency management. The location of citizens and distance from a disaster influence the social media usage patterns. Using the Tianjin Port Explosion, we apply the correlation analysis and regression analysis to explore the relationship between online engagement and location. Citizens' online engagement is estimated by social media. Three dimensions of the psychological distance - spatial, temporal, and social distances - are applied to measure the effects of location and distance. Online engagement is negatively correlated to such 3 kinds of the distance, which indicates that citizens may pay less attention to a disaster that happens at a far away location and at an area of less interaction or at a relatively long period of time. Furthermore, a linear model is proposed to measure the psychological distance. The quantification relationship between online engagement and psychological distance is discussed. The result enhances our understanding of social media usage patterns related to location and distance. The study gives a new insight on situation awareness, decision-making during disasters. © 2019 Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc..

AB  - One of the long-term goals of autonomous mobility is to achieve mobility for non-drivers or those with difficult access to mobility: for seniors, women, children or other groups of people who are not able to drive a car. However, previous surveys revealed that respondents in these subpopulations were rather reluctant to use connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). This discrepancy brings a paradox in the context of autonomous mobility because one of the main benefits of autonomous mobility is its use by groups that currently reject it the most. One of the reasons for this refusal may lie in the amount of available information on CAVs. Thus, this study focuses on the general attitude, the level of awareness and the preferred ways of new information obtaining on CAVs. Firstly, focus groups revealed preferred media channels for obtaining new information on CAVs. Consequently, a survey was conducted on perceptions and attitudes related to CAVs among the general population in the Czech Republic. Overall, 59 professional inquirers personally interviewed 1116 persons older than 15 years via computer (CAPI). Respondents were selected through the multistage probabilistic sampling procedure, based on the list of address points in the Czech Republic. In the sample, there were 573 (51%) women, the average age was 51 years (SD = 17 years). The results show that, on average, women declared more neutral and negatives attitude towards CAV in comparison to men regardless of age. Furthermore, men declared higher CAV awareness than women in all age groups. As for the preferred information channels, young men mostly chose internet or a "trial as a driver on the circuit". On the other hand, seniors declared the lowest willingness to receive new information about CAVs. However, if they wish to receive information on CAVs, they prefer TV or a "Trial during a social event at my neighbourhood". Results of this study are thus consistent with findings of previous studies as they all identify the importance of gender and age when it comes to the attitude on CAVs. © 2018 Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Escola de Direito de Sao Paulo.

AB  - Fiction is often credited with shaping public attitudes to science, but little science communication research has studied fans' deep engagement with a science-themed fiction text. This study used a survey to investigate the impacts of television series Doctor Who (1963-89; 2005-present) on its viewers' attitudes to science, including their education and career choices and ideas about science ethics and the science-society relationship. The program's reported impacts ranged from causing participants to fact-check Doctor Who's science to inspiring them to pursue a science career, or, more commonly, prompting viewers to think broadly and deeply about science's social position in diverse ways. © The Author(s).

AB  - Aim/Purpose The purpose of the study is to examine and understand the attitude of Kazakhstani universities' instructors towards ICT integration into the curriculum and to find out the relationship between instructors' attitudes towards ICT and their actual usage of ICT for teaching and learning processes. Background The Kazakhstani government has taken initiatives and developed state programs to integrate information communication technologies (ICT) into all levels of education. According to previous research studies, instructors' negative attitude towards ICT integration into curriculum can affect the implementation of ICT-related initiatives in education including higher education. Therefore, this research study examines the attitudes of Kazakhstani higher education instructors towards ICT integration into curriculum. Methodology The study implemented an explanatory sequential mixed methods design. For quan-titative and qualitative data collection paper-based questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used, respectively. Convenience sampling was conducted, and the sample consisted of 102 instructors working in two universities in Kazakh-stan. In quantitative data analysis, descriptive and inferential statistics were used; Spearman's rho correlation coefficient was used to identify the relationship between variables. Contribution Understanding instructors' attitude towards ICT in education and exploring reasons behind attitudes might be beneficial in accomplishing aims and purposes of gov-ernmental ICT-related programs in the higher education system. Findings Quantitative data analysis reveals that instructors generally possess positive to very positive attitude towards using ICT in education. Instructors often use simple basic tools such as multimedia presentation software; however, they very rarely use more advanced tools such as discipline-oriented software. No statistically significant rela-tionship was found between attitude and advanced ICT tools. Qualitative data analy-sis identifies several barriers to ICT usage: insufficient or lack of provision of ICT tools and software, lack of technical support, and lack of technical knowledge among instructors. Recommendations for Practitioners As a result of the study, it is firstly recommended to university administrations to create and add positions of information technology (IT) specialists, to each depart-ment and on a permanent basis. Secondly, it is recommended to provide faculty members with training courses that focus on ICT in pedagogy. Thirdly, universities could ask for guidance from their existing faculty members who are advanced ICT integrators, that is to say, collegial learning should be encouraged more strongly. Fi-nally, universities are recommended to reward those faculty members who are active and effective in their attempts to integrate ICT into teaching. Future Research As I was not able to interview those instructors who possessed negative attitude towards ICT in education, I would recommend filling this gap in the future. Inter-viewing instructors who are reluctant to integrate ICT into teaching can help identify more issues related to using ICT in education which were not discovered in the cur-rent research study. Also, the current research study did not investigate instructors' attitudes in relation to their demographic background. Further research studies can examine how in-structors' age, gender, place of study, place of work, academic degree, or subject area of teaching influence their attitude towards using ICT in education and their actual usage of ICT in teaching practices. © 2020 Informing Science Institute.

AB  - Aim/Purpose Edmodo is a free and secure social learning network for teachers, students, and parents. This research aims to investigate the impact of using the Edmodo net-work among the students at Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University and stu-dents' attitudes toward it. Background The creators of e-learning systems have recently taken remarkable strides, in-cluding the development of a full range of techniques and means of communi-cation. Social networks encourage collaborative work and thus have huge poten-tial to increase information sharing among users, which makes these networks especially useful in academic and higher-education systems. Edmodo network is one of the main choices to be adopted in education process. Methodology This research has an experimental design based on a set of online tests. It also includes the development of a scale to determine students' attitudes toward Edmodo Contribution There is a lack of studies on the adoption of Edmodo within higher education. This research is an investigation of the impact that using Edmodo had on stu-dents at Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University. Findings The findings of this research show that using Edmodo leads to a statistically significant improvement in learning skills among higher-education students. The results also illustrate that students have positive attitudes toward the use of Edmodo in their courses. Recommendations for Practitioners Adopting Edmodo within their teaching model. Recommendations for Researchers More investigation on this topic with a larger number of participants is recom-mended Impact on Society This investigation provides society with better understanding of adopting Ed-modo within higher education. Future Research Further work should include investigations of this topic that include a larger number of participants with more diverse backgrounds. The challenges of us-ing Edmodo also need to be investigated in further studies. © 2019.

AB  - Direct to consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) is an emerging service that allows individuals to have their DNA tested without having to consult a healthcare provider. DTC-GT can provide insight into various aspects about an individual, including their health and ancestry. However, testing may pose privacy risks and yield distressing results. Despite the growing popularity of DTC-GT, public attitudes toward such services remain largely ill-defined. Using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we administered a web-based survey to over 1,000 individuals to obtain intuition into public attitudes about DTC-GT. S urvey questions were grounded in a literature review of people's views about DTC-GT. The results of the survey indicated that respondents were interested in DTC-GT as a possible way to gain insight about health, ancestry, and family relationships, as well as advance research. Despite this, respondents were concerned that DTC-GT companies and other users of their DTC-GT data would infringe upon their privacy. ©2019 AMIA - All rights reserved.

AB  - The accurate use of PFTs in multisystem disorders requires a clear understanding of both the nature of multisystem disease and the inherent limitations of PFTs. In multisystem disorders, pulmonary disease may arise in one or more lung compartments, resulting in highly variable patterns of pulmonary function impairment. The detection of pulmonary disease and the accurate quantification of disease severity (with a view to prognostic evaluation) requires the multidisciplinary integration of PFTs, symptoms and ancillary tests such as thoracic CT and echocardiography. With regard to both goals, the integration of all available data is necessary to offset the confounding effect of the normal PFT range, as pre-morbid PFT data are seldom available. PFTs are the cornerstone of monitoring pulmonary disease progression but measurement variability and the existence of multicompartment disease complicate the use of PFTs for this purpose in isolation. Apparently definitive serial PFT trends may, in reality, represent supervening disease processes in other lung compartments or, in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, infection or drug-induced lung disease. In conclusion, PFTs have a key role in multisystem disorders in the identification of pulmonary disease, evaluation of disease severity and monitoring but must always be integrated with all other available data. © ERS 2019.

AB  - The issues of social media spreading hoax news are increasingly worrisome in the diverse society life in Indonesia. It is obvious that various conflicts have been triggered by hoax news filled with prejudice, hatred and negative information. Besides, the prevalence of hoaxes has increased simultaneously with political democracy in Indonesia. For the reason of freedom of communication as being the right of the people, messages are often interpreted unilaterally to serve a given interest. This research aims to obtain an overview of the hoax which threatens diversity as well as the effective strategy and communication pattern to counter it. To gain a holistic view of hoaxes on social media, this research employed a qualitative research method. This research found that hoaxes dominate the social media information traffic and threaten national diversity, which is perceived differently by social media users and society. Another finding is that there is a need for a strategy and communication pattern to counter hoaxes which threaten the nation unity. © 2019.

AB  - The utilisation of direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical drug advertising (DCPDA) continues to elicit divergent views within the healthcare community. Therefore, this study examined the relationship between DCPDA and certain indicators of public perception such as awareness, knowledge, attitude, and behaviour concerning advertised pharmaceutical substance. The findings revealed that exposure to pharmaceutical drug advertising increased respondent awareness, knowledge, attitude, and behaviour towards issues of their healthcare. They suggested that pharmaceutical companies with huge financial resources could engender a high purchase behaviour by maintaining high media visibility. This could translate into a high level of brand awareness, high perceived knowledge, and positive attitude, thereby reflecting in favourable purchase behaviour. © 2019, Malaysian Consumer and Family Economics Association.

AB  - This study expands uses and gratifications research into the area of political Instagram use. A survey shows the motives for following political leaders on the social media platform and how followers’ motives are associated with their demographics and political attitudes. Findings indicate that information/guidance motives are the most important for following political leaders on Instagram, with social utility being the next highest motive. Also, males use Instagram more for social utility purposes than females, and having an entertainment motive is related to being young. The results also provide insight into how the politically active can be more influential on Instagram. © 2019, SAGE Publications Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In studies on the sense of belonging among racialized minorities in Australia, the experiences of Indigenous people and African refugees have been discussed separately. However, because both groups encounter social exclusion due to their blackness, their shared experiences also need to be considered. In this study, I examine the intersections of experiences of blackness and their impacts on people's senses of belonging by using the findings of previous studies in addition to my ongoing fieldwork data on intergroup relationships between both groups. The present study shows that while some individuals of these groups experienced blackness as a deviation from the norm created in the mainstream media, other members reinterpreted or distanced themselves from blackness. Meanwhile, some members of each group found a commonality in blackness with the other group and established their own sense of belonging, stemming from a shared history of colonization, as well as a shared contemporary experience of subordination and exclusion. Awareness of these commonalities in their experiences caused the groups to feel that they were coexisting, rather than competing with each other as indicated by previous studies. The findings indicate a reconciliation of blackness between these two groups and the potential to form a new, shared self-identification as racial minorities in Australia as an alternative to that on the basis of whiteness and Britishness. © 2019, Common Ground Research Networks, Ritsuko Kurita.

AB  - Right-wing populism has a long tradition in Switzerland. Nevertheless, only little is known about how populist messages in the media contribute to the success of the Swiss People's Party (SVP) and to the acceptance of the party's anti-immigration policies. In this study, we combine data from a large media content analysis (including newspapers and TV news shows) with data from a panel-survey in order to address this research gap. Thereby we differentiate between effects driven by the content and the form of right-wing populist communication. While right-wing populist content depicts immigrants and the political elite as a threat to the Swiss people, populist style evokes the sense of a crisis by emotionalizing and dramatizing the message. Populist style is therefore assumed to increase the persuasiveness of populist claims. The results of this study suggest that this is the case only for some voters, while it backfires for others. © 2019, the authors.

AB  - While much of the scholarship on populist political communication focuses on its content and a verbal style, less is known about the nonverbal cues accompanying populist messages. This paper aims in filling that gap by providing findings of the study on characteristics of nonverbal communication of two Polish presidential candidates: Bronisław Komorowski and Andrzej Duda, traced during two debates broadcast on television before the second round of the presidential elections in 2015. The results revealed that both candidates employed nonverbal cues such as appearance, eye contact, facial expressions, or gestures that emphasized their references towards the people or negative attitudes towards elites expressed in their verbal messages. The study also proved that the methods used previously in research on nonverbal content on television (observational protocols and analysis of facial expressions) may be successfully employed in studies on nonverbal components of the populist style of communication. © 2019 Polish Communication Association.

AB  - The paper compares selected passages from Cicero and Aristotle whose common theme is the foundation of social and political relations. A specific concern for self-awareness and self-love can be traced in the strategies of both authors. Aristotle’s inquiry demonstrates how social and political ties are rooted in basic family relationships, especially in the positive attitude towards what is “one’s own”. Showing how the relationship with the other is constituted through the relationship with one’s own, Aristotle demonstrates the basic structural elements of the genesis of a political community based on civic friendship. Cicero presents the concept of self-love as a mediator for establishing mutual bonds within a political community. While Aristotle focuses primarily on the differentiation of the political space established by unique relationships within the family, Cicero is more concerned with the extension of family ties beyond the immediate family to larger communities. In his perspective, the attachment to self and kin is transformed into justice towards fellow citizens and from there, to love of all humanity. Unity with the rest of the human race is the most obvious innovation contained in the extension of civic friendship within the πόλις to goodwill towards all the people within the mundus communis. © 2019, KKS FLU AV CR.

AB  - This article examines migration-themed tweets issued by Polish MPs on the social media platform Twitter by presenting patterns in the narrative on migration as well as identifying determinants affecting politicians’ discourse. The study fills a gap in the literature on the way political leaders discuss migration on social media. The empirical investigation proves that Polish parliamentarians frame their migration tweets around three dominant topics: threat, humanitarian and/or financial aid, and opportunities. The discussion on migration is shaped by several factors: the complexity of the issue, mainly in the area of adopted legislative procedures and mechanisms for their implementation (the political factor), the public response (the social factor), and the public perception of mi-grants which, in turn, is influenced by existing prejudices and stereotypes (the psychological factor). The complexity of the above-mentioned factors results in direct implications, i.e. the emergence of difficulties affecting the decision-making process of a politician as well as the occurrence of specific reactions of the public to the discussion of the migration topic. In addition, they lead to indirect implications, i.e. the emergence of factors – challenges, threats, opportunities, and risks – that on one hand affect the politician’s rhetoric on migration, and on the other hand contribute to shaping public opinion as well as reinforcing or weakening social fears, anxieties, prejudice, and stereotypes. © 2019, Masaryk University Press.

AB  - Introduction: Secure parental attachment improves the perception of available social support and the socialization of emotion regulation strategies. Research has suggested that both perceived social support and emotion regulation help individuals reappraise stressful situations as less stressful. Individuals under stress are at an increased risk for psychological problems. Method: The current study examined whether social support, emotion regulation, and psychological inflexibility mediated the relation between parental attachment and psychological problems after a social exclusion task. Results: Results indicated that secure parental attachment was associated with an increased ability to up-regulate emotions and with an increase in the perception of available social support. Secure attachment to either parent was indirectly associated with psychological problems reported after social exclusion. Discussion: Indirect effects were found only for pathways from attachment through emotion regulation strategies, which suggests that emotion regulation may be a driving factor between attachment to parental figures and stress induced psychological problems. Further results, limitations, and implications were discussed. © 2019 Guilford Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rapidly developing tropical countries such as Viet Nam are experiencing a rapid demand for hydro-meteorological information services. Evaluation of end-users’ demands is one way to inform policy development for organizations such as the Viet Nam Meteorological and Hydrological Administration so that they can provide the most relevant and useful products and services to the diverse and evolving market. An initial interview survey was conducted across 18 provinces and cities in Viet Nam between October and November 2017 to elicit information that would improve understanding of end-users’ perception of the importance of hydro-meteorological information, the quality and utility of current products and services, and expectations for development of hydro-meteorological information over the near future. The results indicated that the contents of the bulletins or the speed of access on TV or the website of the National Center for Hydro-meteorological Forecasting) need to be improved to meet the needs of the wide range of users. Furthermore, the end-users will be happy to pay if information is accurate and timely. Experience from this initial survey will be used to expand the interview survey to the national scale, covering all 63 provinces and 5 centrally-controlled municipalities, and to increase the range of stakeholders’ participation. © 2019 International Association of Lowland Technology.

AB  - Background. Despite the research being accomplished so far, there is no clear answer to the question whether purchasing welfare is affected by the attitude of customer purchasing behavior. Objectives. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of purchasing welfare on consumer purchasing behavior and to assess the mediator role of attitudes in this regard. Methods. This was a descriptive-correlational study conducted using a survey method. The statistical population of the study consisted of all young consumers of sporting goods (15-30 years old) in Isfahan city. In this study, there were 23 free parameters in the proposed model. The sample size was considered for each free parameter of 15 people. Finally, 350 people were estimated. Purchasing welfare (Edley et al., 2013), attitudes (Lee and Trill, 2012) and consumer purchasing behavior (Edwards, 1998) were used as the instruments and their face and content validity and reliability were confirmed (0.75, 0.80, 0.81). Data were analyzed using Amos-22 software. Results. The research model had a favorable fit. Also, the mediator attitude was a partial relationship between purchasing welfareand purchase behavior (P < 0.05). Conclusion. Consumer welfare increased the behavior of consumer purchasing, but with the increasing consumer attitude in the relationship, the impact of purchasing prosperity on behavior increased. © Asian Exercise and Sport Science Association.

AB  - Social acceptance by people without disabilities has been identified as one of the prominent obstacles faced by people with disabilities (PWD) in their involvement in physical activity. To further apprehend this issue, the present study aims to examine the factors that influence public acceptance towards PWD involvement in physical activity. An exploratory model of public acceptance was developed using key antecedents identified from previous literature. Using convenience sampling technique, a total of 444 responses were collected from the public (without disabilities), who were exercising at four urban public recreation parks located in Klang Valley. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach was used to analyze the data collected. The findings revealed the importance of five prominent antecedents that were personality, attitudes, exposure, ethnicity and subjective norms in explaining public acceptance towards physical activity participation of the disabled. Subjective norms were identified as the most important factor in influencing public acceptance. Additionally, public attitude also depicted a mediating role in the relationship between exposure and public acceptance. A pertinent contribution of the study was the introduction of the extended model of public acceptance developed from integrated framework of theory of reasoned action (TRA), social learning theory, and big five model (BFM), which contributed better understanding of public acceptance towards disabled people. Further understanding of these factors towards PWD involvement in physical activity is essential to promote social inclusion in building a better community for the PWD. Implications of the result for future practices and directions of research are discussed. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press

AB  - The aim of this research was to explore gender differences in musical taste and the mediating role of functions of music between gender and musical taste. The research included 740 Croatian and Slovenian students. The results confirmed the existence of gender differences in both musical taste and functions of music. Females preferred the Reflective-Complex musical style, while males showed greater preferences towards Intense-Rebellious style of music. There was no significant gender difference in preferring Traditional and Contemporary Ethno or Energetic and Rhythmic musical style. With regard to the functions of music, there were no significant differences between males and females in identity/culture and background and focus/concentration functions of music. Males assessed political attitudes as a more important function of music than females, while females assessed all other functions of music higher than males did. A complete mediation effect of functions of music was established for gender and Reflective-Complex and Slo-Yugo Pop musical style. © 2019, Institute of Social Sciences Ivo Pilar.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intimate partner violence (IPV) prevention among adolescent patients with disability is needed, yet rarely discussed in the clinical setting. This study evaluated the feasibility of implementing a brief educational training based on an evidence-based IPV intervention in a pediatric spina bifida clinic. Frequency of IPV discussion was assessed through evaluation of patient feedback and provider surveys. METHODS: Adolescent patients with spina bifida aged 12-21 completed after visit surveys before (N= 13) and after the provider training (N= 21). Primary outcomes included frequency of provider discussion about IPV and receipt of patient safety cards. Chi-square tests compared patient feedback prior to and two months following the education session. Provider knowledge and attitude changes were assessed with pre-post surveys. RESULTS: More patients discussed IPV with providers following the education session compared to baseline (p= 0.03). Provider feedback, both immediately and at two months after the education session showed increased awareness of IPV, comfort with assessment, disclosure, and referral to resources. CONCLUSIONS: The educational intervention increased provider comfort with addressing IPV within a specialty clinical setting. The frequency of IPV communication significantly increased as compared to baseline, patients reported the discussions were beneficial, and providers reported greater comfort discussing IPV and referring patients to resources. © 2019-IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - Climate change is a problem that will require cooperation across different levels of government, society, community and individual action. For this reason, communicating about climate change represents a distinct challenge for marketers. This review paper proposes an ecological solution to this challenge. Using the ecological model to guide climate communication efforts could increase marketing effectiveness. This paper proposes a series of questions that marketers can use to create messages, and it shows how the ecological model incorporates the best practices from the climate communication and public health literature on behavior and attitude change. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The research highlights how media, cinema, political discourse or literature portrays Muslims and Islam in a negative light by dwelling on the crimes of only a few Muslims, which in turn creates a stereotype for the Muslims via comparative qualitative research methods. As a result, Orientalism and Islamophobia are rooted in the development of the American empire. In conclusion, the principal subject of discrimination in America today is the Muslims; therefore, it concludes that Islamophobia is the newest and ongoing form of racism in America. © 2019, Universidad del Zulia.

AB  - Background: Automated insulin delivery (AID) technology may reduce variability in blood glucose, resulting in lower risk for hypoglycemia and associated complications, and by extension improve quality of life. While clinical trials, research, and patient experience have consistently demonstrated the value of AID, this technology is still inaccessible to many patients. Patient-driven innovation has resulted in alternative do-it-yourself (DIY) solutions to available off-the-shelf AID devices. Method: This two-phase cross-sectional observational study addressed health care provider (HCP) perceptions of AID as well as the perceived need for, development of, and evaluation of an AID fact sheet comparing the most commonly used Federal Drug Administration approved AID and DIY AID devices. Results: Negative attitudes toward the use of DIY AID were low. The majority of HCPs saw their lack of knowledge about how DIY AID work to be the greatest barrier to answering patient questions about what is available (74.4%). Additionally, the majority of HCPs (64.5%) indicated they were either “likely” or “very likely” to use the fact sheet when answering patient questions about AID options. Conclusion: Increased awareness and utilization of AID technology offer hope to further reduce the burden of diabetes, but there is a need to bridge the knowledge gap about DIY AID. A fact sheet provides a way to facilitate discussions of this emerging technology between HCPs and patients. Next steps could investigate additional ways to put needed information in the hands of HCPs. © 2019 Diabetes Technology Society.

AB  - In September 2015, following the ratification of Istanbul Convention by Portugal, addressing someone with unwanted verbal “sexual proposals” became a criminal offence. This however, barely meets the requirements of the treaty and is far from what was first discussed about sexual harassment both in the Portuguese Parliament and more broadly in the media. When the criminalization of “piropo”—the Portuguese colloquial word for “catcalling”—was first proposed, it sparked heated opposition in online discussions, revealing strong prejudices against women and anti-feminist sentiments. Aiming to contribute to the understudied area of street harassment, this article maps the ways in which its legal developments were framed and counter-framed between August 2013 and September 2018, corresponding to the period before, during and after its adoption. Methodologically, we worked through the combination of quantitative and interpretative methods in order to understand gender politics in public policy making, through the study of news media texts and readers’ comments posted on Facebook. We argue that whereas feminist interpretations found their way into media texts, reader’s discussions expressed the popular misogyny that shaped the law reform. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Electromagnetic spectrum distribution prediction is the basis for the development of wireless communication technology. Due to the high randomness of the rough sea surface, it is difficult to accurately predict the offshore electromagnetic spectrum distribution. We present a prediction model of offshore electromagnetic spectrum distribution based on ray tracing method and Pierson-Moskowitz (PM) wave spectrum model. Based on the antenna attitude and the antenna directional pattern, the field strength calculation formulas of the electromagnetic wave sight line ray (SLR) propagation and the electromagnetic wave reflecting line ray (RLR) propagation off the sea surface are established. As the sea surface and the antenna attitude change, the effective rays from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna also change. This paper focus on the electromagnetic spectrum distribution prediction by calculating the effective angle (EA) of the transmitting antenna. We relate the EA to the antenna tilt angle and the antenna directional pattern, and combine the PM wave spectrum to establish the offshore electromagnetic spectrum distribution prediction models. Finally, we simulated the electromagnetic spectrum distribution prediction based on specific PM wave spectrum data. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The present academic literature hosts volumes of information on Muslim anti-Semitism, while Jewish anti-Islamism is hardly mentioned. With the aim of filling this scholarly gap, the article deals with contemporary Jewish anti-Islamism, principally focusing on Zionism's role in such anti-Islamism, by delving into the existing literature, news media, and online sources. Since the very birth of Zionism, Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims and, finally, Islam itself have primarily been seen as "obstacles" to Zionist goals. The "chosenness, " "promised lands, " and "messianism" doctrines at the core of Zionism have led to the antagonization of the aforementioned. There appears to be a blatant overlap between anti-Islamism and Jewish voices in the media, the entertainment sector, popular bookshops, foundations, academia, think-tanks and the virtual world. Finally, pro-Israel influences in the West have catalyzed negativity about Islam and Muslims and propagated wars through lobbying activities. Jewish anti-Islamism is real and needs further scholarly investigation. © Bursa Ilahiyat Foundation.

AB  - Social Network Sites (SNSs) play key role to raise individuals’ awareness in terms of political issues around the world. Young generation particularly university students utilize social networks for political activism and discussion. The present study investigates the effect of social network on political knowledge and attitude of Iranian university students. Mixed- method design was employed to collect quantitative data through a questionnaire followed by an emailed interview with Iranian media experts. The sample size in the study consisted of 382 Iranian students and 12 media experts. The findings of the current study showed that there is generally a direct and positive relation between the level of use of social networks and political knowledge, and attitude. Moreover, the results revealed that using social network sites have a significant positive effect on student’s level of political knowledge and political knowledge mediates the positive effect of social network use by Iranian university students on their political behavior. The results of interview corroborate that easy access to modern information sources has increased political knowledge of the students. The results also implied the necessity of deploying an intelligent filtering rather than indiscriminate blocking of the social network websites. © 2019, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Press.

AB  - Increasing migration is a vital concern for a globalizing sociocultural environment in today's world. The UK and developed European countries have become an attractive destination for asylum seekers (labelled as "migrants") in the past decade. The rapid rise in the number of asylum seekers, which was labelled "migration crisis" (Ruz, 2015), made this topic an integral part of scientific discussion on sociocultural environment. There are different factors underlying the perception of migrants by local population. The given study is devoted to the review of the usage of different linguistic means and its strategies by mass media whilst the escalation of refugee crisis in Great Britain as compared to Russia. We implement situational approach to the non-fiction factual texts, in particular, texts representing a concrete (actual) situation. Today due to the development of neural network technology we can easily define thematic structure of the text, specify the central lexis, the near peripheral lexis and the far peripheral lexis and reveal implicit information. The data of British National Corpus and Russian National Corpus is analyzed using text mining software-TextAnalyst 2.01. The relationships and patterns among key words and their associations are cluster-analyzed and contextual interpretation of semantic core is provided. Associative structures enable us to define the lexical experience of its speakers (White & Abrams, 2004) while the analysis of associative network helps to study public opinion on different social issues (File, Keczer, Vancso et al., 2018). The data for the text mine is gathered from the website Ruscorpora.ru (data set 1) and British National Corpus (data set 2). The thematic network depicts the structure of the text and the most pertinent information in the data. The semantic network constructs a list of topics and their semantic weights. It is a tree structure of the concepts of the text and identifies the relationships in the text. Just like in data set 1 public attitudes in data set 2 towards refugees and migrants are complex. Representation of migrants and hence public opinion are complicated by predisposition to favor those using legal means to enter a country with national culture, traditional customs, laws and ability to speak the language of the host country being the key factor in integrating migrants. © 2019, RALs.

AB  - Music is intimately implicated in racialising discourses. This is particularly pronounced in the case of so-called black music, i.e. the types of music that are commonly associated with African-American identity, most notably jazz and various forms of popular music. Genres of popular music are furthermore constructed continuously on the basis of a notion of their "black roots." The idea of the "black roots" of jazz and popular music is an essential ingredient of Paul Gilroy's (1993) analysis of a specific authenticity of blackness. To stress the history and consequences of the pre-twentieth century slave trade and institutionalised racism, Gilroy has coined the concept "Black Atlantic" that builds on the idea of a distinct double consciousness inherent in blackness as simultaneously a fundamental constituent and the ultimate other of the West. In the article, I aim at rethinking the notion of the Black Atlantic in relation to North-Eastern Europe. By way of marine analogy I ask, and building on the notions of the Black Pacific and the Black Mediterranean, how to formulate an analytical design "the Black Baltic Sea." In addition to addressing the impact of global racialising tendencies in music, this entails considering the cultural dynamics at issue in relation to the dynamics of postsocialism in the Baltic Sea Region (BSR) and Northern European indigeneity. On the basis of such a consideration, I argue that the styles of "black music" have been appropriated and adopted throughout the BSR, albeit in clearly different national manifestations which for their part imply variegated intersections between postcolonial and postsocialist processes. These intersections become manifest in the discourses over "new Europeanness" in music and the construction of national musical traditions, particularly when juxtaposed with the prevailing Islamophobia as regards treatments of Muslim music in mainstream media. © 2019 Antti-Ville Kärjä, published by De Gruyter Open.

AB  - Food and agricultural policy research is often challenged with the issue of commercializing the application of transgenic technology in food production. There is a need for an enhanced understanding of how risk and benefit information influence the general attitudes of farmers towards genetically modified (GM) technology. This paper contributes to existing literature by studying the various adoption factors that influence Ghanaian farmers' attitudes toward GM crop technology by using risk perception as a mediating tool. An empirical choice of methodology which is structural equation analysis was incorporated in this study. We report that, after conducting a survey among 325 respondents, Ghanaian farmers' negative attitudes toward GM technology is as a result of the influence of risk perception on the attributes of the innovative technology (relative advantage, trialability, mass media, and interpersonal relations). We employ a conceptual framework that incorporates Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT) and Risk analysis to assess the relationships between the attributes and attitudes towards GM technology. It was revealed in the structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis that, risk perception exerts a significant influence on the effects of the attributes of GM technology adoption thus reflecting a negative attitude towards the adoption of the related technology. We further discussed the implications for emphasizing the need for a positive attitude toward the acceptance and adoption of GM technology in Ghana. © 2019 the Author(s).

AB  - We examined the influence of locus of control on the relationship between social exclusion and preference for distinctive choices. Participants were 212 undergraduate students at a university in Central China, who completed measures of social exclusion, locus of control, choice, and perceived uniqueness. Results showed that participants who believed that the environment controlled their fate (external locus of control) preferred more distinctive choices in a social exclusion context than in a social inclusion context, whereas participants who believed that they could control the environment (internal locus of control) preferred less distinctive choices. Further, perceived uniqueness mediated the effect of social exclusion and locus of control on choice. These results add to the literature on social exclusion and personal control. © 2019 Scientific Journal Publishers Limited. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This qualitative case study utilized critical media literacy to guide the analysis of the depiction of racially and ethnically diverse college students in contemporary popular films. Participants in this study were racially and ethnically diverse undergraduate students enrolled at a private, predominantly White institution in the United States. Three primary themes emerged from this study. First, students of color were more apt to recognize stereotypical portrayals of people of color in the films, whereas White students' responses were more attuned with color-blind racial ideology (CBRI). Second, media-centered discussions provided an outlet for students of color to share their personal experiences with racism, stereotyping, and prejudice. In doing so, students of color seek to build the cultural competence of peers who may hold CBRI beliefs. Finally, this study presents a need for critical media literacy. Regardless of race and/or ethnicity, the undergraduates who participated in our study communicated an importance of examining media messages, such as stereotypes of people of color, from a critical perspective. For college and university administrators, such as chief diversity officers, this study is significant in presenting a means for engaging students, faculty, and other stakeholders in dialogue about racial issues in the hopes of fostering a more welcoming campus racial climate for students of color. © 2019 National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education.

AB  - Muhammad Ali's name is one of the most significant yet understudied aspects of the great boxer's extraordinary life. Throughout his career, journalists used Ali's birth name (Cassius Clay) and his Islamic name (Muhammad Ali) to transmit their attitudes toward him. This study interrogates trends in newspaper usage of Ali's two names during the 1960s and 1970s as a way to understand changing public attitudes toward him during this period. It does so via a distant reading of 37,911 digitized newspaper articles obtained from ProQuest Historical Newspapers. By quantitatively visualizing trends and patterns in the usage of the two names, this study reveals that American journalists did not embrace Ali's chosen name until 1971. Acceptance of the name in the press was not gradual but was instead characterized by intense shifts at key points in Ali's career. Finally, this paper addresses the value of digital history-specifically, distant reading-for sport history scholars. © 2019 North American Society for Sport History. All rights reserved.

AB  - —This research aims to complement existing research to be completed as well as study people’s media exposure and attitudes toward media of green spaces. It also aims to explore people’s behavior and improve methods of communication to be more efficient and provide a guideline for content creation to match target audience needs and levels of awareness about environmental problems. Lastly, the results of the study should benefit communicators in planning media for urban green spaces in the future. This quantitative research was conducted by a survey distributed to 400 adults who live in Bangkok. The results show that the samples had a positive attitude towards going to a park to exercise to get healthy rather than improve their body image. It also shows that media can encourage engagement with green spaces as well as share their experience through online media and television because these clearly portray benefits of green spaces which in turn motivates concern about the environment.

AB  - In recent times, people from all walks of life have started to realize the consequences of negative attitude towards the environment, while engaging in the production and consumption business. In addition to the manufacturing sector, the IT sector inactively contributes to global warming and ill health. Global warming is a stark reality and ‘going green’ is the attitudinal shift everybody wishes to encourage and follow. As the concept of green behaviour percolate across the society, organizations and industries realize the need to encourage pro-environmental behaviour among its employees. To sustain initiatives, involvement of the employees is crucial. Next to farming and manufacturing, Information Technology (IT) is the major sector in India, providing employment to 3.7 million people. In spite of green behaviour gaining importance among the employees, there is hardly any specific tool to measure the same. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to give an account of the rationale and the process of developing a reliable and valid scale, to assess Employee Green Behaviour (EGB) among Indian IT professionals. Literature reviews suggest a lack of psychological assessment on EGB, specific to IT professionals in the Indian context. This necessitated the need to develop a new EGB scale for IT professionals. The major contribution of this research paper is the development of a standardised tool to assess EGB as the need to develop a valid and reliable tool suitable for a particular setting is of high demand these days. This article explains the processes involved in tool development like defining the construct, generating item, assessing content adequacy, followed by establishing the reliability and validity of the scale and finally developing the norms. © 2019, Research Trend.

AB  - In an effort to create enriched language learning environments, language teachers, program and course developers, and publishing companies have long sought novel ideas and alternatives. Thus, a wide range of information and communications technologies, which have manifested themselves in the form of virtual learning environments, web-based platforms, or mobile-assisted applications, have been embraced in the field. With the introduction of new means and platforms for delivering instruction outside the classroom, blended learning, combining e-learning and conventional classroom methods as well as providing room for student control over the learning process, has gained popularity as a promising option. In this case study, which focuses on a group of second-year English language students at a School of Foreign Languages, the goal was to investigate students’ attitudes towards blended learning with reference to six learning aspects: learning-flexibility, online-learning, study-management, technology-use, classroom-learning, and online-interaction (Tang & Chaw, 2013). Students’ responses to the attitude questionnaire were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis as well as internal consistency tests among subscales. A subsequent focus group meeting was held with a group of 15 students to attain qualitative data on their views and attitudes towards blended learning with respect to their experiences and expectations. High-achievers had a tendency to hold positive attitudes towards all learning aspects while low-achievers required more face-to-face in-class time, interaction and study management support, pointing to possible links among such variables as language proficiency, learner autonomy and attitudes towards blended learning and highlighting how critical student characteristics and attitudes could prove in the implementation process. © 2019 JLLS and the Authors - Published by JLLS.

AB  - Beliefs about the nature of social groups may motivate people to exclude members of minority groups from their conviviality. This process is analyzed in this article by proposing an explanatory model for the social exclusion of people suffering from mental disorders wherein beliefs about the nature of mental disorder, the perception of threat and prejudice contribute to social exclusion. Two studies (Study 1, N = 254; Study 2, N = 236) were conducted with university students who answered the following questions about beliefs and prejudices regarding mental disorders, perceived threat and social exclusion. Regression analyses have shown that exclusion is motivated by prejudice, whose impact is mediated by perceived threat. The results also indicated that prejudice is anchored in participants' beliefs on the nature of mental disorders, especially those with a religious basis. © 2019 Universidade de Sao Paulo 1.

AB  - Background: Participants for efficacy studies on Internet-based interventions (IBI) are recruited through self-selected convenience sampling or targeted external invitations. Comparisons are necessary to determine how recruitment strategies influence sample composition. Such comparisons consequently yield potential for evaluating which conditions are more probable to fulfill IBI's promise to be an effective treatment option for underserved populations. Methods: A comparison of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of differently recruited participants in an IBI for mild to moderate depression was made: (1) individuals on sick leave due to an affective disorder who were informed about the IBI by their health insurance (n= 308) and (2) individuals who self-selected to participate (e.g., after seeing information on the IBI in print media; n= 699). Results: Compared to the self-selected group, the externally selected group was older, less educated, spent less time on the Internet, had a less positive attitude towards IBI, and comprised more men. Groups did not differ in initial symptom severity, in-treatment symptom change, or previous psychotherapeutic experiences. Conclusions: The results indicate that larger shares of underserved subpopulations (e.g., less educated, older, male, less internet-savvy) begin an IBI treatment when the insurer informs them about the IBI. Recruitment source does not influence efficacy. © 2019 © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.

AB  - In the paper, particularities of social and political activity of the Russian youth are analyzed. The development of the Internet-technologies promotes the emergence of new social virtual environments influencing the Russian young people's social and political activity. As the empirical basis of the research, the authors' sociological survey was used. According to the research results, a generally positive attitude to the social and political segment of the Russian society is stated. The basis for the young people's developing the motivation for getting engaged in public affairs is composed by their interest in politics and their confidence in the possibility to influence the political events. When evaluating the activism of the youth, one can note a clearly expressed passive stance associated with incredulity toward Russia's political segment. The materials of the paper are of interest for professionals dealing with problems of sociology of the young. © 2019 revistaESPACIOS.com.

AB  - Background and Objective. Breast cancer is a major cause of mortality among women if not treated in early stages. Recognizing molecular markers from DCE-MRI directly to distinguish the four molecular subtypes without invasive biopsy is helpful for guiding treatment plans for breast cancer, which provides a fast way to consequential treatment plan decision in early time and best opportunity for patients. Methods. This study presents an approach of molecular subtypes recognition from breast cancer image phenotypes by radiomics. An improved region growth algorithm with dynamic threshold without user interaction is proposed for cancer lesion segmentation, which gives the precise border of lesion other than area with background. The lesions are extracted automatically based on radiologists' annotation which guarantees the lesion is segmented correctly. Various features are extracted on lesions data including texture, morphology, dynamic kinetics, and statistics features carried out on a large patient cohort, which are used to validate the relationship between image phenotypes and the molecular subtypes. A new algorithm of multimodel-based recursive feature elimination is applied on the radiomics data generated by the feature extraction process. This method obtains the feature subset with stable performance for different classification models, and the gradient boosting decision tree model gets the best results of both classification performance and imbalance performance on molecular subtypes. Result. From the experimental results, 69 optimal features from 143 original features are found by the multimodel-based recursive feature elimination algorithms and the gradient boosting decision tree classifier obtains a good performance with accuracy 0.87, precise 0.88, recall 0.87, and F1-score 0.87. The dataset with 637 patients in this paper has serious imbalance problem on different molecular subtypes, and the the robust features that are generated by multimodel-based recursive feature eliminiation algorithm make the gradient boosting decision tree classifier have good behaviors. The recognition precision for the four molecular subtypes of luminal A, luminal B, HER-2, and basal-like are 0.91, 0.89, 0.83, and 0.87, respectively. Conclusions. The improved lesion segmentation method gives more precise lesion edge, which not only saves the time of automatic extraction of lesion region of interest without threshold setting for each case, but also prevents the segmentation error by manual and prejudice from different radiologists. The feature selection algorithm of multimodel-based recursive feature elimination has the ability to find robust and optimal features that distinguish the four molecular subtypes from image phenotypes. The gradient boosting decision tree classifier rather plays a main role in recognition than other models used in this paper. © 2019 Wei Li et al.

AB  - Background: HIV-related stigma among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) is the foremost barrier to HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support. The aim of this study was to identify the perceived stigma level of PLWHA and its relation with selected demographic and situational factors in Pokhara, Nepal. Methods: Cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among 282 PLWHA after probability sampling from antiretroviral treatment center of Western Regional Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal. Face-to-face interview was taken by using Bunn standard HSS tool. Stigma was measured in terms of felt stigma (public attitude concern [PAC], disclosure concern [DC], negative self-image [NSI]), enacted stigma [ES], as well as overall stigma. Result: The mean score of PAC, DC, NSI, ES, and overall stigma was 3.09, 3.02, 2.79, 1.66, and 2.52, respectively, where mean score of all domains of felt stigma (PAC, DC, and NSI) was >2.5, thus reflecting a higher level of felt stigma. ANOVA and t-test revealed higher level of overall stigma among younger age group (P<0.001), highly educated group (P=0.007), unmarried group (P<0.001), and recently HIV-diagnosed group (P=0.003). Conclusion: The study suggests high level of felt stigma, which has devastating effects on PLWHA as well as leads to nondisclosure of sero-positive status. So considering the significant impact of felt stigma on control of HIV epidemic, it is important to have a broader comprehension of this phenomenon and its repercussions on PLWHA via timely intervention like better educational intervention and counseling to PLWHA, wide-scale societal awareness campaigns, and more focused local interventions. © 2019 Subedi et al.

AB  - Benjamin Percy's novel Red Moon (2013) navigates the problem of the 'monster' in the context of post-9/11 representations of Islamist terrorism. Structured around a series of terrorist atrocities carried out by lycan extremists, Percy's novel employs the werewolf as a figure of monstrous otherness in order to deconstruct the very processes of othering by which the monster is produced culturally and politically. Focusing on the distorted ethical justifications of the terrorists and on the roles of political opportunism and media manipulation in shaping US responses, the narrative allows both lycan terrorists and their political antagonists to emerge as more clown than monster. This article draws upon Hannah Arendt's account of the banality of evil, and its development by more recent privation theorists, to situate Red Moon within contemporary popular and theoretical discourses of evil and to read the novel as an interrogation of the processes by which our modern political 'monsters' are created. © 2019 Simon Marsden.

AB  - The US reality television show The Bachelorette is one of the most successful productions in its genre. It only recently featured its first African American lead, a long-expected departure from the show’s dominantly white cast. By analysing how the show discusses race, this article sheds light on how reality television sensationalizes racism. Racism in reality television is not, as the production wants to make viewers believe, the result of individual cases of prejudice, but a problem of those responsible in the control room and, arguably, of those tuning in. © Canadian Review of American Studies

AB  - To date, the effect of intercultural contact on racial prejudice toward the out-group has been, for the most part, examined and studied by way of face-to-face encounters but the effect has seldom been investigated in a computer-mediated interaction. The objective of this research, therefore, is to look into the effect of intercultural contact on the level of prejudice among intercultural partners in both face-to-face and computer-mediated communication (CMC) environment from the perspective of the Intergroup Contact Theory. One hundred participants were involved in the time series experiment and they were randomly assigned to intra-cultural versus intercultural conditions in the two-channel conditions namely face-to-face and CMC. Participants were required to interact in pairs with their ‘zero history’ partners. Parallel to the premise of the theory, for the face-to-face group, the overall level of prejudice among the intercultural communicative partners was significantly lower as compared to those in the intra-cultural group. However, the effect of intercultural contact in the CMC group failed to yield significant findings despite the decreasing trend of the level of prejudice over the four-week period among the intercultural partners. The study provides greater insight into the issue of intercultural integration in Malaysia. With much intercultural interaction and collaboration conducted online nowadays, the study provides preliminary evidences on its effectiveness in reducing perceptual prejudice. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press

AB  - BACKGROUND Primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus accounts for 0.1%-0.2% of all esophageal malignancies, including melanotic and amelanotic melanomas. Primary amelanotic malignant melanoma of the esophagus is extremely rare, and only about 20 cases have been published in the literature to date. Most primary malignant melanomas of the esophagus are diagnosed following development of metastatic lesions and thus have a very poor prognosis. The median survival duration of patients with metastatic melanoma has been reported to be 6.2 mo. CASE SUMMARY A 49-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a diagnosis of esophageal cancer. Endoscopy, biopsy, imaging evaluation, and physical examination at our hospital indicated a diagnosis of advanced primary amelanotic malignant melanoma of the esophagus. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed melanoma. Nuclear medicine examination revealed a left iliac bone metastatic lesion. After discharge, the patient self-administered apatinib for 3 mo, followed by oral treatment with Chinese medicines (also self-administered) for 2 mo. No treatments had been taken since then. The patient has survived with no growth out to the most recent follow-up (24 mo post diagnosis), and she always presented with a positive attitude about her condition during this period. CONCLUSION Survival following metastatic melanoma might be related to the pharmaceutical and Chinese medicine treatment and the patient's positive attitude. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - In 2016, the Special Region of Yogyakarta ranked 9th as the province with the highest number of people suffering from HIV/AIDS, especially in the Sleman District. Globally, AIDS is the second leading cause of death in adolescents aged 10-19 years. This study to aimed out factors affecting the behavior of adolescents toward HIV/AIDS prevention. This study used a cross-sectional study design. The sampling technique used was stratified random sampling that resulted in 59 respondents from 11th-grade students at Sleman 2 Senior High School who were selected as samples. Data were collected using a questionnaire and analyzed using Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression. The results showed that most respondents 66.1% had sufficient knowledge. More than a half (54.2%) of students showed supportive attitude. Information was mostly obtained from electronic media. Thirty-one students (52.5%) showed a positive attitude toward HIV/AIDS prevention. Chi-square test result showed that factors significantly related to adolescent's behavior toward HIV/AIDS prevention were knowledge and attitude. The most influential variable was attitude (p-value = 0.008; PR = 4.4; 95% CI = 1.4-13.1). Copyright © 2019, Kesmas: National Public Health Journal.

AB  - The last two decades have seen the development of a body of literature in evolutionary psychology that seeks to attribute negative attitudes to ethnic and racial minorities and other outgroups to an evolved behavioral immune system (BIS). It hypothesizes that disgust sensitivity, which evolved as protection against pathogen threats, also triggers reactions to cues that are not viscerally disgusting, such as people with unfamiliar features, and thus can explain prejudice toward members of these groups. Such an explanation seems to limit the influence of education, public policy, and rhetoric on those attitudes. Our conceptual analysis shows that this is not the case. Existing hypotheses about why the BIS would be triggered even in the absence of visceral disgust elicitors suggest that general unfamiliarity or atypicality act as cues for this hypersensitive threat detection system. This implies that the impact of the BIS must depend on the cultural and societal context in which people learn not only what is disgusting but also what is typical. The social context of personal interaction with mass media representation of and political debate about immigrants consequently needs to be considered as a decisive factor for any effect of the BIS on attitudes and behavior toward ethnic and racial outgroups. The BIS is therefore not a separate or even superordinate explanation of prejudice, compared to those coming from the social sciences. We conclude that it can offer valuable insights into processes of stigmatization and prejudice, once the role of social learning in the developmental unfolding and activation of psychological mechanisms is taken seriously. © 2019 Kusche and Barker.

AB  - Growing nectar- and pollen-rich flowering plant varieties in domestic gardens and other greenspace is an important pro-environmental behaviour that supports pollinating insects. Wildlife gardening is popular in the UK; however, public attitudes and behaviour relating to planting for pollinators are currently not well understood. We investigated these through questionnaires and interviews with customers in five garden centres in Sussex, southeast England, a relevant and useful consumer group representing horticulturally-engaged members of the public. Garden centre customers had strongly positive attitudes and were motivated to plant for bees and other pollinators: most (77%) grew pollinator-friendly varieties, while 64% would be more likely to buy a plant with a pollinator-friendly logo. Personal motivation to support pollinators was linked to a recent increase in personal and public awareness of their declines through (often negativistic) information from mass media sources. Practical implications of these findings in relation to the horticultural retail industry are discussed. Copyright 2019 Wignall et al.

AB  - Orientation: Compliance culture within the South African local government context is perceived to be critical to sustainable municipality service delivery. Improving compliance culture is therefore important. Research purpose: This article therefore developed a compliance framework based on deterrence theory (DT) and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to identify human behavioural factors to be considered in the development and use of work procedures as a way to improve workers’ compliance with work procedures. Motivation for the study: Reports (e.g. Auditor General reports) on municipality service delivery fall short of providing a clear assessment and study of work and human behavioural dynamics in relation to compliance with work procedures. Research approach/design and method: This article tested a conceptual model focused on the effect of deterrence initiatives on workplace compliance as mediated by the theory-planned behaviour. Data were collected from 119 workers in two municipalities of the Eastern Cape Province in South Africa through a structured questionnaire and analysed using structural equation model. Main findings: Findings show that a positive attitude towards compliance to work procedures cannot be achieved through intimidation; reinforcement has a positive effect on attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control (PBC). However, only the PBC aspect of the TPB explains significant mediation between deterrence and compliance. Practical/managerial implications: The study demonstrates how compliance culture can be engendered by non-intimidating deterrent measures and PBC. Contributions/value-add: The negative effect of intimidation on compliance culture and the positive effect of PBC on compliance attitude of workers are critical contributions. © 2019. The Authors.

AB  - The objectives of this investigation were to determine general background of farmers, their existing rice seed production condition, their perception of rice seed production standard, and constraints on farmers’ rice seed production. The sample of 66 selected rice farmers in Thamai Sub-District, Chumsaeng District, Nakhon Sawan Province was estimated using the formula developed by Arkin (1974) through multistage sampling technique. Data was obtained by interview schedule under close observation and in-depth discussion with key persons in the research site. The results revealed that average age of respondent was 48.09 years. Average year of rice seed cultivation experience was 4.36 years. The average size of owned land for seed cultivation was 3.36 hectares. Total seed cultivation land, accounting for 74.88%, was farmers’ owned land that they inherited from their parents. These can reduce the risk in farming because it is their own land. The results of assessment of farmers’ perception indicated that most of respondents had the required knowledge in seed production standard. They could answer correctly questions regarding rice seed production technology. Most of them had positive attitude toward the proposed standard practice. Nearly 60% of the respondents followed the right production practices. Farmers’ characteristics factors affecting seed yield were number of extension contact, farm media perception, and participation in community intervention program, respectively. The constraints in rice seed production improvement were high cost of inputs, high cost of fertilizer, low rice price, and climate variability, respectively. © 2019, Tarbiat Modares University.

AB  - This study examines how employees’ messages about a corporate crisis affect external publics’ attitudes and behaviors toward an organization. Specifically, the study investigates whether the valence (positive vs. negative) and communication channels (face-to-face vs. social media) of employees’ messages interact with each other. The results of an online experiment indicate that negative messages concerning an organizational crisis significantly affect publics’ perception of message credibility, behavioral forgiveness, and message retransmission intentions when the messages were delivered during face-to-face communication, while negative messages on social media do not significantly affect publics’ attitudes and behaviors. Positive messages had almost equal impacts on the outcomes, regardless of the communication channels through which the message was shared. Theoretical and practical implications for corporate and business communication are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Background: New therapies that could modify the disease course of Huntington's disease (HD) are entering clinical trials. However, conceptions about clinical research from the HD community are unknown. This knowledge could help inform patient-clinician discussions surrounding clinical trial participation. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess clinical trial attitudes and understanding in the HD community. Methods: We developed a survey incorporating two measures of trial understanding and attitudes and the impact of therapeutic route of administration on hypothetical trial participation. The survey was distributed via emails, flyers, and social media through HD-related organizations. Results: There were 73 responses. Individuals self-reported as clinically diagnosed with HD, gene positive but asymptomatic, or primary caregivers. Respondents viewed clinical trials positively and generally viewed trials as safe. Individuals with prior HD-related research experience were less likely to have negative expectations about trials than those without research experience (p=0.002), and women had higher information needs than men (p=0.001). Individuals with HD were more likely than the other groups to experience therapeutic misconception (p=0.002). All respondents were able to appraise risks and benefits of research but exhibited optimism about trial outcomes. Willingness to participate was highest when the route of administration was minimally invasive. Conclusions: While the HD community views clinical trials positively, patients with HD are at high risk for therapeutic misconception and all groups are optimistic about trial outcomes. Limitations of this study include a small sample that may be inclined to view research positively given past trial participation and interest in participating in HD surveys. However, the findings from this study can be used to strengthen informed consent during HD clinical trial recruitment. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - MohjaKahf (b. 1967) is a Syrian-American poet whose poetry is characterized by its cultural opposition to any American stereotyping of Muslims and Islam in general and Arab-Muslim Americans in specific. The American mainstream culture has its own misconceptions about Arab-Muslims which result in a wave of Islamophobia and anti-Arab hate throughforming a stereotype of the Arab-Muslim people as ignorant terrorists. This paper examines the struggle between Kahf’s Islamic concepts and the concepts of the American culture in which she lives.Being a hybrid Arab-Muslim American, Kahf is fully aware of both cultures and understands both languages which qualify her to play the role of a compromiser to bring the opponents into terms. The paper affirms that Kahf, through celebrating her Islamic identity, undertakes the task of a mediator between Islamic cultural customs and the modern American culture. © 2019, Universidad del Zulia.

AB  - Violating one of the criteria of a good argumentative discourse leads to fallacious conclusions that consequently violate the truth of any proposition. The current study aims at proving the fallacies of Islamophobia that are known as the fear and hatred of Islam and Muslims and reflected on a number of headlines in UK press. As long as press and media are considered the only and the most reliable source of information for people round the world, some of UK press media have a fundamental role in presenting a negative image of Islam and Muslims to the world. Language recently appears to be like weapons in the hand of journalists in order to attack Islam and Muslims starting a war of words towards them. The researchers follow Damer T.E. (2009) as their model to analyze the data by diagnosing the lexical signals that prove fallacy in these headlines. It is found that journalist have no good premises to convince people and prove their linguistic war to Islam and Muslims as being a source of danger and terrorism. They violate the criteria of their argumentative discourse by using false evidence which leads to false conclusion. Finally, it is recommended that the religion of Islam holds a message of love and peace that what is linguistically proved throughout the present study. © 2019, Universidad del Zulia.

AB  - Introduction. The aim of this study was to evaluate usage habits, attitudes and perceptions towards mobile learning (m-learning), as well as to identify variables related to those attitudes amongst undergraduate dental students. Materials and Methods. The study consists of 81 dental undergraduate students who who volunteered to participate. The data collection tool consists of an m-learning attitude scale, a questionnaire, and open-ended questions. To compare the total scores and factors of m-learning attitude scale for demographic information and mobile technology usage habits of the students; the Mann-Whitney U test was used for two independent groups such as gender, presence of electronic devices, and places of Internet usage. The Kruskal-Wallis test was also used to compare the total scores and factors of m-learning attitude scale for more than two independent groups including internet usage purposes and opinions. Spearman's correlation coefficient was performed, and linear regression analysis was used to predict the change in total score according to the purposes of Internet usage. Results. The majority of students thought that the use of mobile devices in dentistry courses was useful and their attitudes towards m-learning were high. The students generally use the Internet for online shopping, connecting to social networks, and communication. They tend to use mobile technologies for personal use, followed by educational purposes. There were significant differences found in the m-learning attitudes for gender, having a portable power supply and use of mobile devices in dentistry courses. Communication was found significant in predicting the change in total score for the m-learning attitude scale according to the purpose of Internet usage. Conclusion. Dental students have generally positive attitudes towards m-learning. Students raise awareness towards the promise of m-learning in order to apply their individual technology use and learning behaviours. Designing learning materials and applications for mobile devices may increase students' performances. Copyright © 2019 Suner et al.

AB  - Objectives: To examine public’s knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes toward bipolar disorder (BP) in Saudi Arabia (SA). Methods: A cross-sectional survey was performed in 2016 in Riyadh, SA. The survey included sociodemographic characteristics and BP awareness scale. Results: Of 416 participants, 49.5%had prior knowledge of BP, mainly from internet and social media, and 57% considered it to be common in SA. About half believed BP is caused by a neurophysiological or neurochemical imbalance and that it can be treated with psychiatric medications. Supernatural causes, weak faith, and weakness of character were considered causes of BP by 55%, 48%, and 40% of participants, respectively. Recreational activities and head bandaging by traditional therapists were considered viable treatment options by 55%and 41%of participants, respectively. Students and healthcare professionals scored significantly higher on awareness scale. Regarding attitude, a majority believed that persons with BP can work effectively (86%), have to pull themselves together to get over it (47%), and consider it a shame to mention that someone in a family is affected by BP (32%). Regarding relationships, 22%were not willing to maintain a friendship and 39.3% were not willing to marry someone with BP. Conclusions: This study revealed suboptimal public awareness towards BP in SA. It identified several misconceptions and negative attitudes toward patients with BP. Further studies are needed to investigate potential public interventions to improve literacy of BP. © 2019 Alosaimi et al.

AB  - Since prehistoric times, cetaceans have been important food sources, but they also have been seen as monsters of the sea, a perception that did not change much during the past centuries. Due to a better understanding of their biology in recent years, the public perception towards cetaceans has been evolving. Various studies have been developed aiming to evaluate the attitude and perception of humans towards cetaceans, but these have been local and focused on specific target groups. Our study aimed to evaluate the attitude of the public towards cetaceans on a wide scale by using an international online questionnaire distributed exclusively on social media. An attitudinal scale proposed by Kellert (1985) on a Likert scale matrix was used with nine statements referring to dolphins and nine referring to whales. Even though specific constraints occur from such types of research (e.g., mostly highly educated and young respondents from developed countries), 5,222 responses were collected from 107 countries in total. While Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania were well represented, the number of answers from Africa and Asia were limited. Our results revealed a shift in the public attitude towards cetaceans, with the majority of people exhibiting a positive attitude following the global trend of a rising appreciation for wild-life. Whaling nations and ex-whaling nations that have continued that practice until recently exhibited a more negative attitude towards cetaceans, revealing the importance of culture, heritage, and memory in shaping attitudes. Finally, we discuss our findings under the light of the culture and history of different countries. © 2019 European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

AB  - Climate change is widely discussed with frequent conversations and discussions on the twitter handle #climatechange. Tweets are related to awareness of climate change among general public and active engagement of public in mitigating the climate change risk. The study focused on how relevant the discussions are related to climate change and its impact and type of engagement of public on twitter. Tweets are analysed using sentiment analysis that highlighted various sentiments related to climate change, frequency analysis on key word meta data and finally topic modelling using Laten Dirichlet Allocation used to identify the abstract topics and their relation to climate change topic. The study concludes that the awareness and engagement related to climate change are relevant, but still need further active engagement and increased awareness. © 2019, World Research Association.

AB  - Background: Electronic cigarettes are increasing in popularity, and they are easily accessible in a variety of locations. Despite increasing its popularity, little is known about its overall health effects. Physicians have rated the most trustful source of information about it and play also a role in disseminating information about it. Thus, this study identified the difference in knowledge and beliefs about electronic cigarettes between health care providers and the general population in Egypt. Methods: A cross-sectional study using the self-administered questionnaire in the Arabic language was conducted between December 2018 and March 2019 in the Chest Department in Ain Shams University Hospital in Egypt. Study population (n=610) was divided into health care providers (n=260) and general population (n=350). Result: A total of 593 respondents participated in this study and returned filled questionnaire with total response rate=97.2%, only 8.8% of all participates were smokers, none of the study population reported using electronic cigarettes, despite that, 79.3% of the participants have heard of electronic cigarettes, media advertisements were the main source of getting to know it and there was a statistically significant difference between both groups regarding most beliefs and attitudes toward electronic cigarettes. Conclusion: There was high awareness about electronic cigarettes in Egypt and more negative attitude about it among health care providers than the general population, but still educational programs and guidelines for health care providers are needed to raise more the awareness which will aid in counseling general population appropriately. © 2019 Dwedar et al.

AB  - This research project aims to assess how information and communication technologies (ICTs) are a tool for the social integration of disadvantaged groups. To that end, we studied a group of young people in social exclusion from the Initial Professional Qualification Programs of the Federico Ozanam Foundation in Zaragoza (Spain); we focused on the relationship between their level of digital literacy and their feeling of integration in the main social group. We evaluated their social capacities, their life skills as defined by the World Health Organization, their relational and informative habits and their feeling of empowerment in digital contexts. The goal was to find out if the relationship between these factors and their feeling of integration was directly proportional. The results were positive for most of the indicatives studied. © 2019, Fundacao UNI Botucatu/UNESP. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research has documented an overlap between people's aversion toward nonsocial pattern deviancy (e.g., a row of triangles with 1 triangle out of line) and their social prejudice. It is unknown which processes underlie this association, however, and whether this link is causal. We propose that pattern deviancy aversion may contribute to prejudice by heightening people's dislike of statistical minorities. Infrequent people in a population are pattern deviant in that they disrupt the statistical regularities of how people tend to look, think, and act in society, and this deviancy should incite others' prejudice. Nine studies (N = 1,821) supported this mediation. In Studies 1.1 and 1.2, adults' and young children's nonsocial pattern deviancy aversion related to disliking novel statistical minorities, and this dislike predicted prejudice against Black people. Studies 1.3 and 1.4 observed this mediation when experimentally manipulating pattern deviancy aversion, although pattern deviancy aversion did not directly impact racial prejudice. Study-set 2 replicated the proposed mediation in terms of prejudice against other commonly stigmatized individuals (e.g., someone with a physical disability). Importantly, we also found pattern deviancy aversion to affect such prejudice. Study-set 3 provided additional support for the mediation model. Pattern deviancy aversion predicted prejudice dependent on group-size, for instance, greater racial prejudice in cases where Black people are the statistical minority, but decreased racial prejudice when Black people are the statistical majority. Taken together, these findings indicate that people's aversion toward pattern deviancy motivates prejudice, and that this influence is partially driven by a dislike of statistical minorities. © 2019 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Seventy-five percent of children aged 12–23 months in Malawi have received all eight basic vaccinations—still leaving many children at risk. The Malawi Expanded Program on Immunization comprehensive Multi-Year Plan 2016–2020 reveals several challenges impeding immunization and disease surveillance efforts, such as the fact that non-governmental health organizations (NGHOs) and communities are minimally included in the planning, implementation, and monitoring of these activities. This article examines the extent to which NGHOs are promoting the use of social mobilization (SM) and community mobilizers (CMs) for sharing health information related to the eradication of polio, the importance of routine immunization, and the control of measles and neonatal tetanus. Data collection involved document analysis and interviews with 11 organizations in Malawi whose work contributes to the eradication of polio and control of measles and neonatal tetanus. Content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data, whereas descriptive statistics were used to analyze the quantitative data. Non-governmental health organizations use a variety of approaches for SM, including mass media campaigns (radio and printed booklets), local skits and dramas, and home visits. Most NGHOs use training workshops and opinion leaders to impart knowledge and skills to CMs on immunization to eradicate polio and to control measles and neonatal tetanus. Major challenges faced by the NGHOs include negative attitudes toward campaigns and demotivation of CMs due to lack of financial incentives. The article concludes with a discussion of approaches to strengthen SM and the role of CMs by NGHOs. Copyright © 2019 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene

AB  - Introduction. As a result of the revolutionary events and the military conflict in Donbas in 2014, the number of inbound tourists travelling to Ukraine has dropped almost twice - from 24.7 million in 2013 to 12.7 million in 2014. Ukraine has faced a challenge related to the need for reorienting and diversifying of inbound tourism flows and the need to enter new tourism markets. One of the top priorities is the outbound Canadian tourism market. Ukrainian Diaspora, long-standing strong international ties, visa-free entry for Canadian citizens and ratification of the Free Trade Agreement, intense diplomatic relations and the launch of direct flight create the basis for the growth of tourist flows from Canada to Ukraine. It is necessary to conduct professional and thorough research of the Canadian outbound tourism market in order to increase tourist flows, as well as the revenues to the Ukrainian economy from the tourism industry in the context of creating and promoting targeted Ukrainian tourism products for a Canadian tourist. Purpose. The purpose of this paper is to examine the Canadian travel market in the context of the target audience consuming the Ukrainian tourism product and to define the recommendations for the «Canada-Ukraine» tourism flow. Results. The article analyses the outbound tourism market of Canada as a priority target audience of consumers of the Ukrainian tourism product. The factors of the huge volume of the outbound tourism market of Canada have been presented. The state and growth rates of existing Canada-Ukraine tourist flows have been analysed. The competitive advantages of the Canadian tourism market in comparison with the Ukrainian one have been given, namely: safety, protection of natural resources and ecology, institutional capacity of tourism industry development. The favourable factors for increasing the inflow of tourist flow from Canada to Ukraine, such as numerous Ukrainian Diaspora, positive attitude of Canadians towards Ukraine, visa-free entry for the Canadian citizens to Ukraine; intensification of diplomatic and trade relations, the launch of the direct flight Kyiv-Toronto, have been defined and characterised. The peculiarities of a potential Canadian tourist, who is a representative of the Ukrainian Diaspora, have been analysed. The main channels of popularisation of the Ukrainian tourism product have been researched: the organisation of the Ukrainian community of Canada, the Ukrainian media in Canada. The main tourism exhibitions in Canada, fan trips and press tours for the Canadian tour operators and the Canadian media; hosting the «Days of Ukraine in Canada» in the main places where most of the Ukrainian Diaspora representatives live. Conclusions. Recommendations for tourist travel agencies who plan to work with the Canadian consumer of the Ukrainian tourism product have been formulated. The resort and recreational types of tourism should not be the basis of Ukrainian tourist products for the Canadians because of their non-competitiveness in comparison with Canadian tourist products. A trip to Ukraine will be more in demand if tourism products combine Ukrainian and European tourist products («Ukraine +»). This may be a joint tourism product with neighbouring countries: Ukraine + Poland, Ukraine + Hungary, Ukraine + Romania, Ukraine + Slovakia. When forming a combined tourism product, it is necessary to take into account the availability of convenient logistics (direct flights ideally) and Canadian tourist traffic to the chosen European country/city. © 2019 Institute of Society Transformation.

This research indicates that contemplation of function of linguistic taboos should be considered as of utmost importance for identifying the social implications of linguistic taboo. Through this research study, linguistic taboos, social taboos and religious taboos are identified that restrict the social progress of Saudi Arabia. To integrate Saudi Arabia with progressive globalized world, this research study suggested that it is important for explain these taboos for minimalizing prejudices. It is identified in this research that religions are one of the critical aspects in Saudi cultural and religion activities. Therefore, this research study successfully describes different taboos that stem from different cultural opinions. In addition to this, this research study also emphasizes on changing point of view of people that all restrictions are derived from religious faith and teachings. This research study advances the existing knowledge base through identifying Saudi media and Saudi government as responsible for striving and promoting cultural values and beliefs, educating people and modifying their culture beliefs. In addition, as a country, Saudi Arabia must educate people about sexually transmitted diseases and sexual problems because of this global problem rather than being censored because they do not recognize it. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

AB  - Recent research highlights the significant role of political ideological identities in America’s increasing political polarisation. In line with social identity theory, self-placement as a US liberal or conservative predicts favouritism toward the ideological in-group and negative attitudes and behaviours toward the outgroup. The theory also holds that the link between self-categorisation and behaviour is mediated by the content of that identity, by what an individual believes it means to be a member of that group. Although previous research has done much to analyse the differences between US liberals and conservatives on various a priori dimensions, little work has been aimed at gaining a holistic account of ideological identity content from the individual’s lay perspective. Through qualitative analysis of 40 interviews (20 liberals and 20 conservatives), this study identifies central themes in the meaning self-identified US liberals and conservatives attribute to these labels and finds evidence for asymmetrical constructions of these identities. The liberal participant group’s identity construction revolved around identification as, and concern for, individuals, supported by reference to personal values and political issues and underpinned by a motivation to move toward a more equal society. Conversely, the conservative participant group connected the understanding of their identity directly to the political ideology of the nation through a thread of self-reliance and reverence for the national group. Implications for political behaviour and the study of ideological identity are discussed. © 2019, PsychOpen. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nineteen of Disney's animated feature films were randomly selected to be viewed and coded using the Moral Media Messages (MMM) scale. The scale includes ten moral messages: six positive messages and four negative messages. Paired observers were used for coding and reliability was confirmed. Based on previous research regarding prosocial and negative behaviors, it was hypothesized that Disney characters before 1990 would have a higher negative moral count than characters in after 1990 Disney films. Furthermore, the researchers proposed other hypotheses including differences among more negative and positive morals according to gender and SES. An additional hypothesis included that characters who are considered the protagonist would show more positive morals, whereas the antagonist would show more negative morals. The following results were obtained in the study: negative messages deception/ego and dissing/prejudice scores were significantly higher in films after 1990 than before. Upon examining genders, males were significantly higher in "threatening" messages than females. However, females were found to be significantly higher in "forgiving" messages than males. The following messages were found significant when looking at the character's SES: perspective taking, nurture/affection, "kindness," deception/ego, and dissing/prejudice. When examining the roles as a function of the ten messages, the following were found significant: perspective taking, "apology," "forgiveness," nurture/affection, "kindness," "anger," deception/ego, dissing/prejudice, and "threats." Future research will address some of the limitations mentioned in the discussion. © 2019 Common Ground, Kaitlyn Iseminger, Björn Bergström, Robert Benefield, All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Background: Virtual reality (VR) has several applications in the medical domain and also generates a secure environment to carry out activities. Evaluation of the effectiveness of VR among older populations revealed positive effects of VR as a tool to reduce risks of falls and also improve the social and emotional well-being of older adults. The decline in physical and mental health, the loss of functional capabilities, and a weakening of social ties represent obstacles towards active aging among older adults and indicate a need for support. Existing research focused on the effects of VR among older populations, and its uses and benefits. Our study investigated the acceptance and use of VR by the elderly. Methods: This pilot study was conducted on 30 older adults who voluntarily participated during March to May 2018. Nine VR applications that promote physical activities, motivate users, and provide entertainment were chosen for this study. Participants were asked to use any one of the applications of their choice for 15 min twice a week for 6 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks, participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model and a literature review, to evaluate their acceptance of VR technology. Cronbach's alpha reliability analysis was used to test the internal consistency of the questionnaire items. Pearson's product moment correlation was used to examine the validity of the questionnaire. A linear regression and mediation analysis were utilized to identify relationships among the variables of the questionnaire. Results: In total, six male and 24 female participants aged 60~95 years volunteered to participate in the study. Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social norms, and perceived enjoyment were seen to have had significant effects on the intention to use VR. Participants agreed to a large extent regarding the perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, and their experience of using VR. Thus, VR was seen to have high acceptance among this elderly population. Conclusions: Older people have positive perceptions towards accepting and using VR to support active aging. They perceived VR to be useful, easy to use, and an enjoyable experience, implying positive attitudes toward adopting this new technology. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to global health and antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are useful to limit the momentum of AMR. This study was intended to determine the attitudes of clinicians about AMR, ASP strategies, and their readiness to participate in ASPs. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among clinicians working in teaching hospitals of Punjab between August and November 2018. A multistage sampling method was used. Descriptive statistics and Kruskal-Wallis tests were employed for data analysis. Results: A response rate of 77.9% (670 ⁄ 859) was achieved. Most of the physicians (n = 302, 71.7%) compared to surgeons (n = 134, 70.9%) and anesthetists (n = 25, 41.7%) considered AMR as a serious health problem in Pakistani hospitals (p < 0.001). Clinicians were agreed that hospital audit and feedback (n = 434, 64.8%), restriction of certain antibiotics (n = 424, 63.3%), readily accessible microbiological data (n = 453, 67.6%), and regular educational sessions (n = 496, 74.0%) are imperative approaches to implement ASPs. Median ASP and AMR scores were significantly associated with age, experience, and types of clinicians (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Despite poor previous knowledge of ASPs, all clinicians showed a positive attitude towards hospital ASPs. Several approaches suggested by clinicians will be helpful to implement hospital ASPs in Pakistan. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Vaccination is the administration of a vaccine to help the immune system develop protection from a disease. It is the most cost-effective mechanism for disease prevention that allows people to have better protection from specific bacteria and viruses. Objective: The goal of the research is to determine mothers’ knowledge, attitudes and practices towards child immunization. Methods: In the framework of a cross-sectional study, 188 mothers with children from three to five years of age, were surveyed in 7 kindergartens of Tbilisi (capital city of Georgia). The semi-structured questionnaire was administered in a face-to-face manner. Results: The majority of interviewed mothers (97%) showed a positive attitude towards immunization and believe that vaccination plays an important role in disease prevention. 32% do not have sufficient information about the routine vaccination schedule and subsequently, 36% of children have incomplete vaccination. The reasons for incomplete vaccination are: a lack of knowledge about a routine vaccination schedule (25.5%), limited information about the necessity of the second or the third dose of vaccination (18.6%), fear of post-vaccination side effects (16%) and fear of a child illness (9.6%). A significant association was found between mothers’ education, practice and attitude regarding immunization. Health institutions (49.5%) and internet sources (21.3%) were the most popular sources of information about immunization. Conclusion: Incomplete immunization is related to mother’s lack of information about the immunization schedules, limited awareness about the second and the third dose of vaccination, and it is also related to fear of child getting sick after the vaccination. Some respondents believe that vaccination is not safe and can cause serious side effects. But the majority of mothers have a positive attitude towards child immunization, but their levels of awareness are very low and they do not have comprehensive information about a routine vaccination schedule. It is necessary to raise public awareness of the importance of immunization by implementing educational programs and by traditional and social media. © 2019 Verulava et al.

AB  - Background: While the neuropeptide oxytocin can facilitate empathy and altruistic behavior, it may also promote self-serving tendencies in some contexts, and it remains unclear if it would increase altruistic or self-interest behaviors when they compete within a social situation. Methods: The current between-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled fMRI study investigated the effect of intranasal oxytocin on empathy for social exclusion using a modified online ball-tossing game that incorporated monetary rewards and the potential to display both altruistic and self-interest behaviors. Results: Results showed that when subjects in both oxytocin and placebo groups were observing a player being excluded (victim) by other players in the game, there was activation in the mentalizing network. When subjects then played both with the victim and the players who had excluded them, they threw more balls to the victim player, indicative of an altruistic response. However, subjects in the oxytocin group threw more balls to the excluder players indicative of greater self-interest, since the latter would be perceived as more likely to reciprocate to maximize financial gain. This behavioral effect of oxytocin was associated with greater medial orbitofrontal cortex activation when playing with the excluders and negatively correlated with trait-altruism scores. Conclusions: Overall, our findings suggest that in the context of competing motivations for exhibiting altruistic or selfinterest behavior, oxytocin enhanced self-interest and this was associated with greater activation in frontal reward areas. © 2019 Oxford University Press.

AB  - This study investigated cross-sex best friendships in the experience and expression of jealousy within romantic relationships. Survey data (N = 346) revealed engaged-to-be-married individuals, compared to single, dating and married individuals, have the most negative attitudes regarding cross-sex best friendships. Results further indicated preventive jealousy experience is a predictor of rival-focused jealousy expression, and reactive jealousy experience is a predictor of both constructive and destructive jealousy expressions. Findings also suggest attitudes toward cross-sex best friendships can mediate the relationship between how jealousy is experienced and expressed in relation to reactive jealousy experience and destructive jealousy expression. Implications are discussed regarding how cross-sex best friendships can adversely affect romantic relationships. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with intravitreous tamponade of gas or air has been widely used for a series of vitreoretinal diseases. It is estimated that 100,000 patients per year undergo PPV globally, and half of them were subsequently tamponaded with gas or air. According to Boyle’s law (P1V1=P2V2), patients with an intravitreous remnant of gas or air will be under high risk of intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation and subsequent vision loss owing to the expanded intravitreous gas or air when traveling post operation to a place with a significantly higher altitude. We always explain to patients why postoperative travel is potentially risky. Emergency cases of elevated IOP caused by postoperative traveling would sometimes come to surgeons. However, there have been few disease education or reference tools for both the surgeons and patients to have better communication. Objective: The aim of this study was to introduce and evaluate a mobile phone app developed by surgeons (the authors) for preliminary risk estimation of volume expansion and IOP elevation in patients with intravitreous gas or air when traveling to a place of higher altitude. Methods: The app was developed on the iOS and Android operating systems. Boyle’s law (P1V1=P2V2) was the theoretical basis of the app. Intravitreous gas or air volume and altitude values were independent factors to deduce the risk report. Consecutive patients underwent vitrectomy, and those with an intravitreous remnant of gas or air were recruited. The surgeons judged the vertical height of the fluid/gas interface through the dilated pupil; the patients were instructed to judge it according to their visual field when looking straight ahead and line it out on a chart included in the app. Finally, all the patients were required to fill a Likert scale-based questionnaire with 2 main items to evaluate the participants’ user experience and attitudes toward the app. Results: A total of 50 patients were included (30 males and 20 females). All patients could independently operate the app to complete the test. The median heights of the fluid/gas interface independently judged by the surgeon and patients were 40% (range: 10%-75%) and 41% (range: 9%-78%), respectively (P=.63). The median altitude of the participants’ destinations was 150.0 m (range: 0-3490 m). The Bland-Altman analysis revealed a good agreement between the surgeons’ and patients’ judgments (bias of -0.3%), with 95% limits of agreement of -5.8% to 5.3%. Overall, the Likert scale revealed a positive attitude from the patients toward the app. Conclusions: The app is reliable for patients to have preliminary risk estimation of intravitreous gas or air volume expansion and IOP elevation if travel to a place of higher altitude is planned. The surgeons could also use it as a platform for better disease communication. © Zhaotian Zhang, Fei Li, Haochuan Zhang, Zhipeng Miao, Yantao Wei, Li Wang, Shaochong Zhang.

AB  - Background: The general attitude of HIV-positive surgical patients toward research has not been described, and it is uncertain whether interventions aimed at improving general attitudes toward research are required in this group. The aim of this pilot survey was to address the aforementioned paucity in the literature. Methods: This was a prospective survey of 39 HIV-positive surgical patients. The 7-item Research Attitudes Questionnaire (RAQ) and a demographic characteristics questionnaire were administered to each study participant. Likert responses for the RAQ were converted into numeric values, and cumulative research attitude scores were computed for each study participant. A descriptive analysis of study participant responses to the RAQ was performed. Statistical associations between demographic characteristics and cumulative research attitude scores were also assessed. Results: Depending on the RAQ item, between 74.3% and 95.9% of study participants responded positively toward research. Negative responses ranged between 0.0% and 10.3%, while neutral responses to RAQ items ranged between 2.6% and 23.1%. Female study participants had lower median research attitudes scores when compared with their male counterparts (p = 0.014). Conclusion: In general, study participants expressed a positive attitude toward research. The proportion of neutral responses for some RAQ items suggests there are certain aspects of research which require clarification to prospective research participants. Efforts should be made to improve female HIV-positive surgical patients’ overall attitude toward research. © 2019 South African Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a major burden to individuals, impacting their physical, mental and social wellbeing. While PU prevention is traditionally regarded as a nursing issue, an interprofessional approach has been promoted as best practice. However, little is known about current practice or the knowledge and attitudes of the wider interprofessional team (IPT). Purpose: Pre-designed questionnaires were used to explore knowledge and attitudes with healthcare staff in the community. Methods: Questionnaireswere disseminated to all healthcare staff within a community healthcare Trust predominantly via an online tool. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: The median values of all professional groups demonstrated satisfactory attitudes (>75%) and levels of knowledge (>60%) to PU prevention. However, there were differences within and between groups. Management staff demonstrated the most positive attitude to PU prevention (89%), followed by occupational therapists (OTs) and healthcare assistants (HCAs) (87%, IQR: 75%→89%). OTs demonstrated the highest scores for knowledge (69%, IQR: 62%→73%), while healthcare and rehabilitation assistants scored the lowest (58%, IQR: 58%-64%). Conclusion: This study has demonstrated that themajority of healthcare staff in aUKcommunity setting have satisfactory levels of knowledge and attitudes in relation to PU prevention overall. Nevertheless, there were some differences between groups, albeit non-significant. There were also differences between sub-themes of the questionnaires, indicating a greater focus of pressure ulcer treatment over prevention. While PU prevention is widely regarded to be a nursing issue, these findings provide some indication of the potential for an interprofessional approach. © 2019 Clarkson et al.

AB  - This article surveys the critical history of scholarship on Philippa Chaucer, the wife of the famous English poet. Beginning with the late Victorian work of Frederick Furnivall and ending with contemporary biographies of Geoffrey Chaucer, this article argues that male critics have constructed their depictions of Philippa Chaucer with little reference to historical fact. Instead, male critics have formed an intellectual community with one another (and with the medieval poet) by the act of denigrating Philippa, with an appeal to a supposedly universal knowledge about disagreeable women and their effect on men of genius. From harpy to harlot to cold careerist, Philippa Chaucer's life and relationship with her husband have proved flexible media for male critics to manipulate. The biographical evaluations published over the last century therefore have much to reveal about the intellectual priorities and gender prejudices of her husband's critics. © 2019 Penn State University Press.

AB  - Psychological intimate partner violence (IPV) is the most prevalent form of IPV and is often thought to precede physical IPV. However, psychological IPV often occurs independently of other forms of IPV, and it can often emerge during routine relationship interactions. Using data from imprisoned male offenders we investigate the effect of hostile and benevolent sexist attitudes on psychological IPV and the hypothesized mediating role of positive attitudes toward IPV and this effect when accounting for broader risk factors at the levels of community (social disorder), family-of-origin (conflictive climate in family of origin), and personality (antisocial personality traits) variables. The sample involved 196 male inmates of the Penitentiary Center of Villabona (Asturias, Spain). Structural equation models result showed significant total, direct and indirect effect of hostile sexism on psychological IPV, but not of benevolent sexism. When individual, family-of-origin, and community variables were considered, however, hostile sexism showed only an indirect effect on psychological IPV via positive attitudes toward abuse. These results are discussed in light of the debate of the role of sexist attitudes in the psychological IPV explanation when broader models are considered. © 2019 Colegio Oficial de Psicólogos de Madrid.

AB  - The foundational faith of disability law is the proposition that we can reduce disability discrimination if we can foster interactions between disabled and nondisabled people. This central faith, which is rooted in contact theory, has encouraged integration of people with and without disabilities, with the expectation that contact will reduce prejudicial attitudes and shift societal norms. However, neither the scholarship nor disability law sufficiently accounts for what this Article calls the “aesthetics of disability,” the proposition that our interaction with disability is mediated by an affective process that inclines us to like, dislike, be attracted to, or be repulsed by others on the basis of their appearance. The aesthetics literature introduces a significant complication to uncritical reliance on contact as the theoretical and remedial basis for our inclusive ideal. Contact and engagement with the aesthetics of disability may fail to provide the benefits assumed by contact theory, but more perversely, under certain conditions, they may trigger negative affective responses that may stunt the very normative change sought through antidiscrimination law. This Article proposes a novel theoretical lens to more accurately reflect the complexity of the aesthetic–affective process of discriminatory behavior in the context of disability. © 2019, Columbia Law Review Association.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Mental illness was one of the major health problems in modern society. The purpose of this study was to investigate knowledge, social distance, and attitude toward mental illness in university students, determine correlation among these variables, and analyze their effects on the attitude toward them mental illness. It intended to identify the factors for the attitude toward mental illness and provide basic data that could help develop research and programs to form positive attitude toward them. Method/Statistical Analysis: Participants were 482 university students in G metropolitan city. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS/win 23.0 program. The general characteristics of the subjects were frequency, percentage, mean and standard deviation. Data were analyzed with independent t-test, ANOVA and Pearson’s correlation coefficients and multiple regression analysis. Findings: The participants were aged 21.89 ± 3.20 on average, 72.7% were female. The most frequent major was public health 48.1%, followed by science and engineering 37.1%, humanities 10.7%, and art 42.0 %. The most frequent channel of getting information about mental illness was media 41.5%, followed by voluntary service 26.8%, practical training 10.6%, someone around them 10.6%, education 6.4%, a mental illness person 4.1%.The level of knowledge was 10.52 ± 2.04, the minimum value was 0.00, and the maximum value was 15.00. Social distance was 2.61 ± 0.56, the minimum value was 1.00, and the maximum value was 4.67. Attitude toward mental illness was 3.59 ± 0.35, the minimum value was 2.88, and the maximum value was 4.70. The mean score of knowledge was 10.52 out of 15.00, social distance was2.61out of 5.00 and attitude toward mental illness was 3.59 out of 5.00.Attitude toward mental illness was positively correlated with knowledge (r=.212, p<.001) and was negatively correlated with social distance (r=-.603, p<.001). The more knowledgeable and shorter the social distance was the more positive attitudes toward mental illness. The stepwise regression analysis found that knowledge (β=.195, p<.001), social distance (β=-.590, p<.001), and having a mental illness person around (β=.075, p=.039), significantly affected the attitude toward mental illness, with the variables accounting for 40.5%. Improvements/Applications: It has confirmed that correct knowledge and decrease in social distance are factors for positive attitude toward mental illness in the respect of research. Further studies are necessary to develop an effective educational and experiential program that can help get knowledge and reduce social distance. © 2019, World Informations Syndicate.

AB  - "Augmented reality" (AR) is presented as technology that harmonizes, in real time and with user collaboration, digital information with physical information through different technological supports. Such are AR possibilities, that when it is incorporated into teaching, students show high satisfaction rates and positive attitudes for its use, but at the same time, a series of limitations and obstacles can be noticed. As an attempt to investigate the technical, curricular and organizational difficulties of AR incorporation in training contexts, an instrument "AR obstacle questionnaire" (CORA) was designed, which in turn was administered to a total of 264 subject experts for validation through the Delphi method, subsequently applying the "K coefficient" (K = 1/2 Kc (knowledge coefficient) + Ka (argumentation coefficient)), selecting those experts who obtained a ≥ 0,8 score in the coefficient. Among the results obtained in the study we manage to point out the main obstacles involving AR implementation into university education: the lack of teacher training and improvement, the few educational experiences found, lack of conceptual foundation, limited educational research and lack of institutional support. © 2019, University of Alicante.

AB  - Increased health risks and obesity resulting from soft drink consumption have received considerable attention worldwide. The purpose of this empirical study was to explore the antecedents of soft drink anticonsumption behavior in China using structural equation modeling techniques by analysis of moment structures (AMOS). Soft drink anticonsumers think that these drinks are unhealthy, and consumer attitude and behavioral intention towards anticonsumption behavior were found to be significant. Individual and sociocultural factors were also positively associated with anticonsumption of soft drinks in China. Future studies could examine gender differences in anticonsumption behavior. A large sample size would be more reflective in other contexts. Regarding health and obesity-reduction concerns, this study provides useful implications for marketers and policymakers. Soft drink marketers can integrate obesity-reduction efforts through social marketing. This study has put forward a conceptual framework for soft drink anticonsumption behavior focusing on health concerns and the effect of sociocultural factors on anticonsumption. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The ethnic and cultural diversity of today's society demands an intercultural education that promotes equal opportunities and the inclusion of minority groups at risk of social exclusion. Various policies and governmental strategies are directed at favoring social inclusion and reducing situations of discrimination and exclusion. One of said ethnic minorities is the Roma community. This article talks about measures for reversing the high rates of absenteeism, dropout, and school failure. The aim of this systematic review in the educational context is to analyze programs and interventions that have been made to promote the educational inclusion of Roma students. Three databases were used-Scopus, Web of Science, and Eric-to examine 419 articles. After a selection, based on an inclusion criterion, which follows the guidelines given by the Declaration of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA), 17 articles were chosen for the analysis. The main findings shed light on data for programs and interventions developed mostly within the school setting and for students of elementary and secondary education, however, there are also interventions that are developed in the community and extracurricular context. The works are centralized in valuing the cultural diversity of the Roma people with the Roma students but not just exclusive to them. Highlighted is the implementation of teacher assistants and/or intercultural mediators from the Roma community to be role models or references for the students, and family education participation is considered common practice. Such characteristics in educational interventions contribute to an inclusive education in an intercultural and sustainable manner. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The progressive development of mass communication has allowed the understanding and management of the persuasion process in a more systematic way. However, nowadays, persuasive campaigns still hardly result in behavior changes, particularly around concerns of the promotion of more sustainable lifestyles. Thus, it appears essential to investigate which dimensions are more effective in influencing people's pro-environmental actions. Relying on the conceptual frameworks provided by the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) and the model of goal-directed behavior (MGB), a questionnaire study (n = 380 urban residents) was carried out on the psycho-social antecedents of the intention to use sustainable means of transport. Structural equation modeling showed the mediating role of attitudes toward sustainable transport between ELM persuasion features (i.e., source reliability and argument reliability) and behavioral intention. Positive and negative anticipated emotions, derived from MGB, predict source reliability (the former) and argument reliability (the latter), respectively. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Prepregnancy health care is vital to alleviate and prevent maternal and neonatal disability and death. Objective: The purpose of the study was to measure the levels of knowledge and attitude on preconception care and their determinants among women who delivered at government hospitals in a rural setting in southern Ethiopia. Method: A facility-based cross sectional study was done from January 01 to February 30, 2017 on a sample of 370 women who delivered at government hospitals in Wolayita zone. The mothers were selected using systematic random sampling technique. The data were collected using structured and pretested interviewer administered questionnaires at the postnatal ward of each hospital. Data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariable techniques. Results: The result showed that 53% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 47.8%, 58.1%) of mothers who delivered at public hospitals had adequate level of knowledge on preconception care, whereas 54.3% (95% CI: 49.2%, 59.5%) possessed positive attitude to preconception care. Mothers who have radio, planned pregnancy and have participated in community meetings related to preconception care had a meaningfully higher odds of good level of knowledge to preconception care. Ordinal regression showed that women who own mobile phone had at least three times significantly higher odds of positive attitude to preconception care, whereas women who have participated community meetings had lower odds of positive attitude on preconception care. Conclusion: The results revealed that the levels of mothers’ knowledge and positive attitude on preconception care are low relative to other studies. Using transistor radio and mobile phone have significant effect in improving the knowledge and attitude of reproductive age women on preconception care. Hence, providing community health education based on radio and/or mobile phone messaging could be useful in positively influencing the knowledge and attitude of women on preconception care. © 2019, Ubiquity Press.

AB  - Social dominance orientation (SDO) and stereotypes about out-groups can influence social distance significantly. We tested the effects of these 2 factors on social distance and a probable mediation effect of upper class stereotype with participants from lower class groups of Chinese people in 3 studies (N = 105 in Study 1; N = 102 in Study 2; N = 112 in Study 3). The results in Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that higher SDO and a more positive stereotype elicited less social distance between lower class and upper class members. In Study 3, the mediation effect of stereotype was also significant. These results provide insight into the mechanism of the perceived social distance between social classes, which is meaningful for social harmony in China. © 2019 Scientific Journal Publishers Limited.

AB  - The use of ICT in the teaching and learning process is one of the most discussed topics in education for the past twenty years. It has, particularly, put education in Chinese Independent High Schools (CIHS) in Malaysia into a more challenging place due to their distinctions that revolve around self-funding, medium of instruction and syllabus. Past studies have indicated that most teachers had positive attitudes towards ICT integration in education. However, there are also some barriers that have prevented them from fully utilizing ICT in schools. This study focuses on investigating teachers' perceptions and challenges faced while using ICT based online learning in the process of teaching and learning. A total of 180 questionnaires were randomly distributed to CIHS English teachers in West Malaysia. The questionnaire was adapted from Qasem & Viswanathappa (2016) and Salehi & Salehi (2012). A pilot study was also done to ensure the reliability and validity of the instruments. Besides using descriptive analysis, t-Test and One-Way ANOVA were also used to analyse the data. About two-third of the respondents in this study had the awareness towards the use of technology in education and perceived positively towards ICT in the teaching and learning process. The major challenges faced while using ICT included unstable internet connection, lack of training, lack of support from the school, lack of time. In order to ensure a more successful implementation of ICT in education, appropriate training on the usage of ICT in teaching should be provided. Apart from this, adequate ICT resources must be made available for teachers. This study might be significant to the educators, researchers and school managements to help develop useful guidelines to assist the teachers in overcoming the challenges of using ICT in teaching and learning. © 2019, Research in World Economy.

AB  - In the last 10 years, emotional intelligence (EI) has become a current issue of research in psychology, and there are indicators to consider that EI should be analyzed to help the coach to behave effectively during competitions. According to Boardley's (2018) revised model of coaching efficacy, coaches' EI is predictive of their efficacy beliefs, which, in turn, is predictive of coaching behavior. However, little is known about the mediating effects of coaching efficacy dimensions on the relationships between coach's EI and reactive behaviors in competitive settings. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine mediating effects of coaching efficacy dimensions on the relationship between EI and coaches' reactive behaviors during a game using a multimethod approach. Participants were 258 coaches of youth football players aged 9 to 17 years old. Observations in situ using Coaching Behavior Assessment System (CBAS) were carried on 258 football games during two seasons. At the end of each game, coaches completed the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS) and the Coaching Efficacy Scale (CES). Structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses revealed that motivation efficacy and character building mediated the relationship between regulation of emotion and positive and negative coaches' reactions during game. Specifically, motivation efficacy mediated the association between regulation of emotion and positive coaches' reactions, and the relationship between regulation of emotion and negative coaches' reactions were mediated by motivation efficacy and character building. In addition, coaching level moderated the relationships between EI, self-efficacy and coaches' reactive behaviors. Findings of the present study showed that coaching efficacy dimensions (i.e., motivation efficacy and character building) that have the capacity to influence their confidence in ability to affect the psychological mood and positive attitude of athletes, transfer the effects of EI (i.e., regulation of emotion) on coaches' verbal reactions during a youth soccer game. Specifically, a coach who feels competent to regulate their own emotions would perceive high beliefs of efficacy to motivate and to build character of their athletes, and this insight has an impact on their positive verbal reactions in response to athletes' performances. © 2019 Teques, Duarte and Viana.

AB  - Over the past twenty years there has been a need to explore the process of achieving the goals of sports sponsorship, which is widely accepted in academic circles as well as in practice as an effective marketing communications tool. Mass communication through traditional media is replaced by a much more credible form of communication. Sponsorship can be seen as a B2B relationship that provides benefits for both parties. Previous literature suggests that greater brand exposure by consumers, as well as congruence between the sponsor and the sponsored, makes it easier to identify the sponsor. Loyalty is a form of psychological relationship with a brand, a sports team, or a manifestation that results in a positive attitude and behavior towards that subject. True loyalty exists when a consumer regularly purchases the products of that brand and has positive associations on the brand and its products. In the event of manifestations, a loyal customer can be defined as the one who regularly watch the event, either live or via the media. So, the assumption is that fans who are dedicated to the team have a higher level of knowledge about the event and its environment, and therefore also about the sponsors of their favorite club, which will be the research topic of this paper. © 2019 Montenegrin Sports Academy.

AB  - Our theoretical framework was designed to explain customers' decision-making process for (adopting/using?) environmentally responsible products in an eco-friendly coffee shop. We employed theory of planned behavior (TPB) and value-attitude-belief (VAB) to test their parallel mediating effect on attitudes toward environmental behavior (ATEB), perceived marketplace influence (PMI), and overall image (OI) as well as the moderating effect of switching cost (SC) on pro-environmental behavioral intentions. Data were collected through a survey of 527 customers who frequently visited a coffee shop in Korea, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the research hypotheses. The findings generally supported the hypothesized associations of the study variables within our proposed theoretical framework (ATEB, PMI, and OI of the parallel mediating effect on pro-environmental behavioral intentions) and confirmed SC's moderating effect. In addition, the study's results have important 1) theoretical and 2) practical implications for the environment. 1) This study confirmed the relationship between mediating variables on PCBI and the parallel mediating effect on PCBI as demonstrated in previous studies. 2) Furthermore, these findings might lead coffee shops to voluntarily put an end to the use of disposable products such as plastic cups or straws, which carry great environmental risk. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In this paper qualitative approach was utilized to interview 11 Syrian adolescent refugees, 9 parents and 2 teachers in Malaysia. In-depth interviews were conducted to explore the participants' coping strategies with war experiences and the difficulties they face in Malaysia. The results showed participants used religious beliefs and spiritual coping, cognitive strategies such as developing positive attitudes, acceptance coping, and use of hope as coping strategies. Social support, socialization and social media were among the most significant external resources for coping strategies. Activities and enhancement of self-skills are the most important factors for personal coping with disasters and war trauma. © 2019, Universidad del Zulia. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous studies have found that "disgust-sensitive" individuals have negative attitudes toward gay and lesbian people, but the underlying mechanisms for such attitudes remain unclear. Based on moral foundations theory, the current paper assumes that the relationship between disgust sensitivity and attitudes toward homosexuality are mediated by moral foundations. In order to test this assumption, the current authors examined the questionnaire answers from a total of 452 Chinese undergraduates who participated in this study. The results showed that disgust sensitivity was positively correlated with negative attitudes toward homosexuality, and positively correlated with moral concerns in five domains (care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and sanctity). Authority and sanctity were both associated with attitudes toward homosexuality, while only sanctity mediated the relationship between disgust sensitivity and attitudes toward homosexuality. Overall, the results suggest that considering moral foundations (especially sanctity) may lend more insight to the associations between disgust sensitivity and negative attitudes toward gay and lesbian people. © 2019 Wang, Yang, Huang, Sai and Gong.

AB  - Background. Blue light glasses have been introduced as a possible new treatment option to treat sleep disturbances in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Assessing patient attitudes represents a key step in the road towards formal testing and introduction into clinical practice. Specifically, we aimed to assess how patients experience the use of blue light glasses, aiming to optimise compliance in upcoming clinical trials where these glasses will be tested for efficacy. Methods. We invited 58 PD patients who had used the blue light glasses for at least one week on a daily basis to complete an online survey about their experiences and self-reported impact. For this purpose, the System Usability Scale was used, supplemented with additional questions about (side)effects. A total of 31 patients (53%) replied. Results. 74% of respondents reported subjective improvements in night-Time sleep, daytime sleepiness, depressive symptoms, motor functioning, or a combination thereof. The median score for the System Usability Scale (SUS; 0-100 range, higher scores indicating better performance) was 70.0. A total of 26 patients (84%) had an overall positive attitude towards the technique, with patients rating the glasses with an average score of 6.9 ± 2.0 (SD) out of 10. Except for one patient, all responders would like to continue using the glasses, mostly because they considered it a useful aid. Conclusion. Blue light therapy appears to have a positive effect on sleep, mood, and motor symptoms in PD. PD patients had an overall positive attitude towards blue light glasses as treatment for sleep disorders. © 2019 Katarzyna Smilowska et al.

AB  - The main goal of this study is to identify housewives' attitudes towards locally-made products in comparison with imported produce. Furthermore, it aims to detect the degree of their satisfaction with each product regarding its quality, advertising tools (the media) and targeted groups (Jordanian housewives) with a more focus on their attitudes towards home-made products, namely baby's diapers. This study focused on collecting primary and secondary data through a structured questionnaire which was handed out to a sample consisting of 519 respondents and distributed all throughout Amman. The questionnaire included (4) items: the first item tackled the demographic factors of the Jordanian housewives, the second and the third items included different types of questions to explore housewives' attitudes towards home-made baby's diapers. The fourth item included specific statistical techniques that were used to achieve the research objectives and to examine related hypothesis such as the descriptive statistics (means, standard deviation frequencies and percentages), multiple regression, t-test for Paired Samples, and Two-Way ANOVA) test. The following results were concluded: 1) The attitudes of the Jordanian housewives showed negative attitudes towards home-made baby's diapers in comparison with the imported produce. 2) Every independent variable regarding the quality, advertising tools, (the media), and the targeted groups affected the three components of the attitudes including the cognitive, effective, and perceptive components. 3) The correlation between the quality, the advertising tools, the targeted groups and the Jordanian housewives' attitudes towards locally-made baby's diapers do differ according to the difference in demographic variables. 4) The relationship between all independent variables (quality, the advertising tools, and the targeted groups) and Jordanian housewives' attitudes towards locallymade baby's diapers do differ with the difference of the demographic variables. The study focused on four main parts including: the theoretical framework of the study, consumers' attitudes, and data analysis and finally the results and recommendations. © 2019 Allied Academies.

AB  - This study was designed to investigate the relationships of demographic variables with the dimensions of organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB) and to compare the OCB among human service and information technology (IT) professionals. For this purpose a sample of 400 in total from two different professionals, i.e., human service and IT professionals were selected. Correlation, multiple regression and Z-test were carried out for the analysis of the study. The results of the study indicate that age and job experience emerged as a major predictor of OCB. Age and job experience were also found positively correlated with all dimensions of OCB, whereas significant negative relationship was found between marital status and dimensions of OCB. The inconsistent relationship was found between gender and dimensions of OCBs. The findings of this study will be helpful for the administrator in the public health sector and policy makers in the IT sector to reinforce positive attitude among the employees of both the sector.

AB  - The sociofunctional model of prejudice (Cottrell & Neuberg, 2005) states that behaviors toward an outgroup are determined by emotions felt toward this outgroup, and that those emotions are determined by threats this group represents for one’s own group. Although widely cited in literature, this intuitively appealing model is not as supported as sometimes assumed. In fact, seminal data supporting the model have not been replicated, and the mediating role of emotions in the threat-behavior link remains in need of empirical evidence. Two studies were aimed at filling this gap by measuring specific threats, emotions and their associated behavioral intentions. Our results provide mixed support for the sociofunctional model. We found evidence of the threat-emotion, the threat-behavior and the emotion-behavior links described in this model, but only partial support for the mediational role of emotion in the threat-behavior link. © 2019 Ubiquity Press.

AB  - Research links intrinsic religiousness to less prejudice toward Black people and greater prejudice toward gay people. We examined longitudinally in a sample of 865 adolescents three variables that might serve as a mediator of attitudes toward Black people yet produce a suppression effect in attitudes toward gay people: (a) humanitarian values, (b) favorable evaluations of social groups, and (c) socially desirable responding. In light of evidence that Black people on average are more religious than are White people, we also examined whether self-identifying as Black helped explain racial prejudice. Our mediation analyses provided strong evidence that humanitarian values and the tendency to view all social groups favorably accounted for the relationship between intrinsic religiousness and positive attitudes toward Black people. We found no support that socially desirable responding or identifying as Black accounted for our effects. Consistent with a suppression effect, controlling statistically for the agreeable aspects of religiousness strengthened the relationship between intrinsic religiousness and prejudice toward gay people. These findings illustrate mechanisms through which intrinsic religiousness can correspond both positively and negatively with attitudes toward marginalized groups. © 2019 American Psychological Association.

AB  - This study examines how news coverage of terrorist threats affects emotions that then shape support for antiterrorism policies, presidential approval, and attitudes toward Muslims. Using a national sample, news stories were experimentally manipulated to emphasize terrorist threats (high/low) and depictions of U.S. military strength (high/low). Results show that group-based anger-when people thought about themselves as Americans-mediated the relationships between threat coverage and antiterrorism policies, whereas group-based fear did not. On the other hand, group-based fear mediated the relationship between threat coverage and negative attitudes toward Muslims, whereas group-based anger did not. When people thought about themselves as individuals, neither anger nor fear mediated these relationships. © 2019 (Seth Bradshaw and Kate Kenski).

AB  - This case study analyzed nonverbal cues during the 2016 town hall debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Variables were facial expressions, posture, eye contact, and spatial distance. Clinton was friendlier, took more expansive postures, and maintained more eye contact. The candidates largely kept within social distance, except for an instance that created postdebate controversy. Whereas some of Clinton's nonverbal behavior conformed to established gendered cues, her nonverbal behavior largely transcended gender norms. Also addressed are the media's shortcomings in contextualizing debate visuals. © 2019 (Ben Wasike).

AB  - The interpretation of genetic information in clinical settings raises moral issues about adequate risk communication and individual responsibility about one's health behavior. However, it is not well-known what role numeric probabilities and/or the conception of disease and genetics play in the lay understanding of predictive genetic diagnostics. This is an important question because lay understanding of genetic risk information might have particular implications for self-responsibility of the patients. Aim: Analysis of lay attitudes and risk perceptions of German lay people on genetic testing with a special focus on how they deal with the numerical information. Methods: We conducted and analyzed seven focus group discussions (FG) with lay people (n = 43). Results: Our participants showed a positive attitude toward predictive genetic testing. We identified four main topics: (1) Anumeric risk instead of statistical information; (2) Treatment options as a factor for risk evaluation; (3) Epistemic and aleatory uncertainty as moral criticism; (4) Ambivalence as a sign of uncertainty. Conclusion: For lay people, risk information, including the statistical numeric part, is perceived as highly normatively charged, often as an emotionally significant threat. It seems necessary to provide lay people with a deeper understanding of risk information and of the limitations of genetic knowledge with respect to one's own health responsibility.

AB  - This research examined how news content influences attitudes towards Syrian refugees in Turkey. The study aimed to understand if the way Syrian refugees are attributed in media - that is, media salience about Syrian refugees that comprise their image - would cause an attitude change in the public. More specifically, we intend to determine whether being exposed to positive news coverage about Syrian refugees would cause an attitude change in the public from negative to positive. For the purpose of the study, we have conducted a quasi-experimental research and used a pretest-posttest design to investigate the second-level agenda-setting effects. Two experiments (a pilot and a main experiment) were conducted during the Spring term of 2017 in Turkey. The participants were selected from a large private university in Turkey for the experiments. The t-test results suggest that positive media emphasis on the images of Syrian refugees had a positive impact on public opinion and caused an overall attitude change in the public. © 2019 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

AB  - Throughout this essay I offer an adumbrated critique of recognition theory through a psychoanalytic sensibility. Contemporary recognition theory relies on an overly optimistic and intellectualized view of social relations that fails to adequately consider pathological processes inherent in human motivation, particularly those that are unconsciously mediated by collective prejudice and dysrecognition. In revisiting the Hegelian struggle for recognition, much of social reality today is mired in a collective pathos that prevents optimal mutual recognition among social collectives. Not all people are disposed, let alone capable, of recognizing the Other. We may have to contend that, in the end, recognition means tolerance of difference and not merely acceptance of one other, which could still bring about a pragmatic co-existence even if people cannot recognize each other as equals. This is largely due, I suggest, to the ontology of prejudice, attachment deficits, and the failure to adopt empathy toward alterity. © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2019.

AB  - We examined the associations between intimate partner violence (IPV) before and during pregnancy, negative attitudes toward pregnancy, and mother-to-fetus bonding. Participants were 636 pregnant women in the third trimester, who completed the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale, Violence Against Women Screen, and ad hoc questions (for IPV before pregnancy, negative attitudes, and demographics). We found association between IPV during pregnancy and mother-to-fetus bonding failure was mediated by negative attitudes toward pregnancy in the third trimester. IPV before pregnancy was associated with negative attitudes at the beginning of pregnancy, which predicted negative attitudes in the third trimester and mother-to-fetus bonding failure. Careful assessments and psychological interventions are needed to reduce negative attitudes toward pregnancy among abused women in antenatal health settings to prevent mother-to-fetus bonding failure. © 2019 Springer Publishing Company.

AB  - Purpose - This paper examines the mediating effect of positive attitude (ATT) and subjective norm (SJN) on customers' behavioral intention to participate in Islamic banking in Nigeria using the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) as a basis. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire with 274 samples. This study used the convenience sampling technique. Findings - The authors found a positive and significant relationship between the factors in the model. The findings highlight the relevance of attitude in the structural model. The findings further show that attitude has a positive effect in mediating the relationship between awareness, knowledge, religion and the behavioural intention of customers. Originality/value - This paper highlights the need for policymakers, regulators and Islamic banking operators to create proper awareness through effective communication with customers on the benefits of Islamic banking and the provision of a platform for knowledge enhancement to promote a positive attitude among the different segments of society and which in turn can influence their intention to participate in Islamic banking. © 2019, International Journal of Financial Research.

AB  - In language planning for minority languages, policy often aims to positively influence attitudes towards the language by increasing its salience in key areas of public life such as broadcasting and signage. This is true for Gaelic in Scotland, where recent national initiatives have included the establishing of a Gaelic language television channel in 2008, and the launch, in the same year, of a bilingual brand identity for ScotRail (Rèile na h-Alba), resulting in Gaelic-English signage at railway stations across Scotland. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the effects of such an increase in national visibility of Gaelic on public attitudes towards the language. The present paper explores this using a national survey of public attitudes conducted in Scotland in 2012. Exposure to Gaelic broadcasting was found to be positively associated with attitudes towards the status of the Gaelic language (as a language spoken in Scotland, and as an important element of cultural heritage), and with attitudes towards the greater use of Gaelic (in public services and in the future). However, exposure to Gaelic signage was often negatively associated with such broader attitudes to the language and culture. The implications of the results for Gaelic language planning, and for future academic studies of language attitudes in Scotland, are explored. © Edinburgh University Press.

AB  - The dark triad (DT) traits–psychopathy, narcissism and Machiavellianism–have collectively been linked to reduced empathy and increased aggression; however, their association with distinct empathic subtypes remains unclear; and unique links to indirect relational aggression (IRA) have not been delineated. Moreover, whether dark traits should be conceptualized individually, as a dyad or as a triad with a dark core centered around the absence of empathy is debated. The current study examines (i) whether impaired empathy indeed represents a common “dark core” binding Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy, and (ii) this core explains associations between the dark traits and IRA. Participants (N = 301, 262 F/39 M) completed measures of the DT traits, cognitive and affective empathy components and IRA (Social Exclusion, Malicious Humor and Guilt Induction). The individual traits model without links between narcissism and IRA showed the best fit, suggesting that, at least in the context of IRA, the DT traits are best viewed as three independent personality traits. Distinct cognitive and affective empathy deficits and capacities are seen in the DT. Peripheral responsivity was the only type of empathy deficit associated with all dark traits, but unrelated to IRA. Psychopathy was the strongest indicator of impaired empathy and all IRAs; however, only online simulation, an affect-related cognitive empathy facet, partially mediated the relationships of psychopathy and Machiavellianism with IRA. Whilst the unique pathways for the dark triad traits suggest stronger alignment of psychopathy and Machiavellianism in their empathic deficits and indirect aggression; the data do not support the notion that an unempathic dark core underpinning all three traits drives indirect aggression. This is the first paper delineating the specific empathic deficits involved using a facet approach and their link to indirect forms of aggression. Results therefore inform theoretical models of aggression in the DT and offer some clarity on the debates surrounding the unempathic dark core in the DT.

AB  - Media censorship is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes. We conduct a field experiment in China to measure the effects of providing citizens with access to an uncensored internet. We track subjects' media consumption, beliefs regarding the media, economic beliefs, political attitudes, and behaviors over 18 months. We find four main results: (i) free access alone does not induce subjects to acquire politically sensitive information; (ii) temporary encouragement leads to a persistent increase in acquisition, indicating that demand is not permanently low; (iii) acquisition brings broad, substantial, and persistent changes to knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and intended behaviors; and (iv) social transmission of information is statistically significant but small in magnitude. We calibrate a simple model to show that the combination of low demand for uncensored information and the moderate social transmission means China's censorship apparatus may remain robust to a large number of citizens receiving access to an uncensored internet. © 2019 American Economic Association.

AB  - Purpose: This study investigated knowledge and users' preferences of contemporary marketing strategies used in academic libraries. It is a user study innovation characterized by granting users' with the information appropriate for better library usage and their feedback to analyze how what is presented to them makes an impact towards their attainment of academic goals. Methodology: This study carried out in University of Calabar Library adopted survey research design on a population of 1804 registered users. A simple random sampling technique was adopted in selecting 600 undergraduate and postgraduate registered users. Accordingly, 600 copies of questionnaire were distributed in the reader services units, which comprised Social Sciences, Medical, Africana, Humanities, Law, Reference as well as Science and Technology/Annex Divisions of the library. Questionnaire was distributed with a condition that only registered users who use the library often (at least thrice a week) were eligible to respond. Only 428 usable copies were returned and these were analyzed for the study. Findings: Study revealed users' knowledge of marketing strategies in the following sequence Digital media marketing 423(98.83%), Awareness services marketing 377(88.08%) and Conducive environment marketing 224(52.34%). The result of preferences showed Digital media marketing as most preferred with 421(98.36%), Awareness services marketing had 398 (92.99%) respondents and Conducive environment marketing 204(47.66%). On the challenges, two respondents (5 & 34) frankly indicated their lack of understanding for the term conducive environment. This has a great implication for the result altogether but other respondents revealed their challenges with regards to inappropriate time fixed for library use of e-library, epileptic power supply, low bandwidth, that causes the network to show while pages were unable to open and staff negative attitude. Suggestions were given to encourage the publications of local news and magazines, which would help to intimate users of issues relating to library use among others. Originality: This article offer valuable insight on the users' knowledge and preferences of contemporary marketing strategies in academic libraries. This indicate that, it is only when users' are given what they desire, that they could be said to be satisfied. © 2019 Library Philosophy and Practice.

AB  - This study examines how household composition and news media consumption and trust are related to attitudes towards two minority groups—immigrants and refugees—in a representative sample of the adult population (n = 6000) in Belgium, Sweden, France, and the Netherlands. We find that Swedes hold the most positive attitudes towards both groups, while the French are found to be most negative. The Belgians and Dutch hold moderate attitudes. There is also evidence that attitudes on refugees are more negative than attitudes on immigrants in Sweden and France, but not in Belgium and the Netherlands. Using structural equation modeling, we find that household composition is not directly related to attitudes, but indirect effects through socio-economic status and media consumption indicate that singles hold more negative attitudes than couples. Public television consumption, popular online news consumption, and trust in media are positively related to attitudes, whereas commercial television consumption is negatively associated with them. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Stigma poses an additional burden for people suffering from mental illness, one that often impairs their social participation and can prevent them from seeking adequate help. It is therefore crucial to understand how stigma develops in order to counteract it by setting up effective evidence-based anti-stigma interventions. The present study examines the effect of causal beliefs on stigmatizing behavioral intentions, namely people's desire to distance themselves from persons with mental illness. In addition, we draw cross-cultural comparisons between native Germans and Turkish immigrants to investigate the influence of culture on stigma and causal beliefs and to broaden knowledge on the biggest immigrant group in Germany and on immigrants in Western countries in general. Methods: n = 302 native Germans and n = 173 Turkish immigrants were presented either a depression or a schizophrenia vignette. Then, causal beliefs, emotional reaction and desire for social distance were assessed with questionnaires. Path analyses were carried out to investigate the influence of causal beliefs on the desire for social distance and their mediation by emotional reactions for Germans and Turkish immigrants, respectively. Results: We found an influence of causal beliefs on the desire for social distance. Emotional reactions partly mediated this relationship. Causal attribution patterns as well as the relationship between causal attributions and stigma varied across both subsamples and mental illnesses. In the German subsample, the ascription of unfavorable personal traits resulted in more stigma. In the Turkish immigrant subsample, supernatural causal beliefs increased stigma while attribution to current stress reduced stigma. Conclusion: Our study has implications for future anti-stigma interventions that intend to reduce stigmatization of mentally ill people. Targeting the ascription of unfavorable personal traits and supernatural causal attributions as well as promoting current stress as the cause for mental illness appears to be of particular importance. Also, the mediating influence of emotional responses to causal beliefs needs to be addressed. Furthermore, differential interventions across cultural groups and specific mental illnesses may be appropriate.

AB  - Given that the most students spend considerable time on social networks, many educational institutions use this habit as a basis for educational purposes. Increasing students' active participation in learning activities is one of the main goals of education. The purpose of this research was to investigate to what extent crowdvoting techniques can increase students' participation and interest in the e-learning process. Additionally, we set out to explore social networks as a medium for crowdvoting, contests, and collaboration among students. The research participants included 131 students in the information technologies area of the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, University of Belgrade who participated in contest related to their 3D modeling projects. Voting was performed via Facebook. The students voted for particular projects primarily based on the quality of the project itself. Additionally, the competition was an incentive for students to prove themselves to colleagues, but also to provide an opportunity for teamwork, additional engagement, and acquisition of new skills and knowledge. The research results indicate a generally positive attitude among students towards the competition and rewards. © 2019, Athabasca University.

AB  - The Brexit referendum to leave the EU and Trump’s success in the US general election in 2016 sparked new waves of discussion on nativism, nationalism, and the far right. Within these analyses, however, very little attention has been devoted towards exploring the transnational ideological circulation of Islamophobia and anti-establishment sentiment, especially amongst diaspora and migrant networks. This article thus explores the role of the Indian diaspora as mediators in populist radical right discourse in the West. During the Brexit referendum and Trump’s election and presidency, a number of Indian diaspora voices took to Twitter to express pro-Brexit and pro-Trump views. This article presents a year-long qualitative study of these users. It highlights how these diasporic Indians interact and engage on Twitter in order to signal belonging on multiple levels: as individuals, as an imaginary collective non-Muslim diaspora, and as members of (populist radical right) Twitter society. By analysing these users’ social media performativity, we obtain insight into how social media spaces may help construct ethnic and (trans)national identities according to boundaries of inclusion/exclusion. This article demonstrates how some Indian diaspora individuals are embedded into exclusivist national political agendas of the populist radical right in Western societies. © 2019 by the author.

AB  - This study examined the magnitude of HIV/AIDS stigma and discrimination among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC). A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using both qualitative and quantitative methods to survey 100 PLWHA resident in AMAC-FCT. Participants were selected through a combination of two-stage and systematic random sampling technique using a table of random numbers. A 40-item structured questionnaire adapted from the HIV Stigma Scale and a semi-structured focus group discussion (FGD) guide were used to collect data. Quantitative data were coded and entered SPSS statistical software. Frequency tables were generated, and data subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics. Cross tabulations examined pattern of associations between respondent‘s characteristics while qualitative findings utilized content analysis along five specific themes to demonstrate the way HIV/AIDS stigma manifested among respondents. Participation was 100% and HIV/AIDS stigma prevalence was high at 67%, with mean age 33.01years (SD±5.94years) for respondents. Findings confirmed rejection of PLWHA by sexual partners, family members and friends, dismissal from work, decrease in the quality of health care services and sometimes outright denial of services. A high correlation was found between the scales and subscales of the HIV Stigma Scale with all correlation values reaching statistical significance (p =0.01). Regret for disclosure of status and ending social interaction by PLWHA was reported as consequences of disclosure and potential hindrance for disclosure which will encourage ongoing transmission of the virus. Our study provides evidence on stigma and discrimination of PLWHA in AMAC, FCT-Abuja in the face of limited evidence to drive HIV prevention interventions. Further studies should investigate other predictors and reasons for stigma and discrimination among this population. © 2019, Women's Health and Action Research Centre. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study intended to test whether attachment to one's own residential place at neighborhood level could represent a coping response for the elderly (consistently with the "docility hypothesis"; Lawton, 1982), when dealing with the demands of unfamiliar environments, in order to balance their reduction of spatial abilities. Specifically, a sequential path was tested, in which neighborhood attachment was expected to play a buffer role between lowered spatial competence and neighborhood satisfaction. The participants (N=270), senior citizens (over-65 years old), responded to a questionnaire including the measures of spatial self-efficacy, spatial anxiety, attitude towards wayfinding, residential attachment and residential satisfaction. Results from the mediation analysis showed that a lower perceived spatial self-efficacy is associated to a higher spatial anxiety, and both promote a more negative attitude toward wayfinding tasks in non-familiar places. This leads to a higher attachment to one's own neighborhood, which in turn predicts a higher residential satisfaction. Thus, the "closure" response of becoming more attached to their residential place may be an adaptive strategy of the elderly for compensating the Person-Environment (P-E) mis-fit (Lawton & Nahemow, 1973) when they feel unable (or less able) to cope with the demands of unfamiliar environments. © 2019 fornara, lai, Bonaiuto and Pazzaglia.

AB  - BACKGROUND Demographers are increasingly interested in connecting demographic behaviour and trends with 'soft' measures, i.e., complementary information on attitudes, values, feelings, and intentions. OBJECTIVE The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how computational linguistic techniques can be used to explore opinions and semantic orientations related to parenthood. METHODS In this article we scrutinize about three million filtered Italian tweets from 2014. First, we implement a methodological framework relying on Natural Language Processing techniques for text analysis, which is used to extract sentiments. We then run a supervised machine-learning experiment on the overall dataset, based on the annotated set of tweets from the previous stage. Consequently, we infer to what extent social media users report negative or positive affect on topics relevant to the fertility domain. RESULTS Parents express a generally positive attitude towards being and becoming parents, but they are also fearful, surprised, and sad. They also have quite negative sentiments about their children's future, politics, fertility, and parental behaviour. By exploiting geographical information from tweets we find a significant correlation between the prevalence of positive sentiments about parenthood and macro-regional indicators of both life satisfaction and fertility level. CONTRIBUTION We show how tweets can be used to represent soft measures such as attitudes, values, and feelings, and we establish how they relate to demographic features. Linguistic analysis of social media data provides a middle ground between qualitative studies and more standard quantitative approaches. © 2019 Letizia Mencarini et al.

AB  - This study focuses on media images of islamophobia as portrayed by Cable News Network (CNN) and its implications for international relations. The study employed qualitative methodology. Data was collected using key informant interviews, while documentary search was done using CNN current affairs videos. The study findings indicated that the media has the power to influence human perceptions towards stereotyping Islam as a terrorist organisation and conflating the Islamic religion and the Muslim culture with terrorism. The study also found out that islamophobia really has a relationship with how Muslims are represented in the media. The study recommends that media houses should have media ethics, laws and policies which force journalists to be more accountable and objective when reporting issues of religion, race and culture as a way of eliminating offensive communication and religious intolerance.

AB  - Celebrities who use Instagram can influence their female followers in many ways, for instance, in influencing their perceptions on body image, adoption of healthy eating lifestyles, and persuading them to purchase products or services endorsed by these celebrities. Accordingly, this study aims to examine the influence of celebrity-fan engagement on Instagram on hijab culture among Muslim women in Malaysia. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among female university students from the International Islamic University of Malaysia (N = 630). In order to participate in the study, respondents completed an online survey and are instructed to think about a favourite female Muslim celebrity they follow on Instagram while completing the research instrument. Results indicate that almost one-third of the most popular Muslim celebrities among females Instagram users are non-traditional celebrities (i.e. bloggers/vloggers, YouTube personalities and social media influencers). Furthermore, attitude homophily and parasocial interaction with said celebrity may significantly influence the likelihood that the celebrity’s profile will be visited, and the number of likes on their photos. Finally, after controlling for the respondents’ religious educational background, this study found that those who had positive attitude and behaviour towards the hijab, and perceived a higher degree of parasocial bond with Muslim celebrities on Instagram tended to have a more positive perception towards the hijab culture. The repercussions of these findings on the parasocial interaction theory, and the influence of celebrity-fan engagement on social media over hijab culture are discussed. © 2019, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Press.

AB  - Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have an increasing influence on the way we interact, learn, and live. The increase in teaching and learning methodologies that are mediated by ICT in the field of education and in the domestic settings encourages the design of new effective technological tools, supported by scientific research and development to improve student learning. The challenge psychology is facing in the education field is to promote those technologies and make them available to the education community. Technologies also would produce attractive items for users and realistic commercial issues for businesses. This also allows an effective transfer for scientific work, providing visibility to Research and Development. In this context, the main aim of the article is to describe the process to get an agreement between Babyradio (a children's entertainment company: https://babyradio.es/) and our research team, starting a collaborative work between two groups of people (Babyradio's technical designer and Psychologist-Engineers software designer), in order to create several educative applications (APPs) in the field of early mathematics cognition. The institutional framework of the relationship of the R & D project and a children's entertainment company is described. The article also focuses on experience in Psychology, Technological Innovation, and Entrepreneurship. In considering the efficiency of the agreement, we present different APPs designed for tablets and smartphone devices, adapted to the different operating systems (IOS, Android, Windows). APPs are designed to instill the cognitive fundamentals associated with early math learning for students aged 4 to 7 years. The study developed after this babyradio-university enterprise agreement contributes to the development of mathematics skills in children, aged 4-7 years, so that they can successfully meet the mathematics school requirements; it also contributes to encouraging a more positive attitude toward mathematics. This study also suggests how the education system and software and educational content developers' companies would manage verified instructional APPs, with a more realistic commercial perspective. © 2019 Mera, Ruiz, Aguilar, Aragón, Delgado, Menacho, Marchena, García Sedeño and Navarro.

AB  - Τhe aim of this paper is to provide a space to consider the recent research on post truth communication, especially related to research in Higher Education. More concretely, the study focuses on the work of P. Kiprianos on the perception of degrees throughout Greek history and the role of graduates in the making of modern Greece. Under this framework we concentrate on the 'elective affinity' between public posttruth narrations and post modernity, as a consequence of the breakdown of the twentieth century mass media order and the consolidation of disaggregated mediated spheres. According to the theoretical frameworks of Max Weber and Jurgen Habermas the upsurge of post-truth argumentation represented by Social Media can only be overcome by the collective effort to produce agreed-upon facts and reach consensus on the correspondence between assertions and reality. In conclusion, the fundamental position of this study is that the shift towards the post-truth public sphere ultimately concerns the political definition of the social subject itself and the democratic composition of its action. In this context, trust and truth become constitutive reasons for action that is implied by the social biopolitics as a process of normalizing the phenomenon of social exclusion (Neets) and not as a process of withdrawing it. Under this assumption, placing the University at the core of action for (lifelong?) growth and social cohesion, implies an answer to the social and, by extension, to the political importance of the University in the public sphere. © 2019 Higher Education Policy Network.
Είναι κοινός προβληματισμός της διεθνούς βιβλιογραφίας πως στο πέρασμα από την μαζική επικοινωνία στην εξατομικευμένη κουλτούρα της ρευστότητας των social media, οι συλλήψεις της αλήθειας και της αντικειμενικότητας κατασκευάζονται υπό το πρίσμα των υποκειμενικών αφηγήσεων. Στην κυριαρχία των υποκειμενικών αφηγήσεων η διαδικασία της ρήξης με το γραμμικό, θα προσδιορίσει ως κυρίαρχο νοηματοδοτικό στοιχείο της μετανεωτερικής επικοινωνιακής κατάστασης μια ειδικότερη πτυχή δηλαδή τη ρήξη με την αξιακή σαφήνεια, νοηματοδοτώντας την εποχή ως εποχή της 'μετά-αλήθειας'. Το πεδίο της εκπαίδευσης και ιδιαίτερα το επίπεδο της ανώτατης εκπαίδευσης είναι ένα προνομιακό πεδίο σύλληψης και ανάλυσης του φαινομένου. Η υπέρβαση της παραπάνω πρόκλησης γίνεται εφικτή υπό την προϋπόθεση της επικοινωνιακής δράσης όπου η επιδίωξη της εμπιστοσύνης ως θεμέλιο της κοινωνικής σημασίας του πανεπιστημίου στην εποχή της μετα-αλήθειας, καθιστά ουσιαστική την παρέμβαση των μελετητών της διεθνούς επιστημονικής κοινότητας. Οι τελευταίοι προτείνουν ως ανάχωμα στην αληθοφάνεια και τα fake news, το επιχείρημα που εισάγεται στη δημόσια σφαίρα με αυστηρό κριτήριο την επίκληση γεγονότων, τη χρήση δεδομένων και την επιστημονική παρουσίαση και ανάλυση τεκμηρίων. Υπό αυτό το πρίσμα η μελέτη του Π. Κυπριανού αποτελεί σημαντικό εφαλτήριο προβληματισμού και ανάλυσης συζήτησης όπου η τεκμηρίωση και εκλογίκευση καταδεικνύουν πως συγκριμένες ρυθμίσεις νομιμοποιούνται στο κοινωνικό ως 'επιθυμητές αλήθειες" και τελικά αποτελούν κανονιστικά πλαίσια σε περιβάλλον διακινδύνευσης, ενώ οδηγούν τις υποκειμενικές, εργαλειακές μικρο- αφηγήσεις σε ρήξη με το παρελθόν. Τελικά ο σχετικός προβληματισμός αφορά στην κοινωνική συνοχή των δυτικών κοινωνιών και ιδιαίτερα την κρίσης του δημοκρατικού χαρακτήρα τους.

AB  - The imbalance between water supply and demand has become prominent increasingly, and the quantity and quality of water has limited the social and economic development. Public participation can solve this problem effectively. Based on the existing research, the impacts of citizens’ water behavior are put forward. Through the application of paper inquiry, the relationship among water knowledge, water attitude and water behavior is analyzed. It is proved that water knowledge, water emotion and water responsibility have significant effect on water behavior. The mediating role of water emotion and water liability in water knowledge and water behavior is confirmed. For the government and social organizations, in order to ensure the sustainable use of water and regulate citizens’ water behavior, not only water knowledge, but emotion and responsibility should be propagated. © Foundation Environmental Protection & Research-FEPR.

AB  - The public opinion ecosystem is a part of artificial social ecosystem. It composed of public opinion environment, public opinion subject and public opinion rule system. In recent years, with the advent of the era of big data, the status and influence of online public opinion has gradually become an important factor affecting the human environment. As a country that influences the interaction of various factors that promote the orderly development of public opinion, public opinion ecology plays an increasingly important role in people’s daily life quality. Whether this state is stable or not directly leads to people being able to live in peace in a community. The law of ecological balance governs the paradox of diversity and instability. Through the investigation of the current research results, it is found that the exploration of such problems has not penetrated into the more detailed analysis points of netizens. The differences and instability of the individual’s cognitive behaviors will directly or indirectly affect the changes of the entire communication mechanism. In order to study this more detailed problem, the public opinion transmission mechanism based on individual cognitive behavior in the public opinion environment is obtained through Netlogo simulation. It mainly relies on traditional infectious disease models and individual behavior patterns based on individual multi-dimensional characteristics. And choose a hot topic to get the actual law to draw and verify. The application value and significance of studying these contents lies in the fact that the dissemination mechanism and evolution law of the research can provide some reference for the relevant public opinion supervision departments and provide suggestions for them. At the same time, this study will help to form an ecological balance of public opinion and provide certain practical significance for further exploration in the future. © Foundation Environmental Protection & Research-FEPR.

AB  - Unconditional Respect for Persons (RfP) scale is an instrument for measuring positive attitudes towards autonomy, equality, and integrity of human beings. This research validated and analyzed some psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the RfP scale in a sample of 947 pupils from 12 and 19 years old (M = 15.47, SD = 1.49). Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, we found two factors of respect Disrespect towards people (F1) and Respect toward people (F2). Internal consistency (F1: Omega = 0.82; F2: Omega = 0.78), and convergent and discriminant validity of the RfP were acceptable. Results show that RfP is a valid and reliable instrument for applying to adolescents and young population. © 2018, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana.

AB  - Existing methodological efforts subsume the interview into broad epistemological abstractions, neglecting actual mechanics of the interview as practice, and dismiss linguistic and cultural asymmetry in the interview as a matter of (in)adequate resources. Reflecting on 24 semi-structured interviews exploring social media use among Hong Kong youth, this article develops a culturally sensitive approach that democratically exposes the way cultural norms surface in communication, using strategies which (a) transform the dialogical mechanics of an interview—reflecting back and encouraging; (b) transform the positionality of the researcher—building intersubjectivity and emotional rapport; (c) transform the context of the interview—making shifts in space, language, and presentation. In doing so, a culturally sensitive approach generates practical recommendations for (a) humanizing the researcher to dismantle power imbalances and social distances and (b) naturalizing the interview into a more conversational form, both of which combine to expose the cultural logics that govern action and interpretation whilst constructing results into intimate narratives of people’s life-worlds. © 2019: Anson Au and Nova Southeastern University.

AB  - The present study utilized the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM 3) to explore the learning attitudes of college students with respect to English e-tutoring websites, an approach that has rarely been employed from the perspective of information technology and the global e-digital market. More specifically, the study used college students' assessments of self-paced business English e-learning websites to investigate the adoption of those sites. Using simple linear regression analysis, the research explored the question of whether engagement in e-learning was able to enhance the students' willingness to learn. The results of the analysis indicated that the majority of English e-tutoring users felt that online sources for learning English offer greater convenience and are more effective than noninternet resources. This finding suggests, in turn, that the web designers of business English e-learning websites could maintain and enhance the loyalty of site users by taking care to ensure the quality of the sites' content. In particular, the knowledge management functions and interface requirements of student users should be adequately addressed by web designers so that the students can operate the websites more easily in the course of the learning process. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In today's world, social media is playing an indispensable role on the learning behavior of university students to achieve sustainable education. The impact of social media on sustainable education is becoming an essential and impelling factor. The world has become a global village and technology use has made it a smaller world through social media and how it is changing instruction. This original study is amongst the few to perform a focalized investigation on revealing the relationship between positive and negative characteristics of social media and the learning attitude of university students for sustainable education. However, this study aims to examine the constructive and adverse factors that impact on students' minds and how these helped students to share positive and negative aspects with others. It is increasingly noticeable that social networking sites and their applications present enormous benefits for as well as risks to university students and their implications on students' psychological adjustment or learning behaviors are not well understood. This study adapted the cluster sampling method, and respondents participated from five selected regions. Researchers distributed 1013 questionnaires among the targeted sample of university students with an age range of 16 to 35 years, and they collected 831 complete/valid responses. This study applied the social gratification theory to examine students' behavior practicing socialmedia usage. This study specifically identified 18 adversarial and constructive factors of social media from the previous literature. The findings revealed that the usage of social media in Pakistan has a negative influence on a student's behavior as compared to positive aspects. Results may not be generalized to the entire student community as findings are specific to the specific respondents only. This study presents a relationship between antithetical and creative characteristics of socialmedia and exhibits avenues for future studies by facilitating a better understanding of web-based social network use. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Social influence has a positive impact on the purchase intention for eco-friendly products along with other subjective and objective aspects related to environmental attitude, product attitude, and subjective and objective knowledge. Also, exposure to media has been proven to have a significant positive affect on environmental attitude, with effect on the purchase intention. Several recent studies have shown the importance of consumers' influence in online social networks, underlying the role played by the online environments over consumers' attitude. As a result, the current research tries to analyze the influence exerted on consumers' decision to purchase eco-friendly products by their activity in online social environments. Using a questionnaire, filled-in by 409 respondents, a series of variables have been extracted with regard to the eco-friendly products. An agent-based model has been created, fed with the values of the variables extracted from the questionnaire, and used for simulations. As a result, it has been observed that an increase in online media exposure can have a high positive impact on the eco-friendly product adoption. Depending on the type of product-soft or durable good-different times for the eco-friendly product adoption have been determined relatively to the considered variables. Last, the possible limitations of using an agent-based modeling approach are discussed, along with possible extensions and improvements. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Efforts are being made in the field of medicine to promote the possibility of indefinite life extension (ILE). Past research on attitudes toward ILE technologies showed that women and more religious individuals usually have more negative attitudes toward ILE. The purpose of this research was to investigate whether gender differences in attitude toward indefinite life extension technologies could be explained by religiosity, afterlife beliefs, and general attitudes toward science. In four studies (N = 5,000), undergraduate participants completed self-report questionnaires measuring their support for life extension as well as religiosity, afterlife beliefs, and attitude toward science (in Study 3). In all studies, men supported ILE more than women, whereas women reported greater belief in an afterlife. The relationship between gender and attitude toward ILE was only partially mediated by religiosity (Studies 2-4) and by attitudes toward science (Study 3). © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.

AB  - Background: Gender-based data indicates that within-race STI rate disparities exist for young African Americans males, (YAAMs) ages 18 to 24. Social media may prove to be a valuable tool for delivering theory-driven messages about sexual health knowledge and behaviors, including condom usage, directly to YAAMs in promoting safer sex behaviors for this population. Purpose: To examine the current attitudes, norms and perceived controls related to the influence of social media on condom use among YAAMs ages 18 to 21. Methods: Nine group-depth interviews were held with 41 participants, mean age 19, SD +1.2, were conducted in metro Detroit to understand use of social media for condom use education, and health messages among YAAMs ages 18 to 21. Results: Participants demonstrated positive attitudes about using social media for condom use education. Social media sites that were educational (n = 12) and engaging (n = 5) made it easy to seek out sexual health information related to condom use. Similarly, participants liked social media for condom use education if the sites provided educational (n = 9) content and had creative advertisements. (n = 7). Top reasons to dislike social media as a mode for condom use education included negative comments (n = 6) displayed on the sites or if the site provided misinformation (n = 5) about the use of condoms. Conclusion: The findings here can help healthcare providers, the community and researchers understand media preference, navigation, and better understand the role of social media in adolescent health care. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Older adults (> 65) are less physically active than all other adult age groups. Although experiences of weight discrimination have been inversely associated with physical activity in several studies of middle-aged and older adults, the role of weight discrimination in this relationship has not been sufficiently explicated. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (a longitudinal panel study of U.S. adults aged 50 and older), we hypothesized that, among middle aged and older adults, weight discrimination would (a) be inversely related to respondents’ reported level of physical activity; and (b) partially mediate the relationship between BMI and physical activity. Using multiple logistic regression analysis, we found an inverse relationship between weight discrimination and vigorous physical activity (OR = 0.79; 95% CI [0.66, 0.94]), as well as between weight discrimination and moderate physical activity (OR = 0.76; 95% CI [0.62, 0.92]). Weight discrimination mediated 13% of the relationship between BMI and vigorous physical activity, as well as 9% of the relationship between BMI and moderate physical activity. Weight discrimination may thus pose a barrier to regular physical activity among middle aged and older adults. Future research and interventions should identify effective ways of mitigating barriers experienced because of weight discrimination in the promotion of physical activity among these age groups, as well as how we may effectively reduce the perpetration of weight discrimination in various settings. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: It has been reported that the majority of individuals with mental illnesses (MIs) do not seek help. Few studies have focused on correlates of a positive attitude toward professional help-seeking for MI. This study aimed to determine levels of knowledge, perception, and attitudes toward MI, determine attitudes toward mental health help-seeking, and identify sociodemographic predictors of correct knowledge and favorable attitudes among the Saudi public. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 650 Saudi adults aged >18 years who attended the Saudi Jenadriyah annual cultural and heritage festival during February 2016. The previously validated Attitudes to Mental Illness Questionnaire was used. Attitude to professional help-seeking was also assessed, using a tool retrieved from the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview part II. Multiple regression analyses were applied, and statistical significance considered at P<0.05. Results: The majority of the Saudi public reported lack of knowledge about the nature of MI (87.5%, percentage mean score [PMS] 45.02±19.98), negative perception (59%, PMS 59.76±9.16), negative attitudes to MI (66.5%, PMS 65.86±7.77), and negative attitudes to professional help-seeking (54.5%, PMS 62.45±8.54). Marital status was a predictor of knowledge (t=–3.12, P=0.002), attitudes to MI (t=2.93, P=0.003), and attitudes to help-seeking (t=2.20, P=0.03). Attitudes to help-seeking were also predicted by sex (t=–2.72, P=0.007), employment (t=3.05, P=0.002), and monthly income (t=2.79, P=0.005). Perceptions toward the mentally ill were not predicted by these socioeconomic characteristics (P>0.05). Conclusion: The Saudi public reported lack of knowledge of MI and stigmatizing attitudes toward people with MI in relation to treatment, work, marriage, and recovery and toward professional help-seeking. Sociodemographic characteristics predicted correct knowledge and favorable attitudes, while Saudi culture was the likely factor behind negative judgments about mentally ill persons. Efforts to challenge this negative publicity and stigma through antistigma campaigns and public education through schools and media are recommended. © 2019 Abolfotouh et al.

AB  - Focusing on electrical circuits as the topic for a STEM project, this research aims to develop virtual reality media for student learning. Using virtual reality media to perform STEM electrical circuit activities, data was collected and analyzed. The virtual reality media was then evaluated by five experts who used the Index of Item-Objective Congruence (IOC) to assess its effectiveness, where the IOC for each criteria was 0.8 or higher. Moreover, after evaluating it with the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI), the arithmetic mean of its effectiveness on the diffusion of innovation was 4.32, with a 0.48 standard deviation. This demonstrates that the use of virtual reality media was a beneficial innovation at a high level. Afterwards, the developed virtual reality media was evaluated by a sample of 30 subjects in the areas of VR features, usability, learning experience, and VR measurement outcomes. The findings show that its arithmetic mean was 4.67 with a 0.47 standard deviation, meaning the developed virtual reality media was an effective for electrical circuit learning at the highest level. Furthermore, after evaluating its effectiveness in the area of information technology acceptance, it was found that, for these criteria, the arithmetic mean was 4.64 with a standard deviation of 0.48. This indicates that the subjects generally accepted the use of virtual reality media for use in learning STEM activities at the highest level. It can be said that the development of the virtual reality media for learning STEM activities with a focus on electrical circuits enhances the learning process of the learners who confirmed such statements at the highest level, with an increase in subject understanding of the learning activity and self-satisfaction, while at the same time reducing the prejudice learners have towards the study of electrical circuit installation. © 2019 Kassel University Press GmbH.

AB  - This study explored how a 2-year, maker-centered science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) project-based learning (M-STEM-PjBL) curriculum aimed at leading students to be makers changed students, science teachers, and a rural middle school in Taiwan, where teachers were stressed due to the low birth rate and low grades in the Comprehensive Assessment Program for Junior High School Students (CAP). This practical action research study utilized data collected from 24 students in a maker class, their peers, 4 teachers, and administrative documents related to school enrollment and student competitions’ records. Results showed that teachers had shifted their teaching from being teacher-centered to student-centered. The students who participated in the M-STEM-PjBL curriculum actively assisted peer learning and initiated active teacher–student interactions. Both teacher and student participants improved their practical skills during the process. Students in the maker science class had more positive attitudes toward science and science learning and changed their peers’ attitudes in the regular science class. The problematic rate of not meeting the required standard in the science subtest of the CAP was reduced from 36 to 26%. Moreover, student participants’ products recommended to the county or national level competitions frequently won awards. Student participants’ creativity and the science teachers’ teaching efforts were recognized in the media. Parent endorsement of the school was increased, the threat of losing students to other schools was decreased, and the crisis of cutting the number of classes was reduced. © 2019, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.

AB  - Objectives: As young children increasingly grow up in a digital environment, parents are confronted with the question whether and how to regulate young children’s digital gaming effectively. The goal of this study was to examine correlates of parents’ degree of restrictive mediation and their (autonomy-supportive or controlling) style of doing so. Specifically, we tested associations of parents’ degree and style of restrictive mediation with parents’ attitudes about digital gaming, parental perceptions of children’s defiance and problematic gaming, and their interest in social play. Methods: A sample of 762 parents of children between 3 and 9 years filled out questionnaires on their degree and style of restrictive mediation, their attitudes about gaming, and their perceptions of children’s oppositional defiance, problematic gaming, and interest in social play. Results: We found that parents who hold more negative attitudes about digital gaming were more likely to use a controlling style when mediating their child’s gaming. Further, a higher degree of restrictive mediation generally related to more adaptive child outcomes (i.e., lower levels of perceived defiance and problematic gaming, higher levels of perceived interest in social play), whereas the opposite pattern was found for parents’ controlling style of mediation. Finally, these associations were not moderated by children’s age or gender, nor by parents’ gender or educational level. Conclusions: Also in the context of children’s digital gaming, it seems important for parents to set clear rules. Yet, when doing so, it is equally important to refrain from using controlling strategies, as they seem to be counterproductive. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Winston Churchill once said, ‘it is better to jaw-jaw than to war-war.’ However, negotiations are particularly difficult when they are enmeshed in public opinion precommitments. The sharpest crisis between China and Vietnam in the last 30 years concerned the placement of a Chinese oil rig into contested waters in 2014. This study analyses the Chinese and Vietnamese propaganda efforts surrounding the crisis as examples of the instrumental use of propaganda in managing domestic public opinion on diplomatic crises. The article argues that despite very different approaches to public diplomacy during the crisis, both states were primarily concerned with avoiding escalation and ending the confrontation. The authors show how propaganda function as a pacifying device in dealing with rising domestic nationalism when executing a moderate foreign policy. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - From predicting medical conditions to administering health behavior interventions, artificial intelligence technologies are being developed to enhance patient care and outcomes. However, as Mélanie Terrasse and coauthors caution in an article in this issue of the Hastings Center Report, an overreliance on virtual technologies may depersonalize medical interactions and erode therapeutic relationships. The increasing expectation that patients will be actively engaged in their own care, regardless of the patients’ desire, technological literacy, and economic means, may also violate patients’ autonomy and exacerbate access. Moreover, since AI design is both a technical and social process, algorithms may mirror human biases, calling into question the vision of AI technologies surpassing human judgment and avoiding prejudices in decision-making. The best answer to these problems is to develop AI health technologies as part of a culture of health care quality improvement, responding to existing needs while being proactive about potential technical and ethical problems that can arise from the technologies’ design and implementation. © 2019 The Hastings Center

AB  - Purpose This project developed and evaluated the efficacy of a game decision aid among pregnant women about prenatal screening in a randomized controlled study. Study Design Participants were recruited from an obstetric clinic of an academic urban medical center and randomized (n = 73) to one of two study groups: the control group (n = 39) that used a brochure or the intervention group (n = 34) that also used a game decision aid. Result Participants who played the game had higher knowledge scores (m = 21.41, standard deviation [SD] = 1.74) than participants in the control group (m = 19.59; SD = 3.31), p = 0.004. The median time of game playing was 6:43 minutes (range: 2:17-16:44). The groups were similar in frequency of completing screening after the study, control = 6 (15%) versus intervention = 11 (32%), p = 0.087. However, the more interaction with the game resulted in more positive attitudes toward screening. Conclusion The addition of a game decision aid was effective in educating pregnant women about prenatal screening. As other genetic testing decisions continue to increase within clinical care, game-based decision tools may be a constructive method of informed decision-making. © 2019 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Stigmatization against HIV/AIDS greatly hinders efforts to increase the accessibility and utilization of HIV/AIDS services to meet the 90-90-90 goal. This study assessed the stigmatization and discrimination experienced by people living with HIV (PLWH) across multiple social settings such as family, community, and healthcare facilities in Vietnam. A total of 1,016 patients (63.8% males, mean age = 35.4) participated in a cross-sectional study using a culturally tailored HIV stigma measure in three HIV-epidemic-concentrated cities in Vietnam. Zero-inflated Poisson models were used to examine factors associated with the number of types of stigma that patients experienced. 86.2% PLWH reported experiencing stigma against HIV/AIDS, more frequently from their community (62.8%) and family (30.2%) than from health care facilities (8%). The level of stigma from community reported by PLWH is associated with socioeconomic status (e.g., income, occupation). The poor and middle economic classes and unemployed patients reported more stigmatization and discrimination from the community. Across all settings, PLWH experienced fewer stigmatization over the course of ART indicating the benefits of rapidly expanded ART programs. PLWH reported more stigmatization and discrimination at the provincial level of the health administration. Those with the history of drug injection reported significantly less stigmatization from healthcare setting. More culturally tailored interventions to reduce stigmatization overall to improve the quality of life and health outcomes of PLWH should be warranted to achieve the 90-90-90 goal. Improving HIV-related knowledge of the general population and providing opportunities for PLWH to be reintegrated into should be considered. Using mass media with positive messages and images would also foster positive attitudes towards HIV/AIDS among the population and could potentially change social values. Continuous training of health staffs' attitude could minimize the occurrence of stigmatization and discrimination at healthcare facilities. © 2019 Bach Xuan Tran et al.

AB  - To test a possible boundary condition for the risk information seeking and processing (RISP) model, this study experimentally manipulates risk perception related to the 2014 Ebola outbreak in a nationally representative sample. Multiple-group structural equation modeling results indicate that psychological distance was negatively related to systematic processing in the high-risk condition. In the low-risk condition, psychological distance was positively related to heuristic processing; negative attitude toward media coverage dampened people's need for information, which subsequently influenced information processing. Risk perception elicited more fear, which led to greater information insufficiency and more heuristic processing in the low-risk condition. In contrast, sadness was consistently related to information processing in both conditions. Model fit statistics also show that the RISP model provides a better fit to data when risk perception is elevated. Further, this study contributes to our understanding of the role of discrete emotions in motivating information processing. © 2019 Society for Risk Analysis

AB  - Administering Interdenominational Competency class is a very common problem. Mostly, if not all, Language Classes contain students of mixed competency. This happens for a number of reasons, but mainly because of different learning styles, learning speed, variation in motivation, and very frequently as a result of logistic decisions as most solutions to the problems depend on cooperation between the members of the class. Co-operative learning may be the most thoroughly researched instructional method in education and rapidly growing body of research supports the effectiveness of the approach. Cooperatively taught students tend to have better and longer information retention, higher grades, more highly developed critical thinking and problem solving skills, more positive attitude towards the subject and greater motivation to learn. © IAEME Publication.

AB  - In order to better understand the efficacy of efforts to educate the public about the risks of hurricane storm surge, links on the local National Weather Service (NWS) website and various media outlets were used to recruit 575 Charleston-area residents to complete two anonymous internet-based surveys. Most participants knew that storm surge was the primary risk from a hurricane in low-lying areas, particularly younger, new residents with less prior experience with hurricanes. One in five participants indicated that the NWS always or usually overstates the dangers of hurricanes, although most participants actually overestimated the accuracy of NWS track forecasts. Many users of a hurricane storm-tide visualization model anticipated more storm surge than they would actually receive in various hurricane scenarios. After model usage, there was a noted increase in user understanding of the importance of landfall location on the amount of storm surge, particularly among women and older participants. Comparing surveys completed before and after model usage, there was no change in the number of users that claimed they would evacuate for a hurricane scenario that produced a small storm tide, but there was a substantial increase in the number that claimed they would evacuate for a hurricane scenario that produced a large storm tide, particularly among younger and new residents. A quarter of users stated they would have reconsidered living in their current home if they had investigated the model prior to their move. Thus, significant evidence exists to demonstrate the effectiveness of this type of model in improving risk awareness among users. © 2019 Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Objectives:Negative attitudes toward aging are common among formal healthcare providers, but have been infrequently assessed among informal caregivers providing assistance to older adults. The current study sought to identify factors associated with ageism toward older women.Design:Multivariate hierarchical linear regression modelSetting:Lower-income neighborhoods in an urban setting in the Midwestern USAParticipants:144 care network members of White and African American women aged ≥ 65 yearsMeasurements:Age Group Evaluation and Description (AGED) Inventory assessed attitudes toward older women; CES-D scale measured depressive symptoms; Intergenerational Affectional Solidarity Scale assessed relationship closeness.Results:In bivariate analyses, African American caregivers endorsed more positive attitudes toward older women. In the multivariate regression model, attitudes toward older women were associated with care recipient health (β = 0.18, p < 0.05) and relationship closeness with the care recipient (β = 0.23, p < 0.05). However, these associations were fully mediated by care recipient-specific attitude ratings by the care network member. The association between person-specific attitudes and general attitudes was uniquely directional.Conclusions:Findings from the present study are consistent with past research suggesting that 'ageism' may, at least in part, derive from bias against perceived poor health. Further, our findings of an association between attitude toward the care recipient and attitudes toward older women in general provide support for cognitive psychology theory which emphasizes the role of personal experience in stereotype formation through the availability heuristic. The current study underlines the necessity for development of interventions to address ageism in informal caregivers. © International Psychogeriatric Association 2019.

AB  - Background Ukraine has the second largest European HIV epidemic. This study aimed to describe stigma, demographic and social factors and their association with anxiety among perinatally and behaviourally-HIV-infected (PHIV; BHIV) young people in Kiev and Odessa. Methods 104 PHIV and 100 BHIV young people aged 13–25 years completed a confidential tablet-based survey. Survey tools included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (anxiety sub-scale scores of 8–10 indicating mild and ≥11 moderate/severe symptoms in last 7 days), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and HIV Stigma Scale (HSS) (short version, composite of disclosure, negative self-image and public attitudes sub-scales). Unadjusted Poisson regression models were fitted to explore factors associated with moderate/ severe anxiety symptoms. Results PHIV and BHIV young people were of median age 15.5 [IQR 13.9–17.1] and 23.0 [21.0–24.3] years, having registered for HIV care a median 12.3 [10.3–14.4] and 0.9 [0.2–2.4] years previously; 97% (97/100) and 66% (65/99) respectively were on ART. Overall 43% (95%CI 36–50%) reported any and 13% (95%CI 9–19%) moderate/severe anxiety symptoms, with no difference by HIV acquisition mode (p = 0.405) or gender (p = 0.700). 42% (75/180) reported history of an emotional health problem for which they had not been referred/attended for care. Moderate/severe anxiety symptoms were associated with HIV-related stigma (prevalence ratio (PR) 1.24 95%CI 1.14–1.34 per HSS unit increase), lower self-esteem (PR 0.83 95%CI 0.78–0.90 per RSES point increase), CD4 ≤350 cells/mm3 (PR 2.29 95%CI 1.06–4.97), having no-one at home who knew the respondent’s HIV status (PR 9.15 95%CI 3.40–24.66 vs all know) and, among BHIV, less stable living situation (PR 6.83 95%CI 1.99–23.48 for ≥2 vs no home moves in last 3 years) and history of drug use (PR 4.65 95%CI 1.83–11.85). Conclusions Results indicated unmet need for psychosocial support. Further work is needed to explore strategies for mental health support, particularly around disclosure, self-esteem and stigma. © 2019 Durteste et al.

AB  - In this paper, we look at the relationship between European identification and political support for (or opposition to) EU membership. First, we argue that conceptualizing political attitudes towards the EU as a direct product of European identification (a) neglects the distinction between the social reality of Europe and the political reality of the EU and (b) leads to psychological reductionism. We propose that the relationship should instead be conceptualized as mediated by legitimacy perceptions and as moderated by social-level variables. Second, we look at three spheres of European integration and propose that their perceived legitimacy is appraised through the following principles: (a) normative solidarity for wealth sharing, (b) political authority for sharing political decisions, and (c) collective self-realization for the sharing of practices. We illustrate the key mediating role of those principles by drawing on data from a survey ran across five European countries. Third, we argue that these meditational relationships are in turn moderated by social, political, and ideological realities and illustrate this point by looking at the case of United Kingdom in the context of the EU membership referendum. We point to an ideological assumption in the U.K. political landscape about the illegitimacy of EU supranational decision making and argue that this contributed to shape both the debate of the referendum campaign and its result. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Research in information processing suggests that the journalistic practice of embedding right-wing populist Twitter posts in news may stimulate political polarization. To test this notion, we conducted an online experiment (N = 379). We investigated how highlighted right-wing populist statements affected individuals from different ideological stances and whether potential effects were determined by Twitter-specific characteristics (Twitter frame, profile picture). We exposed participants to two articles, each including a statement by a politician of the Austrian Freedom Party. In the first group, the statements were not highlighted (control group). In the second and third group, the statements appeared as conventional block quotes either without (G2) or with (G3) a picture of the politician. In the fourth and fifth group, the statements were highlighted as Twitter posts, again either without (G4) or with (G5) a picture of the politician. Results revealed that all highlighting conditions increased statement recognition among left-wing individuals. However, the full Twitter post condition exerted the strongest effect. Higher recognition then decreased left-wing individuals’ anti-immigrant attitudes and sympathy toward the right-wing populist candidate. Thus, embedding right-wing populists’ Twitter posts may induce disconfirmation bias among left-wing voters and trigger a process in which they strengthen their initial attitudes. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Though Nepal declared leprosy elimination in 2010, its burden is constantly rising in Terai communities for the past 2 years with 3000 new leprosy cases being diagnosed annually. Community's perception is important for prevention and control of leprosy and enhancing quality of life of leprosy patients. Poor knowledge, unfavorable attitude and stigma create a hindrance to leprosy control. The main objective of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude and stigma of leprosy amongst the community members living in Dhanusha and Parsa districts of Southern Central Nepal. Methods: A total of 423 individuals were interviewed using a structured questionnaire in Dhanusha and Parsa districts. Data was analyzed using both descriptive (frequency, percentage, median) and statistical inferences (Chi-square test, Kruskal Wallis H test, Mann Whitney U test, binary logistic regression) using SPSSvs20. Results: All respondents had heard about leprosy. Source of information on leprosy was mainly found to be health workers/hospitals (33.1%). Only 62.6% reported bacteria being its cause followed by other myths such as bad blood/curse/heredity/bad deeds (36%). Only 43.8% responded that leprosy is transmitted by prolonged close contact with leprosy patients and 25.7% reported religious rituals as the treatment. Only 42.1% had good knowledge and 40.9% had favorable attitude. Good knowledge of leprosy was highly associated with favorable attitude towards leprosy (P<0.001). The outcome variables- knowledge, attitude and EMIC score were found to have highly significant association with age, sex, ethnicity, religion, education and occupation of the respondents (P<0.001). Having knowledge on leprosy transmission was positively associated with favorable attitude towards leprosy (P<0.001). Conclusions: Strategizing the awareness programmes according to socio-demographic characteristics for enhancing the knowledge regarding leprosy cause, symptoms, transmission, prevention and treatment, can foster the positive community attitude towards leprosy affected persons. Enhancing positive attitude towards leprosy affected persons can reduce the community stigma, thus may increase their participation in the community. Positive attitude may further increase their early health seeking behaviour including their quality of life. © 2019 Singh et al.

AB  - Information and communication technologies have become essential and design-effective tools in the global healthcare system. Evidence suggests that information and communication technologies can promote nursing practice and patient satisfaction and quality of care. Competency with information and communication technologies is essential for both nurses and nursing students, and attitudes toward its use and perceived self-efficacy are important for implementation in the workplace. This study aimed to explore nurse and nursing student attitudes and perceived self-efficacy regarding information and communication technologies use in clinical practice and to examine professional and cultural differences between these groups in their attitudes and perceived self-efficacy in information and communication technologies use. A cross-sectional study was conducted among Israeli nursing students (n = 144) and registered nurses (n = 104). The findings revealed that respondents held overall positive attitudes toward information and communication technologies' use in clinical practice and perceived themselves as competent in this context. Significant differences were found between nurses and students in their attitudes toward information and communication technologies and information and communication technologies self-efficacy. Cultural group (Jewish/Arab) was found related to positive attitudes toward use of information and communication technologies in clinical practice. Nurse educators and managers should be aware of the potential impact of cultural and professional differences on the adoption and implementation of information and communication technologies and should institute initiatives within the organization and academia to manage cultural and professional discrepancies. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Studies have shown that despite the freedom of content creation and democratic participation, the digital space has also provided platforms for negative discourse with far-reaching implications for national unity and democracy. However, scant scholarly attention has been given to the prevalence and nature of online negative discourse in a pluralistic and politically complex society like Nigeria. Therefore, anchored on the Social Identity Theory (SIT), this study examined forms of intergroup discrimination as a negative discourse in the user-generated content (UGC) of online platforms of select Nigerian news media. Textual analysis of the UGC shows that as users react to news stories about national issues, they also create contents that reflect group identities and intergroup prejudices characterising Nigeria as a country with fragile unity. This phenomenon is a new socio-cultural order that poses serious threats to the peaceful co-existence and future of Nigeria—a nation grappling with sundry political, ethno-religious and security challenges. © 2019, Media Watch.

AB  - Waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) has gained significant attention recently because of increasing consumption and related environmental impacts. This work focuses on Lithuania and analyses the trends of WEEE generation and management during the period 2008–2015. Attitudes and behaviour of students and pupils (main future consumers) regarding WEEE are also determined in this work. The analysis shows that the generation and collection of WEEE in Lithuania have been on the rise since the global economic crisis. In total, approximately 16260 metric tonnes of WEEE were collected in 2015 in Lithuania. Most of the collected WEEE consisted of large home appliances and information technology and telecommunication equipment. In addition, the survey highlights that some small WEEE is still discarded together with municipal waste. Results also report that there is a need for more information about WEEE as such, as well as the need for more collection points and possibly a refund system. The study suggests that those aspects could be of importance for the efficiency of WEEE management systems and related policy implementation. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Research suggests that regulating negative emotional responses to threatening events can help reduce outgroup bias. The present research examined the effect of emotion regulation strategies on outgroup bias during relatively benign versus threatening time periods. Participants were assigned to regulate their emotions (reflection, rumination, or control) while reading a reminder of a past terrorist event and then reported their anger and bias toward Muslims. The bombings at the 2013 Boston Marathon occurred during data collection, which allowed us to examine the effect of emotion regulation on bias before versus after these events via a 3 (emotion regulation) x 2 (timing of bombings) between-subjects design. A two-way interaction between emotion regulation condition and timing emerged on bias and anger. Reflection (compared to rumination or control) reduced bias and anger toward Muslims but only after the bombings. The reduction in anger mediated the effect of reflection on bias only after the bombings. The results provide evidence that reflection is effective at reducing bias when people are experiencing an intense outgroup threat. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - This study aimed to gain insight into the interplay between citizens’ reactions on Twitter and governmental communications as well as their effects on self-reliant behaviour and trust. Two experimental studies were conducted. In Study 1, participants first received other citizens’ reactions followed by the government's communications about how to act. Participants received supporting, opposing, mixed, or no reactions from other citizens. In Study 2, participants first received the government's communications with either certain or uncertain crisis information, followed by the different citizens’ reactions. The results showed that citizens’ reactions via Twitter are not necessarily detrimental to the effectiveness of governmental communications regarding self-reliant behaviour. In addition, our findings suggest being careful with providing uncertain governmental communications during a crisis. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Recent extensions to the contact hypothesis reveal that different forms of contact, such as mediated intergroup contact, can reduce intergroup anxiety and improve attitudes toward the outgroup. This study draws on existing research to further consider the role of identification with an ingroup character within a narrative depicting intergroup contact between Muslim and non-Muslim Americans. Results reveal that identification with the non-Muslim (ingroup) model facilitated liking the Muslim (outgroup) model, which reduced prejudice toward Muslims more generally. Identification with the ingroup model also increased conversational self-efficacy and reduced anxiety about future intergroup interactions - both important aspects of improving intergroup relations. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing GmbH.

AB  - We investigated the role of positive and negative contact on outgroup attitudes, collective action tendencies, and psychological well-being among minority (Kurds) and majority (Turks) group members in a conflict area (N = 527), testing ingroup identification, relative deprivation, and perceived discrimination as potential mediators in these associations. Contrary to recent research studies demonstrating the superiority of negative contact effects, positive contact was generally a stronger determinant of the dependent variables, directly and indirectly, in both groups, although negative contact also had some direct and indirect associations with the outcomes. Findings highlight the need to incorporate the role of positive and negative contact to provide a full understanding of the potential benefits/costs of the contact strategy in conflict settings. © 2018 Hogrefe Publishing.

AB  - Partisan media—typically characterized by incivility—has become a defining element of the American political communication environment. While scholars have explored the consequences of partisan media for political attitudes and behaviors, little work has looked at how variations in incivility moderate partisan media’s effects. Using a population-based survey experiment, we show that incivility affectively depolarizes partisans when it comes from an in-party source (e.g., MSNBC for Democrats, Fox News for Republicans). Incivility on out-party sources affectively polarizes the audience, however, and we show that the respondent’s degree of conflict aversion conditions these effects. Our results raise intriguing normative questions about the trade-offs between polarization and incivility and highlight how scholars must account for both levels of incivility and partisan slant when studying the effects of partisan media. © 2018 by the Southern Political Science Association.

AB  - The current study employs an online survey of viewers of pornography featuring transgender performers (N = 250) to investigate the relationship between pornography consumption and attitudes toward transgender people. Results demonstrated a statistically significant but substantively weak association between greater pornography viewing and more positive attitudes toward transgender people. Additionally, results demonstrated that viewers’ experience of shame about their sexual attractions to transgender people did not moderate the relationship between porn viewing and attitudes. However, analysis revealed an unhypothesized direct influence of sexual shame on attitudes toward transgender people such that higher levels of shame were associated with greater prejudice. Results are discussed in the context of sexual scripting and the revived porn debates. Further longitudinal research focusing on how the feelings viewers have about the pornography they view impacts erotic media’s effects is encouraged. © 2018, © 2018 Eastern Communication Association.

AB  - Purpose: To explore the influence of media source, suspect's alleged criminal activity, and the rater's socio-demographic attributes on public ratings of video incidents of police use of force (PUF). Methods: A national online sample of 581 adults viewed and evaluated four different PUF videos in a 3 × 3 experimental design.Study participants were randomly assigned to experimental conditions involving differences in (1) media sources and (2) suspect's alleged criminal activity.The dependent variables included ratings of the credibility of the video's media source (i.e., trust in the source and accuracy of its video account) and the officer's conduct (i.e., excessive force, justifiable force).The independent and moderating variables included the experimental conditions, personal salience of PUF incidents, the rater's use of different media sources, and other socio-demographic attributes. Results: Three major results were found in this study: (1) video accounts of PUF are rated as more trustworthy when the video is attributed to “national TV news” source than “social media” outlets, (2) ratings of excessive force are more likely in PUF incidents when they involve a more dangerous offender (i.e., an alleged murder vs. shoplifter), and (3) the impact of the individual's socio-demographic characteristics on these public perceptions are strongly moderated by the personal salience of PUF incidents to the rater and their pattern of daily usage of conventional and social media. Conclusions: The visual content in short, video clips of PUF incidents strongly influences public attitudes about the officer's conduct as excessive and unjustifiable.However, by the timely release of the video images and framing them within their wider context, police departments may better demonstrate transparency and help overcome various cognitive biases that may underlie adverse public reactions to PUF incidents. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The field of biological psychiatry is controversial, with both academics and members of the public questioning the validity and the responsible use of psychiatric technological interventions. The field of neuroethics provides insight into these controversies by examining key themes that characterize specific topics, attitudes, and reasoning tools that people use to evaluate interventions in the brain and mind. This study offers new empirical neuroethical insights into how the public responds to the use and development of psychiatric technological interventions by comparing how the public evaluates pharmacological and neurosurgical psychiatric interventions, in the context of online comments on news media articles about these topics. We analyzed 1142 comments from 108 articles dealing with psychopharmacological and psychiatric neurosurgery interventions on websites of major circulation USA newspapers and magazines published between 2005 and 2015. Personal anecdote, medical professional issues, medicalization, social issues, disadvantages, scientific issues and cautionary realism were among the main themes raised by commenters. The insights derived from the comments can contribute to improving communication between professionals and the public as well as to incorporating the public's views in policy decisions about psychiatric interventions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study is the case of a breast cancer patient who visited the local unit of the Brahma Kumaris (BK). Conversations with the patient revealed that the patient was being treated in the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India. The treatment of the patient included the surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The patient narrated her ability to manage the psychological stress associated with the cancer treatment. She ascribed it to the positive attitude developed by her practice of the Rajyoga meditation from last 15 years. Rajyoga involved the daily meditation and regular listening to the specified commentary recommended by BK. Patient's health remains stable during the whole treatment process as analyzed by the mammography, histopathology and PET scan. The patient was also able to maintain the total body weight, biochemical and hematological profile within normal physiological range. The present case study is an attempt to provide Rajyoga as supportive means to the maintenance of patient's biochemical and hematological profile, and overall general health during breast cancer treatment. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019.

AB  - Bivalve aquaculture is an expanding industry and there is a strong need for the identification of ecologically and socially feasible levels of aquaculture production in order to promote sustainable growth. In this context, the concept of carrying capacity serves to determine acceptable limits for aquaculture expansion. This study compares three case studies from different parts of the world where bivalve aquaculture represents an important socio-economic activity. Through a media analysis, public perception of aquaculture is analyzed and critical aspects shaping the process of societal discussion in the different settings are discussed. Public perception of aquaculture-related activities was mainly positive for all three case studies, and local socio-economic characteristics were found to likely to drive the process of social carrying capacity estimation. This work aims to provide a basis for the advancement of the definition of sustainable practices required for an Ecosystem Approach to Aquaculture. Understanding local socio-economic settings and public perceptions on aquaculture is assumed an important first step towards accessing the social dimension of carrying capacity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - News media helps individuals think about the impacts of hosting the Olympic Games, enabling them to clarify or construct their own opinions toward an Olympic bid. This study aims to unveil the rationale underlying such media influence with the help of agenda setting theory. An experimental study was conducted in both China with 505 respondents and the US with 449 respondents in which media content was manipulated and framed as either positive or negative. The result confirmed the causal relationship between media content and resident attitude change. Although the moderating role of nation on media effect was not supported, it was found that the more initial interest the individual had in the Olympic Games, the more evident the media effect was. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The development of electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs) has made great progress and been expected to play an important role in a future transport system. Some researchers have explored the potential impacts of autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs), while few have focused on the public attitude towards AEVs. This paper aims to understand the public acceptance of AEVs through the application of Technology Acceptance Model. Considering the potential environmental benefits of AEVs, this study concentrates on how environmental concern affects AEVs acceptance. Data is collected from an online survey in China and analyzed by a structural model. The results indicate that green perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and environmental concern have a positive relationship with people's intentions to use AEVs. Environmental concern poses a powerful indirect effect on using intention through mediating effects. Implications for improving the public acceptance of AEVs and suggestions for further research are given correspondingly in this study. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The availability of electronic health (eHealth) information and disease-related community forums has grown over the last decade. Although patients and families frequently use these resources, their content has not been characterized in terms users, content, or reliability of information. eHealth communities therefore represent a potentially valuable but uncharted source of information about key patient issues, communication terminology, and unmet needs. We hypothesized that eHealth forums would contain terminology, themes, and advice inconsistent with resources from medical providers and references. To test this hypothesis, we performed a qualitative analysis of posts and responses from an open-access peripheral artery disease (PAD) eHealth community forum to characterize the discussion, participants, and the information being exchanged. Methods: Posts were collected from an online PAD Medical Support Community forum (MedHelp), which is open access, does not require participants to identify themselves, and is based in the United States. Posts were selected from threads in which the main topic was PAD, including diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment. Original posts and related responses were analyzed for thematic content, common vernacular, and self-reported characteristics of the participants using a qualitative analysis software program. Disease-specific comments and advice were evaluated for congruence with contemporary PAD treatment guidelines. Results: A total of 103 posts were collected and analyzed, including 40 original posts and 63 responses. Forty-five percent of the original posts and 19% of the responses were authored by participants who self-identified as patients with PAD. The remaining posts were authored by people with undeclared relationships to patients with PAD, followed by children, spouses, and other relatives. The most common themes among original posts included PAD diagnosis (and differential) (25%), treatment (23%), epidemiology and pathophysiology (21%), disease symptoms and impacts on activities of daily living (15%), and health-care provider recommendations (13%). Themes of responses included medical advice (40.5%), personal experiences with PAD (32.8%), and social support (12.6%). Negative attitudes were identified in 10 of 18 (55.6%) posts related to experiences with health-care providers. Of all medical advice, 15.1% was inconsistent with clinical treatment guidelines. Conclusion: eHealth communities are a rich source of information related to the experiences of patients with PAD, their treatment preferences, questions they consider important, and terminology that they use. This information can be used to understand unmet patient needs, develop educational resources, and improve communication. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Skin cancer is a prominent public health concern in Australia. The desire to darken skin tone is derived, in part, from portrayals of people with tanned skin on social media. Methods: The current study pilot tested a social media literacy intervention that aimed to decrease positive attitudes to tanning and improve the capacity to be critical of social media and the messages promulgated. A total of 84 young women (aged 18–29; M = 22.30, SD = 2.97) participated in the study, 28 in a Facebook group and 56 in a wait-list control group, with the latter receiving the intervention materials at the conclusion of the study. Results: The intervention resulted in significantly decreased positive tanning attitudes in the intervention group compared to the control group and improved media literacy skills in both groups. Intervention group participants reported significantly less internalization of a tanned ideal, appearance comparisons, and tanning intentions than control group participants. Conclusions: Media literacy education is a novel strategy to reduce the harmful effect of social media messages about tanning on skin cancer risk factors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective: Even though the dual process of aggression is acknowledged as a mediator of violent behavior, few studies have explored the implicit aspect of violence-supportive cognition. The current study advances understanding of the implicit attitude toward violence and suggests evaluative conditioning (EC) as a strategy to change the implicit violence-supportive attitude of juvenile offenders. Method: A total of 100 juvenile offenders and nonoffenders were randomly assigned to a treatment or control condition, and EC or control intervention was followed depending on the condition. The explicit and implicit attitudes toward violence of the juvenile offender and nonoffender groups were assessed pre- and postintervention by a self-report and implicit association test. Results: Preintervention results indicated that the offender group revealed a less negative implicit attitude toward violence than the nonoffender group did, whereas there was no significant group difference in the explicit attitude toward violence. Postintervention results showed a significant improvement in the violence implicit association test score after the EC intervention in the treatment condition of the offender group. Conclusions: These findings indicate that implicit and explicit attitudes could be expressed independently and that juvenile offenders have more implicit violence-supportive cognition than do nonoffenders. EC intervention was found to be an effective method to correct the implicit attitude toward violence of the juvenile offender group, which suggests that specific interventions for violence-supportive implicit attitudes should be considered. © 2018 American Psychological Association.

AB  - The present research unites two emergent trends in the area of language attitudes: (a) research on perceptions of nonnative speakers by nonnative listeners and (b) the search for general, basic mechanisms underlying the evaluation of nonnative accented speakers. In three experiments featuring an employment situation, German participants listened to a presentation given in English by a German speaker with a strong versus native-like accent (in Studies 1–3) versus a native speaker of English (in Study 1). They evaluated candidates with a strong accent worse than candidates with a native(-like) pronunciation—even to the degree that the quality of arguments was of no relevance (Study 1). Study 2 introduces an effective intervention to reduce these discriminatory tendencies. Across studies, affect and competence emerged as major mediators of hirability evaluations. Study 3 further revealed sequential indirect influences, which advance our understanding of previous inconsistent findings regarding disfluency and warmth perceptions. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Background: Herbal medicine has been widely utilized by pregnant women despite the limited available evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of that practice. The current available studies, from different countries, estimated that the use of herbal medicine during pregnancy range from 7% up to 96%. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence, attitude, source of information, and reasoning behind the use of herbal medicine among pregnant women in Saudia Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted using a convenience sample including pregnant women who visited the obstetric clinics at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A survey was administered in order to evaluate the prevalence and perception toward herbal medicine use among pregnant women in Saudi Arabia. Results: A total of 297 pregnant women completed the survey. The results showed that 56% of the respondents have used some type of herbal medicine during their pregnancy. Olive oil was utilized in 26% of the respondents followed by cumin 20% and garlic 15%. In addition, 37% of the respondents used herbal medicine by their own initiative, while 33% and 12% used herbal medicine based on recommendations from their families and friends, respectively. Furthermore, 19% of the respondents reported a positive attitude toward herbal medicine use during pregnancy. In addition, the percentage of women with positive attitude was marginally higher among respondents with lower educational level. Conclusion: The prevalence of using herbal medicine is considerably high among pregnant women in Saudi Arabia. Unfortunately, the majority of the users relied on informal sources to use herbal medicine during pregnancy. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - How to understand the propagation properties of infectious diseases among the population is an important topic in the field of epidemic modelling. In this paper, we investigate the interaction between the disease transmission and disease-related awareness spread, and then propose a new coupled disease spreading model on a two-layered multiplex network, where one layer denotes the underlying topology for the epidemics and the other one represents the corresponding topology for the awareness spread. In the current model, once the information about the disease is acquired by some susceptible ones, it is assumed that they will take the preventive measures to reduce the probability of being infected (e.g., social distancing or taking the vaccine). In the epidemic layer, the transmission dynamics among nodes can be characterized with the classic SIR (susceptible-infective-recovered) model, and those individuals who obtain the disease information will cut down their rate of being infected with a multiplicative factor γ during the course of disease transmission; while in the awareness layer, we will employ the UAU (unaware-aware-unaware) model to denote the diffusion of information. Meanwhile, we explore the impact of mass media on the spread of infectious diseases in the model. Based on the microscopic Markovian chain approach, we build the probability tree to describe the switching process among different states and then establish the different equations for the state transition in detail. Furthermore, we analytically derive the epidemic threshold regarding the disease propagation, which is correlated with the multiplex network topology and the coupling relationship between two classes of spreading dynamics, and extensive simulations also validate the theoretical predictions. Current results are beneficial for us to deeply understand the contagion characteristics of real epidemics within the population. © 2018

AB  - This study seeks to investigate the impact of an exposure to a university's social media on publics’ perceptions during a crisis. Data from this study showed that participants (N = 269) expressed more favourable evaluations towards the university and their perceived severity was mitigated after viewing its official statement on university's Facebook posts. The results of this empirical research offer a meaningful suggestion to crisis communication scholars and practitioners interested in assessing the impact of universities’ statements in social media by providing ways to understand the importance of the organizational usage of social media during a crisis, why that is important, and why practitioners should make effective social media communication tactics a priority during a crisis. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Sponsorship in pro-environmental social marketing campaigns has received limited academic attention within a higher education (HEI) context. This study examines how multi-level variables, i.e. individual (general environmental attitudes), organisational (scepticism toward the HEI’s environmental corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives; perceived HEI behaviour) and campaign-related (attitudes toward the advertisement; attitudes toward the corporate sponsor) factors, influence university students’ environmental intentions in response to a corporate-sponsored environmental initiative; using mixed methods (231 surveys and 40 interviews). Questionnaires revealed that scepticism toward the HEI’s CSR initiatives led to less positive perceptions of the HEI’s environmental behaviour, which decreased positive attitudes toward the advertisement and environmental intentions. Interviews revealed that the corporate sponsor seemed to motivate environmental behavioural intentions due to product discounts related to the sponsorship. Thus, a corporate sponsor may have confounding effects on pro-environmental behaviour campaigns. This has implications for the use of sponsorship in environmental social marketing campaigns. © 2018, © 2018 Society for Research into Higher Education.

AB  - The primary purpose of these studies was to investigate associations between religiosity, political ideology, and attitudes toward immigrants using a mediation path-analytic approach. Respondents in two nationally representative samples of Americans (Studies 1 and 2) completed single items assessing general religiosity, political ideology, and immigrant prejudice. University students (Studies 3 and 4) completed measures of religious fundamentalism (RF), political ideology, and perceived realistic and symbolic threats posed by immigrants. Across the four studies, there were small to medium positive relationships between measures of religiosity and prejudice toward immigrants and consistent evidence that religiosity influences immigrant prejudice through political ideology (i.e., significant indirect relationships). None of the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) included zero for total or indirect effects of religiosity on immigrant prejudice. However, when liberal political ideology was included as the mediator, the relationship between religiosity and immigrant prejudice weakened to statistical and practical nonsignificance. These four studies reveal the role political ideology plays in associations between measures of religiosity and attitudes toward immigrants.

AB  - The present research aims to verify the presence of linguistic biases in crime news reports (Study 1) and their role (Study 2) in activating a crime stereotype toward racial/ethnic minorities. In a first content analysis study, the natural occurrence of a set of linguistic biases was analyzed in Italian news articles that described comparable crimes committed by an in- or an outgroup aggressor. Results indicated that when the crime was committed by an outgroup (vs. ingroup) member, more aggravating and less attenuating adjectives were used. Moreover, the nationality of the perpetrator was not only mentioned more frequently, it also appeared in most cases as a noun. In Study 2, participants read a fictitious news article that either described an in- or outgroup criminal act with neutral or biased language. Their implicit associations between in- and outgroup members and weapons (vs. tools) were measured immediately afterward in the weapon paradigm. Results confirmed that a biased (vs. neutral) language use increased participants' crime-related associations with the outgroup in general only when an outgroup criminal was staged. The role of media portrayals in determining the cognitive representations of racial/ethnic minorities is discussed. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.

AB  - We investigated the negation of media stereotypes. Negation refers to an internal attempt to negate stereotypic content ("No! This is not true!"). The process of negation is important because a critical assessment of stereotypic content can be beneficial for stereotype and prejudice reduction. This fact is a crucial reason why readers' disagreement regarding simplified stereotypic depictions is of central interest for mass communication research and media literacy campaigns. Importantly, factors that can increase negation are of special interest. Although the ability and motivation to process stereotypic content can be theoretically identified as potential influencing factors, media-stereotype research has not yet tested the influence of these factors on negation. In Experiment 1 (N = 347), we manipulated the motivation to negate by presenting awareness material. We informed some of the participants that the news media often do not represent the world as it is, but sometimes do so in a stereotypic way. Analyses revealed that participants who received the awareness material before reading negated to a higher extent. In Experiment 2 (N = 223), we investigated the impact of ability by manipulating the time participants had to negate stereotypic content. The ability to negate was assumed to be higher the more time the participants had to process stereotypic information. As hypothesized, negation was higher when there was more time available. Interestingly, the increase in effect size was dampened the more time was available, which indicated a curvilinear relationship. Implications for media-literacy campaigns are discussed. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.

AB  - Drawing from the literature on sexual stigma, the principal aim of this study was to investigate predictors of heterosexual's internalization of negative attitudes regarding lesbian and gay parenting and the mediating role of beliefs in the controllability of homosexuality. A Portuguese sample of 1,430 heterosexual women and 502 heterosexual men responded to an online questionnaire about attitudes toward lesbian and gay parenting. Structural equation modeling was used to explore attitudinal predictors and mediation analysis. Mediation analyses revealed that sexual prejudice toward same-gender-parented families was predicted by gender, age, education, and religiosity, in that heterosexual men, those who were older, had less education, and were more religious held significantly more negative beliefs about lesbian and gay parenting, as well as lower perception of benefits associated with lesbian and gay parenting. Further, etiological beliefs mediated the effects of gender, age, and religiosity on sexual attitudes, highlighting the importance of the perception of controllability of homosexuality in justifying sexual prejudice. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Media literacy, the critical analysis and deconstruction of media messages, has the potential to promote favorable attitudes toward members of racial minority groups. This study reports on the development and implementation of two types of media literacy interventions (i.e., critical and stereotype) aimed at enhancing college students' attitudes toward Blacks and Latinos. Students from 5 sections of the same course took part in a quasi-experiment and were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 interventions or to a control group. Students' attitudes were measured at 3 different times during the study: 6 weeks before the intervention, immediately following the intervention, and 6 weeks after the intervention. Both interventions enhanced students' attitudes toward Blacks and Latinos but the stereotype intervention was more effective than the critical one, both for short- and long-term effects, as the latter disappeared in the critical condition. Attitudes of students in the control group remained the same throughout the study. Implications address how to use media literacy to enhance conversation about race relations. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Given the focus of the media on female candidate appearance in the 2008 presidential election, this research investigates the effects on voter evaluations of calling attention to female candidate attractiveness. The current research hypothesizes that pointing out candidate attractiveness likely has a negative effect on subsequent evaluations and reports of vote likelihood, particularly for female candidates. Role congruity theory, which argues that evidence of prejudice against female leaders is the result of a discrepancy between people’s stereotypes of women and their stereotypes of leaders, provides an explanation for these findings. This study establishes the negative influence of calling attention to a candidate’s attractiveness. In particular, a female candidate described as attractive are evaluated more negatively than a male candidate described as attractive and compared to male and female candidates, who are not described as attractive. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study was conducted to conceptualise advertising value and consumer attitudes towards advertisements. The research was developed to reveal the effect of the source of advertisements on credibility perception through the theoretical framework of Ducoffe's (1995) advertising value model. The research objective is to identify source derogation in terms of credibility to create advertising value and a positive attitude towards advertisements launched through the Facebook social network. In this regard, the study used three distinct sources to generate and introduce product promotional messages: an associative reference group, an aspirational reference group and marketers themselves. This research revealed significant differences in developing advertisement value and forming a favourable attitude towards advertisements when the product-related message was developed by these three distinct groups, who have different source derogations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study explored the strength of national identification and intergroup attitudes of Chinese youth (n = 591, aged 12–15) toward the Chinese, the Americans, the Japanese, and the South Koreans. The participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire and write down reasons why they ‘like’ or ‘dislike’ the four groups. The results showed a consistency in in-group favoritism. Gender and age were both related to Chinese youths’ national identifications and their national intergroup attitudes. Confucian ethics, media influence and historical complex were identified as main factors that may contribute to their attitudes toward the four groups. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.
