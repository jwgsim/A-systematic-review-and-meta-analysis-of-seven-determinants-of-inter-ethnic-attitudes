T1  - Neoliberal representations of Muslims and the Islamic world: a discourse analysis of imaginative geographies in Brazilian local and regional print media
AN  - 2695623042
AB  - Since 9/11, representations of Muslims and the Islamic world in Western mass media have received much scholarly attention, not least because such representations influence how Muslims are perceived by and integrated into Western societies. Most existing studies have shown that Muslims and Islam tend to be framed negatively through orientalist and Islamophobic discourses. However, this paper argues that in specific contexts, neoliberal ideology has generated mass-media representations of Muslims and the Islamic world that differ from orientalist versions. In contexts relating to the globalised halal market, for example, neoliberal discourses portray Muslims and the Islamic world as economically useful and/or exploitable rather than culturally threatening. This argument is supported by an analysis of representations of Muslims and the Islamic world in local and regional newspapers in Brazil, one of the largest halal meat and poultry exporters in the world. Drawing on theories of neoliberalism, a discourse theoretical approach and the notion of imaginative geographies, the study examines newspaper articles on the halal business. Based on the findings, this paper suggests that scholars should subject neoliberal ideology (and its interaction with orientalism and Islamophobia) to greater scrutiny in future research on representations of Muslims and the Islamic world.

T1  - Online interventions for reducing hate speech and cyberhate: A systematic review
AN  - 2676551114
AB  - BackgroundThe unique feature of the Internet is that individual negative attitudes toward minoritized and racialized groups and more extreme, hateful ideologies can find their way onto specific platforms and instantly connect people sharing similar prejudices. The enormous frequency of hate speech/cyberhate within online environments creates a sense of normalcy about hatred and the potential for acts of intergroup violence or political radicalization. While there is some evidence of effective interventions to counter hate speech through television, radio, youth conferences, and text messaging campaigns, interventions for online hate speech have only recently emerged.ObjectivesThis review aimed to assess the effects of online interventions to reduce online hate speech/cyberhate.Search MethodsWe systematically searched 2 database aggregators, 36 individual databases, 6 individual journals, and 34 websites, as well as bibliographies of published reviews of related literature, and scrutiny of annotated bibliographies of related literature.Inclusion CriteriaWe included randomized and rigorous quasi‐experimental studies of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions that measured the creation and/or consumption of hateful content online and included a control group. Eligible populations included youth (10–17 years) and adult (18+ years) participants of any racial/ethnic background, religious affiliation, gender identity, sexual orientation, nationality, or citizenship status.Data Collection and AnalysisThe systematic search covered January 1, 1990 to December 31, 2020, with searches conducted between August 19, 2020 and December 31, 2020, and supplementary searches undertaken between March 17 and 24, 2022. We coded characteristics of the intervention, sample, outcomes, and research methods. We extracted quantitative findings in the form of a standardized mean difference effect size. We computed a meta‐analysis on two independent effect sizes.Main ResultsTwo studies were included in the meta‐analysis, one of which had three treatment arms. For the purposes of the meta‐analysis we chose the treatment arm from the Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study that most closely aligned with the treatment condition in the Bodine‐Baron et al. (2020) study. However, we also present additional single effect sizes for the other treatment arms from the Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study. Both studies evaluated the effectiveness of an online intervention for reducing online hate speech/cyberhate. The Bodine‐Baron et al. (2020) study had a sample size of 1570 subjects, while the Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study had a sample size of 1469 tweets (nested in 180 subjects). The mean effect was small (g = −0.134, 95% confidence interval [−0.321, −0.054]). Each study was assessed for risk of bias on the following domains: randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, and selection of the reported results. Both studies were rated as “low risk” on the randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, and measurement of the outcome domains. We assessed the Bodine‐Baron et al. (2020) study as “some” risk of bias regarding missing outcome data and “high risk” for selective outcome reporting bias. The Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study was rated as “some concern” for the selective outcome reporting bias domain.Authors' ConclusionsThe evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions for reducing the creation and/or consumption of hateful content online. Gaps in the evaluation literature include the lack of experimental (random assignment) and quasi‐experimental evaluations of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions, addressing the creation and/or consumption of hate speech as opposed to the accuracy of detection/classification software, and assessing heterogeneity among subjects by including both extremist and non‐extremist individuals in future intervention studies. We provide suggestions for how future research on online hate speech/cyberhate interventions can fill these gaps moving forward.

T1  - Mobile application for couple relationships: Results of a pilot effectiveness study
AN  - 2672498582
AB  - Mobile apps in mental health have seen a significant growth in recent years. Most of them are aimed at treating depression, anxiety, and stress disorders using cognitive behavioural therapy methods and relatively few apps are being developed to address interpersonal issues. This study tested the effectiveness of the iCognito Relationship Program, a self‐help application for couple relationships based on the chatbot technology. A between‐group experimental study was conducted in Russia using the bibliotherapy as a control condition (N = 58, female sample), with results showing that, after 2 weeks, iCognito's users had increased satisfaction, tenderness, constructive communication, as well as commitment to the relationship. Also, indicators for relationship self‐efficacy, communicative skills in relationships, and self‐esteem regarding relationship skills had significantly increased, while level of conflicts had decreased. A medium effect size was reported for most indicators. The participants of an experimental group expressed a high level of satisfaction with the technology and a generally positive attitude towards the idea of working with a “virtual psychologist”‐chatbot on their personal issues. Despite the need to reproduce the research results, iCognito program demonstrates that both mobile application and chatbot technologies can be useful for training individuals’ relationship satisfaction and communication skills, and that they can be more efficient in increasing satisfaction and reducing conflict in relationships than self‐help books.Alternate abstract:En los últimos años, las aplicaciones móviles en la salud mental han crecido considerablemente. La mayoría están orientadas a tratar trastornos de depresión, ansiedad y estrés usando métodos de la terapia cognitivo‐conductual, pero se están desarrollando relativamente pocas aplicaciones para abordar problemas interpersonales. En este estudio se evaluó la eficacia de la iCognito Relationship Program, una aplicación de autoayuda para las relaciones de pareja basada en la tecnología de bots de charla. Se realizó un estudio experimental intergrupal en Rusia usando la biblioterapia como condición de control (N = 58, muestra femenina), cuyos resultados demostraron que, después de 2 semanas, los usuarios de iCognito habían aumentado la satisfacción, la amabilidad, la comunicación constructiva y el compromiso con la relación. Además, los indicadores de la autoeficacia de la relación, las habilidades comunicativas en las relaciones y la autoestima con respecto a las habilidades relacionales habían aumentado significativamente, mientras que el nivel de conflictos había disminuido. Se informó un tamaño del efecto mediano para la mayoría de los indicadores. Los participantes de un grupo experimental expresaron un alto nivel de satisfacción con la tecnología y una actitud generalmente positiva hacia la idea de trabajar con un “psicólogo virtual” en un bot de charla sobre sus problemas personales. A pesar de la necesidad de reproducir los resultados de la investigación, el programa iCognito demuestra que tanto la aplicación móvil como las tecnologías de bot de charla pueden ser útiles para formar las habilidades de satisfacción con la relación y de comunicación de las personas, y que pueden ser más eficaces que los libros de autoayuda a la hora de aumentar la satisfacción y reducir el conflicto en las relaciones.Alternate abstract:近年来, 心理健康方面的移动应用程序有了很大的发展。它们中的大多数旨在针对使用认知行为疗法的方法来治疗抑郁症、焦虑症和压力症的治疗过程, 而解决人际关系问题的应用程序开发中的相对较少。本研究测试了ICOGNITO这个有关伴侣关系的程序的有效性, ICOGNITO是一个基于聊天机器人技术的两性关系的自助应用程序。在俄罗斯进行了一项组间实验研究, 以书信疗法作为对照条件 (N = 58, 女性样本), 结果显示, 2周后, ICOGNITO的用户在满意度、温柔度、建设性的沟通以及对关系的承诺方面都有所提高。另外, 关系的自我效能感、人际关系中的沟通技巧以及对关系技巧的自尊都有明显增加, 而冲突程度则有所下降。大多数指标的效应大小被报告为中等。实验组的参与者对该技术表示高度满意, 并对与 "虚拟心理学家" 聊天机器人合作解决他们的个人问题的想法普遍持积极态度。 尽管需要再次试验验证研究结果, 但ICOGNITO项目表明, 手机应用和聊天机器人技术对训练个人的关系满意度和沟通技巧都很有用, 而且在提高关系满意度和减少冲突方面比那些自助书籍会更有效。

T1  - Structural Predictors of Underemployment During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Psychology of Working Perspective
AN  - 2669997813
AB  - In the present study, we surveyed a sample of working adults (N = 495) in the United States to understand experiences with underemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing from psychology of working theory, we examined a structural model linking economic constraints and experiences of marginalization to underemployment, as mediated by work volition and moderated by perceptions of economic conditions. Economic constraints, experiences of marginalization, and work volition all significantly predicted underemployment, accounting for 52% of the variance. Additionally, work volition served as a significant, but minor, mediator variable and economic conditions were a significant moderator linking economic constraints and experiences of marginalization to work volition. The negative effect of these constructs on work volition was mitigated when participants had more favorable perceptions of the economy at large. Findings may have implications for both research and practice, highlighting the importance of assessing structural and psychological factors to understand individuals’ work experiences.

T1  - The Mediating Role of Self-Forgiveness in the Relationship between Perceived Social Support and Adjustment to Divorce
AN  - 2658990869
AB  - The aim of the research was to determine the predictive strength of perceived social support on divorce adjustment process, and the mediating role of self-forgiveness in this predictive relationship. In line with this, the hypothetical structural model was tested with a total of 150 individuals who were divorced or in the legal divorce process. The findings showed that perceived social support positively predicted divorce adjustment at high levels, positive and negative attitudes of self-forgiveness did not significantly predict divorce adjustment, and additionally, they did not function as mediating variables in the prediction of divorce adjustment by perceived social support. The fit indices of the tested model revealed good level of fit. The findings were discussed within the framework of the relevant literature and the cultural context.

T1  - Rejection sensitivity and interaction quality in everyday life
AN  - 2609042698
AB  - The elevated satisfaction that comes from interacting with close ties, as opposed to distal ties, is well-established in past research. What remains less clear is how the quality of daily interactions between close versus distal ties may vary as a function of personality. Drawing on data from a 2-week experience sampling study (N = 108 participants, N = 7755 observations), we consider how trait rejection sensitivity (RS)—or the tendency to worry about potential social rejection—interacts with perceived closeness and interaction channel (i.e., face-to-face vs. technology-mediated) in daily life. We find that individuals who are high (vs. low) in rejection sensitivity not only view distal tie interactions as less satisfying, they also perceive close tie exchanges as more enjoyable and supportive—but only for technology-mediated (vs. face-to-face) interactions. We also find that individuals who are high in rejection sensitivity have higher variability in the perceived quality of their interactions. These findings demonstrate the interlocked factors of personality tendencies, perceived closeness, and interaction channel in shaping the variability in the quality of daily interactions.

T1  - Trends in Health Equity Among Children in the United States, 1997–2018
AN  - 2598301957
AB  - ObjectivesHealth equity is crucial to population health. To achieve this aim, extensive monitoring efforts beyond traditional disparities research are required. This analysis assesses trends in health equity for children from 1997 to 2018.MethodsHealth equity in a given year is calculated using a previously developed measure as the mean weighted departure of individual health from the best achievable level of health. This criterion is defined as the median health of the most socially privileged identifiable group: white, non-Latinx boys in upper-income households.Using more than 20 years of data from the National Health Interview Survey, we apply this methodology to six measures of child health: parent-reported health status, school days missed due to illness or injury in the past year, a strength and difficulties questionnaire score, emotional difficulties, a toddler mental health indicator score, and toddler depression. We separately calculate racial/ethnic and income disparities.Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess whether trends are statistically significant.ResultsHealth equity among children increased gradually over the past 2 decades, with five of the six measures demonstrating upward trends. Improvements in health equity are stronger among younger children (age 0–3 and 4–7). Unlike previous work examining adults, both types of disparities narrowed over the study period.Conclusions for PracticeProgress on health equity requires accountability to an objective metric. This analysis suggests some improvement over the past two decades, although these gains are under threat from potential decreases in government spending on programs affecting children and the COVID-19 pandemic.

T1  - Is Touch in Romantic Relationships Universally Beneficial for Psychological Well-Being? The Role of Attachment Avoidance
AN  - 2571580474
AB  - Affectionate touch is crucial for well-being. However, attachment avoidance is associated with negative attitudes toward touch. We tested two preregistered hypotheses about how attachment avoidance influences the association between touch in romantic couples and psychological well-being. We examined whether greater attachment avoidance is associated with a reduced link between touch and well-being, and/or whether reduced touch mediates the relationship between attachment avoidance and lower well-being. Across three studies, including two dyadic ones, we measured retrospective self-reports (Studies 1 and 2), laboratory observations (Study 2), and daily experiences (Study 3) of touch. Touch and well-being were positively associated, and attachment avoidance was associated with lower well-being and less frequent touch. Touch was associated with greater well-being regardless of level of attachment avoidance, and less frequent touch mediated the negative association between attachment avoidance and well-being in most analyses. This underscores the importance of touch, even for those valuing distance and autonomy.

T1  - Let’s think about family visits in prison: a case of participatory research and committed art in Spain
AN  - 2560018192
AB  - This paper presents a research project carried out with participatory methodology in which the collaborative creation of an audiovisual has been the driving element of a complex process of inquiry about prison reality. The objective of the project is to describe, reveal and denounce how conjugal and family visits to inmates in prison take place. We have employed artistic co-creation and media literacy as facilitators of the participation of social groups without a voice. The project is structured as a qualitative case study. The participating group consists of six men in a Centre for Social Integration, the social worker and three researchers. The results discuss the possibilities offered by art as a viable social transformative practice. Likewise, the possibilities of art as social activism and as a facilitator of new forms of knowledge accessible to all are analysed. Finally, as a device of digital artivism, the audiovisual will be disseminated.

T1  - Ableist contours of Down syndrome in Australia: Facebook attitudes towards existence and parenting of people with Down syndrome
AN  - 2535020176
AB  - The emergence of online disability hate speech on social media platforms is the latest form of ableist expression. This was highlighted when an alarming amount of negative attitudinal responses emerged towards people with Down syndrome and their parents on the 60 Minutes Facebook platform to their segment ‘Does Australia really want to see the end of Down syndrome?’This article analyses the varying contours of ableism within these responses. The responses could be categorised into three broad themes: the construction of Down syndrome as an economic burden on society and a drain on public resources; social attitudes to Down syndrome; and bias related to information provided by the medical profession to pregnant women with a high probability of a Down syndrome birth.These findings allowed us to interrogate what this means in terms of how Australians view difference associated with Down syndrome, and to consider the operationalisation of ableism within the Australian social landscape.

T1  - Everyday secrecy: boundaries of confidential gossip
AN  - 2507807812
AB  - Gossip is an everyday part of organizational life and has been increasingly researched. However, some gossip has a particular character, whereby it is to some degree secret. Drawing on studies of both gossip and secrecy, in this paper we explore this ‘confidential gossip’ via a participant observation case study. This was based on an internship with Quinza, a British media company, and had a covert element which is discussed and justified. Specifically, we show how the boundaries around confidential gossip are marked in organizational interactions. The paper contributes to existing knowledge about organizational gossip by showing the particular significance of secrecy which makes confidential gossip a more potent source of group inclusion and exclusion.

T1  - What Makes Diets Political? Moral Foundations and the Left-Wing-Vegan Connection
AN  - 2573636474
AB  - Though meat-consumption is known to be a key factor in environmental damage, veganism and vegetarianism are still perceived to be left-wing-phenomena, ironically not penetrating to those who hold ideologies of conservation. Logical contradictions and historical counter-examples cast doubt on a substantive connection between political orientation and meat-eating. Instead, common psychological factors may predispose people toward both: left vs. right-wing political orientation and self-restrictive vs. omnivore eating preferences. Moral foundations have been shown to explain why even seemingly contradictory issue stances are brought forward in the context of the same ideological or political orientation. Here, we expand on these findings by showing the moral foundations to connect political orientation and vegan and vegetarian eating preferences as well as specific strategies of meat-eating justification in a large German sample. Specifically, the binding foundations authority and purity as well as avoidance tendencies are shown to differentially interact with meat-eating across the political spectrum with stronger effects for left-wing adherents and centrists than for the right-wing. Mediation analyses reveal that substantive parts of the association between political orientation and self-restriction in eating are attributable to differences in the moral makeup of left- and right-wing adherents. Connecting our results to prior work on the explanatory power of moral foundations for the political polarization of environmentalism, we discuss how our results may inform inter-ideologically appealing communications of reducing meat consumption, which is a worthwhile and necessary goal for mitigating climate change.

T1  - The Miseducation of the Elite
AN  - 2487417752
AB  - One of the most widely accepted arguments in favor  of affirmative action stems from a concern with diversifying the perspectives and voices of those who hold positions of power in society. If we accept the democratic principle that all who are affected by collective decisions should have the opportunity to influence their outcome, then we ought to be concerned that representatives, who mediate such decisions in a representative democracy, should be drawn from all sectors of society. Although in the political philosophy literature much of the focus has been on elected representatives, there are many others who have a disproportionate amount of power in making their voices heard in the collective decision-making process: lawyers, lobbyists, doctors, journalists, academics, to name but a few. Historically, certain groups-racial minorities and women being central examples-have been systematically excluded from this elite. Consequently, members of marginalized groups have not only lacked political influence, but haven't been included as epistemic contributors to critical decision making. In order to mitigate this exclusion, many have been rightly concerned with diversifying the elite so that it is more inclusive of the perspectives of members of historically marginalized groups. And, given the disproportionate role that highly selective colleges and universities play in constituting that elite, this had led to support for affirmative action in admissions to those educational institutions.

T1  - YouTube Queer Communities as Heterotopias: Space, Identity and “Realness” in Queer South African Vlogs
AN  - 2469981357
AB  - YouTube has provided a platform for many queer vloggers in South Africa to find audiences and to represent queer lives via a public medium. The platform allows for multiple queer identities to be represented in dynamic ways, complicating the ways in which mainstream mass media often stereotype or distort queer lives and experiences, and simultaneously challenging the widespread social marginalisation of queer people. This article explores how queer South African vloggers have created communities that function as heterotopias, spaces that allow for social and cultural norms to be contested or reversed. These heterotopian YouTube communities provide forums where identity, space and authenticity or “realness” are invoked and reimagined in ways that speak back to the limitations or oppressions experienced in offline spaces. The communities also offer viewers and commenters the space to share, reflect on and demonstrate support for the experiences of others. Videos of influential South African vloggers are analysed to demonstrate the heterotopic potential of these queer communities.

T1  - The Socio-economic Effects Of Covid-19 Lockdown in Nigeria: Implications on Micro and Macro Economy
AN  - 2583607000
AB  - Many countries across the planet are facing unprecedented challenges as a result of COVID-19 infections. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country is no exception. The government has implemented a range of measures to curb the spread of the pandemic, including closure of international airports, shutting down of institutions, markets/stores etc. On March 29th, an initial four-week state-wide lockdown was declared in three major states, Lagos, Abuja and Ogun, halting all essential activities. Following this Executive Order, state governments throughout the country took stringent measures such as restrictions on inter-state travel, instituting curfews, etc. Against this backdrop, the paper reviewed the socio-economic effects of COVID-19 lockdown in Nigeria and its implications on the micro and macro economy. The study adopted the systems theory. Due to safety protocols established by health experts on the COVID-19 pandemic, data for the study were drawn from participant observation, media commentaries and authentic secondary sources. The content analytical technique was used to review the literature on the subject matter. The study reported that the halt in business activities in the country has rendered many penniless and unable to provide for themselves the basic amenities needed for the duration ofthe lockdown. The study concluded that Federal Government of Nigeria should waive payments on personal and corporate income tax for the second quarter and third quarter of 2020, considering that the shock has affected the income andprofits ofhouseholds and businesses.

AB  - The changes in the global mediascape have had a tremendous impact on societal news flows. Using data from the Social Survey Austria 2018 and a quantitative application of the media repertoire approach, the article illustrates how information behavior and news seeking relate to social status, political orientation and sociodemographics. The results confirm that the developments in Austria—often referred to as a representative of a traditional media landscape—are mostly in line with international trends, as new media have been added to the media repertoires of approximately two-thirds of the sample. Effects tied to social inequality generally match previous assumptions: Higher educational achievements and income lead to more diversified news repertoires. Additionally, the overall structure of the data indicates that the online-only users are still a small minority, consisting of younger individuals who are less likely to work and more likely to vote for left-wing parties.

T1  - Fear of crime in France: a partial test of Ferraro’s risk interpretation model
AN  - 2471472256
AB  - Conflicting with its Republican idealism, France’s colonial legacy and history of xenophobia has led to riots by the first-, second-, and third-generation immigrants who experienced unemployment and social marginalization. Motivated by politicians advocating for expanded police powers to search and arrest citizens, the French media reported these unemployment issues causing an increase in crime and police brutality in immigrant-dominated neighborhoods, only to increase feelings of insecurity and fear of crime among the French population. Thus, theoretically informed by Ferraro’s (Fear of crime: interpreting victimization risk, State University of New York Press, Albany, 1995) risk interpretation model, the present study plans to identify the factors that predict variations in fear of crime among a representative sample of persons age 15 and older living in France. While individual-level factors such as gender, economic marginalization, health problems, perceived discrimination, prior experience with victimization, and living in a large city are more likely to predict a higher level of fear of crime, in the overall sample, one’s immigrant status does not affect one’s level of perceived safety. Inter-group comparisons indicate that among natives, gender and perceived discrimination have a stronger effect on fear of crime, while residency in large urban areas and victimization have a stronger influence on immigrants’ feelings of unsafety.

T1  - Exposure to Difference on Facebook, Trust, and Political Knowledge
AN  - 2454626606
AB  - Building off of literatures in the areas of network heterogeneity, oppositional networks, cross-cutting exposure, incidental information exposure, and trust, we suggested that Facebook networks characterized by inclusion of people different from the self have the potential to facilitate the inflow of diverse and attitudinally-dissonant information, and, as such, have potential for political knowledge obtainment. We further theorized that this relationship would be conditioned on forms of social and institutional trust that serve as important attention- and elaboration-inducing cues. The results generally supported these contentions, indicating that the relationship between maintenance of Facebook networks comprised of people perceived to be different than the self and political knowledge was moderated by social trust, trust in knowledge-producing institutions, and news trust. Subsequent analyses suggested that the moderating effects ofnews trust on the relationship between ego-network difference and political knowledge may be further conditioned on political ideology.

T1  - Transitions to motherhood: young women’s desire for respectability, responsibility and moral worth
AN  - 2444579408
AB  - In the UK, teenage motherhood is depicted in the media and government policy as highly negative and problematic. Pregnant and mothering young women are constructed as socially excluded members of society who belong to an assumed underclass who lack responsibility and respectability. This article draws on the views and perspectives of pregnant and mothering young women in the east of England to examine how positive and successful subjects are defined and understood. It is illustrated how this group of working-class young women negotiated and resisted their positioning as ‘unfit’ mothers and ‘bad’ citizens. Central to their narratives was a desire to reassert themselves as respectable and responsible individuals through engaging in education and employment in order to achieve financial independence. It is argued that this notion of respectability provides a limited and limiting understanding of inclusion and moral worth for working-class young women.

T1  - Gender Essentialism, Authoritarianism, Social Dominance Orientation, and Filial Piety as Predictors for Transprejudice in Chinese People
AN  - 2442687960
AB  - Although research on prejudice against gender and sexual minorities has been increasing in recent years, little attention has been paid to predictors for transprejudice and its potential culture-specific correlates in particular. This cross-sectional study addressed these gaps in the literature by exploring the relative contributions of social dominance orientation, authoritarianism, filial piety, and essentialist beliefs of gender to negative attitudes toward transgender people in 371 Chinese participants. Path analyses showed that (a) consistent with previous research, authoritarianism and social dominance orientation made independent contributions to explaining variance in transprejudice; (b) filial piety, as a culture-specific variable, was a unique predictor for transprejudice beyond the effects of authoritarianism and social dominance orientation; and (c) these relations appeared to be mediated by gender essentialism. Our findings suggest that people with higher levels of authoritarianism and social dominance orientation tend to have stronger essentialist beliefs of gender, which may in turn contribute to the development of transprejudice. It also highlights the importance of identifying culture-specific predictors (e.g., filial piety in a Chinese context) when we attempt to understand transprejudice.

T1  - People on the move: how museums de-marginalize migration
AN  - 2435505233
AB  - Newly set-up social heritage museums have attempted to counter the anonymous and stereotyped presentations of migrants in the public sphere. Drawing on the tension between media and museum representations of human mobility, this paper offers a multimodal analysis of de-marginalization strategies in museum discourses of migration. We argue that in contrast to contemporary news media and their predominantly “exclusionary” discourse (Krzyżanowski, Triandafyllidou, and Wodak 2018. “The Mediatization and the Politicization of the ‘Refugee Crisis’ in Europe.” Journal of Immigrant & Refugee Studies 16 (1-2): 1–14), museums portray (e)migration enthusiastically, with varying degrees of sophistication, with strategies to generate involvement, empathy, and pleasurable experience. Historical actors and events are thereby stretched as well as compressed and essentialized into a phenomenon of people of all times everywhere. In this process of de-marginalization, however, museums and visitors also pay a price of differentiation and authenticity. We suggest that this mainly happens under the pressure of neoliberal economic conditions and the exigencies of the experience economy.

T1  - Youth sport and community segregation: a study of kids’ participation in Australian rules football and soccer clubs in an Australian community
AN  - 2422105809
AB  - This research addresses the appeal for more empirical-based research on exclusionary practices in local community sport that often go unchallenged within dominant discourses. By examining how organised community sport clubs can uphold systemic segregation of various ethnic, racial, linguistic, religious and socioeconomic groups, this study also draws attention to the importance of research on race, ethnicity, and education in primary school age children; a population group often ignored in both racism studies and studies of sport. Using interview and focus group data from school principals and students (aged 9–12), including students from refugee and asylum seeker migrant backgrounds, collected over 3 years from two schools in the same multicultural community in Melbourne, Australia, this paper challenges the depiction of sport as an uncontested inclusive space in national and educational discourse, and instead demonstrates the continued existence of exclusion through systemically mediated segregation in organised community youth sport.

T1  - Towards an Integration of Models of Discrimination of Immigrants: from Ultimate (Functional) to Proximate (Sociofunctional) Explanations
AN  - 2229809169
AB  - We integrated models of discrimination of immigrants by combining established approaches to prejudice and discrimination towards immigrants (proximate explanations) using assumptions of Evolutionary-Coalitional Theory (ultimate explanations). Based on this perspective, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and multicultural ideology (MCI) were considered as sociofunctional motives for attitudes towards immigrants. We examined relationships between individual differences in beliefs about the social world (dangerous worldview and competitive worldview) as more distal antecedents, and RWA, SDO, and MCI as more proximal antecedents, and the endorsement of discrimination of immigrants in the socioeconomic domain by Russian majority group members as the outcome. Data were collected among 576 participants from 33 regions in Russia, using online social media. MCI predicted endorsement of discrimination of immigrants by Russian majority group members better than did RWA and SDO. SDO predicted only economic aspects of the endorsement of discrimination. The results are discussed within the Russian context, with its ethnically diverse composition of the population and high migration rates.

T1  - Reflecting on Sacrifices Made by Past Generations Increases a Sense of Obligation Towards Future Generations
AN  - 2409934021
AB  - Tackling climate change presents an intergenerational dilemma: People must make sacrifices today, to benefit future generations. What causes people to feel an obligation to benefit future generations? Past research has suggested “intergenerational reciprocity” as a potential driver, but this research is quite domain specific, and it is unknown how well it applies to climate change. We explored a novel means of invoking a sense of intergenerational reciprocity: inducing reflection on the sacrifices made by previous generations. Our studies revealed that such reflection predicts and causes a heightened sense of moral obligation towards future generations, mediated by gratitude. However, there are also some downsides (e.g., feelings of unworthiness), and perceptions of obligation do not substantially affect pro-environmental attitudes or motivations. Thus, while reflecting on past generations’ sacrifices can generate a sense of intergenerational obligation, it is limited in the extent to which it can increase pro-environmental concern.

T1  - Social marginalization and chronic illness: A critical analysis of the role of labour-market exclusion
AN  - 2401700492
AB  - Since the 1990s, most European countries have implemented activation policies targeting the unemployed. During the past decade, the target group for activation policies expanded and currently also includes persons with limitations in their ability to work due to long-term or chronic illness and disabilities. The argument underlying these policies is that labour-market exclusion is the main cause for social marginalization because participation in paid work provides important social and psychological functions that cannot be found elsewhere. Based on an extensive set of quantitative data that combines register data and survey data, and using structural equation modelling, this paper analyses the relationship between chronic illness and social marginalization, and in particular which role labour-market exclusion plays in this relationship. Is labour-market exclusion a crucial factor in explaining why individuals with chronic illnesses face a higher risk of social marginalization if factors such as income and education are also taken into account? From the statistical results, the paper states that individuals with chronic illnesses face a far higher risk of social marginalization, but that this risk is caused by their health limitations and not by their lack of labour-market participation. Contrary to the policies’ logic and the theoretical argument of psycho-social theories originating from the deprivation perspective, no direct, indirect or mediating effects of labour-market exclusion on social marginalization were identified.

T1  - Making Sense of Language Use in Foreign Soap Operas: The Case of Bamenda Market Women
AN  - 2455928894
AB  - This article examines some Bamenda market women's responses to the domination of English and French used in the broadcast of foreign soap operas in Cameroon. Foreign soap operas, locally referred to as series by some of the Bamenda market women, became increasingly popular among women after the liberalization of the audiovisual sector in the year 2000. Although popular, these series are broadcast in English and French and some women find it difficult to understand the official languages used in broadcasting their preferred series. English and French are official languages because of Cameroon's colonial history, and they are used to resolve the lingual complication that blocks communication across ethnic groups with different vernaculars. English and French thus provide the possibility of a unifying language, but especially as mediated through foreign soaps, they seem "external" to the lived experiences of popular classes whose principal language for daily communication purposes is Cameroon Pidgin English (CPE). Thus, this article argues that the English and French spoken in the broadcast of foreign soap operas are used by viewers to unite them, but at the same time, the viewers' negotiation of these languages exposes some women from the English-speaking regions to the problem of Anglophone marginalization. The article poses the following question: what do "subaltern" ("everyday") women do with the imposed official languages, and how do they make sense of the languages used in the broadcast of transnational soap operas? The methodology combines linguistic and cultural studies based on fieldwork in Bamenda, Cameroon.

T1  - Where the Other Side Gets News: Audience Perceptions of Selective Exposure in the 2016 Election
AN  - 2431020364
AB  - Building on research on selective exposure, hostile media perceptions, and presumed media influence, this study explores what citizens believe about their political rivals’ news habits and introduces the idea of perceived selective exposure: the extent to which citizens believe their political opponents curate media diets of like-minded political news. Results from a national survey of voters (N = 657) show that during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, voters disagreed about the extent to which prominent news sources favored Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. The more undesirably biased voters considered a source, the more news they assumed their political rivals received from that source. This perceived selectivity was consequential: A belief that others’ news habits were weighted toward like-minded media was linked to a belief that others’ election news choices had reinforced their attitudes. Partisans think their political rivals are selecting biased news sources that bolster extremity.

T1  - Cumulative consequences of stigma: Possessing multiple concealable stigmatized identities is associated with worse quality of life
AN  - 2387130292
AB  - Large health disparities exist between stigmatized and nonstigmatized groups. In addition to experiencing and anticipating greater discrimination, members of stigmatized groups also tend to demonstrate greater ruminative tendencies in response, which may lead to these poor health outcomes. Even among stigmatized groups, differences in the visibility of stigma lead to different mechanisms through which stigma takes its toll. Previous work has primarily focused on the impact of belonging to a single marginalized group; however, people often belong to multiple marginalized groups, and this likely affects both their health outcomes and their anticipation of stigma. In the current study, we focused on individuals with concealable stigmatized identities (CSIs)—socially stigmatized identities that are not immediately apparent to others—and created a measure of concealable marginalization that captures multiple group memberships. We predicted that those possessing a greater number of CSIs would anticipate more stigma from others, and, in turn, ruminate more about the stigma, which would negatively impact the health. Surveying N = 288 adults with CSIs, we found that possessing a greater number of marginalized concealable identities predicted worse self‐reported physical quality of life. These relationships were partially mediated by greater anticipated stigma and brooding rumination in regard to their CSI. This work illuminates a more complete picture of how living with CSIs can take its toll on health.

T1  - Nearness and distance: the double-sided nature of belonging for young refugees in Australia
AN  - 2407556799
AB  - The concept of belonging captures both the overwhelming place-belongingness experienced by many young people living in bounded communities such as refugee communities, as well as the ways belonging is mediated through structural embeddedness and everyday interactions. While the majority of scholarship on belonging emphasise the positive, inclusive aspects of belonging, and generally see belonging as something to be achieved, this article offers a more nuanced understanding of how modes of belonging can act as both a hindrance and a protective mechanism in young people's lives. A qualitative case study of a group of young Somali refugees living in Australia has been chosen to illustrate this dynamic. This article firstly discusses refugee young people's access to and transitions between contexts and communities that enhance their belonging and broaden their opportunities to participate. Secondly, the article shows how efforts to belong to youth communities can, in fact, entrench other kinds of marginalisation. The article seeks to further develop the concept of belonging, as it proved vital in understanding the ways marginalisation shape and influence young people's participatory practices and choices.

AB  - This article examines how Afro-Brazilian YouTube channels Papo de Preta (Black woman’s chat) and Afros e Afins use African-American media representations and cultural references to discuss social justice issues in Brazil. They also rely on African-American entertainers and activists to articulate the particularities of marginalization in Brazil. Their use of African-American entertainers demonstrates the transnational exchange of ideas among Afro-descendants. The social justice work of these YouTubers is part of a long tradition of transnational communication among Afro-descendants to resist marginalization in the home country.

T1  - How far can stigma-based empathy reach? Effects of societal (in)equity of LGB people on their allyship with transgender and Black people
AN  - 2471510530
AB  - The shared experience of societal discrimination and affirmation can provide a basis for empathy among members of different marginalized groups. However, the potential mechanisms and moderating conditions involved in this process have been little studied. This experiment examined how perceived societal (in)equity of one's own group may influence one's reaction to other marginalized groups. We randomly assigned 310 cisgender White lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults to conditions varying in LGB (in)equity salience (discrimination, affirmation, control) and in the target outgroup identity (transgender, Black). Participants completed a survey assessing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to the outgroup, that is, indicators of allyship. Based on the emerging theory of stigma-based solidarity, we expected LGB discrimination to improve intergroup relations with transgender people (i.e. a group readily sharing a common superordinate identity with LGB people) but worsen relations with Black people (i.e. a group not readily sharing a common superordinate identity). Counter to expectations, allyship variables were not predicted by discrimination as a main effect or in interaction with outgroup identity. However, we found support for the mediating role of emotions in explaining the indirect effect of discrimination on allyship. For example, discrimination produced greater outgroup identification by elevating negative affect, but only when the outgroup was transgender people. Results for transgender and Black targets converged for outcomes requiring participants to consider societal injustice toward the outgroup. We observed only one effect for affirmation: It reduced LGB people's empathic anger for both transgender and Black people. Results may inform efforts of coalition building.

T1  - What factors explain anti-Muslim prejudice? An assessment of the effects of Muslim population size, institutional characteristics and immigration-related media claims
AN  - 2376776840
AB  - What factors explain majority members’ anti-Muslim prejudice? This is an increasingly important question to ask, but to date only relatively few studies have sought to provide answers from a cross-national comparative perspective. This study aims to help fill this gap. Using data from the seventh round of the European Social Survey (ESS) linked with country-level characteristics, our results indicate that (a) a larger Muslim population size, (b) more liberal immigrant integration policies and (c) greater state support of religion are all associated with lower levels of majority members’ negative attitudes towards Muslim immigration – our indicator of anti-Muslim prejudice. Such attitudes, however, prove to be unrelated to (d) cross-national differences in the frequency of negative immigration-related news reports as measured by the ESS media claims data. Collectively, these findings bring us one important step closer towards a better understanding of interethnic relations between majority members and Muslim immigrants in European host societies.

T1  - The impact of precarious employment on the health and wellbeing of immigrants: a systematic review
AN  - 2430183126
AB  - Background Migration and precarious employment are social determinants associated with adverse health outcomes. In the United Kingdom, migration policy and labour market characteristics mean that migrants are often engaged in precarious work. We synthesise evidence on the experiences of migrants and explore the effects of precarious employment on their health and wellbeing. Methods Electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed qualitative studies describing the experiences of United Kingdom migrants in precarious employment. Title and abstracts were screened, followed by full text screening using pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data on employment experiences and effects of working conditions on physical and mental health and perceived wellbeing were extracted. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (2009) framework was used to conduct a narrative synthesis. Results Out of 1577 unique citations, 5 met our inclusion criteria. All included studies reported negative outcomes on physical and mental health. 2 reported positive or negative outcomes for perceived wellbeing depending on pre-migration experience. Musculoskeletal pain, exhaustion, anxiety and depression were commonly reported effects of precarious employment. Communication difficulties and over qualification were identified as migrant specific factors influencing health outcomes. Conclusions Stress response theories and risk factors associated with occupational injury explain how employment specific factors influence health. Extrinsic factors such as immigration policies, pre-migration experience, responsibilities in home country and acculturation mediate precarious employment effect on health. Key messages    Migrants feel isolated in precarious employment and are vulnerable to negative mental and physical health impacts.   Broader migration related policies impact on experiences of employment and health.

T1  - Relationships between sociocultural factors (gender, immigrant and socioeconomic background), peer relatedness and positive affect in adolescents
AN  - 2348209050
AB  - Introduction During adolescence, experiencing positive emotions at school is important for motivation as well as for academic success and psychological well-being. In the present study, on the basis of Self-Determination Theory (SDT), we investigated the relationships between sociocultural factors (gender, immigrant and socioeconomic background), peer relatedness (acceptance and friendship) and positive affect at school. Methods Data was based on a random sample of 36,712 tenth grade Italian adolescents. Their average age was 15.6 years (SD = 0.77), 50.6% were males, while 6.1% were first-generation immigrants and 3.8% were second-generation immigrants. Firstly, comparing latent means, we established peer relatedness and positive affect profiles of adolescents with different sociocultural backgrounds. Subsequently, we tested a structural equation model, based on SDT, according to which the effects of sociocultural factors on experiencing positive affect at school are mediated by peer relatedness dimensions. Results Latent mean comparisons showed that immigrant adolescents, students with a lower-SES and girls had fewer friendships with their classmates, lower levels of positive affect at school and were less accepted by their peers. A well-fitting structural equation model corroborated the mediating role of acceptance and friendship, which accounted for 16% of variance in positive affect. Conclusions Due to sociocultural factors, some groups of adolescents proved to be more at risk of being socially excluded and of experiencing less positive affect at school. Moreover, our findings support the claim of SDT that the satisfaction of basic psychological needs, such as relatedness, is more important than sociocultural factors in determining adolescents' psychological well-being.

T1  - Introduction: 1918, A Sharp Rupture or a Period of Transition?
AN  - 2338907854
AB  - A large crowd had gathered at Vilnius Airport (Lithuania) on March 31, 2017 and appeared to be waiting for something. Among the gathered was the government chancellor, three ministers, and many other well-known public figures. The scene at the airport was being shown on the national broadcaster, and later on news reports on all the channels. Readers would be amiss thinking that this crowd was waiting for a sports team (more likely a Lithuanian basketball team than a Lithuanian football team, alas), which had just won top position at a championship. They were in fact waiting for a little-known scientist at the time, Liudas Mažylis, who, as was announced, had found the declaration of Lithuanian independence from 1918 in a German archive. Until then, the Lithuanian state did not have its own original “birth certificate.” No one cared about the opinion of professional historians that the discovered document should be called differently and more precisely. Mažylis became a national hero and a TV star, while the document's exposition turned it into a mass pilgrimage object.

T1  - Performing gender identities in Fatou Diome's novel Kétala
AN  - 2268280253
AB  - Since the publication of her first novel Le ventre de l'Atlantique (2003), Fatou Diome, a Senegalese author who immigrated to France in the 1990s, has been regularly invited to French cultural TV programmes, in which she often criticises European foreign policy, as well as social and racial segregation. Despite her public political commitment, in several interviews, Fatou Diome argues that literature should be dissociated from politics. This article analyses Diome's narrative techniques when depicting current social issues in her second novel Kétala (2006). In Kétala, Diome shows how Senegalese gay people and women face social violence and exclusion. Drawing on queer theory and the concept of performance, this article describes the various strategies through which marginalised identities in Kétala contest heteronormative social representations. This paper argues that Fatou Diome's novel captures the reality through a singular poetics.

T1  - Tainted Love: How Stigmatization of a Political Party in News Media Reduces Its Electoral Support
AN  - 2430088371
AB  - In contemporary democracies, a political party typically needs good press to attract voters. A glum scenario for a party would be that news media systematically stigmatize it. To what extent does stigmatization lower its electoral support? This article examines voters’ reactions to news media coverage of the Dutch party PVV. Using a media content analysis linked to a 2014 panel survey of a sample representative of the Dutch electorate, we find that, among voters who held anti-immigrant attitudes, exposure to stigmatization lowered these voters’ perceived legitimacy of the PVV. This, in turn, decreased their propensity to vote for that party. This suggests that stigmatization can be a strong tool in the hands of those who intend to damage a party.

T1  - Rebuilding a Social Contract: The Role of Media and Academia in shaping a new narrative in Pakistan
AN  - 2475010664
AB  - The paper aims to provide an insight into the role of media and academia in shaping a new narrative in Pakistan (by strengthening the national cohesion, economic and social progress), with reference to the fundamental laws as enunciated in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The initial research hypothesis envisages the necessity of providing an updated narrative for rebuilding the social contract in order to introduce greater social equality and provide better chances for the multidimensional development of Pakistan's citizens. There are three major assumptions in this research: There is a need to come up with an updated formula for the state-society relations and need to re-negotiate the social contract at multiple levels by taking into consideration the voice of the public. All decision-makers and influencers from the media, civil society, civil and military bureaucracy, business and academia, have their distinctive role in rebuilding/renewing the social contract.
The media and academia have unprecedented role in the development of a rules-based society, thus their contribution to reshaping a narrative in Pakistan should not be underestimated. Modern, 21st century social order should adhere to the principles of equality and empowerment of the underprivileged groups, as articulated in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

T1  - No life without family: Film representations of involuntary childlessness, silence and exclusion
AN  - 2256091472
AB  - Forming a family and having children constitutes an adulthood rite of passage, one of the tacitly assumed requirements of a fulfilled life. What happens, then, when the ‘family dream’ does not materialize? This article addresses the dark sides of the ‘family imperative’ by focusing on representations of involuntary childlessness (i.e. childlessness not by choice) in film. It advances the argument that popular culture, far from being ‘mere entertainment’, plays an important role in wider processes of stigmatization, silencing and, as a result, exclusion of those who do not have a family. The analysis, which is informed by a broader study into the structure of silence surrounding childlessness, presents the findings of a comparative qualitative content analysis that examined the (troubling) representations of involuntary childless individuals in 50 films from Italy, Norway and the United States. It discusses their far-reaching cultural and political implications, making practical suggestions to counter their stigmatizing effects.

T1  - (In/exclusion) Humor and diversity in Finnish public radio: ‘If all immigrants were as funny as you guys, nobody would have any problems’
AN  - 2205313002
AB  - Similar to the rest of Europe, multicultural programming in Finland has become risky for public broadcasting. Programs aimed at encouraging social inclusion may not attract sufficiently large audiences and may be attacked by ever louder anti-immigration voices. This article focuses on what seems to be an exception in this respect: Ali and Husu. Hosted by immigrants from Iran and Somalia – a stand-up comedian and a politician – this popular talk show aired on Finnish public radio between 2013 and 2016. Through interviews with the producers and the analysis of a selection of episodes, we examine Ali and Husu’s daring and unapologetic ethnic/racial humor as well as its combination of funny and serious talk. Our findings underscore specific ways in which multicultural programming can use humor strategically to engage relatively large and diverse audiences in discussions meant to humanize immigrants and challenge social prejudices, while minimizing right-wing criticism and unintended readings.

T1  - Symbolic capital, informal labor, and postindustrial markets: the dynamics of street vending during the 2014 world cup in São Paulo
AN  - 2189243908
AB  - In contrast to industrial markets based on mass-production of material goods, postindustrial markets hinge on images, experiences, and emotions produced and exchanged on screens and in real life. Because postindustrial markets tend to be highly concentrated and technology-driven, they pose a threat to small businesses and low-skill workers in both advanced industrial economies and the Global South, where a large share of the population makes a living in the informal economy. Using the 2014 World Cup as a case of postindustrial economic activity hinged on spectacle, emotional experience, and intellectual property, I analyze the income-making strategies used by street vendors in São Paulo, Brazil. I show that organizers’ control of fan markets was limited by local conceptions of ownership over national symbols as well as informal workers’ flexible relation to legal norms and enforcement-dodging practices. Circumventing market barriers required risky and sophisticated strategies, however, which were more readily available to the more marginal section of the street vending population.

T1  - QUESTIONING the SUPER-RICH: Representations, Structures, Experiences
AN  - 2230285961
AB  - The authors outline how multiple dimensions-historical and contemporary; global and local; political, economic, social, and cultural-inform an understanding of the super-rich. Recent super-rich scholarship is reviewed with regard to three themes: discourses and representations; mechanisms and structures; experiences and identities. The empirical and conceptual insights of the contents are then highlighted, with regard to the significance of discourses of legitimacy, namely, those of meritocracy, civility, and luxury; the intersections of race and class that underpin assumptions about and representations of wealth; institutional and political-economic dynamics, in relation to international financial systems and property markets; and experiences and attitudes, examined via elites' professional identities and cultural practices. The authors suggest that questioning the super-rich provides an avenue for the study of power in society, how it is reproduced, and how global hierarchies may be shifting. To that end, the articles attempt to make visible the brute force of the infrastructures (politics and policy, cultural and occupational conventions, financial devices and systems) that are occluded by the tendency to focus on the gloss of super-rich lifestyles; to draw attention to the long-term and newly emerging tensions within and between categories of wealth and of elites, and spheres of political, economic, and cultural activity; and to contribute to an understanding of how the accumulation of wealth is perpetuated and excused through discourses of legitimation, structural dynamics, and lived identities. These are much-needed critical interventions at a time of escalating inequality.

T1  - Tanni Grey-Thompson - 'The one that got away': a theological analysis of foeticide, infanticide and the deviant Paralympic success story
AN  - 2178535253
AB  - In this essay, I apply a theological perspective to argue that the Paralympic Games, its athletes and the media, unwittingly collude to demonstrate contempt towards the killing of disabled children, whilst claiming that disability equality has been improved or achieved. I argue that British Paralympic athlete Tanni Grey-Thompson was destined to succeed because many of her potential competitors were denied the right to life. British newspapers and publicly available figures related to the killing of disabled children in the United Kingdom are contrasted against the positive narrative about disabled people promoted by the International Paralympic Committee. I make reference to Christian bio-medical ethics to draw attention to the medical profession's negative attitudes towards disabled people in the early 1900s, which provided execution techniques for the Nazi holocaust. I conclude by contending that the genocide of disabled children continues unabated despite the positive and dominant discourse attached to the Paralympic Games.

T1  - National identification and intergroup attitudes of Chinese youth towards Americans, Japanese, and South Koreans
AN  - 2162684715
AB  - The study explored the strength of national identification and intergroup attitudes of Chinese youth (n = 591, aged 12-15) toward the Chinese, the Americans, the Japanese, and the South Koreans. The participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire and write down reasons why they 'like' or 'dislike' the four groups. The results showed a consistency in in-group favoritism. Gender and age were both related to Chinese youths' national identifications and their national intergroup attitudes. Confucian ethics, media influence and historical complex were identified as main factors that may contribute to their attitudes toward the four groups.

T1  - GENDER AND SOCIAL INCLUSION IN THE CASHEW NUT VALUE CHAIN: THE ROLE OF WOMEN AND YOUTH IN AGRO PROCESSING IN TANZANIA
AN  - 2478261881
AB  - The main thrust of the article is that women and youth play significant roles in the cashew nut value chain, that is, from production, processing, to marketing and trade but they face more constraints than other social groups, especially in production, processing and marketing because of lack of ownership and access to productive resources such as land, credit, and membership in marketing cooperatives. Their lack of recognition deprives them of opportunities to enter into gainful transactions that can improve their working capital, activities and productivity. Their production and processing activities still depend on crude, hazardous, ineffective and inefficient inputs, implements and technologies. Furthermore, they lack the necessary knowledge, confidence and networks that can help them to secure access to inputs and markets without having to go through intermediaries. In addition, they also lack the necessary information, knowledge and skills that can help them to comply with the national regulations for registering of food processing enterprises, national and international food quality standards to qualify them to take part in dynamic domestic and export markets. The article recommends a gender and youth inclusive approach that increases women and youth entitlement to the ownership of productive assets, access to credit, awareness of technical standards required for cashew nuts on local and international markets and modern equipment and technology.

T1  - Sexual minority women's attitudes toward infants, children, and parenthood
AN  - 2303793125
AB  - Little is known about the experiences of lesbian and bisexual women with infants or children or about their views on trade-offs required by parenthood. In this study, we examined how reactions to experiences with infants/children, perceived trade-offs of parenthood, and self-reported nurturance vary as a function of women's sexual orientation. Two hundred cisgender childless women (53 lesbian, 57 plurisexual, 90 heterosexual) from the United States, recruited via social media, participated in this study. Results showed that lesbian women reported more negative attitudes toward infants/children and parenthood than did heterosexual women. Self-reported nurturance did not differ as a function of sexual orientation. Overall, lesbian women reported that they had less favorable experiences with infants and/or children and that they anticipated more social and economic costs involved with parenthood than did heterosexual women. Lesbian women also reported lower aspirations for parenthood than heterosexual women, and this was largely accounted for by differences in perceptions of the trade-offs involved with parenthood. Plurisexual women did not differ from lesbian or heterosexual women on any outcome. These results contribute to our understanding of why lesbian women are, on average, less likely than heterosexual women to aspire to parenthood.

T1  - A Subject Deferred: Exposure and Erasure in an Ethnographic Archive
AN  - 2137641004
AB  - From as early as the late 1970s anthropologists and ethnomusicologists have been both analysts of and advocates for institutional worlds of Aboriginal art and media. Keenly aware of the Faustian character ascribed to the Indigenous embrace of media, and attuned to the ironies of its governmental subvention, such work of necessity took shape in dialogue with specific institutional possibilities and Australian anxieties. This paper revisits the historical coordinates of Indigenous media research in the age of social media, exploring the relationship between institutional representation and recognition, and the avatars and memes afforded by contemporary social media platforms. Drawing from an ethnographic archive of online media, the essay seeks to better understand the dissimulation and self‐erasure these artefacts entail.

T1  - Dissecting the politics of “Obamacare”: The role of distributive justice, deservingness, and affect
AN  - 2132138381
AB  - Political conservatives (vs. liberals) are commonly thought to oppose government‐based policies that promote equal distribution of resources, preferring that resources be distributed based on merit. In a sample of American adults (n = 436), distributive fairness perceptions, deservingness, and affective reactions related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) were examined to better understand the ideological differences in ACA attitudes. Participants completed measures of political orientation, ACA knowledge and attitudes, deservingness, distributive justice principles (i.e., need, equality, merit), anger, and sympathy. Identifying as politically liberal (vs. conservative) and greater knowledge on the ACA predicted greater ACA support. Preferences for the distributive justice principles of equality and need (but not equity) mediated the relation between political orientation and ACA attitudes. Further, conservatives perceived less deservingness and in turn experienced greater anger and opposition to the ACA. Additional exploratory analyses also suggest that the positive path between deservingness and ACA support is moderated by political orientation such that it is stronger among political liberals than conservatives. Implications of the ideological chasm in relation to the ACA are considered.

T1  - Perceived threat mediates the relationship between national identification and support for immigrant exclusion: A Cross-National Test of Intergroup Threat Theory
AN  - 2132685967
AB  - Hypotheses derived from intergroup threat theory and social identity theory were tested by analyzing cross-national data about national identity and attitude toward immigrants. National identification, perceived threat and support for irregular immigrant exclusion were considered as variables at the individual level. Gross domestic product, Gini index and individualism–collectivism index were used as national descriptors. Results indicated that, across 33 nations worldwide, intergroup threat mediated the relationship between national identification and support for immigrant exclusion. Moreover, the level of national wealth moderated this mediation so that perceived threat was a stronger mediator in rich than in poor nations. On the other hand, Gini index and individualism did not affect this mediation. Present findings are supportive for intergroup threat theory and social identity theory.

T1  - “They don’t see us otherwise”: A discourse analysis of marginalized students critiquing the local news
AN  - 2120900786
AB  - At the end of the fall semester, a fight broke out at a high school in the southeastern United States, a fight large enough to be covered by the local news. In this article, we analyze two data sources related to this event: one local news report and a discussion of that news report that occurred in an Intensive Reading class at the school. Intensive Reading was a remedial course designed for students who had failed a required standardized literacy assessment. In this article, we draw upon discourse analysis and critical race media literacy to argue the following: 1) the local media representation presented a version of events that used coded language and visual images to create a figured world in which students of color were silenced and a master script was perpetuated; and 2) students, having been taught critical literacy (in the form of multiliteracies pedagogy) and media literacy, resisted the media representation and constructed a counter-story based on their own figured worlds. Our analysis also supports the call for critical race media literacy pedagogy in schools.

T1  - The right to education act (2009): Instructional medium and dis-citizenship
AN  - 2092682058
AB  - While the broader ambition of the Indian government’s Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act (2009) has been lauded, scholars have expressed reservations with the universal education measure. One area that has not been adequately addressed within these debates is the instructional medium. While RTE (2009) recognizes children who are “disadvantaged” as linguistic minorities, and stipulates that the “medium of instruction shall, as far as practicable, be in child’s mother tongue”, it offers little further direction. India is home to more than 1,652 languages, but only 43 languages function as instructional media. Therefore, the majority of children learn in a tongue that is not their home language, experiencing serious educational disadvantages. How this issue complicates the intent of the RTE (2009) Act remains to be explored. This article examines this gap using the theoretical lens of dis-citizenship, which is conceptualized in terms of exclusions experienced by marginalized groups. Here, we focus on those marginalized by the language of instruction. We investigate questions about language access, inclusion, equity, and rights arising from RTE (2009), within the narrative of India’s complex, hierarchical multilingualism.

T1  - Ikebukuro in-between: mobility and the formation of the Yamanote's heterotopic borderland
AN  - 2322800162
AB  - Ikebukuro, one of the major stations along the Yamanote line, is ambiguously placed in Tokyo, both spatially and discursively. Serving as a black-market in the immediate post-1945 era, and situated as a major hub leading to Tokyo's Northwestern suburban sprawl today, its position as an in-between space is mirrored in its image as a site of excessive consumption and play. This position has also meant it has become home to many marginalised groups and consumption practices in Tokyo. This article demonstrates the ways that thinking from the Yamanote inspires thinking about mobility, heterotopia and the interstices they create. Specifically, it explores the different forms of mobility, from transportation, to people and media, which have produced Ikebukuro's place as a borderland. Understanding these mobilities as historically cumulative, it shows how the Yamanote in many ways made Ikebukuro, and how in turn Ikebukuro exemplifies the heterotopic nature of Tokyo more generally. Today, Ikebukuro is one of the largest sites of social activity among recent Chinese migrants in Japan, with its Northwestern area unofficially referred to as Tokyo Chinatown by some. At the same time, it is home to many other migrant groups and constitutes the second largest adult entertainment district in Tokyo. It attracts waves of consumers on their way home to neighbourhoods in Saitama, and is only second to Akihabara as a space that 'rotten girls' and 'otaku' frequent. These practices and groups are also reflected upon in popular culture, where Ikebukuro is portrayed as a site of danger and excitement. Through these analyses, the importance of heterotopias to marginalised groups in Japan is explored, as well as the crucial role the Yamanote plays in making heterotopias possible.

T1  - Family Matters: Claiming Rights across the US-Mexico Migratory System
AN  - 2186161677
AB  - The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA) created an immigration system favoring the immigration of spouses, children, and parents of US citizens, thereby establishing family unity as the cornerstone of US immigration policy. Despite this historical emphasis on family unity, backlogs and limited visas for non-immediate relatives of US citizens and legal permanent residents, the militarization of the US-Mexico border, punitive measures for those who enter without inspection, such as the forced separation of children from their parents at the US border, and an aggressive policy of deportation have made it more difficult for members of Mexican binational families to unify.How do members of Mexican binational families manage the hardships that result from US immigration policies that prolong and force family separation? Immigrants and return migrants alike may not be aware of their rights and the legal remedies that exist to enforce them. Structural barriers such as poverty, legal status, fear of deportation, lack of proficiency in English, and lack of familiarity with government bureaucracies no doubt prevent many migrants in the United States and return migrants in Mexico from coming forward to request legal assistance and relief in the courts.Despite these barriers, when it comes to family matters, members of some Mexican binational families can and do assert their rights. In this article, we analyze an administrative database of the Department of Legal Protection of the Mexican consular network that documents migrant legal claims resulting from family separation, along with findings from 21 interviews with consular staff and community organizations in three consular jurisdictions — El Paso, Raleigh, and San Francisco — to investigate the sociolegal processes of claims. Our investigation centers on the mediating role the Mexican state — via its consular network — has developed to assist binational families as they attempt to assert their rights and resolve child support and child custody problems resulting from prolonged and forced family separation. We find that the resolution of binational family claims in part depends on the institutional infrastructure that has developed at local, state, and federal levels, along with the commitment and capacity of the receiving and sending states and the binational structures they establish. These binational structures transcend the limitations of national legal systems to achieve and implement family rights and obligations across borders.

T1  - The Psychology of the Politics of Rape: Political Ideology, Moral Foundations, and Attitudes Toward Rape
AN  - 2012371802
AB  - Previous research has found that conservatives and liberals emphasize different moral foundations. The purpose of these two studies was to investigate whether moral foundations mediate the relationship between political ideology and attitudes toward rape among U.S. college students. In Study 1, moral foundations fully mediated the relationship between political ideology and rape myth acceptance. Study 2 generally replicated the results of Study 1, with binding foundations demonstrating the most consistent mediating effects. These results suggest that individual differences in moral decision-making may explain the relationship between political ideology and attitudes toward rape.

T1  - ‘They seemed like Super Businessmen’: Financial Instruments in Social Housing Policy
AN  - 2273216254
AB  - This article explores the trajectory of so-called guaranteed social housing in the Czech Republic as an example of penetrating financial instruments into the public policy realm. The project, promoted by the government’s Agency for Social Inclusion, was intended to encourage private landlords to rent their properties to people in need through commercial insurance against the risk of rent defaults. Using policy documents, media and interviews with governmental officers, the article describes the performative strength of financial instruments in the sphere traditionally occupied by the welfare state. In financialisation literature, the proliferation of financial instruments is often described as a one-way process in which these instruments colonise public domains. However, the empirical case discussed in the article shows that this process is much more complex and contingent, and financial instruments are not used as the best option but rather as a last resort in a situation marked by weak policies.

T1  - Less than Expected? How Media Cover Demonstration Turnout
AN  - 1940693855
AB  - Demonstration turnout is a crucial political resource for social movements. In this article, we investigate how mass media cover demonstration size. We develop a typology of turnout coverage and scrutinize the factors that drive turnout coverage. In addition, we test whether media coverage underestimates, reflects, or exaggerates “guesstimates” by organizers and police forces. Together, these analyses shed light on whether turnout coverage fits a logic of normalization or marginalization. We rely on a unique dataset of 428 demonstrations organized in Brussels (2003–2010). For these demonstrations, we have information on the turnout as reported in national television news, as counted by the police, and as expected by the organizers. We find that media present turnout most often as a fact, rarely as contentious (10 percent). Although few demonstrations pass the media gates, our study yields little to no evidence for a logic of turnout marginalization. Media coverage does not systematically underestimate demonstration size, nor does it blindly follow police counts. Rather, turnout coverage attests of a logic of normalization, following standard news-making practices. The more important the demonstration (size, lead item) and the larger the gap between police and organizer guesstimates, the more attention is paid to turnout in the news. Discussion centers on the generalizability and normative interpretation of the results.

T1  - Immigrant perpetrators in the news: A terror management approach to resultant hostility, perceived vulnerability, and immigration issue judgment
AN  - 2013187444
AB  - This study found that mortality salience in TV news activated more hostile attitude toward the perpetrators and negative judgment on the immigration issue. Social group difference influenced news viewers' immigration issue judgment, but did not affect their resultant hostility and perceived vulnerability. More negative attitudes emerged toward the immigration issue when immigrant perpetrators were portrayed negatively in the news. News viewers with exposure to mortality salience in TV news reported more negative toward immigrants. Exposure to mortality-related elements in TV news could lead to social conflicts that were viewed as a severe threat by U.S. government and policymakers.

T1  - STINKING QUEEN AND HER ROYAL FAMILY: SARKAR AMMAN'S VISIT TO ENGLAND IN MEMOIRS OF A REBEL PRINCESS
AN  - 1990434799
AB  - This paper, drawing upon the travel of the female ruler of the princely state of Bhopal, Sultan Jahan Begum (1838T901), to England to plead with KingEmperor George V to intercede for her son, Prince Hamidullah Khan, in a Case of Succession, examines cross-cultural encounters that occurred during her stay. The focus of this paper thus is not on the details of the travel agenda; the paper assesses the interesting interplay of English and Bhopali cultures as noted by Princess Abida Sultaan, the favourite granddaughter of Sultan Jahan Begum and the narrator of this travel, in her Memoirs of a Rebel Princess (2004). During nine months of stayin England, from September 1925 to May 1926, the travelling royal party, including several women as well, came across incidents of faux pas, resistance, mimicry, and moments of embarrassment, cultural prejudices, shocks, misunderstanding, and confusion. The travel, though undertaken for specific political reasons, however, turned into a voyage of self-discovery. The tradition-oriented women of the royal family of Bhopal with their conservative way of life, encountered western ways of living. This paper attempts to analyze how this hybridity of two cultures- of the colonizer and the colonized- impacted each other at various levels.

T1  - Pro-Biafran Activists and the call for a Referendum: A Sentiment Analysis of ‘Biafraexit’ on Twitter after UK’s vote to leave the European Union
AN  - 1932113204
AB  - In a society bonded by a concatenation of diverse ethno-nationalism, the struggle for inclusion and exclusion becomes particularly unavoidable. Common among the findings of researchers of ethnic identities is the potential for conflicts when inequalities and injustices, rooted in ethnicity and religious identities are the basis for allocation of powers and resources. This is more threatening when a particular ethnic group is signposted as a threat to other group and targeted for ill-treatment. In Nigeria, the Igbo ethnic group is characterized as an endangered group and has risen at one point to challenge inequalities, injustices and state-orchestrated violence against the ethnic society that led to Nigeria-Biafra war between 1967 and 1970. Fifty years after the war, the Igbo ethnic society is still grappling to be included in the Nigeria nation-building project. The implication is a deep-rooted grievance among the Igbo ethnic group that the wave of campaigns and social movement for the restoration of Biafra continued to reverberate in recent times. After the UK's 'Brexit' vote, the pro-Biafra activists launched 'Biafraexit' on Twitter in the style of 'Brexit' for a referendum to exit Nigeria. The purpose of this paper is to examine the major sentiment of the people about the Biafra restoration 50 years after the Biafran war. Through a sentiment analysis of 'Biafraexit', 'free Biafra' hashtags and the 'Biafra' search term on Twitter, the paper examines to what extent the perception of insecurity of lives of the Igbos constitute major concern of proponents of Biafran independent on Twitter? How have the human right abuses of pro-Biafra activists under President Buhari's rule facilitated feelings of insecurity, religious cleansing and Islamization among pro-Biafra activists? The implications of this for cohesive nation-building are discussed.

T1  - 'We're Not Multicultural, but ... '
AN  - 1923057176
AB  - This article reconsiders the 2005 Cronulla riots after ten years. We begin by examining three examples of events misread ten years ago, to illustrate some key changes that have since shaped Australian racism. The first two, concern the rallying call to 'Leb and wog bashing day' at Cronulla in December 2005, and the attack there on two Bangladeshi students. These are shown to be indicative in a shift in the focus of racist Othering in Australia, from the 'Arab Other' to the 'Muslim Other', as Islamophobia becomes increasingly mainstreamed in Australian culture following the trend throughout the global West. Second, the incongruous chivalry-cum-feminism of the beachgoers who participated in the riot and were interviewed in the 2006 Four Corners television documentary, Riot and Revenge, illustrates some key features of Islamophobia as it has developed and become entrenched: such as accusing Muslims of hyperpatriarchy, and purporting to 'rescue' Muslim women while targeting them for racist vilification. We trace these and related ideological elements of Islamophobia inherent in the Cronulla riots, and show how these have unfolded in the Australian mainstream in the ten years since, becoming further enfolded into the commonsense as part of the 'new normal'.

T1  - Media Representations of Racism and Spatial Mobility: Young Muslim (Un)belonging in a Post-Cronulla Riot Sutherland
AN  - 1923055625
AB  - Young Australian Muslims living in Sydney have been influenced by the Cronulla riot. Online surveys (n: 76) and interviews (n: 10) reveal the impact on their engagement with the Sutherland region around Cronulla, detectable a decade after this event. The exclusionary intent of the rioters and their sympathisers was a racist form of spatial management that had both specific and general aims. The Australian news media contribute to the ethnic purification that was originally intended by the Cronulla riots. This reduces mobility among an 'ethnic other' in accessing spaces that have been portrayed as 'racist' - or, in the case of young Muslims, 'Islamophobic'. Findings demonstrate the ongoing consequences of a wide-scale racist attack, like the Cronulla riot, on urban citizenship. Representations of the Cronulla riot are a repertoire of learning for young Sydney Muslims that rehearse what has been conceptualised as pedagogies of (un)belonging by Noble and Poynting [(2010). White Lines: The Intercultural Politics of Everyday Movement in Social Spaces. Journal of Intercultural Studies, 31, 489-505]. We have extended the application of this concept to a specific space and point to the means by which constructions of unbelonging are reinforced and made material. Processes of repetition and accumulations identified by Butler and Essed highlight how this enduring pedagogy of spatial unbelonging is maintained by media representations of places as Islamophobic.

T1  - Hybrid Muslim identities in digital space: The Italian blog Yalla
AN  - 1910148099
AB  - Islam is often regarded as being incompatible with European values. In Italy, for example, anti-Islamic points of view reiterate the religion's alleged inconsistency with Catholicism and secularism. This article argues that narrative practices can challenge this idea by articulating Muslim hybrid identities that are compatible with Italian culture and society. The second-generation blog Yalla Italia represents a 'third space' where young Italian Muslims contrast dominant media stereotypes, thereby creating 'disruptive flows of dissent'. A textual analysis of the blog and interviews with some of the bloggers reveal that three main topics are employed to overcome marginalization: (1) critiques of mainstream media (2) narratives about family lives and the practice of Islam, and (3) advocacy of a quicker procedure for gaining Italian citizenship. The bloggers adopt a storytelling style to press for social and institutional change and explain how they succeed in adapting Islam to Italian society. Their religious diversity is thus perceived as providing a potential for Italy, rather than being a mark of marginalization.

AN  - 1902472911
AB  - From the spring of 1830, the Kingston-based newspaper, Watchman and Jamaica Free Press, published a series of articles discussing the prevalence of interracial concubinage throughout the island of Jamaica. While many discussed concubines as the victims of white men's lust, equally discussed was the role that mothers had in the continuation of this practice and the degradation of their children. Amid the movement for the abolition of slavery, respectable members of the free community of colour discussed concubines who engaged in interracial sex as unfit mothers and a hindrance to the social progress of the larger community of colour.

T1  - Cloaked in Invisibility: Dropout-Recovery Narratives of Girls of Color after Re-enrollment
AN  - 2491991529
AB  - There is limited research that explores the dropout and re-enrollment experiences of girls of color in urban schools despite these students having higher rates of early school withdrawal than their racial counterparts. Girls of color that dropout often have to navigate racial and gender stereotypes within a larger heteronormative system of oppression that challenges their identity as young women. Drawing from Role-Identity and Social Stress Theory, this qualitative study examined the intersection of race, gender, and space in structuring how female students of color negotiated their status as former "dropouts" to returners. Their narratives illustrate how dropout stigmas of girls of color are mediated by the context in which they experienced racial microstressors, and how they negotiated parent relationships in their pursuit of a high school diploma.

T1  - A multimodal discourse analytic approach to the articulation of Martini's "desire" positioning in filmic product placement
AN  - 2012907069
AB  - Product placement constitutes an amply used tactic in a marketer's Integrated Marketing Communications roster. Its merits in circumventing negative attitudes to advertising and in integrating brand values in sociocultural narratives in TV and cinematic filmic discourses have been repeatedly stressed. However, little attention has been placed thus far in the idiosyncratic mode that is scrutinized in this paper, that is product placement by leveraging uncertainty, surprise, postponement and displacement as defining characteristics of the discourse of desire. The analysis of the discourse of desire that unravels in a flirting sequence from the blockbuster movie "Hitch" demonstrates that although the concerned brand (Martini) is minimally visible in the analyzed scene, yet it attains to appropriate as part of its core DNA in "stealth" mode the above characteristics of desire by demarcating the cultural field of flirtation. The offered cultural analytic addresses this idiosyncratic product placement mode by drawing on Lacanian psychoanalysis and multimodal discourse analysis.

AB  - (ProQuest: ... denotes non-USASCII text omitted)
Many studies on men and masculinity have discussed how Asian male migrants who experience a 'masculinity crisis' negotiate their masculinity vis-à-vis dominant black and white masculinities in Western societies. Yet, few have discussed how they negotiate their masculinity in the Asian contexts. In this study, Nepalis have a tradition of transnational migration. Their transnational networks have facilitated the development of overseas Nepali communities. This research therefore aims to study the negotiation of masculinities of Nepali male heroin users, a marginalized group in Hong Kong. By using a qualitative mixed-methods approach, it is argued that their negotiation of masculinities is nuanced and relational; intersecting with race/ethnicity, social space, and generation. In the process, discursive resources in the cultural repertoire are utilized to construct alternative forms of masculinities in school, the workplace, and rehabilitation treatment. These masculinities are pluralistic and contingent, in relation to the transnational space and post-colonial situation of Hong Kong.

T1  - Utopian Hopes or Dystopian Fears? Exploring the Motivational Underpinnings of Moralized Political Engagement
AN  - 1864984220
AB  - People are more likely to become politically engaged (e.g., vote, engage in activism) when issues are associated with strong moral convictions. The goal of this research was to understand the underlying motivations that lead to this well-replicated effect. Specifically, to what extent is moralized political engagement motivated by proscriptive concerns (e.g., perceived harms, anticipated regret), prescriptive concerns (e.g., perceived benefits, anticipated pride), or some combination of these processes? And are the motivational pathways between moral conviction and political engagement the same or different for liberals and conservatives? Two studies (combined N = 2,069) found that regardless of political orientation, the association between moral conviction and political engagement was mediated by the perceived benefits of preferred but not the perceived harms of non-preferred policy outcomes, and by both anticipated pride and regret, findings that replicated in two contexts: legalizing same-sex marriage and allowing concealed weapons on college campuses.

T1  - News discourse and ideology: critical analysis of Copenhagen gang wars' online news
AN  - 2028852139
AB  - Gang warfare is one of the social problems that attract attention in Denmark and it occupies an important place in the media discourse. However, the discriminatory and exclusionary effects of this discourse have been largely overlooked in many of the previous studies focusing on this problem. Taking this into account, this study examines the discriminatory aspects of the online news discourse covering these gang wars. In this way, it uncovers the forms of anti-immigrant bias in the news discourse in Denmark by examining articles from two online news articles by the newspaper Politiken and the news quoted from the same newspaper. Specifically, this study aims to demonstrate that the discriminatory and exclusionist discourse on the gang wars in Denmark may cause ethnic discrimination by producing negative social capital. The chosen sample of news articles has been analysed by devoting special attention to the concepts of 'racism', 'exclusion', 'marginalisation' and 'negative social capital' which are based on the critical discourse analysis of Teun A. van Dijk, who does not perceive news media as passive reporters but instead draws attention to their role in (re)constructing news events and dominant ideology.

T1  - Promoting Social Inclusion through Sport for Refugee-Background Youth in Australia: Analysing Different Participation Models
AN  - 2002254319
AB  - Sports participation can confer a range of physical and psychosocial benefits and, for refugee and migrant youth, may even act as a critical mediator for achieving positive settlement and engaging meaningfully in Australian society. This group has low participation rates however, with identified barriers including costs; discrimination and a lack of cultural sensitivity in sporting environments; lack of knowledge of mainstream sports services on the part of refugee-background settlers; inadequate access to transport; culturally determined gender norms; and family attitudes. Organisations in various sectors have devised programs and strategies for addressing these participation barriers. In many cases however, these responses appear to be ad hoc and under-theorised. This article reports findings from a qualitative exploratory study conducted in a range of settings to examine the benefits, challenges and shortcomings associated with different participation models. Interview participants were drawn from non-government organisations, local governments, schools, and sports clubs. Three distinct models of participation were identified, including short term programs for refugee-background children; ongoing programs for refugee-background children and youth; and integration into mainstream clubs. These models are discussed in terms of their relative challenges and benefits and their capacity to promote sustainable engagement and social inclusion for this population group.

T1  - Ideological Heterogeneity and the Rise of Donald Trump
AN  - 1871674423
AB  - In the days after the 2016 election, a variety of explanations has been offered to explain Donald Trump’s unique ascendancy in American politics. Scholars have discussed Trump’s appeal to rural voters, his hybrid media campaign strategy, shifts in voter turnout, Hillary Clinton’s campaign advertising strategy, economic anxiety, differences in sexist and racist attitudes among Trump voters and so forth. Here, we add another key factor to the conversation: Trump’s appeal to a smaller, often ignored, segment of the electorate: populist voters. Building upon our previous work - demonstrating that while American political elites compete across a single dimension of conflict, the American people organize their attitudes around two distinct dimensions, one economic and one social - we use 2008 American National Elections Study (ANES) data and 2016 ANES primary election data to show that populist support for Trump, and nationalist policies themselves, help us to understand how Trump captured the Republican nomination and the White House.

T1  - The associations between body dissatisfaction, body figure, self-esteem, and depressed mood in adolescents in the United States and Korea: A moderated mediation analysis
AN  - 1843005864
AB  - The perception of one's body image becomes particularly important in adolescence. Body dissatisfaction has been associated with negative psychological functioning, such as self-esteem and depression. Previous findings showed that the decreased self-esteem due to body dissatisfaction explained the association between negative attitude toward body and psychological well-being in different cultural contexts. The present study examined adolescents from the US (N = 1002) and Korea (N = 3993) and replicated and extended the previous findings regarding body dissatisfaction and associated psychological outcomes. The results showed that body dissatisfaction predicted higher depressed mood and that self-esteem mediated this association for both American and Korean adolescents. Notably, the indirect effect of body dissatisfaction and perceived body image on depressed mood via self-esteem was greater for American adolescents than for Korean adolescents. The implications of the cultural difference in the significance of self-esteem in mediating the body dissatisfaction and depressed mood are discussed.

T1  - It's the frame that matters: Immigrant integration and media framing effects in the Netherlands
AN  - 1842821340
AB  - In the past years the Netherlands have witnessed turbulent debates on immigration and integration, characterized by high levels of negativity and containing a variety of different viewpoints, i.e., frames, of the issue. We use a 4 x 2 between subjects experiment to investigate, which responses four salient immigration frames elicit among Dutch citizens. The results show that, whereas the willingness to support collective action is affected by the valence of the story, attitudes towards immigrants and intercultural behavioural intentions are affected by the frame of the story: the multicultural frame exerts positive, and the victimization frame exerts negative effects, regardless of the valence of the story.

T1  - From CAUR to EUR: Italian Fascism, the 'myth of Rome' and the pursuit of international primacy
AN  - 1835698137
AB  - The formation of Fascist Italy's international imaginary in the 1930s tells a fascinating story of growing global political ambition, of constant recalibration in the face of seismic geopolitical shifts and, in the end, a (frustrated) pursuit of symbolic primacy. Kallis discusses two different Fascist projects underpinned by this imaginary: first, the political project of internationalization promoted through instruments such as the Fasci Italiani all'Estero (Italian Fasci Abroad) and especially the Comitati d'Azione per l'Universalità di Roma (CAUR), as well as through direct diplomatic and political ties with an expanding circle of regimes in Europe and overseas; and, second, the pursuit of a deeper sense of historic-cultural primacy, linked to the idea of 'Roman universality, which became the discursive lynchpin of the ill-fated plan to host a 1942 world's fair in Rome (EUR/E42). The transformation of Fascism from a hyper-nationalist phenomenon into a force actively seeking international diffusion and finally 'universality' can be understood as a reflexive adjustment of Fascism's ideological-political horizon, driven as much by new geopolitical opportunities and frustrations as by conquering ambition and ideological continuity. In fact, Italian Fascism's trajectory from CAUR in the 1930s to EUR/E42 in the war-torn 1940s, unfolding against a backdrop of growing antagonism between Italy and Nazi Germany for global influence, retained a primary symbolic point of reference: the ideological, political and cultural-historic estate of the 'myth of Rome' as a symbolic discourse of trans-temporal and -spatial primacy.

T1  - Cross-border ties and Arab American mental health
AN  - 1783351608
AB  - Due to increasing discrimination and marginalization, Arab Americans are at a greater risk for mental health disorders. Social networks that include ties to the country of origin could help promote mental well-being in the face of discrimination. The role of countries of origin in immigrant mental health receives little attention compared to adjustment in destination contexts. This study addresses this gap by analyzing the relationship between nativity, cross-border ties, and psychological distress and happiness for Arab Americans living in the greater Detroit Metropolitan Area (N = 896). I expect that first generation Arab Americans will have more psychological distress compared to one and half, second, and third generations, and Arab Americans with more cross-border ties will have less psychological distress and more happiness. Data come from the 2003 Detroit Arab American Study, which includes measures of nativity, cross-border ties -- attitudes, social ties, media consumption, and community organizations, and the Kessler-10 scale of psychological distress and self-reported happiness. Ordered logistic regression analyses suggest that psychological distress and happiness do not vary much by nativity alone. However, cross-border ties have both adverse and protective effects on psychological distress and happiness. For all generations of Arab Americans, cross-border attitudes and social ties are associated with greater odds of psychological distress and for first generation Arab Americans, media consumption is associated with greater odds of unhappiness. In contrast, for all generations, involvement in cross-border community organizations is associated with less psychological distress and for the third generation, positive cross-border attitudes are associated with higher odds of happiness. These findings show the complex relationship between cross-border ties and psychological distress and happiness for different generations of Arab Americans.

T1  - The Power of Perception: Mediating the Impact of Poverty on Student Achievement
AN  - 1764707901
AB  - Race and class often marginalize students in impoverished urban neighborhoods, and this reality is evident in consistently low student achievement in many of the schools in these neighborhoods. This study examines how a teacher's sense of agency can help mediate the detrimental impact of poverty on student achievement. Teachers in a large Northeastern urban school district (N = 1,019) were surveyed about how they perceive obstacles to student learning. The study shows that the ways in which teachers think about obstacles to student learning are strong predictors of student achievement regardless of poverty level. The study suggests ways teachers can achieve a greater sense of agency in the classroom. [web URL: http://eus.sagepub.com/content/48/3/245.abstract]

AB  - Some early responses to this book (Burr, 2016), and public discussion related to the material within, indicate an extraordinary and wilful myopia; recommendations from Justice Henway of the CLAS (Radio NZ, 2016b), the Human Rights Commission (NZ Herald, 2016), and calls from the survivors themselves, remain stifled under the weight of official minimisation and internal self-justification (Radio NZ, 2016c; Action Station).  Essential reading for students in Criminology, Sociology, or New Zealand History, or anyone with an interest or profession related to the criminal justice system, the helping professions, particularly mental health and social work, human rights, or social policy.

T1  - Does change in minority and women's representation on television matter?: a 30-year study of television portrayals and social tolerance
AN  - 2571055024
AB  - Increases in substantive portrayals of working women, racial groups, and sexual minorities on television are a common explanation for some of the observed increase in social tolerance over the last few decades. In this study, I first document change in these portrayals from 1970 to 2000. After doing so, I determine if higher levels of recurring portrayals are associated with greater levels of social tolerance for those who report watching larger amounts of television. If no association is found, this would validate claims of non-existent or minimal effects. The findings show that frequent television viewers generally have more negative attitudes as compared with non-viewers when recurring portrayals of these groups are low. However, television viewers have similar or higher levels of social tolerance compared with non-viewers when recurring portrayals become frequent. This supports the argument that increasing televised portrayals of women and minorities on television can help increase social tolerance, but differences in the substance and quality of these portrayals likely condition this link.

T1  - Images of poverty in a selection of the Polish daily press
AN  - 1732093004
AB  - The social construction of poverty constitutes an important aspect of a country's welfare culture. Still amidst studies on poverty measurement, dynamics, causes and consequences, enquiry into the social or cultural (re-)presentations of poverty remains relatively infrequent, especially in Continental Europe. The current study addresses the issue of social/cultural representations of poverty by investigating the media portrayal of poverty in Poland. Qualitative analysis of three dailies published in three research periods (2005-2007-2010) revealed marginalization of poverty in press reports. In the course of investigation, five dominant frames, each conveying a specific image of the poor and featuring them in a particular (social) role, were identified. The two primary frames were the injustice frame and the solidarity frame; the two secondary normality frames were the heroic and anti-heroic frames; the fifth -- the instrumental frame proved rather marginal. The (social policy) implications of the media portrayal of the poor are discussed. Parallels between the poverty frames uncovered in Polish media and those revealed in other countries are sketched.

T1  - Second Generation Immigrant Girls' Negotiations of Cultural Proximity in Switzerland: A Foucauldian Reading
AN  - 1724872410
AB  - Although overtly racist political discourse in Switzerland has receded, culturalist discourses continue to construct ideal immigrants. Policies define immigrants in terms of "cultural proximity" and contain an implicit distinction between "distant" and "proximal" foreigners. Culturally, distant immigrants have been stereotyped as aggressive and/or lacking interest in education and professional success and while scholars have examined immigrants from Switzerland's "culturally-near" regions, the experiences of second generation immigrant populations from perceived culturally distant countries have largely escaped attention. Knowledge about girls and women is particularly scarce. Against this backdrop, this paper provides an examination of how six teenage girls living in a German-speaking Swiss city negotiate their perceived cultural distance. By combining interview material with elements of Foucauldian theory, the paper provides insight into (1) the diasporic experiences of girls with second generation immigration backgrounds and (2) the operation and influence of culturalist discourses. Foucault's notion of dispositive--the discourses, institutions, laws, and scientific findings that, through various means of distribution (e.g., media texts, policies, education curricula), act as an apparatus that constructs and supports normative ideals--provides a generative analytic tool for this task. The analysis suggests that the ways girls learn to understand their social worlds is a collective process of discipline that places mechanisms of social control within each individual. This process involves the homogenisation and marginalisation of the immigrant population and is circular in nature in that the girls strengthen and maintain the power of existing culturalist knowledge that works negatively on them. The paper concludes with a consideration of how this situation might be challenged.

T1  - Finding God in Global Politics: IPSR
AN  - 1933640334
AB  - The literature on religion and international politics has expanded in reaction to the events iconically known as '9/11', said to cast doubt on the 'secularisation thesis', which dominated the social sciences' approach to religion until the 1980s. The four books under review begin by assessing the secularisation premise, before amassing data to demonstrate the ways in which 'religion' (however conceived) influences or is suppressed by governments, inflames or mediates conflicts, shapes voter attitudes and political cultures, and so on. With one exception, the authors devote little attention to defining 'religion' or to delineating what differentiates it from other categories such as 'politics', 'culture', or 'ethnicity'. What 'religion' refers to, and how it relates to the 'secular', has been the subject of detailed, technical debate within the discipline of religious studies since 1962, but this literature is largely invisible in the four reviewed texts. The result is an enormous body of data which will overturn many enduring stereotypes; but whose usefulness is, in some cases, limited by the fact that the studies ultimately demonstrate that researchers tend to find what they go looking for.

T1  - Senegalese immigrant families' 'regroupement' in France and the im/possibility of reconstituting family across multiple temporalities and spatialities
AN  - 1722763406
AB  - This paper interrogates the structural conditions, macropolitics and governmentality of family 'regroupement' in France in an era of shifting immigration policies in Europe and the imaginative possibilities that Senegalese immigrants exercise to maintain family and kinship ties with those left behind. It argues that while the need to maintain ties from diasporic locations is mediated by policies, material and emotive transnational practices, the materiality of displacement as well as the state's politics of immigration render more elusive possibilities of maintaining family in situ. What tensions and creative strategies emerge? How is 'home', the primordial site of family structure, reimagined and reconstituted? Taking into account state's politics and immigrants' entrapment within multiple spheres of power and their active agency as determinants, this paper uncovers how displacement gives rise to multiple ruptures while simultaneously motivating a search for active agency to reconstruct and reimagine kinship, family and conjugality across multiple temporalities and spatialities.

T1  - Television on Women's Empowerment in India
AN  - 1667948558; 201510291
AB  - We used a nationwide demographic survey to study the relation between television exposure and women's empowerment in India. Ordinary least squares (OLS) results suggested that TV exposure improved Indian women's status. We used the propensity score matching (PSM) method to mitigate the potential threat of endogeneity. The results indicate that TV exposure is correlated with greater awareness of autonomy, greater financial independence, less unwanted pregnancy (birth control), negative attitude toward beating, a lower tendency of giving birth, a smaller family, and a lower preference level for sons. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1660022993; 201506537
AB  - Women's sport has always been a challenging subject in Muslim countries and Muslim women have had to face various constraints regarding their participation in sport and exercise, which also influence their attitudes to sport. This study aims to explore the attitude of Iranian female university students toward sport by survey method (N = 1,120) and qualitative interviews (N = 50). The results indicate that the majority of the participants have negative attitudes to sport, and accordingly they do not practice it. Various macro-, meso- and micro-level factors were found as perceived barriers. From the results it can be concluded that the media as a tool for raising awareness to providing role models and shaping the social values of mainstream society does not take a positive role in order to develop the culture of women's sport, and to change the attitude of female students and their social environments to sport in Iranian society.

T1  - The role of the internet in testimony: the case of the 'Forgotten Australians'
AN  - 1933671259
AB  - This article examines the case of the Forgotten Australians as an opportunity to examine the role of the internet in the presentation of testimony. 'Forgotten Australians' are a group who suffered abuse and neglect after being removed from their parents - either in Australia or in the UK - and placed in Church- and State-run institutions in Australia between 1930 and 1970. The campaign by this profoundly marginalized group coincided with the decade in which the opportunities of Web 2.0 were seen to be diffusing throughout different social groups, and were considered a tool for social inclusion. We outline a conceptual framework that positions the role of the internet as an environment in which the difficult relationships between painful past experiences and contemporary injunctions to remember them, are negotiated. We then apply this framework to the analysis of case examples of posts and interaction on websites with web 2.0 functionality: YouTube and the National Museum of Australia. The analysis points to commonalities and differences in the agency of the internet in these two contexts, arguing that in both cases the websites provided support for the development of a testimony-like narrative and the claiming, sharing and acknowledgement of loss.

T1  - Between the therapeutic and the democratic? Mediating disability memories online1
AN  - 1646880212
AB  - Disabled people constitute the "largest minority in the world" (United Nations, 2006). As such, a study of contemporary memory-making practices around disability can provide a crucial lens through which to engage with ongoing issues of socioeconomic and cultural marginalization. This article examines two digital memory projects which showcase the life stories and creative outputs of people with disabilities: the Museum of the Person USA (Bloomington, US) and Envisioning New Meanings of Disability and Difference (Toronto, Canada). I argue that a close analysis of these projects illustrates a current tension between autobiographical, self-expressive memory narratives and those orientated by wider sociopolitical claims. Significantly, gendered aspects of disability discourses also work to unsettle the boundaries of what we understand the "therapeutic" and "democratic" to be. At present there is scant research taking people with disabilities' own testimony and experience as its core sources. The rise of networked technologies and the opportunities this creates for marginal memories to be publicly shared and witnessed therefore provides a compelling context through which to examine the mediation of disability stories online, and the ways in which these memories can act as tentative resources for social justice claims.

T1  - Gender equality and immigrant integration: Honor killing and forced marriage debates in the Netherlands, Germany, and Britain
AN  - 1559007963; 201434514
AB  - Synopsis The past decade has seen a surge in media and policy debates on honor-based violence, honor killing, and forced marriage in the Netherlands, Germany, and Britain. Drawing on political debates and policy responses to these forms of violence, we analyze how understandings of 'gender equality' inform distinct approaches to immigrant integration. The Dutch case shows how the idea of gender equality can sometimes be used to include Muslim communities in the larger population, by generating policy responses that are more likely to position immigrants as full members of society. Alternatively, as the German case most clearly illustrates, the idea of gender equality can inform the stigmatization of Muslim communities and lead to exclusionary immigration policies. In Britain, gender equality discourses stand in tension with discourses on race, with some NGO's accusing government of failing women out of fear of being accused of racism. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - The Subjective Group Dynamics of Inter- and Intragroup Criminality in the News: The Role of Prior Television News Viewing as a Moderator
AN  - 1680151028; 201514672
AB  - Participants read a crime news story featuring two perpetrators. Building on subjective group dynamics, we predicted that a perpetrator would be evaluated differently depending on the partner's ethnicity and participants' prior media use. Results show that heavy news consumers were more likely to (a) give a harsher sentence to a white perpetrator acting with a white (vs. Latino) partner, and (b) develop more negative attitudes toward Latinos when members of that group were portrayed in intergroup criminal partnerships. The implications of intergroup portrayals for perceptions of the ingroup, as well as the outgroup, and the moderating effects of news viewing on such effects, are discussed. .

T1  - STIGMA TOWARDS PLWHA: THE ROLE OF INTERNALIZED HOMOSEXUAL STIGMA IN LATINO GAY/BISEXUAL MALE AND TRANSGENDER COMMUNITIES
AN  - 1512218380; 201410430
AB  - Stigma negatively affects the health of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Negative attitudes and discriminatory actions towards PLWHA are thought to be based, among other factors, on stigma towards sexual minorities and beliefs about personal responsibility. Yet, there is little evidence to support these linkages and explain how they take place, especially among Latinos. This study analyzes attitudes towards PLWHA among 643 Latino gay/bisexual men and transgender (GBT) people. It examines whether discriminatory actions are predicted by beliefs about personal responsibility and internalized homosexual stigma. Results indicate that Discriminatory Actions towards PLWHA is associated with HIV/AIDS Personal Responsibility Beliefs and Internalized Homosexual Stigma. Further, HIV/AIDS Personal Responsibility Beliefs partially mediates the relationship between Internalized Homosexual Stigma and Discriminatory Actions towards PLWHA. Latino GBT persons who have internalized negative views about homosexuality may project those onto PLWHA. They may think PLWHA are responsible for their serostatus and, hence, deserving of rejection.

T1  - Justifying discrimination against Muslim immigrants: Out-group ideology and the five-step social identity model
AN  - 1438553802; 201340142
AB  - This study examines how Geert Wilders, leader of the far-right Party For Freedom (PVV) in the Netherlands, justifies discriminatory measures for Muslim citizens. Wilders' contributions to four parliamentary debates and newspaper articles are analysed. The analysis shows that Wilders consistently makes a distinction between Islam as a belief system and Muslims as a group of people. Islam is defined as external to the West and as a major threat to the virtuous nature of the in-group. Defending and preserving Western liberal values against Islam is construed as a moral imperative. It is further shown how the distinction between Islam and Muslims functions to ward off accusations of prejudice and discrimination. It is concluded that social psychologists studying prejudice and discrimination should pay more attention to the distinction between person categories and ideological categories, and to political leadership.

T1  - Screening in or out? Selective non-surveillance of unwanted humanity in EU cities
AN  - 1439040948
AB  - In Surveillance Studies, routinized surveillance systems are often regarded as public (and corporate) interference in the private lives of citizens. On the other hand, it is often recognised that surveillance of citizens is also often the counterpart of fundamental rights being guaranteed by the state, especially in fields of economic and social rights. Non-surveillance, and highly selective surveillance can thus be counterparts of efforts to exclude some urban residents from the 'right to have rights' in the first place. This paper considers how selective in- and out-screening of undocumented people in EU cities can produce regularised human rights abuses. Only punitive surveillance is routine in the case of this group of the population. Starting with the 2002 EU Directive 'Strengthening the Penal Framework to Prevent the Facilitation of Unauthorised Entry, Transit and Residence', across the EU the goal of policy has been to remove those redefined as unwanted or surplus humanity. The urban dispossessed are denied even the most basic rights through selective out-surveillance and non-collection of data, including, for example, the right to housing, healthcare, education and employment. At the heart of such selective non-surveillance and punitive screening-out is the deterrence logic of immigration policies across the EU. Data about the everyday lives of the undocumented is lacking, and even where there is such data it is not being fed into policy making at national and urban government levels. Undocumented people end up in the parallel economy, and on the streets, being 'caught' up in illegality, liable to the most punitive forms of screening-out surveillance. They are thus liable to detention, imprisonment and deportation. Self-exclusion, avoidance of public institutions, including schools, medical care and migrant support organisations, can be the result of such punitive screening-out. Redefined as 'unwanted humanity', about whom data is not even systematically collected, undocumented people are a 'target group' for policing, the media and law and order policies. Their selective non-surveillance is thus a strong indicator of their unwantedness. We illustrate our argument using examples from UK, The Netherlands and France. The article suggests that broad and general surveillance of all populations within the EU needs to be recognised as a public good for which states should be held accountable. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Romaphobia Among Serbian Adolescents: The Role of National In-group Attitudes and Perceived Threat
AN  - 1283642562; 201303381
AB  - This study employed the integrated threat theory to examine Serbian adolescents' attitudes towards the Roma. The sample consisted of 687 secondary school students (mean age 17), of whom 53% were females. In a survey-based study, we assessed adolescents' national in-group attitudes (i.e., nationalism), their feelings toward the Roma, and their perception of economic and symbolic threat. Findings suggest that perceived threat to either real resources or worldviews of the dominant group was related to more negative attitudes towards the Roma minority. Further, Romaphobia was positively related to adolescents' nationalism and this relationship was partially mediated by perceived economic and symbolic threat. The theoretical and educational implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Direct and Mediated Intercultural Contact: Koreans' Attitudes toward U.S. Americans
AN  - 1033026447
AB  - Guided by the intergroup contact hypothesis, this study tested two models examining the associations among Korean young adults' consumption of U.S. dramas, direct contact with a U.S. American person, and their attitudes toward U.S. Americans in general. Results demonstrated that personal contact and mediated contact had a positive effect on intergroup attitudes, but that frequency of personal contact was a negative contributor. Mediated contact had different and stronger influences on participants' intergroup attitudes when they did not have personal contact with U.S. Americans. In addition, intergroup anxiety played a significant role in the contact modes and attitudes links. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Attitudes and Decisions about Sexual Offenders: A Comparison of Laypersons and Professionals
AN  - 1023026660; 201223726
AB  - The current study examines the inherent biases about sexual offending held by 123 laypersons and 120 professionals (i.e. probation officers and therapists). In order to determine the extent of these biases, a series of brief newspaper articles were constructed to depict cases of sexual offenders. Each article comprised several combinations of key variables, including offender type, level of admission, and the presence of alcohol. Participants read a series of three fabricated articles and then completed a questionnaire regarding attitudes about the various offenders. The results indicate important differences between the lay and professional samples. Laypersons deemed sex offenders more favourably in terms of character, accountability, and risk for sexual recidivism. However, both groups showed some similar perceptions about sexual offending. Specifically, both groups evaluated child molesters more negatively than exhibitionists and in some cases, rapists. These findings highlight the need for continuing education for professionals in order to attenuate the effects of prejudicial attitudes. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

AB  - Cult Med Psychiatry (2012) 36:175177 DOI 10.1007/s11013-011-9227-x BOOK REVIEW The Paradox of Hope: Journeys Through a Clinical Borderland University of California Press, Berkeley, 2010 C. Jason Throop Published online: 31 July 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011 The Paradox of Hope begins with an evocative retelling of Cheryl Mattinglys rst encounter with an African American mother named Adrena in the main lobby of a large urban hospital in Southern California.

Drawing signicantly from neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics, Mattingly shows throughout the books various chapters how such a C. J. Throop (&) Department of Anthropology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA e-mail: jthroop@ucla.edu 123 176 Cult Med Psychiatry (2012) 36:175177 blues hope is cultivated through concrete practices that distill virtuous dispositions such as courage, care, and compassion.

Expanding upon some of Mattinglys earlier insights into the homologous relationship between narrative and experience (Mattingly 1998), The Paradox of Hope advances a narrative phenomenology that tacks between an appreciation for the broader socio-political and economic structures that shape everyday existence and a close analysis of the personal, intimate, singular, and eventful qualities of social life (p. 7).

T1  - Status conferral in intergroup social dilemmas: Behavioral antecedents and consequences of prestige and dominance
AN  - 1347784079; 201318446
AB  - Bridging the literatures on social dilemmas, intergroup conflict, and social hierarchy, the authors systematically varied the intergroup context in which social dilemmas were embedded to investigate how costly contributions to public goods influence status conferral. They predicted that contribution behavior would have opposite effects on 2 forms of status -- prestige and dominance -- depending on its consequences for the self, in-group and out-group members. When the only way to benefit in-group members was by harming out-group members (Study 1), contributions increased prestige and decreased dominance, compared with free-riding. Adding the option of benefitting in-group members without harming out-group members (Study 2) decreased the prestige and increased the dominance of those who chose to benefit in-group members via intergroup competition. Finally, sharing resources with both in-group and out-group members decreased perceptions of both prestige and dominance, compared with sharing them with in-group members only (Study 3). Prestige and dominance differentially mediated the effects of contribution behavior on leader election, exclusion from the group, and choices of a group representative for an intergroup competition. Taken together, these findings show that the well-established relationship between contribution and status is moderated by both the intergroup context and the conceptualization of status.

T1  - Race, Immigration, and Policing: Chinese Immigrants' Satisfaction with Police
AN  - 925712178; 201205787
AB  - A considerable body of research focuses on racial and ethnic minorities' perceptions of police, yet non-Black, non-Hispanic minority groups, Asians in particular, are largely overlooked. Meanwhile, despite a fast growing immigrant population and the increasing demand on local police to enforce immigration law, research on police-immigrant relations remains limited. Using data from over 400 Chinese immigrants, this study examines the issues of race/ethnicity, immigration, and policing with a focal concern on Chinese immigrants' attitudes toward police. Results indicate that the majority of Chinese immigrants rate police positively in overall performance and specific areas of effectiveness, integrity, and demeanor. Both universal and immigrant-specific factors are important predictors of immigrants' attitudes. Chinese immigrants' evaluations of police are not only affected by exposure to media coverage of police misconduct, neighborhood conditions, and city context, but also are intertwined with their opinions of their home country police and perceptions of US immigration authorities.

T1  - 'Simon Cowell for prime minister'? Young citizens' attitudes towards celebrity politics
AN  - 1928294158
AB  - The merging of celebrity and politics is becoming an established element of democratic political culture. Drawing on our own empirical research with first-time voters in the UK, we want to contribute to this debate. Specifically we ask whether, for young citizens, celebrities are an alternative to current political processes and a democratizing force capable of engaging them in the politics of the public sphere. Young people are a particularly interesting example. While disconnected from main-stream forms of political participation, such as voting and party membership (Fahmy, 2003), young people’s lives are strongly connected with the cultural industries that drive the production of celebrity. Our argument engages with those authors who suggest that popular culture has the potential to energize the public sphere.

T1  - Taming of the casino dragon
AN  - 758121968; 201059043
AB  - The Gambling Act 2005 reformed the gambling market with far-reaching implications for the market as a whole, and casino gambling in particular. A small survey was conducted in Swansea to review community perceptions of casinos in their locality. This paper examines the alleged benefits of gambling and to discuss the concern that the Gambling Act will be likely to harm those who are most deprived and vulnerable in society. This paper explores the advantages and disadvantages to the establishment of a casino and its perceived impacts on local families and communities. Issues such as fear of an increase in crime and increases in poverty, ill-health and family breakdown were all important to respondents and are discussed in this paper. In summary, the majority of all respondents had a negative attitude towards gambling, which reflects the findings of the British Gambling Prevalence Survey. During conversations it became evident that the respondents' attitudes towards the casino gambling were formed based on their perceptions and images of a casino and the gambling industry in general. A lot of respondents said that their perceptions of Internet gambling were predominantly based on the media reporting. Some of the respondents mentioned that their personal gambling experiences and observations had also shaped their opinions on the survey responses. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 754041442; 201053289
AB  - Draws on various secondary sources to examine how anti-Communism & homophobia in the late-Cold War US impacted Cuban & US immigration policies. The gay press's relationship to the larger narrative of the 1980 Mariel boatlift is explored, asserting that the gay press & the US homosexual community helped mobilize queer resistance & support for the Marielitos. In considering the experiences of these Cuban exiles, light is shed on the relationships among immigration, nationality, & sexuality. In particular, the effect of the Refugee Act of 1980 on the Marielitos is discussed in terms of the "state's gaze" on homosexuality. It is contended that the US shifted its homophobic stance on immigration & citizenship in support of those fleeing Cuban Communism. D. Edelman

T1  - Need Threat Can Motivate Performance After Ostracism
AN  - 1928320964
AB  - Ostracism threatens fundamental needs of belonging, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence, which should motivate participants to respond to this threat. However, research has yet to examine the role of need threat in producing motivation after ostracism. In the current work, participants completed a "cognitive ability" (antisaccade) task following Cyberball-induced ostracism or inclusion. In two experiments, it was found that when ostracized, participants do not see antisaccade performance as a means of responding to the concerns produced by need threat; they respond only to the social threat, leading to worse performance than included participants (Experiments 1 and 2). However, when participants see an avenue of response (the Cyberball players can compare antisaccade performances), ostracized participants outperform included participants (Experiment 2). Moreover, this effect was mediated by the need for belonging, suggesting that ostracized participants were motivated to elevate their inclusionary status by demonstrating their worth on the cognitive ability task.
