T1  - Association between race/color and incidence of hypertension in the ELSA-Brasil population: investigating the mediation of racial discrimination and socioeconomic position
AN  - 2680919113
AB  - ObjectiveTo investigate the mediation effect of socioeconomic position and racial discrimination in the association between race/color and incidence of hypertension in 4-years follow up.MethodsWe included 8,370 participants of the Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). A latent variable was constructed to represent socioeconomic position (SEP). The perception of discrimination was measured through an adaptation of the Lifetime Major Events Scale; and hypertension was defined using standard criteria. We investigated Body Mass Index (BMI) due to its role in proximal risk for hypertension. To investigate the mediating role of SEP and racial discrimination, we used structural equation modeling.ResultsSEP had a direct and negative effect on HT incidence (HT incidence increased in worse SEP categories), while the effect of BMI on HT was direct and positive. We did not find significant direct effects of race/color and racial discrimination on HT. As for indirect effects, we observed associations between race/color and HT only through SEP mediation.ConclusionAccording to our results, race/color is indirectly related to HT incidence, mediated by SEP. Racial discrimination was not a mediator in the relationship between race/color and HT in the follow-up period.

T1  - Looking at the ‘field’ through a Zoom lens: Methodological reflections on conducting online research during a global pandemic
AN  - 2661420697
AB  - For many social science scholars, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to re-think our approaches to research. As a result of new social distancing measures, those of us who conduct in-person qualitative and ethnographic research have faced significant challenges in accessing the populations and fields we study. Technology served as an incredibly useful tool for social interaction and research prior to the pandemic, and it has since become even more important as a way to engage with others. Although not all types of social research, or even all projects, lend themselves to online activities, digital communication platforms like Zoom, Skype, and Facebook have allowed many of us to continue our studies from a distance—in some cases, significant temporal and spatial distances away from our research sites. As such, it is important to consider how these different methodological approaches challenge our understandings of fieldwork. While the disadvantages of not physically accessing the places we study are clear, can mediated approaches offer (any) hope of the immersion we experienced with in-person fieldwork? If many of us are able to continue ethnographic research (in some form) without co-locating with our participants in our field sites, how are our studies fundamentally affected, as well as the ways we conceptualize the ‘field’ more largely? This paper explores these methodological and epistemological questions through reflections on conducting online research during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

T1  - Let's talk about the Israel–Palestine conflict: Does exposure to political comedy about the Middle East influence policy attitudes?
AN  - 2667100557
AB  - ObjectiveThe research considers the impact of exposure to political comedy focused on the crisis in the Middle East on viewers' attitudes toward the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.MethodsData from a four‐group experiment were analyzed (N = 240; August 2021). Video stimuli were drawn from Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, Late Night with Seth Meyers, and Full Frontal with Samantha Bee.ResultsThe results suggest that exposure to this critical content has a limited but significant effect on issue attitudes. Specifically, subjects exposed to satire about the conflict in the Middle East were significantly less likely to suggest that the United States is too supportive of the Palestinians and were marginally less likely to suggest that the Hamas response to the crisis goes too far, that the Israeli government is making a sincere effort to bring about peace, and that there is a way for Israel and an independent Palestinian state to coexist peacefully.ConclusionThe implications of the findings and the potential influence of satire on foreign policy issue attitudes are discussed.

AN  - 2660214702
AB  - Purpose>The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of civil liberties, global health security, median age and population size on the spread of COVID-19 across the globe.Design/methodology/approach>This study was done by taking data from 166 different countries from the Economist Intelligence Unit, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, World Bank, Johns Hopkins University and United Nations Population Division (UNPD). After conducting all the necessary standard econometric tests, the study was analyzed using the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.Findings>The finding of the study indicated that COVID-19 tests per million people (LTT/PM), Population Size (LPOP), Civil Liberty Index (CLI) are statistically significant and positively affect the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases; on the other hand, the Health Security Index (HSI) negatively affects the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.Practical implications>In emergency circumstances, the government ought to have a special responsibility to align civil rights with the protection of public health cautiously. However, measures to restrict civil liberties must be proportionate.Originality/value>Besides other variables, the study included and considered civil liberties as a significant factor to affect the spread of COVID-19, which is a new contribution to the existing body of knowledge in the field.

T1  - “Why should Facebook (not) ban trump?”: connecting divides in reasoning and morality in public deliberation
AN  - 2655995341
AB  - The divides between social groups in American society today extend from political opinion to lifestyle and emotions. A less explored area, however, is how these divides relate to potential divides in morality. The Habermasian conceptualization of the public sphere prioritizes deliberative reasoning as a way to solve moral conflicts. In contrast, this study argues that divides in reasoning and opinion are associated with divides in morality. To make the argument, this study focuses on the case of public debates over whether social media companies should deplatform Trump and his supporters in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection. Public comments were obtained from a dataset compiled and released by Facebook Oversight Board. First, I used structural topic modeling to identify the reasoning and used the dictionary based on the Moral Foundations Theory to gauge moral foundations in each document. Then, I used statistical analysis to examine whether there was a correlation between specific reasoning and moral foundations. The results show that the pro- and anti-deplatforming camps in the debate are divided not only in reasoning, but also in morality. Supporters of deplatforming argue that it would fulfill tech companies’ public responsibility, and protect society at large. These arguments are correlated with the care foundation. In contrast, opponents argue that deplatforming Trump violated freedom of speech. This argument is correlated with the fairness, loyalty, and authority foundations, but not the care foundation. The findings support my argument that divides in reasoning should be analyzed with consideration of morality.

T1  - Media Representations of Lesbians, Gay Men, and Bisexuals on Dutch Television and People’s Stereotypes and Attitudes About LGBs
AN  - 2635108024
AB  - This study investigates stereotypical portrayals of lesbians, gays, and bisexuals (LGBs) on Dutch television and whether these portrayals relate to people’s attitudes towards LGBs. Previous research shows that television programs in the U.S. contain many stereotypical portrayals of LGBs. These portrayals are both negatively and positively related to people’s attitude towards LGBs. Because the Dutch culture is relatively accepting of LGBs it is interesting to see if they are portrayed differently than in the U.S. A content analysis showed that there are stereotypical representations on Dutch television but there are also people who ‘just happen to be gay’. A survey among 272 participants showed that people who more frequently watch programs with stereotypical portrayals of LGBs do not have a more positive or negative attitude than people who do not. A mediation analysis showed that people who watch more television in general have a more stereotypical view of gay men, which is related to more negative attitudes towards LGBs.

T1  - Everyday Intimacies and Inter-Ethnic Relationships: Tracing Entanglements of Gender and Race in Multicultural Singapore
AN  - 2640529619
AB  - Through the proposed frame of ‘everyday intimacies’, this article explores the entanglements of race and gender in inter-ethnic relationships. ‘Everyday intimacies’ brings together the minority experiences of everyday racism, the state practices and policies of multiculturalism, and their inflections in intimate relationships of marriage, friendship, and dating. This approach demonstrates not just how the state regulates people’s intimate life through policies of marriage and family, but also how other indirect processes of multicultural governance mediate intimate life. Drawing on biographical narratives of mainly Indian women from in-depth life story interviews and ethnographic fieldwork, the article brings the literature on intimacies in conversation with the scholarship on race and ethnic relations in Singapore. Through a focus on intimacy, the article illustrates how tacit knowledge and embodied effects of everyday racism relate to larger trends of intermarriages, rising singlehood among Indian women and possibilities of co-ethnic friendships and solidarities. In doing so, the article presents novel insight into race and gender relations in Singapore.

T1  - When Does Infrastructure “Qualify for [Artistic] Attention”? The “ABCs” of Contemporary Art in Post-Liberalization India
AN  - 2635982524
AB  - The period between “liberalization,” or the 1991 opening of India's economy to foreign direct investment, and the 2008 onset of the Great Recession was one of unprecedented change in the forms of Indian art and the infrastructures that supported its understanding, presentation, and circulation. This period of efflorescence—of multiplying growth in and transformation of a set of interlocking artistic and social forms—poses methodological challenges similar to those identified by George E. Marcus and Fred R. Myers in their 1995 volume, The Traffic in Culture: Refiguring Art and Anthropology. Marcus and Myers’ call to focus on appropriation, boundary-making, and circulation, though meant to submit the Western art world to critique, coincides quite clearly with three particularly salient changes seen in Indian contemporary art in the period: the turn to unconventional material as artistic media (appropriation); the deliberate integration of artistic work with the materialities of everyday life (boundary); and the development of entirely new curatorial infrastructures and frameworks (circulation). The present essay examines these changes through Mumbai-based artist Navjot Altaf's post-1996, ongoing collaborative work with adivasi (indigenous) artists in the Central Indian region of Bastar. Eventually registered as the NGO Dialogue Interactive Artists Association (DIAA), the collective's activities have ranged from parallel exhibitions of “art” and “craft” to site-specific, cross-disciplinary engagements with play structures (Pilla Gudi) and water taps (Nalpar) built upon collective practices meant to bridge the considerable social distance between urban upper-class and adivasi artists. DIAA's work with water, like other artistic engagements with infrastructure, highlights the social, aesthetic, material, and political aspects of the built networks that sustain everyday life. Their critique leveraged Marcus and Myers’ ABCs, incorporating critical acts of appropriation, the active violation of social and geographical boundaries, and, above all, demonstration of a concern with circulation.

T1  - Public service broadcasting and the emergence of LGBT+ visibility: A comparative perspective on Ireland and Flanders
AN  - 2625221119
AB  - Public Service Broadcasting in Europe and its centrality to cultural diversity has been established in relation to race, multiculturalism and gender, but LGBT+ sexual identity remains relatively absent from research. This article aims to address this gap by fostering a historical approach to examine the ways in which LGBT+ identities emerged on Public Service Broadcasting within Western Europe, specifically in Ireland and Flanders during the 1950s–1990s. Through a small-scale comparative case study analysis between these two regions, this article contends that the emergence of LGBT+ visibility is intrinsically linked to Public Service Broadcasting in both landscapes. Specifically, the article argues that this emergence shares two distinct structural qualities in the emergence of this LGBT+ visibility. First, the comparison points to the ways in which Public Service Broadcasting production cultures incorporated external expertise regarding LGBT+ diversity, presenting itself as a practical operationalisation of the social responsibility of publicly funded media in both regions. Second, later parallels in the introduction of LGBT+ characters to television fiction series illustrate how Public Service Broadcasting responded to various forms of competition from international and commercial broadcasters, engendering particular implications for the visibility of same-sex desire. While contributing to historical treatments of LGBT+ visibility familiar within Queer Media Studies, this article goes against the Anglo-American dominance of the field by examining more local contexts outside the US/UK centric paradigm, diversifying the contexts in which Queer Media Studies research takes place.

T1  - High-Risk Injection-Related Practices Associated with anti-HCV Positivity among Young Adults Seeking Services in Three Small Cities in Wisconsin
AN  - 2644767311
AB  - BackgroundHepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been increasing among people who inject drugs (PWID), younger than 30 years, and living in rural or suburban areas. We examined injection-related behaviors of young PWID to determine factors associated with HCV infection.MethodsFrom September 2013-May 2015, respondent-driven and snowball sampling were used in 3 suburban areas of Wisconsin to recruit PWID 18-29 years who reported injection drug use in the previous 12 months. Participants were tested for HCV antibody (anti-HCV) and reported injection-related behaviors/practices via self-administered computer-based survey. We calculated anti-HCV prevalence and assessed associated factors using multivariable logistic regression.ResultsForty-two percent (117/280) of participants were male, 83% (231/280) were white, and median age was 23 years. Overall HCV prevalence was 33%, but HCV prevalence among males was 39%. Adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, relationship status, insurance status and income, anti-HCV positivity was associated with higher injection frequency (> 100 times in the past six months) (aOR = 3.07; 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI): 1.72-5.45), ever shared syringes (aOR = 5.15; 95% CI: 2.52-10.51), past week/last use receptive rinse water sharing (aOR = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.06-3.33), past week/last use receptive filter sharing (aOR = 3.25; 95% CI: 1.61-6.54), reusing syringes (aOR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.08-3.37), history of overdose (aOR = 8.82; 95% CI: 2.26-3.95), and having ever injected another PWID (aOR = 8.82; 95%CI 3.94-19.76).DiscussionAnti-HCV positivity is associated with high-risk injection practices. Young PWID would benefit from access to evidence-based interventions that reduce their risk of infection, link those infected to HCV treatment, and provide education to reduce further transmission.

T1  - Trial and error: hate speech prosecution and its (unintended) effects on democratic support
AN  - 2616790576
AB  - Due to its controversial nature, hate speech prosecution of anti-immigration politicians is likely to affect citizens’ democratic support. Using a web experiment in which participants are exposed to a manipulated television news story about hate speech prosecution, we test these potential effects in the Dutch context. We demonstrate that effects on democratic support are driven by (dis)agreement with ideas expressed by the prosecuted politician in his alleged hate speech rather than by identification with his party. While a decision to not prosecute a politician does not seem to affect democratic support, a decision to prosecute a politician for hate speech decreases democratic support among citizens with anti-immigration attitudes, and increases democratic support among citizens with pro-immigration attitudes. Decisions to prosecute politicians for hate speech thus have important effects not just on supporters of the politician’s party, but also on other groups in society.

T1  - The digital racist fellowship behind the anti-Aboriginal internet memes
AN  - 2584256002
AB  - In Australian social media platforms, non-Indigenous social media users commonly utilize digital spaces to communicate anti-Aboriginal racism. This article investigates the phenomenon of anti-Aboriginal internet memes that appear across Australian social media pages and closely examines the prominent racializations evident in these memes. This article discusses 19 internet memes and how they function in the development of a racist colonial digital movement. As this article uncovers, several racializations targeting Aboriginality in relation to skin colour and several racist stereotypes are communicated in these memes. This article unpacks the vulgarity of these internet memes and the ways they sustain a racist digital bond among participants.

T1  - Living in a 'free jail': Asylum seekers' and local residents' experiences of discomfort with asylum seeker accommodation
AN  - 2621878372
AB  - This paper shows how asylum seeker accommodation produces a politics of discomfort among both asylum seekers as well as local residents. The paper compares two collective asylum centres located in the city of Augsburg, Germany, one of which is a nationally renowned refugee integration project, the 'Grandhotel Cosmopolis', the other, a state-run asylum centre. Data was obtained through participant observation and semi-structured interviews between September 2016 and November 2017. Drawing on carceral geographies, the paper identifies three mechanisms through which the material and institutional standards of asylum accommodation generate discomfort among and between asylum seekers and local residents, which are self-mortification, depersonalization and role-breakdown. Through the sharing of rooms and facilities, asylum accommodation contributes to asylum seekers' self-mortification, referring to changes in the conceptions and beliefs of oneself. The comparison of the two cases highlights how large asylum centres depersonalize asylum seekers by creating images of a homogenized 'mass' and contribute to role-breakdown, meaning a reduction of individuals' identities performed with regard to work, home or family life. National discourses of asylum seekers as dangerous merged with the space of asylum accommodation, thereby preventing social interaction 'as neighbours' between asylum seekers and local residents. Overall, the paper exposes how a politics of discomfort utilizes affect as a governmental device, thereby turning asylum accommodation into a carceral space by creating social distance and 'moral closure'.

T1  - “Real Men Stand for Our Nation”: Constructions of an American Nation and Anti-Kaepernick Memes
AN  - 2541700466
AB  - On September 1, 2016, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeled for the playing of the national anthem arguing that he was “not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” noting that “this is bigger than football and it would be selfish . . . to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” Kaepernick received a tremendous amount of backlash for this action, and many White fans/media pundits accused him of disrespecting the flag and U.S. military. This act took place during the very contentious presidential election in the United States between eventual winner Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. During this election, the Trump campaign mobilized discourses of White nationalism, and even employed alt-right member Steve Bannon as Trump’s chief advisor for a period. The Trump campaign capitalized on a set of White backlash politics that had been growing since the 1990s, and the reactions to Kaepernick’s protest cannot be separated from this larger context. In this article, we critically read internet memes of Colin Kaepernick to gain insight into the relationship between race, gender, and the nation during the rise of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency.

T1  - ‘Cropped out’: The collaborative production of an accusation of racism
AN  - 2531505880
AB  - This article utilises the concept of ‘race trouble’ as an overarching framework for examining an interview between Ms Vanessa Nakate and a South African news broadcaster. The interview describes an incident involving Ms Nakate’s attendance at a global climate change conference and her exclusion from a media report about a press briefing that she held along with four other youth activists at the conference. The analysis focuses on the collaborative and interactional production of Ms Nakate’s claim that her exclusion was racially motivated and the discursive mechanisms by which race is mobilised as a common-sense explanation for the incident that occurred. My analysis demonstrates the sanctionability of producing an accusation of racism and identifies the rhetorical functions of stake and facticity in its production, and concludes with a discussion of the relevance of these findings in the context of studies on race and racism in interaction.

T1  - Perceptions of identity management in police-civilian interactions: considering the role of gender and race
TT  - Perceptions of identity management
AN  - 2533100749
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to assess if in viewing tense, potentially stigmatizing, police-civilian interactions, people bring their own gendered and racial biases, as they form perceptions of officers' use of identity management (IM) strategies, as they relate to officers' competence, warmth and appropriateness of actions.Design/methodology/approachIn two experimental studies, the authors investigate how the IM strategies used by female and racial minority officers impact officers' ratings of competence, warmth and appropriateness of actions. Utilizing a 2x2x4 design, the authors manipulate officer gender (race), civilian gender (race) and IM strategy used by the officer in a news article describing a police-civilian interaction.FindingsNot all IM strategies established positive perceptions of officers. Gender and race effects were observed in how officers were seen when they were involved in a tense interaction with a civilian. Female officers were perceived as more appropriate in their actions than male officers. However, Black, female officers were rated as both less warm and appropriate in their actions than White, female officers.Originality/valueAlthough policing is seen as a tainted profession, officers' use of IM strategies is understudied. By taking a novel lens of stigmatization and IM strategies as they relate to policing, the authors contribute to how officers may manage their identities as they cope with the stigmatized views of their occupation. Findings have implications for the diversification of law enforcement personnel, as well as building trust and legitimacy between officers and the communities they serve.

T1  - Colour, displacement and narratives of citizenship in South Asian/American and African-American cultures: Notes toward a future of a movement
AN  - 2527379393
AB  - The current movement that aligns the South Asian American population with Black cultures and Black Lives Matter is rooted in a deep history of the New Immigrants from the 19th century to the present. This essay integrates personal narrative with that of race in the United States and develops a historiography of the encounters between South Asian and African-American cultures. It interrogates the presumptions about how we perceive race, how scopophilic desire attenuates to the visual representation of people of colour. The cultural politics of skin colour and race were ambiguous in relation to South Asians and thus, racial slippage between what constituted brown and black played out in social and legal venues, thus defining who is citizen and who is excluded from having a voice in the body politic. Analysing this history is significant in articulating formations of cultural and political solidarities which are urgent in the present time of Black Lives Matter as South Asians link their racialization to that of African-Americans. It is through that we can move towards a liberatory and equitable future.

T1  - From advocacy to acceptance: Social media discussions of protected bike lane installations
AN  - 2503612925
AB  - Many North American cities are building bicycling infrastructure. Lively discussions on social media, where people passionately support or reject bicycling infrastructure projects, provide a unique data set on attitudes towards bicycling infrastructure. Our goal is to analyse social media posts in Edmonton and Victoria, Canada as new bike infrastructure was implemented to understand the thematic and social elements of the conversation and how these changed over time. We collected Twitter messages (n = 13,121: 7640 in Edmonton; 5481 in Victoria) and compared three timeframes: before lanes opened (January 2015 to lane opening); the first riding season (opening to April 2017); and the second riding season (May 2017 to November 2018). For each timeframe, we evaluated word-combination frequencies (to understand the use of language) and social network structures (to understand which accounts were influential and how they interacted). We observed a change in the three time periods. Before the bicycling infrastructure was built, Twitter activity was focused on advocacy, which was especially strong in Victoria. The first riding season had the most social media activity, the most diverse perspectives and the most controversy. The second riding season held more support. Based on the Twitter activity, we found that Edmonton had more support from local businesses and traditional media, launching a connected network of infrastructure with less social media opposition. Our results suggest that attitudes associated with change in bicycling infrastructure may have a cycle, with initial negative responses to change, followed by an uptick in positive attitudes.

T1  - Comparing normative influence from multiple groups: Beyond family, religious ingroup norms predict children's prejudice towards refugees
AN  - 2549948608
AB  - In the wake of the global refugee crisis, children are exposed to negative attitudes from public and private spheres. Previous research has identified family, peer, and school norms as significant predictors of children's inter-ethnic attitudes. We extend this literature by examining normative influence from wider society, which has received substantially less attention. Among 266 children (Mage = 11.24), this study investigates the relative contributions of norms from five ingroups (family, class-peers, Irish, religious and all-humanity) to predict children's anti-refugee bias. Perceptions of positive family and religious norms were the strongest unique predictors of contact intentions and warmth towards refugees. Intergroup anxiety and perceived threat mediated these relationships. Social dominance orientation mediated family normative influence only. These findings highlight the importance of broader groups (beyond that of proximal ingroups) for understanding children's intergroup attitudes.

T1  - Parodies for a pandemic: coronavirus songs, creativity and lockdown
AN  - 2521842848
AB  - One of the common responses to the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdowns that have been a feature of almost all countries has been the making of what have come to be called parodies. These are songs with new lyrics set to the tunes of established and well-known popular songs. The new lyrics describe life during the pandemic, the experience of isolation during lockdown, the importance of wearing masks and washing hands, the importance of social distancing when one is out. The pandemic parodies are a comment, sometimes jocular sometimes more anguished, on the new normal. They are posted on social media sites, mostly YouTube but also other sites such as TikTok, and invite comments from their audience about everything from the quality of the recording to the accuracy of the lyrics in reflecting people’s lives during this time. Some of these parodies are by semi-professional singers, others by amateurs. Most of the parodists are white males and most of the songs parodied are from the 1970s and 1980s, part of the cultural capital of Generation X. This article argues that calling these songs parodies invites misunderstanding. They function more like the ballads of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when new lyrics would be written to be sung to well-known tunes. Often these lyrics would be commentaries on significant public or political events. This article argues that the pandemic parodies function similarly only now rather than the new lyrics being sold in the streets by hawkers, the songs are available on the web. At a time when the popular music industry is undergoing a fundamental transformation as a consequence of the impact of new technologies such as streaming, these pandemic parodies suggest another transformation in the production and consumption of popular music.

T1  - Resistance and Revival: Indigenous Women Media-Makers in Contemporary Mexico
AN  - 2505268450
AB  - Through the use of the documentary genre, a group of Mexican indigenous women video-makers and their collaborators are depicting contemporary indigenous women. Occupying transformative roles in their communities, indigenous women are pioneers opening new cultural and social spaces to work toward a more equitable society. The main scenarios of their struggle are indigenous marginalization and women’s marginalization under patriarchy. The documentaries Voladora/Flying Woman (Chloé Campero, 2008), La vida de la mujer en resistencia/We Are Equal (Chiapas Media Project–Promedios, 2004), and La rebelión de las oaxaqueñas/The Oaxaqueña Rebellion (Mal de Ojo TV, 2008) are case studies of female indigenous resistance through the media.Alternate abstract:Un grupo de creadoras de vídeos indígenas mexicanas y sus colaboradores representan a las mujeres indígenas contemporáneas a través del uso del género documental.

T1  - Higher Rates of Low Socioeconomic Status, Marginalization, and Stress in Black Transgender Women Compared to Black Cisgender MSM in The MARI Study
AN  - 2494269095
AB  - Most HIV research combines transgender women who have sex with men (TWSM) with cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM), despite emerging evidence of important differences. Using data from The MARI Study, we compared Black TWSM and Black cisgender MSM on personal and ecological factors. Black TWSM reported more unemployment (71.4% versus 51.4%, p = 0.015), incarceration (52.4% versus 36.0%, p = 0.046), stressful life experiences (median score 135.5 versus 90, p = 0.033), and HIV positivity (66.7% versus 22.9%, p = 0.008). Further research into the causes and consequences of these differences, and regarding TWSM specifically, is needed.

T1  - Racial equity in academic success: The role of school climate and social emotional learning
AN  - 2489016356
AB  - Many schools and school districts have put significant effort into improving school climate and the social emotional learning (SEL) of students, as they have been shown to be related to improved academic success. Yet, little is known about whether these efforts will contribute to or ameliorate racial differences in academic outcomes. In a series of structural equation models adjusting for school clustering, this study examined mediating and moderating effects of student perceptions of school climate and their own SEL on race differences in self-reported grades. Asian and Latinx students reported slightly more positive perceived school climate while Multiracial students reported significantly less positive perceived school climate compared to White students. Compared to their White peers, all racial groups reported lower levels of SEL. Significant but small indirect standardized effects of race on grades through social emotional competence but not school climate suggest that SEL partially mediates the relationship of race with grades. The association of SEL with grades was significantly stronger for White students compared to other racial groups; the standardized effect size of the association was nearly twice as large for White students as for Black and Native students.

T1  - The segregated gun as an indicator of racism and representations in film
AN  - 2427422574
AB  - Film emphasizes an ironic history of racism in gun control and ownership and a justification for seeking justice among the Black community, but film also perpetuates structural racism and bias, segregating Black from White, and failing to promote equality, solidarity, and progress. The gun is both a symbol of structural racism, and an expression through which critical attitudes and political statements can carry greater meaning and lead to positive action, empowerment, and desegregation. The symbolic meaning of guns in the hands of Blacks as violent, exceptional or some other stereotypical character trope is illustrated using three selected films including: Django Unchained, John Q., and Proud Mary. This paper is divided into three acts: Act I: The gun as symbol of structural racism in film; Act II: Stereotypical characters and their guns; Act III: Desegregation of the gun in film. These sections illustrate the meaning and representation of the gun as a theatrical object in film, and when in the hands of stereotypical character tropes, has perpetuated racist beliefs and attitudes that have not been adequately addressed in the film industry. To desegregate the gun in film, filmmakers need to critically examine the overt and hidden film texts and how the gun, and the characters wielding it, are perceived among audiences.

T1  - Reckoning with whiteness: the limits of desegregation in America’s newsrooms from the 1960s to the present
AN  - 2562202107
AB  - In the wake of George Floyd’s murder, a host of Black and minority journalists are spearheading a national conversation about how racism within the news media has resulted in its failure to adequately and accurately cover the Black community and to report on racial injustice. This article puts that conversation into historical context by considering its antecedents in calls to address the news media’s whiteness problem in the mid-1960s and beyond. Focusing predominately on the television news industry and the print press, it reveals how American newsrooms appeared to lower their colour barriers but did not commit to substantive change. The article shows how the journalists of colour speaking out today inherit a struggle waged by generations before them. The biggest obstacle they faced in turning desegregation into full-blown integration, however, has not been overt white supremacist racism in American news media, but the enduring commitment of white media owners, managers, and editors to white-defined ‘objectivity’.

T1  - Producing white comfort through “corporate cool”: Linguistic appropriation, social media, and @BrandsSayingBae
AN  - 2441651690
AB  - Drawing on branded tweets that linguistically appropriate slang, African American Language, and hip hop lyrics, this article examines how corporations rework black culture to create “corporate cool” as part of their advertising strategy on social media. We examine three processes that corporations engage in to associate themselves with “coolness” while managing levels of racial contact and proximity for their audience: 1) racially ambiguous voicing, 2) “bleaching” black bodies out of images, and 3) the forging of “racially tinged” intertextual connections. While previous scholarship has analyzed how acts of cultural and linguistic appropriation reap profit for white people and continue to stigmatize already racially marginalized groups, we describe how these seemingly innocent cultural and linguistic references harness a corporately constructed black cool to produce a sense of white comfort. We argue that white comfort is generated not only through the avoidance of overt references to racial conflict, as the term “white fragility” suggests, but also through well-worn, familiar, and comfortable reminders of racial difference and domination that are offered at a safe distance from actual black people and contexts of racial violence.

T1  - Using counterframing strategies to enhance anti-stigma campaigns related to mental illness
AN  - 2506548116
AB  - Rationale and methods: Despite the prevalence of media-based anti-stigma campaigns, there is little empirical evidence of their effectiveness and little guidance regarding which communicative strategies can bolster their message. Using a Belgian sample (N = 737) recruited in March–April 2019, the current experimental study manipulated a campaign message using counterframing strategies. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to investigate the effectiveness of the resulting nine variants. Results: Campaign effectiveness was most increased by stating that people with a mental illness are "not free-riders or poseurs", or by redefining them as "go-getters" who are "certainly not abnormal or crazy". These variants decreased desired social distance, and significantly reduced stereotype endorsement for people with a high need for cognitive closure. Whereas several campaigns decreased attitudinal stigma for people with a high need for cognitive closure, they inadvertently increased it for people with a low need for cognitive closure. Conclusion: This study indicates that small changes in the body copy can impact a campaign's destigmatizing potential. As such, empirical testing is essential to avoid ineffective or counter-productive anti-stigma interventions. Moreover, this study demonstrates that refuting stigmatizing statements can be a valid strategy in anti-stigma interventions, even though previous literature has argued against it.

T1  - The Pornographic Grammar of the Vocal Latinx Body: Gay Lesbian Quarterly
AN  - 2508628175
AB  - During the summer of 2018 I taught a course titled "'Putting Hypersexuality to Work': Ethnic Images in Film." The course was inspired by Mireille Miller-Young's article "Putting Hypersexuality to Work: Black Women and Illicit Eroticism in Pornography" (2010b). The goal of the course was for students to analyze and understand how pornography created different racist scripts, how queer and feminist genres emerged, and how adult entertainers of color negotiate labor politics. Given it was my first time teaching a porn class, I made a commitment to read what I could find about porn and pedagogy (Decena 2010; Miller-Young 2010a; Penley 2013; Parrenas Shimizu 2010). Most of the films I assigned were incorporated into the course because they were identified as porn classics by porn scholars, particularly when thinking about race, gender, class, size, and queer representation. As I watched these porn classics and assigned readings to my students, I began to realize that most of the literature had very little about Latinx and fat representation (Flores 2013). As a relational scholar of race, class, gender, and sexualities, I became intrigued by this gap.

T1  - Effects of network heterogeneity on social media on opinion polarization among South Koreans: Focusing on fear and political orientation: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2365035439
AB  - Recent studies have shown mixed findings regarding the relationship between network heterogeneity on social media and opinion polarization. Focusing on individual-level variables (i.e., individuals' political orientation, fear of a risky situation, and fear of an out-group), the objective of this study was to investigate opinion polarization over North Korean issues that have brought out threats to South Koreans and tangled with political orientations in the nation. Our analysis indicated that network heterogeneity on social media could decrease polarization. Moderation effects of political orientation and fear of political opponents in the relationship between network heterogeneity and polarization were also found. Findings of this study extend previous discussions regarding the relationship between network heterogeneity and polarization in the context of social media by concentrating on North Korea's threatening situation.

T1  - Is negative the new positive? Secondary transfer effect of exposure to LGBT portrayals in TV entertainment programs
AN  - 2354725994
AB  - This study investigates the primary effect of positive, neutral, and negative exposure to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) TV portrayals in entertainment programs on attitudes toward the LGBT community and the Secondary Transfer Effect (STE) of such exposure on attitudes toward people with Asperger's Disorder (the secondary out‐group), controlling for face‐to‐face and online contacts with both out‐groups. Research was conducted using a mixed methods approach. Quantitative Study 1 used an online survey of 716 Israeli Jews, to investigate primary and secondary effects of TV exposure to LGBT portrayals. The positive primary effect of TV exposure was shown—regardless of LGBT portrayals perceived as positive, neutral, or negative. STE of TV exposure to neutral and negative LGBT portrayals is likely to diminish social distance to people with Asperger's Disorder, while no STE was found with positive LGBT portrayals. Full mediation effect of attitudes toward the LGBT community was found. Qualitative Study 2, based on 52 in‐depth interviews, was conducted in order to reveal the hidden mechanisms of these effects, examining the parasocial experience and its interpretations by the viewers. According to qualitative findings, the positive primary and secondary effects of negative exposure may be explained by varied interpretations of gay portrayals on TV by different people depending on social background and life experience, opposite reaction on stereotypical gay portrayals on TV, and asymmetrical negative‐positive heuristic. Given the important role of TV in fostering more positive intergroup relations, this research revealed sources of prejudice reduction and increase in tolerance toward “others” for society at large.

T1  - Relationships Between Race/Ethnicity and Health Care Utilization Among Older Post-Acute Home Health Care Patients
AN  - 2332318443
AB  - Few studies have explored racial/ethnic differences in health care outcomes among patients receiving home health care (HHC), despite known differences in other care settings. We conducted a retrospective cohort study examining racial/ethnic disparities in rehospitalization and emergency room (ER) use among post-acute patients served by a large northeastern HHC agency between 2013 and 2014 (N = 22,722). We used multivariable binomial logistic regression to describe the relationship between race/ethnicity and health care utilization outcomes, adjusting for individual-level factors that are conceptually related to health service use. Overall rates of rehospitalization and ER visits were 10% and 13%, respectively. African American and Hispanic patients experienced higher odds of ER visits or rehospitalization during their HHC episode. Racial/ethnic differences in utilization were mediated by enabling factors, such as caregiver availability, and illness-level factors, such as illness severity, functional status, and symptoms. Intervention targets may include early risk assessment, proactive management of clinical conditions, rehabilitative therapy, and caregiver training.

T1  - Reflective Photobooth – a way to visualise, and challenge perceptions and representations of distanced social groups
AN  - 2359452951
AB  - Taken-for-granted knowledge about people from other social groups is a key challenge for overcoming stereotypes. This article describes a novel arts-based research method to visualise participants’ frames of distanced social groups and aims to trigger reflections among them. The Reflective Photobooth invites participants to dress up as members of distanced social groups, stage a scene, produce pictures, answer prompting questions, and discuss their visualisations. We argue that the artistic re-enactment that underlies the visualisation process can attract diverse groups of participants to engage with research topics, create places for the articulation of critical statements against existing societal clichés and stereotypical media representations, and trigger reflections among participants about taken-for-granted knowledge. The method was tested within the Frame-a-Farmer project, in which the social distance between consumers and food producers in modern agrifood systems was addressed. Results indicate that despite the method bearing some risks and facing some challenges, three promising areas of future application could be identified: (i) raising awareness among large groups of people, (ii) collecting stories or topical vignettes, and (iii) deconstructing taken-for-granted knowledge and societal clichés.

T1  - 'A most picturesque mass of rags': Romani costume and undress in nineteenth-century travel descriptions of Hungary
AN  - 2316452539
AB  - Davis examines descriptions of Romani costume in travel narratives written by predominantly British writers visiting Hungary, believed to be the site of especially 'pure' Romani culture, during the long nineteenth century. Travel descriptions provided key sources of information on the peoples of East Europe, for the British public, authors of popular fiction and Gipsiologists alike. However, most travellers spent little time with Roma. Consequently, they supplemented descriptions of surface details, such as Romani costume, with information from local informants and Gipsiologists' texts. Following these sources, travellers ethnologized Romani costume, demonstrating Orientalism and tropes of poverty, indolence, licentiousness, neglect, vanity and essentialism. In the process, travel writers reinforced and disseminated the 'pure Romany' stereotype to wider audiences.

T1  - Darker skin color is associated with a lower likelihood of smoking cessation among males but not females
AN  - 2317026545
AB  - Darker skin color is associated with discrimination and unfair treatment and may contribute to persisting health disparities. This study examined whether darker skin color was associated with smoking cessation and whether this association was moderated by sex and race. This study also explored whether biological and psychosocial factors, including nicotine and cotinine concentrations, discrimination, distrust, and neuroticism, mediated this association. The data for this study came from a prospective smoking cessation intervention that included 224 Black and 225 White adults from Kansas City, Missouri. Skin color was assessed using a DermaSpectrometer to measure melanin contained within the skin. Point prevalence smoking abstinence was biochemically-verified and assessed at weeks 4 and 26. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate hypothesized relations between skin color and smoking cessation. Interactions between race and sex with skin color were also evaluated. While skin color was not associated with smoking cessation in the overall sample or among Blacks only, results indicated that sex moderated the effect of skin color on smoking cessation after adjusting for race and other covariates. Among males, darker skin color was associated with lower odds of achieving smoking abstinence at weeks 4 (OR = 0.60 [95% CI = 0.36, 0.99]) and 26 (OR = 0.52 [95% CI = 0.29, 0.91]). Skin color did not predict smoking cessation among females. Skin color was positively correlated with discrimination (r = 0.15, p = 0.02), cynicism/distrust (r = 0.14, p = 0.03) and neuroticism (r = 0.24, p < 0.01) among males only. However, these factors did not mediate the association between skin color and smoking cessation. Skin color may contribute to cessation-related health disparities among Black males, but more research is needed to understand the psychosocial and biological mechanisms through which skin color influences tobacco cessation.

T1  - Evidence for indirect loss of significance effects on violent extremism: The potential mediating role of anomia
AN  - 2300086729
AB  - Psychological research suggests that violent extremism (e.g., terrorism) stems partly from existential motives, such as individuals’ need to achieve significance in life after experiencing failure, ostracism, or humiliation (Significance Quest Theory; SQT). Parallel investigations from sociology and criminology established similar findings by linking anomia—a syndrome including feelings of meaninglessness, powerlessness, isolation, self‐estrangement, and normlessness—with violent behavior. In line with SQT, this contribution tested if anomia could mediate Loss of Significance effects on violent extremism. Accordingly, three studies conducted in France highlight indirect effects of exposure to discrimination on legitimation of political violence (Study 1, cross‐sectional, minority population sample, N = 110), violent behavioral intentions (Study 2, experimental, undergraduate sample, N = 249), and support for ISIS fighters (Study 3, experimental, undergraduate sample, N = 221) through anomia. A subsequent study shows this indirect effect to be robust when controlled for Social Dominance Orientation and Political Extremism (Study 4, cross‐sectional, undergraduate sample, N = 279). A final investigation re‐analyzing data collected in Turkey highlights a reverse effect when the independent variable tapped into social inclusion (rather than exclusion; Study 5, cross‐sectional, undergraduate sample, N = 321). This indirect effect was also robust to Political Extremism and Intolerance as control variables. These results support the usefulness of considering anomia as a proximal predictor of violent extremism in a SQT perspective.

T1  - Participation as Inclusion and Exclusion: Policing the Boundaries of “Citizenship” in Roma Health Mediation
AN  - 2277916988
AB  - Participatory health interventions have long been advocated as an approach to help marginalised community members exercise their rights as citizens, including access to health care. More than two decades ago, the Roma health mediation programme was established in Romania as a participatory community health intervention. Mediators are employed specifically to act as intermediaries between ‘Roma patients’ and local authorities or health professionals, with the overall aim to increase trust and improve access to health care. Based on data gathered during a year of ethnographic fieldwork with Roma health mediators in Romania, including participant observation and interviews, this article analyses the social processes by which participatory approaches produce both social inclusion and exclusion. It illustrates how mediators exceeded their remit of health and attempted to discipline communities into forms of neoliberal citizenship. Mediators reframed access to health care not as a right that community members already have, but as a benefit that must be individually ‘earned’ through the fulfilment of neoliberal citizenship. The article argues that far from being an ‘empowering tool’, community participation can extend the power of governing institutions and thereby may in fact contribute to the maintenance of a political status quo that perpetuates the precarisation of marginalised communities.

T1  - Mindsets of health and healthy eating intentions
AN  - 2238611752
AB  - Across two studies, we examined the relation between mindsets of health, expectancy‐value, and eating intentions. We also explored if relations are stronger for African Americans compared to White Americans. In Study 1, we conducted a correlational study (N = 158) to examine initial relations among constructs. In Study 2, we employed an experimental design (N = 205), and randomly assigned participants to either a growth mindset or a fixed mindset of health condition. In both studies, we measured participants’ mindsets of health, expectancy‐value beliefs, healthy eating intentions, past eating habits, and demographics. In Study 1, stronger growth mindsets of health predicted healthier eating intentions. Expectancy‐value beliefs, namely, the extent to which individuals value healthy eating habits and expect to be able to manage their eating, mediated this relation. In Study 2, we successfully manipulated mindsets of health and individuals in the growth mindset condition reported healthier eating intentions, compared to those in the fixed mindset condition. Expectancy‐value beliefs again mediated this link. Race only moderated the relation in Study 1, such that effects of growth mindsets on outcomes (i.e., eating intentions and expectancy‐value beliefs) are stronger for African Americans compared to White Americans. Study 1 provided initial evidence of a relationship between stronger growth mindsets of health and healthier beliefs and intentions. Study 2 offered experimental evidence. We discuss theoretical and practical implications.

Considering WeChat activism as a counterpublic enclave, we seek to bring critical context to the collision of new digital media strategies and old neoconservative "colorblind" race rhetoric that brings power to the increasingly visible Chinese American conservative movement.

T1  - "A Kangaroo and Bradman"
AN  - 2197710987
AB  - Academic research on White Australia Policy and the Colombo Plan has spanned across the history of Asian migration, policy-making initiatives and Australia-India relations. But the role of popular transnational media images and stories that informs the sociocultural understanding of these relations has been under evaluated. In this article, using newspaper reports and notes of the tours, I highlight the building of popular perceptions under the Colombo Plan (1950-1957). By focusing on Indian journalists and editors, E. P. W. da Costa, J. N. Sahni, Frank Moraes, and Durga Das, this article contributes to the historiography of Australian-Indian relations. As these culture exchanges created a dialogue between the two countries that still influences the public opinion. The article concludes that journalists from both India and Australia sought to play a key role in image-making process and wanted a fresh start in relationship--politically, economically, sociologically and technologically.

T1  - Johannesburg in Transition: Representing Street Encounters as Racial Registers in Clint Eastwood's Invictus
AN  - 2352359361
AB  - Clint Eastwood's Invictus (2009) uses subtle interplay between various cinematic elements, including a social realist approach to the political narrative of a 1990s Johannesburg and dynamic framing of the street to reflect the changing political psyche of the city as it transitioned from apartheid to racial coexistence and finally racial cohesion. Yet, when read within the context of the political transition that the film pursues and the incipient symbols of unity including the erstwhile segregated streets, these cinematic devices index problematic racial encounters. This article puts forth the argument that the film's urgency to connect the races paradoxically posits the character of Nelson Mandela as a vortex of an unbridgeable race gap, and the street as the ultimate racial register of this stalled linkage. Representations of a cohesive Johannesburg through Mandela's perspective, the article argues, is countered by the film's formal devices.

T1  - How to improve the well-being of homeless girls: an exploratory study
AN  - 2189047542
AB  - Worldwide, homeless girls are a highly vulnerable group. They suffer sexual exploitation and forced labor, discrimination, and social exclusion at a higher rate than the rest of the general population. They often present anxiety and depression, unassertiveness and emotion dysregulation, among other psychosocial characteristics. All of these factors negatively impact subjective well-being, further worsening their mental health. Subjective well-being has both immediate (mental health, health behaviors) and long-term, cumulative effects on health (physical health, mortality), representing opportunities for investment in population health. Despite the relevance of subjective well-being and its associated factors, there is scarce research on the plight of homeless girls in Mexico and Latin America, which leads to ineffective interventions, policy actions and to a diminished quality of life. This study was carried out to develop and test a path model of well-being in 240 Mexican homeless girls ages 6-23 years old. Symptoms of anxiety and depression, assertiveness and emotion regulation strategies were used as factors influencing subjective well-being. Results showed that symptoms of depression and functional emotion regulation strategies have a significant direct influence on subjective well-being. Symptoms of anxiety and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies have an indirect influence on subjective well-being with symptoms of depression as the mediating variable. Assertiveness did not significantly influence well-being directly and indirectly. Functional and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies have a positive significant correlation. Fit indexes obtained indicate an excellent adjustment to data. R square indicates that 38% of the variance in subjective well-being can be explained by this model. Hence, the current study provides unique findings in terms of a model of well-being through which it is possible to design and implement interventions that increase such well-being in order to promote healthier social and emotional developmental trajectories in homeless girls, especially in the context of Latin American cities.

T1  - Still the tragic mulatto? Manufacturing multiracialization in magazine media, 1961-2011
AN  - 2171896386
AB  - On the heels of the 2000 US Census allowance of multiracial categorization and with rising mainstream discussion of multiracial heritage, questions over the meanings of multiracialism are quite prevalent. Scholars have highlighted how mainstream-oriented and black-oriented media structure (multi)racial conflicts, concepts, and categories. However, sociological analysis has neither examined qualitative differences and nuance among multiracial-oriented media sources nor specified the precise qualitative themes, frames, and discourse of that representation across time and media format. A content analysis of mainstream-, black-, and multiracial-oriented magazine articles demonstrates how varied media sources differently drew upon, resisted, and reproduced distinct understandings of multiracialism to reproduce the dominance of the "Tragic Mulatto" trope. The implications for this study illuminate the import of multiracial self-esteem, the intersection of conservative political movements and black interest groups in the fight for and against a multiracial movement, and the paradoxical role of anti-black stereotypes in multiracial representations.

T1  - Time Travelling in Dixie: Race, Music, and the Weight of the Past in the British “Televisual” South
AN  - 2196296123
AB  - This article examines a series of British travel documentaries on the American South made since 2008 which are representative of the way in which southern distinctiveness is maintained through television within a transatlantic context. The travelogues focus on historic racial struggles, southern food, and music, and frame the South as a distinctly historical space, where either historical moments obscure the contemporary South, or cultural continuity and resistance to change and modernity are celebrated. The article also discusses the similarities between the travelogues and the southern tourist industry, and how transatlantic “televisual tourism” works against the wider scholarly challenge to southern exceptionalism.

T1  - Diversity in Western Countries: Journalism Culture, Migration Integration Policy and Public Opinion
AN  - 2300626872
AB  - Earlier research has shown that public opinion and policy lines on the topic of immigrant integration are interrelated. This article investigates a sample of 24 countries for which data are available in the Migrant Integration Policy Index (MIPEX), the World Values Survey (WVS), as well as in the Worlds of Journalism Study (WJS). To our knowledge, this is the first time that these data are connected to one another to study journalists’ views on their role to promote tolerance and cultural diversity in societies with diverging immigration policies. The WJS presents an analysis of the role conceptions of professional journalists throughout the world, including a variable measuring the extent to which journalists conceive promoting tolerance and cultural diversity as one of their tasks. Our findings show that journalists (as measured in the WJS) mostly tend to promote tolerance and cultural diversity in countries with more restrictive immigration policies (measured by MIPEX) and less emancipative values (measured by the WVS) Promoting tolerance and cultural diversity is associated with a so-called interventionist approach in journalism culture. Furthermore, we used cluster analyses to attribute the countries under study to meaningful, separate groups. More precisely, we discriminate four clusters of the press among the 24 countries under investigation.

T1  - Does Experienced Discrimination Explain Patterns of Menthol Use Among Young Adults? Evidence from the 2014 San Francisco Bay Area Young Adult Health Survey
AN  - 2213935640
AB  - Background: Young adults are at high risk for using flavored tobacco, including menthol and underrepresented populations, such as Latino and African American young adults, are at particular risk. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to identify sociodemographic correlates of menthol use among young adult smokers and examine the potential role of experienced discrimination in explaining any associations. Methods: We conducted a probabilistic multimode household survey of young adults (aged 18-26) residing in Alameda and San Francisco Counties in California in 2014 (n = 1,350). We used logistic regression to evaluate associations between menthol cigarette use and experienced discrimination among young adult smokers as well as with respect to sociodemographic, attitudinal, and behavioral predictors. Interactions between experienced discrimination and race/ethnicity, sex and LGB identity were also modeled. Results: Latino and non-Hispanic Black young adult smokers were more likely to report current menthol use than non-Hispanic Whites, while those with college education were less likely to do so. Experienced discrimination mediated the relationship between race and menthol use for Asian/Pacific Islander and Multiracial young adult smokers with odds of use increasing by 32 and 42% respectively for each additional unit on the experienced discrimination scale. Conclusions/Importance: Latino and African American young adult smokers have disproportionately high menthol use rates; however, discrimination only predicted higher use for Asian/Pacific Islander and Multiracial young adult smokers. Limits on the sale of menthol cigarettes may benefit all nonwhite race/ethnic groups as well as those with less education.

T1  - Police use of force and its video coverage: An experimental study of the impact of media source and content on public perceptions
AN  - 2179661695
AB  - Purpose To explore the influence of media source, suspect's alleged criminal activity, and the rater's socio-demographic attributes on public ratings of video incidents of police use of force (PUF). Methods A national online sample of 581 adults viewed and evaluated four different PUF videos in a 3 × 3 experimental design.Study participants were randomly assigned to experimental conditions involving differences in (1) media sources and (2) suspect's alleged criminal activity.The dependent variables included ratings of the credibility of the video's media source (i.e., trust in the source and accuracy of its video account) and the officer's conduct (i.e., excessive force, justifiable force).The independent and moderating variables included the experimental conditions, personal salience of PUF incidents, the rater's use of different media sources, and other socio-demographic attributes. Results Three major results were found in this study: (1) video accounts of PUF are rated as more trustworthy when the video is attributed to “national TV news” source than “social media” outlets, (2) ratings of excessive force are more likely in PUF incidents when they involve a more dangerous offender (i.e., an alleged murder vs. shoplifter), and (3) the impact of the individual's socio-demographic characteristics on these public perceptions are strongly moderated by the personal salience of PUF incidents to the rater and their pattern of daily usage of conventional and social media. Conclusions The visual content in short, video clips of PUF incidents strongly influences public attitudes about the officer's conduct as excessive and unjustifiable.However, by the timely release of the video images and framing them within their wider context, police departments may better demonstrate transparency and help overcome various cognitive biases that may underlie adverse public reactions to PUF incidents.

T1  - Making Meaning of Reality Television Celebrities: The Reception of South African Idol by Young Adults in Joza, Grahamstown
AN  - 2162428328
AB  - Reality television or "factual entertainment" is a hybrid of old television formats and factual programming in order to create a "new" entertaining show designed to draw the attention of audiences and increase viewership ratings. South African Idol is one popular local example. Adapted from the British programme Pop Idols, the show promises upward mobility for the young star who wins the competition. This show has become a subject of conversation amongst young people in South Africa who aspire to the "success" and "celebrity" status that is produced by participating on the show. This paper uses of a Cultural Studies framework in order to examine the relationship between texts and audiences as an aspect of the "circuit of culture," with its interrelated moments of production, texts, consumption and lived experience. Our research focuses on the text and audience "moments" of this circuit. Audience studies research suggests that we should situate television viewing and the meanings made of TV programs in the natural setting of the home, and that this setting should be taken seriously as a unit of analysis. This study therefore, seeks to understand the ways in which audiences make meaning of this television programme within the domestic context.

T1  - Mass incarceration, race inequality, and health: Expanding concepts and assessing impacts on well-being
AN  - 2135604493
AB  - We explore race differences in how individuals experience mass incarceration, as well as in mass incarceration's impacts on measures of well-being that are recognized as major social determinants of health. We draw on baseline data from a sample of 302 men and women recently released from prison/jail or placed directly onto probation in New Haven, Connecticut (CT) for drug related offenses and followed at 6-month intervals for two years (2011–2014). We describe race differences in experiences of mass incarceration and in its impacts on well-being; and we conduct mediation analyses to analyze relationships among race, mass incarceration, and well-being. Blacks reported fewer adult convictions than whites, but an average of 2.5 more adult incarcerations. Blacks were more likely to have been incarcerated as a juvenile, spent time in a juvenile facility and in an adult facility as a juvenile, been on parole, and experienced multiple forms of surveillance. Whites were more likely to report being caught by the police doing something illegal but let go. Blacks were more likely to report any impact of incarceration on education, and dropping out of school, leaving a job, leaving their longest job, and becoming estranged from a family member due to incarceration. Whites were more likely to avoid getting needed health or social services for fear of arrest. Overall, Blacks reported a larger number of impacts of criminal justice involvement on well-being than whites. Number of adult incarcerations and of surveillance types, and being incarcerated as a juvenile, each mediated the relationship among race, mass incarceration, and well-being. Though more research is necessary, experiences of mass incarceration appear to vary by race and these differences, in turn, have implications for interventions aimed at addressing the impacts of mass incarceration on health and well-being.

T1  - Peer Toy Play as a Gateway to Children’s Gender Flexibility: The Effect of (Counter)Stereotypic Portrayals of Peers in Children’s Magazines
AN  - 1993311560
AB  - Extensive evidence has documented the gender stereotypic content of children’s media, and media is recognized as an important socializing agent for young children. Yet, the precise impact of children’s media on the endorsement of gender-typed attitudes and behaviors has received less scholarly attention. We investigated the impact of stereotypic and counter-stereotypic peers pictured in children’s magazines on children’s gender flexibility around toy play and preferences, playmate choice, and social exclusion behavior (n = 82, age 4–7 years-old). British children were randomly assigned to view a picture of a peer-age boy and girl in a magazine playing with either a gender stereotypic or counter-stereotypic toy. In the stereotypic condition, the pictured girl was shown with a toy pony and the pictured boy was shown with a toy car; these toys were reversed in the counter-stereotypic condition. Results revealed significantly greater gender flexibility around toy play and playmate choices among children in the counter-stereotypic condition compared to the stereotypic condition, and boys in the stereotypic condition were more accepting of gender-based exclusion than were girls. However, there was no difference in children’s own toy preferences between the stereotypic and counter-stereotypic condition, with children preferring more gender-typed toys overall. Implications of the findings for media, education, and parenting practices are discussed, and the potential for counter-stereotypic media portrayals of toy play to shape the gender socialization of young children is explored.

T1  - Peer Buddies in the Classroom: The Effects on Spontaneous Conversations in Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder
AN  - 2017545977
AB  - BackgroundTo date, research on spontaneous social interactions in mixed and non-mixed groups has not included exchanges with peer buddies.ObjectIn Study 1, socio-cognitive factors associated with the intention to volunteer to become a peer buddy for students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) were investigated. In Study 2, spontaneous social interactions in adolescents with ASD and a low level of support with selected peer buddies and with other students were compared.MethodIn Study 1, social-cognitive abilities were investigated through the use of self-report questionnaires. Among typically developing students, their willingness to spontaneously volunteer to help a classmate with ASD was evaluated. Moreover, students were required to indicate among their classmates who were competent to volunteer and who were not. In Study 2, social interaction behaviors in mixed and non-mixed groups were observed and opportunely codified.ResultsIn Study 1, students expressing the intention to volunteer obtained higher scores on empathy scale and displayed more positive attitudes towards ASD than other classmates. Volunteers were, in turn, selected as peer buddies by their classmates. In Study 2, when students interacted with selected peer buddies engaged in the highest number of social positive interaction behaviors than they did in other kinds of groups. The worst social interactions were observed in non-mixed groups.ConclusionsSocial behavior displayed by students with ASD appeared strongly influenced by social partners. Students with ASD seemed to more positively benefit from interactions with selected peer buddies compared to other mixed and non-mixed groups.

T1  - Precursors and Outcomes of Students' Attitude towards Social Media Advertising; the Case of the University of Semnan
AN  - 2175284301
AB  - Introduction: By the increasing expansion of the Internet on various issues of life, the way of exchanging transactions through the Internet is taken attention Very much by organizations and their customers. On the other hand, in today's business world, most marketers are trying to gain a better understanding of the attitudes and emotions of their customers. Attitudinal structures are useful tools for understanding the behavior of buyers and consumers in the market. The effect of advertising on customers is largely due to the attitude of consumers towards advertising, because it is believed that a strong attitude toward advertising affects consumer behavior. The paucity of research in the field of social media advertising that integrates attitudes and advertising and the implications and attitudes of consumers towards advertising is a challenge for individuals to understand the trends and criteria associated with these structures. Therefore, the present study seeks to identify and investigate the effective factors on the attitude toward social media advertising and its impact on informational and behavioral responses of consumers. Theoretical Framework Attitude is considered to be the expression of goodwill or the rejection of an object, idea or person. Also, attitude is described as a person's position based on his or her own assessment of the tendency or orientation towards a person, personality or object and depends on the experiences and motivation of the individual. In addition, the attitude is based on the motivation of the particular stimulus in the form of an idea, person or product is different, so that the formation of a highly dependent on situation of wanted phenomenon. Therefore, the individual learns from his or her attitude and influences from advertising, because it stimulates individuals to move their thinking towards an optimal attitude (Raza et al., 2018). The general attitude towards advertising is defined as the emotional response of the audience members to advertising. In marketing management, the attitude towards advertising is very important, because the attitude of consumers is a major factor in influencing consumers' buying intent (Can & Kaya, 2016). If customers have a positive attitude towards social media advertising, this will lead to customer shopping behavior (Mir, 2015). The degree to which an individual believes that with using the system of mental effort will be free is called the perceived ease of use (Hansen et al., 2017). However, habitude is used as a result of cognitive processes or harassing acts that apparently cannot explain irrational and uncontrollable aspects of media addiction (LaRose et al., 2009). Psychological Dependence expresses the severity of the links between a person and the social media (Park et al., 2010). In this research, we tried to identify and examine the factors influencing the attitude toward social media advertising. The current research model is a new model based on the reformations made to the previous models and tested for the first time. In the present research, informational and behavioral responses are considered as two consequences and the effect of attitudes toward social media advertising is considered. Methodology Considering the fact that here in this research we are attempting to test the factors affecting the University of Semnan’s students’ attitude towards social media advertising, informational and behavioral responses of users, and develops applied knowledge about the attitude toward advertising and the impact between variables, in terms of purpose, is an applied research. Also, this research is conducted in real-world situations and regarding this fact is a field research, and because of the causal relationship between perceived ease of use, habitude and psychological dependence, based on the data collection, the research is a correlation type. The statistical population of this study is 325 MSc & Ph.D. Student at Semnan University. To determine the sample size, the Cochran formula was used for a limited population. Findings and Results Some of the primary results indicate that the perceived ease of use has a positive and significant effect on the habitude and attitude towards social media advertising. Also, the habitude has a positive and significant effect on psychological dependence. However, no significant relationship was found between habitude and attitude. Finally, there was a positive and significant relationship between attitude toward social media advertising and informational and behavioral responses. Conclusions and Suggestions The attitudes of consumers and their behavior are in strong relationships. This means that the impact of advertising on consumer attitudes has a number signals for consumer behavior how to act. As a result, people who have a more positive attitude toward social media advertising are more likely to click on ads. This means that users have a positive attitude towards social media advertising and are considered it to be a good phenomenon. Several studies have shown that consumers' attitudes toward advertising are the intermediary between the beliefs of consumers about advertising and their behavioral responses. In addition, there is a strong relationship between attitude and behavioral responses to Internet advertising. Therefore, to the extent that the attitude towards Internet advertising is more positive, the probability of responding to a positive behavior toward advertising will increase. Therefore, research findings are recommended to social media users who are more focused on attracting attention to advertising texts and to receive relevant information from social media ads. According to research findings, social media users are advised to focus more attention on advertising text messages and to receive relevant information from social media ads. Also, social media users are advised not to miss the lack of attention in the media that are less prioritized. Therefore, it is suggested that when social media users find a good attitude toward social media ads, they are more likely to engage in advertising messages and obtain information about advertised products or brands.

T1  - From Family Violence Exposure to Violent Offending: Examining Effects of Race and Mental Health in a Moderated Mediation Model Among Confined Male Juveniles
AN  - 2058320890
AB  - Depression, substance use, and impulsivity have been linked to family violence exposure and to the development of violent offending during adolescence. Additionally, the indirect effects associated with these factors may not generalize across different racial/ethnic adolescent populations. The present study tested whether race/ethnicity moderated the mediated relationship between family violence exposure and violent offending, with depression, substance use, and impulsivity as mediators. A sample of 1,359 male adolescents was obtained from a juvenile correctional program. Between-racial/ethnic group comparisons were generally consistent with previous findings. The overall moderated mediation model was significant in predicting violence for both racial/ethnic groups. Different factors influenced violent offending among African Americans and European Americans in the tested model. Furthermore, race/ethnicity moderated the relationship between family violence exposure and impulsivity and substance use. Implications and future directions resolving issues are discussed concerning whether race/ethnicity should be included as a moderator in models of violence.

T1  - “Getting Along” in Parkchester: A New Era in Jewish–Irish Relations in New York City 1940–1970
AN  - 2125021127
AB  - The history of conflict between New York City’s Irish Americans and east European Jews dates back to the close of the 19th century. They disputed over jobs, union memberships, housing, and frequently over politics. These conflicts crescendoed exponentially in the decade or more of the Great Depression in Gaelic neighborhoods, now more than ever, the word on the street was that the Jews were taking over. The rhetoric and organizations of Michigan-based radio preacher Father Charles Coughlin gave voice and activism to local frustrations. However, in 1940, within a new neighborhood built in the Bronx that attracted a majority of Irish and a large proportion of Jews, there was no organized anti-Semitism, no outbursts of violence, or even significant complaints that more callow Jews were being roughed up in the streets or play areas. If animosities existed, negative feelings were kept within families and were not expressed in daily youthful encounters. Why life in Parkchester was so different is the conceit of this study. Its community history from 1940–1970s constituted a turning point in their previously-contested ethnic group relationship while what went on as Jews and the Irish ‘got along’ marks off the limits of conviviality of that time.

T1  - Representations of Interpersonal Interaction and Race/Ethnicity: An Examination of Prime-Time Network Television Programs
AN  - 2034231261
AB  - Racial and ethnic relations in America are a form of social interaction about which changing perceptions could have important consequences. Current research examining the nature of discrete social interaction situations in entertainment content on television is lacking. This study was conducted with the objective of obtaining an updated account of the state of interpersonal interaction portrayals between characters of different racial/ethnic backgrounds in popular prime time programs on broadcast television. Specifically, we analyzed prime-time television program content on 4 major U.S. broadcast networks. Findings are interpreted via a media priming framework.

T1  - Policing Us Sick: The Health of Latinos in an Era of Heightened Deportations and Racialized Policing
AN  - 2021486474
AB  - In 2016, Donald Trump campaigned for more restrictive immigration enforcement, including stronger border security, mass deportations, and an end to birthright citizenship (Johnson 2016). Since Trump has taken office, immigrant communities have experienced heightened anxiety corresponding with increased policing. Although US immigration enforcement is intended to target individuals whose presence in the United States is unauthorized and who are classified as "high priority" (e.g., accused of more violent criminal offenses)(Rocha, Knoll, and Wrinkle 2015; Cruz Nichols, LeBrón, and Pedraza 2018b), the spillover consequences of detentions and deportations are much broader than those deemed "high priority" and affect various aspects of life for Latinos, including those who have birthright or naturalized US citizenship (Cruz Nichols, LeBrón, and Pedraza 2018a; 2018b; Pedraza, Cruz Nichols and LeBrón 2017). Indeed, Latin American immigrants represent 96% of all deportations from the United States since 2010 (Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse 2014). Notably, 61% of Latinos report knowing someone who is undocumented, and 36% know someone who has experienced immigration detention or deportation (Sanchez, Pedraza, and Vargas 2015). This article examines the consequences of deportation threats and racialized policing environments relative to the health of Latinos, specifically focusing on knowing someone who is undocumented or who has been deported. The proliferation of immigration enforcement operations in the United States is exemplified by the intergovernmental information-sharing Secure Communities (SComm) program (Cruz Nichols, LeBrón, and Pedraza 2018b).1SComm coordinates federal and local law-enforcement resources to identify, detain, and eventually deport immigrants without authorized US status. Although the stated focus is on those with a criminal charge, the majority of people processed through SComm have minor infractions (Kohli and Chavez 2013). Additionally, early participation in SComm coordination efforts has been correlated with sizable Latino populations, not crime (Cox and Miles 2013). Given the growth of immigrant policing through daily encounters with local police, we relied on pre- and post-2016 election surveys and SComm data to examine the health implications of deportations under SComm and the perceived racialized policing of Latinos--a crucial topic often neglected in existing political science discussions on the scope of policy effects.

T1  - Introduction: Slavery and the Contemporary Imagination
AN  - 2018570848
AB  - Months before Django premiered to movie audiences, Washington became the first black woman leading actor in a television drama series in nearly forty years when she starred as Olivia Pope on ABC's Scandal.[...]a black woman-led show like HBO's Insecure (starring Issa Rae, which owes its success to forerunners like Rhimes) has parodied these dynamics by conflating the romance of Scandal with another television show-the now canceled Underground, based on fugitive slaves-in Due North, a show within a show that sends up the nation's established romanticized cultural imagination of slavery, as well as that imagination's continuing, if questionable, appeal to black audiences.The Obama administration enabled the completion of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016, and facilitated the establishment of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Park, which opened in 2017.[...]thanks to Annette GordonReed's Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings (1997), DNA testing in 1998 linking one of Hemings' children to Jefferson, and various films and television shows dramatizing their relationship, Hemings is now included and even centered in our national narratives-even if we do not quite fully grasp the raced and gendered power dynamics informing her enslaved relationship, which began in her adolescence, with the third president of the United States.

T1  - Uncertainty and prejudice: The role of religiosity in shaping group attitudes
AN  - 2011518923
AB  - Past research indicates that being religious is frequently motivated by the need to avoid uncertainty and associated with prejudice against value‐violating groups. The present research clarifies these previous findings and shows for the first time a causal link between a sense of uncertainty and group attitudes through religiosity and the perception of the target group's mindset. Study 1 demonstrates that belief in God is associated with uncertainty avoidance and increases prejudice against value‐violating groups, but simultaneously increases positive attitudes towards value‐consistent groups. Study 2 demonstrates experimentally that a sense of uncertainty shapes intergroup attitudes when the relationship is mediated through the belief in God and the perception that a target group actually violated perceivers' values. The results corroborate and broaden previous findings on religiosity, ambiguity avoidance, and prejudice and, for the first time, show a causal link between a sense of uncertainty and attitudes towards value‐violating and value‐consistent groups.

T1  - Structural racism in the workplace: Does perception matter for health inequalities?
AN  - 2070444192
AB  - Structural racism has been linked to racial health inequalities and may operate through an unequal labor market that results in inequalities in psychosocial workplace environments (PWE). Experiences of the PWE may be a critical but understudied source of racial health disparities as most adults spend a large portion of their lives in the workplace, and work-related stress affects health outcomes. Further, it is not clear if the objective characteristics of the workplace are important for health inequalities or if these inequalities are driven by the perception of the workplace. Using data from the 2008 to 2012 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a probability-based sample of US adults 50 years of age and older and the Department of Labor's Occupational Information Network (O*NET), we examine the role of both standardized, objective (O*NET) and survey-based, subjective (as in HRS) measures of PWEs on health and Black-White health inequalities. We find that Blacks experience more stressful PWEs and have poorer health as measured by self-rated health, episodic memory function, and mean arterial pressure. Mediation analyses suggest that these objective O*NET ratings, but not the subjective perceptions, partially explain the relationship between race and health. We discuss these results within the extant literature on workplace and health and health inequalities. Furthermore, we discuss the use of standardized objective measures of the PWE to capture racial inequalities in workplace environment.

T1  - Il pubblico del teatro contemporaneo: fra auto-osservazione e processi di fruizione
AN  - 2275919099
AB  - There has been a growing interest in the study of performing arts audiences over the last three decades. This interest is expressed both at an organizational level, by the increasing presence of audience development and audience engagement initiatives, and within the expanding multidisciplinary field of academic research on theatre audiences, which interweaves economics, cultural marketing, the sociology of culture and audience studies applied to theatrical reception. To some extent, such attention is guided by the need for organizations and institutions to compete in increasingly competitive culture markets. It is however also the expression of a rising awareness of the social impacts that art consumption has on the processes of citizenship, community welfare, urban regeneration, political participation and on the struggle against social exclusion. Starting from the introduction of a theoretical framework that unites studies on theatre audiences, audience development and reception processes, the article presents the results of national survey dedicated to the Italian audiences of contemporary and experimental theatre. The purpose of this study is to provide a preliminary profiling of the audience of a branch of performing arts with its own specificities in terms of aesthetic, productive and distributive features. To this aim we also stress the importance of the dialogue between audience research and theatre studies to evaluate the perimeter of the field of the 'contemporary'. Hence, the present research starts from the process of self-observation of spectators, having asked audience members to define themselves as 'frequenter of contemporary and experimental theatre', 'non-frequenter' or 'uncertain about the attribution'. In this way it has been possible to trace homologies and divergences between habitual and occasional audiences, in order to describe attitudes, motivations and attending behavior on the basis of the different degrees of affection and competence towards this cultural sector.The analysis of the data follows the different areas investigated in the questionnaire, presenting a socio-demographic profile of the audience, attending behavior, the attitudes towards the artistic proposals, the relation between the enjoyment of contemporary theatre and other cultural and media consumption routines. It is therefore possible to observe a type of audience with certain specific characteristics: they tend to be competent and willing to accept the challenges of artistic innovation (with certain complaints); they are dynamic and generally omnivorous regarding cultural consumption.

T1  - Beyond Refuge: Contested Orientalism and Persons of Self-Rescue
AN  - 2085006805
AB  - Drawing on empirical data from a recent study of the resettlement practices, challenges and concerns of privately sponsored refugees and sponsor groups in Ontario, Canada, we examine how Orientalist scripts of refuge frame "the Syrian refugee crisis" but are interactively challenged and reconfigured in the sponsor-sponsored relationship. Key to this contestation are the pre-conflict practical identities through which "refugees" assert their authority to act as "persons of self-rescue" in pursuit of a life beyond refuge. Relatedly, their authority to act is impeded or enhanced in their interaction with sponsors whose corporate group identity, formed in response to community expectations, policy obligations, media representations, and personal motivations, is a conduit of (mis)recognition. Focusing on resettlement practices of refugeeness, we argue that the Canadian private sponsorship scheme provides deep insight into refugee-host relations.Alternate abstract:À partir de données empiriques tirées d'une étude récente sur les pratiques, les défis et les preoccupations des réfugiés parrainés par le secteur privé et des groupes de parrainage en Ontario, nous examinons comment les scénarios de refuge orientalistes encadrent ?la crise des réfugiés syriens? mais sont interactifs et reconfigurés dans une relation sponsorisée. La clé de ce defi réside dans les identités pratiques d'avant-conflit par lesquelles les ?réfugiés? affirment leur autorité â agir comme des ?personnes d'auto-sauvetage? dans la poursuite d'une vie au-delâ du refuge. Parallelement, leur pouvoir d'agir est entravé ou renforcé dans leur interaction avec des parrains dont l'identité de groupe, formée en réponse aux attentes de la communauté, aux obligations politiques, aux représentations médiatiques et aux motivations personnelles, est un moyen de reconnaissance. En mettant l'accent sur les pratiques de réinstallation, nous soutenons que le Programme canadien de parrainage privé de réfugiés offre un aperçu approfondi des relations entre les réfugiés et les hôtes.

T1  - Cultural politics of emotions in households: migrant domestic workers in Macau
AN  - 1980493873
AB  - This article discusses the emotions and cultural politics within domestic work contexts involving employers and migrant domestic workers in Macau. Since Macau was transferred back to China from Portugal in 1999, the Macau SAR government has pursued a neoliberal economic policy that emphasizes economic growth. With a revitalized economy boosted by casino revenues, thousands of migrant workers have moved to Macau to take advantage of new employment opportunities. Based on first-hand interviews with migrant domestic workers and employers in Macau, this paper examines how emotions are motivated and articulated within the affective interactions between employers and Migrant Domestic Workers (MDWs). This includes how employers' emotions of fear and disgust towards MDWs contribute to the creation of an MDW population as a feared and inferior "other," and how such affective operations reinforces the existing hegemonic dominance of naming and legitimizing the exploitation of MDWs. Meanwhile, in the production of domesticity in the home, this paper explores how emotions such as emotional numbness and disgust experienced by the MDWs make affective negotiations and contestation possible, and generate disobedience and resistance to the disciplines and controls imposed upon them. This article also investigates how such emotions, acting as a kind of intervention, operate within the production of specific subjectivities and identities that MDWs want to claim for themselves.

T1  - Tracing tears and triple axels: Media representations of Japan's women figure skaters
AN  - 1974227175
AB  - Anticipating the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, this article uses the triple axel jump, one of the most challenging moves in women's figure skating, as a heuristic device to track representations of Japanese skaters Ito Midori and Asada Mao in the New York Times
 and Asahi Shimbun
. Ito and Asada are two of only six women to have landed triple axels at international figure skating competitions. Employing affect and feminist theories, I argue that constructions of the skaters' bodies are not just gendered and heteronormative, but also sexed, raced, and affective. Using discourse analysis, I trace how media representations of Ito and Asada redraw global color lines and national boundaries in sport and negotiate different femininities, underscoring excessive feelings and physical appearance. Contributing to feminist sport studies and transnational feminist cultural studies, this comparative analysis offers new perspectives on women's sports in Japan and athleticism's relation to race, femininities, and national identity.

T1  - Communication rights from the margins: politicising young refugees' smartphone pocket archives: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1943427330
AB  - Politicising the smartphone pocket archives and experiences of 16 young refugees living in the Netherlands, this explorative study re-conceptualises and empirically grounds communication rights. The focus is on the usage of social media among young refugees, who operate from the margins of society, human rights discourse and technology. I focus on digital performativity as a means to address unjust communicative power relations and human right violations. Methodologically, I draw on empirical data gathered through a mixed-methods, participatory action fieldwork research approach. The empirical section details how digital practices may invoke human right ideals including the human right to self-determination, the right to self-expression, the right to information, the right to family life and the right to cultural identity. The digital performativity of communication rights becomes meaningful when fundamentally situated within hierarchical and intersectional power relations of gender, race, nationality among others, and as inherently related to material conditions and other basic human rights including access to shelter, food, well-being and education.

T1  - DISPARATE LESSONS: RACIAL CLIMATES AND IDENTITY-FORMATION PROCESSES AMONG LATINO STUDENTS
AN  - 2027577052
AB  - This paper compares the identity-formation processes of Latino students in three different college contexts (a liberal arts college, a research university, and a regional public university). Drawing on ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and surveys of members of Latino student organizations, I chart the distinct ways in which Latino students interact with one another and arrive at particular ethnic identities on different campuses. By applying ethnoracialization theory to mesolevel settings, I examine how students respond to external ascription as they co-construct and negotiate their ethnic-racial understandings. I identify three different patterns by which students deploy panethnic boundaries, specifically, as they adopt and define identity labels: inclusive Latino identification signifying solidarity above all, qualified Latino identification mediated through specific organizational membership, and the rejection of panethnic identities. I consider how the organizational context of each campus provides a distinct racial climate that mediates student interactions and potentially shapes the disparate identity outcomes that result. The findings suggest that, beyond providing academic experiences, colleges also provide Latino students with disparate lessons regarding who they are and where they fit in the ethnoracial hierarchy.

T1  - Islamophobia: What Teachers Can Do To Reduce It in the Classroom
AN  - 2007680714
AB  - The year 2017 marked the sixteenth year anniversary of the destruction of the World Trade Center, the worst domestic attack in US history. The global environment has been very different since Sep 11, 2001. Prior to that date, terms such as terrorism, terroristic actions, and Islamophobia were not commonly heard. The world environment has changed greatly since then. Now people all over the world are continually on edge. When considering a dictionary definition of Islamophobia, the Oxford Dictionary states it as a "dislike of, or prejudice against, Islam or Muslims, especially as a political force." Islamophobia is not only focused on Islam or Muslims, but also on anyone "who may appear to be Muslim". Here, Hossain addressing the issue of Islamophobia from pre-school to college classrooms.

T1  - U.S. racial and ethnic relations in the twenty-first century
AN  - 1930435985
AB  - The study of U.S. racial and ethnic relations is often reduced to the study of racial or ethnic relations. This article reveals the limitations of a focus on ethnicity or race, in isolation, and instead urges a new framework that brings them together. We consider three cases that have been conceptualized by the ethnicity paradigm as assimilation projects and by the race paradigm as structural racism projects, respectively: (1) African-American entrepreneurs; (2) the Mexican middle class; and (3) black immigrant deportees. We reveal the shortcomings of the ethnicity paradigm to consider race as a structural force or to acknowledge that structural racism conditions incorporation in marked ways; and the limitations of the race paradigm to take seriously group members' agency in fostering social capital that can mediate racial inequality. Instead, we offer a unifying approach to reveals how ethnicity and race condition members' life chances within the U.S. social structure.

T1  - A Flâneur in the Erotic City: Prince and the Urban Imaginary
AN  - 1945566291
AB  - In September of 1986, megastar Prince journeyed across the Atlantic to France to begin filming his second motion picture Under the Cherry Moon. Having captured the US imagination in the commercially successful Purple Rain (1984), “The Kid” (Prince’s Purple Rain alias) was eager to begin shooting his idea for a wry comedy in black and white in “homage to the B films of the 1940’s” (Goodman, 1986 ). Prince’s artistic, transcontinental trek was already on display with his 1985 Around the World in a Day, an album that at once pushed him forward musically by looking backward to 1960s psychedelic, Beatles-esque pop. An avant-garde experimentalist, Prince was seemingly constructing a new musical paradigm that linked past and present in kaleidoscopic fashion. The title song might have Prince playing the melodious wanderer: “Open your heart, open your mind, A train is leaving all day, A wonderful trip through our time, And laughter is all U pay.” Parade: Music from The Motion Picture “Under the Cherry Moon” continued the sauntering theme as the diminutive Prince declares in the title track, “The little 1 will escort U, 2 places within your mind.” In this manner, the wanderings of Prince’s character Christopher Tracy took him “more often to the strange corners of Paris than to its historic centre, to the strongholds of multiculturalism rather than to the classic headquarters of the Gallic tradition” (White, 2001 ). The purpose of the article is to present Prince as a postmodern flâneur. Beyond notions of his dandyism, most directly observed in his use of signifiers that convey gender ambiguity/bending, Prince’s urban representations, traveling imagery, solitary character, social commentary, contradictory relationships with women, and transformative creativity mark a new take on the flâneur.

T1  - Meanings of (dis)connection: Exploring non-users in isolated rural communities with internet access infrastructure
AN  - 2069970116
AB  - While public policy worldwide has focused on providing digital connectivity infrastructure in remote areas, there remain people who are digitally excluded. Hence, it is important to explore why people, despite having access to a digital connection, do not go online. As the third part of a three-year project on digital inclusion in isolated communities in Chile, this study draws on findings from focus groups conducted with non-Internet users who live in three remotes but digitally connected villages, to unravel the elements associated with their decision to remain digitally excluded. The main findings indicate that strong ties within the community shelter their sense of isolation providing a feeling of closeness, whereas the internet is perceived as disruptive. In addition, negative attitudes about the Internet emerge from the discussions: the internet is associated with addiction and isolation. Finally, the absence of digital skills makes smartphones and computers unknown entities, a black box people feel unable to or overwhelmed at the thought of learning how to use. However, many are facing a hard choice due to their need to remain in contact with those outside the community as well as promote and develop their small business ventures. Therefore, there is a cultural construction of the internet as a required form of progress that nonetheless does more harm than good to a tight-knit community.

T1  - Accepted monitoring or endured quarantine? Ebola contacts' perceptions in Senegal
AN  - 1912585894
AB  - During the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic, transmission chains were controlled through contact tracing, i.e., identification and follow-up of people exposed to Ebola cases. WHO recommendations for daily check-ups of physical symptoms with social distancing for 21 days were unevenly applied and sometimes interpreted as quarantine. Criticisms arose regarding the use of coercion and questioned contact tracing on ethical grounds. This article aims to analyze contact cases' perceptions and acceptance of contact monitoring at the field level. In Senegal, an imported case of Ebola virus disease in September 2014 resulted in placing 74 contact cases in home containment with daily visits by volunteers. An ethnographic study based on in-depth interviews with all stakeholders performed in September -October 2014 showed four main perceptions of monitoring: a biosecurity preventive measure, suspension of professional activity, stigma attached to Ebola, and a social obligation. Contacts demonstrated diverse attitudes. Initially, most contacts agreed to comply because they feared being infected. They adhered to the national Ebola response measures and appreciated the empathy shown by volunteers. Later, acceptance was improved by the provision of moral, economic, and social support, and by the final lack of any new contamination. But it was limited by the socio-economic impact on fulfilling basic needs, the fear of being infected, how contacts' family members interpreted monitoring, conflation of contacts as Ebola cases, and challenging the rationale for containment Acceptance was also related to individual aspects, such as the professional status of women and health workers who had been exposed, and contextual aspects, such as the media's role in the social production of stigma. Ethnographic results show that, even when contacts adhere rather than comply to containment through coercion, contact monitoring raises several ethical issues. These insights should contribute to the ethics debate about individual rights versus crisis public health measures.

T1  - Reconstructing African American Mobility after Emancipation, 1865-67
AN  - 1950795669
AB  - Historians and social scientists have relied on contemporaneous textual accounts to document African American mobility in the immediate aftermath of emancipation after the Civil War, but they have interpreted them in widely varying ways. Some emphasize large-scale migration across the South, while others suggest that most movements were local and limited. This research tracks the early or "first wave" of African American migrants between 1865 and 1867 within and out of the South in an attempt to map the motion taking place after the war and to document the scale, direction, and intensity of African American mobility in the period between 1865 and 1867. The Freedmen's Bureau records indicate certain kinds of movements within the South, while our census methodology shows that there was more movement out of the South than accounted for in the Freedmen's Bureau labor records or previously accounted for in the historiography. Further, we observe two types of movement: short-term migration based on one-year contracts, perhaps returning to the point of origin, and another movement not always mediated through the Freedmen's Bureau that was more long term, but also subject to the freedperson's return to the point of origin. We seek to chart the process of emancipation over time and across space, detecting spatial patterns on an otherwise highly variable individual experience. No study has used the Freedmen's Bureau labor contracts to trace African American labor movements, and no study has deployed the 1880 individual census data to examine African American migration based on birthplace cohorts.

T1  - Reading cartoons’ interpretation of the verdict and sentence in the Pistorius murder trial: The case of Zulu and English newspapers
AN  - 1848467816
AB  - This article is an interpretation of cartoons’ interpretation of both the verdict and the sentence in the Oscar Pistorious trial for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. Selected for analysis, in terms of methodology and sampling, are those cartoons that appeared in isiZulu and English newspapers in South Africa, during September and October 2014. Specifically interpreted in these cartoons is their production of social meaning(s). This work is concerned mainly with cartoons’ content and their ideology, and less so with aesthetics and form. If cartoonists, by nature, read a particular subject and then reproduce social meaning from it through references to other familiar happenings in the public sphere, this work examines the allusions/metaphors used by cartoonists in this regard. Cartoons, in this work, are regarded as texts that represent cartoonists’ conscious decoding of both the verdict and the sentence, and subsequent representation of them for public reception. In reading the ‘reading’ of the verdict and the sentence, the article concludes that cartoons made little references to race, gun control, urban violence, violence against women, wealth and celebrity status, which had already engulfed public discourse about the Pistorius trial. Cartoons did find Judge Masipa ‘guilty’ of a lenient verdict and sentence.

T1  - Making sense of French urban disorders in 2005
AN  - 1819491465
AB  - The dynamics of contention that unrolled in the French riots of 2005 in France were hardly the first of their kind, but the intensity, contagion, locations and scale of disruption that followed the horrifying deaths of two youths chased by the police in Clichy-sous-Bois were unusual and became imbued with symbolic significance. In this article, based on numerous conversations with involved participants and secondary sources, I distinguish on the one hand the interaction of active protestors, bystanders and police forces, which I call the 'silent riots' because so few of those actors talked during these leaderless and spontaneous events, and, on the other, a vast amount of a posteriori comment and analysis, the 'paper riots'. The merit of the latter was to point out that the root causes of the disorders were relative deprivation, social exclusion, heavy-handed policing, discrimination and disrespect. An alternative comprehensive framework incorporates such dimensions and I add that routine relations were modified by the operation of multiple forces that, in the course of fluid and indeterminate situations, came together to produce a certain type of public disorder. These included the media, the issue of local space, cultural and religious dimensions, and unusual forms of political expression confronting a path of dependency at work in France. Did these 'riots' produce change? Except for massive urban renewal operations, the inability of French elites to increase the mobility of a generation of youths from deprived urban neighbourhoods, to alleviate the banlieues ' economic deterioration in terms of jobs and public services, to increase their political representation and to insert Islam's values into French core values was made possible by the stability of the regime. Nevertheless, disturbances of this type are needed to trigger a public debate, slowly leading to reforms. Other countries face similar dilemmas.

T1  - All Lives Matter, but so Does Race
AN  - 1826252181
AB  - This article demonstrates the ways in which youth of color played an active role in debates that erupted on Twitter following the tragic deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner in 2014. These debates on social media represent a larger struggle over discourse on race and racism across the nation. Drawing from critical theory and race theory, and engaging in the relatively new practice of using Twitter as a source of data for sociological analysis, this article examines Twitter as an emerging public sphere and studies the hashtags "#AllLivesMatter" and "#BlackLivesMatter" as contested signs that represent dominant ideologies. This article consists of a qualitative textual analysis of a selection of Twitter posts from December 3 to 7, 2014, following the nonindictments of officers in the murders of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. The debates on Twitter reveal various strategies that youth of color employed to shape the national discourse about race in the wake of these high-profile tragedies.

AN  - 1786270047
AB  - This special issue grew out of the 'Understanding the New Europe' workshop that the guest editors of this issue organized in November 2012 in Amsterdam. We want to thank all the participants and contributors for stimulating conversations and papers. We learned much about the 'New Europe' during this event and even more so in the editing of this issue.. When we decided to move ahead with this special issue, we felt assured that, with the line-up of authors that we had, the contributions would be excellent. We are not disappointed. We thank all of the authors, with special thanks for Gregory Noble for bringing another critical lens to both the international workshop and this special issue. We also would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments, and Anick Vollebergh for her insightful reading for a draft of this introduction. We owe a great debt to Patterns of Prejudice editor Barbara Rosenbaum for her unfailing support, patience, adroit feedback and insightful editing, for which we say a big thank-you. Anouk de Koning's work that led to this special issue was supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) under Grant W 07.68.115.00, and by the European Research Council (ERC) under Grant 640074 (MigrantParents).

T1  - Xenophobia across the class divide: South African attitudes towards foreigners 2003-2012
AN  - 1784417787
AB  - In May 2008 anti-immigrant riots in South Africa displaced more than a hundred thousand people. Despite the media attention that the riots attracted, there has been no study that presents trend data on anti-immigrant sentiment for the period after 2008. This paper uses data from the nine rounds of the South African Social Attitudes Survey over the period 2003-2012 to fill this gap and test the success of government commitments to reduce anti-immigrant prejudice. The results reveal that attempts to combat xenophobia have been ineffectual, with anti-immigrant sentiment prevalent and widespread in 2012. Afrophobia was observed, with a majority of citizens identifying foreign African nationals as the group they least wanted to come and live in South Africa. The government is advised to urgently address the alarming and widespread pervasiveness of anti-immigrant sentiment in South Africa.

T1  - Media, Racial Identity, and Mainstream American Values
AN  - 1784145824
AB  - A survey of 499 Black, Asian, and White American college students assessed their endorsement of "mainstream" American values, uncovering a 6-factor values structure, with some notable significant differences between the races. As expected, White respondents' own personal value orientations most closely matched their assessments of mainstream American values, and stronger racial identity (from a social identity perspective) corresponded to an even closer match. A variety of media consumption measures correlated with personal/mainstream American values congruence, with greater media exposure predicting greater endorsement of mainstream values, but most relationships were eclipsed when controlling for demographics, race, and racial identity. Predictors that maintained under controls included music TV and sports programming exposure, pointing to the potential importance of such particular media forms in the process of value-based cultural assimilation and reinforcement.

T1  - Stereotypes: Perceptions of the 'other' in Second Generation
AN  - 1765091474
AB  - The South Asian stereotype has been presented on British television through programmes such as Mind Your Language (LWT/ITV, 1977-79) and It Ain't Half Hot Mum (BBC Television, 1974-1981). This article traces the journey of the South Asian stereotype from the racist undertones presented in British television comedies of the 1970s to the British Asian comedy show Goodness Gracious Me! (BBC Television, 1998-2000) that used the stereotype to gain a sense of ownership and represent British and South Asian identity through a South Asian lens. In recognising the South Asian presence on British television, it has been identified that the traditional stereotype has shifted from the marginalised depiction of the 'other' to a representation of the British-Asian subject as an integral part of multicultural Britain. Using the television drama Second Generation, an illustration of how British-Asian female identity no longer relies on previous South Asian stereotypes has been made, demanding a new way of seeing and gaining cultural understanding.

T1  - The (racial) biases of communication: rethinking media and blackness
AN  - 1784151579
AB  - The media studies approach to race often examines blackness through depictions in music lyrics, movies, and videos. The vast majority of these studies posit that media may provide 'fair' or 'unfair' depictions of blackness. Less examined is the importance of media environments to the structuring of racial relations in the United States. This article extends the contemporary literature on black media studies by taking a 'medium theory' approach to analyzing blackness. I argue medium theory aids studies of blackness by showing the ways in which the technologies we use transform the environments we inhabit in ways that further racialization processes beyond depictions of music lyrics or reality TV. To examine the interrelations between media environments and blackness, I offer a critical rereading of the Underground Railroad. I argue the Underground Railroad's success was related to the necessity of brilliant planning and a complex understanding by slaves and conductors of the essential overlapping of space- and time-biased media cultures. In short, the different understandings of media ensured that the slaves and slave catchers inhabited radically different yet interconnected worlds or galaxies, increasing the effectiveness of the Underground Railroad for runaway slaves.

T1  - A Rebuttal to Jack Niemonen's "Whither the White Working Class?"
AN  - 1695196369
AB  - Prof. Niemonen claims that the concept of white privilege is "anti-sociological" and "mask[s] complex race-class interactions." He highlights the importance of including social class in discussions of white privilege but focuses exclusively on the white working class, neglecting how race and social class also intersect for people of color. Further, while different social identities mediate how whites experience race privilege, race remains a key factor in shaping life chances and opportunities. We agree that racial groups cannot be treated as homogenous, but we argue for the importance of teaching students about disparities between races before showing them heterogeneity within races; doing so in reverse minimizes the very real ways that race shapes people's lives. Nonetheless, taking into account Niemonen's points, we offer an addendum to our original exercise that stresses the importance of intersectionality; this can be offered as a second step once students have an understanding of white privilege.

T1  - Voices and Votes in the Fields of Settler Society: American Indian Media and Electoral Politics in 1930s Wisconsin
AN  - 1691117112
AB  - In 1939, Wisconsin readers of a weekly newspaper column by Mitchell Redcloud, a member of the Ho-Chunk Indian community settled within the rural township of Komensky, were greeted with a set of headlines from the imaginary "Komensky News" about an actual local event. The headlines reported that despite opposition from local whites, Ho-Chunk people had successfully elected a Ho-Chunk candidate to the township board. This article draws on studies of Indigenous media and recent efforts to develop field-theoretic accounts of social action to understand the interdependence of Redcloud's headlines and the Ho-Chunk vote as part of an incipient project of Indigenous political action. Using census records, I first describe the positions in the everyday field of race and class relations that Ho-Chunk people occupied in Komensky, based on their incomes, educations, and occupational statuses. I then draw on this description to understand Redcloud's position-taking strategies before the election. I next examine Redcloud's writing career in the newspaper to understand his strategy of self-positioning as a marked Indian voice within a print-based discursive field that denigrated other Ho-Chunk voices. I finish by examining new position-taking strategies manifest in the 1939 vote and in Redcloud's turn to headline register. I argue that both media and electoral mechanisms offered relatively autonomous fields that made these experiments with Indigenous action possible despite the absence of tribal political institutions necessary to transform the positions Ho-Chunk people occupied in their everyday lives. Together, the headlines and the election suggest the interdependence of activism carried out in media and in governmental structures in the production of transformative acts of political self-representation.

T1  - Media, race and crime: Racial perceptions and criminal culpability in a multiracial national context
AN  - 1667948676; 201510473
AB  - This study contributes to the limited literature on race and crime in a multicultural Asian context. Based on a survey in Singapore, where multiracialism is a fundamental political pillar and yet discourse about race is mostly shunned, the findings suggest a relationship between media consumption and racial perceptions. Respondents who consume more race-specific media have less negative racial perceptions of their own race, and more negative racial perceptions about other races. Respondents who consume more crime-related media content on TV, newspapers, and social networking sites tend to be more racially prejudiced against other races. Those who pay more attention to crime-related media content hold more negative racial perceptions of other races, and have harsher criminal culpability judgments of other races while holding a diminished culpability judgment of one's own race.

T1  - “The White Space”
AN  - 2406941943
AB  - Since the end of the Civil Rights Movement, large numbers of black people have made their way into settings previously occupied only by whites, though their reception has been mixed. Overwhelmingly white neighborhoods, schools, workplaces, restaurants, and other public spaces remain. Blacks perceive such settings as “the white space,” which they often consider to be informally “off limits” for people like them. Meanwhile, despite the growth of an enormous black middle class, many whites assume that the natural black space is that destitute and fearsome locality so commonly featured in the public media, including popular books, music and videos, and the TV news—the iconic ghetto. White people typically avoid black space, but black people are required to navigate the white space as a condition of their existence.

T1  - The managed prosumer: evolving knowledge strategies in the design of information infrastructures
AN  - 1551000528; 201429537
AB  - This paper contributes to the reworking of the traditional concepts and methods of Science and Technology Studies that is necessary in order to analyse the development and use of social media and other emerging information infrastructures (IIs). Through long-term studies of the development of two contrasting IIs, the paper examines the prosumer-management strategies by which vendors manage their relationships with their diverse users. Despite the sharp differences between our cases -- an online-game with social network features and traditional enterprise systems -- we find striking homologies in the ways vendors manage the tensions underpinning the design and development of mass-market products. Thus their knowledge infrastructures -- the set of tools and instruments through which vendors maintain an adequate understanding of their multiple users -- change in the face of competing exigencies. Market expansion may favour 'efficient' quantitative user assessment methods and the construction of abstract user categories for designing new generic solutions and services around market segments. However where a product extends into new and unfamiliar user markets the growing social distance between developer and user may call for 'richer' direct ways of knowing the user. We note the emergence of collective fora, which can provide a space for independent action and innovation by users. However, these were managed communities. Certain user relations functions were pushed out to the community or third-party organizations and at other times pulled back in-house -- for example, to increase vendor direct control. This picture is far removed from the visions of seamless integration of producers and users encouraged by notions such as prosumer. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Religious Affiliation and Attitudes Towards Gay Men: On the Mediating Role of Masculinity Threat
AN  - 1559006880; 201431865
AB  - Previous research suggests that people from some religious backgrounds hold more negative attitudes towards gay men than others do. The current research focuses on psychological variables as an alternative explanation to religious affiliation, testing whether masculinity beliefs regarding gay men and their perceived threat to one's masculinity can explain such between-group differences in negative attitudes. With a sample of 155 male heterosexual university students (Muslims and Christians in Germany), we found that Muslims held more negative attitudes towards gay men than Christians did. Yet, this relation was partially mediated by beliefs about the masculinity of gay men and the experience of masculinity threat imposed by gay men, substantially reducing the effect of religious affiliation on antigay attitudes. In sum, similar psychological processes explained antigay attitudes of both Muslims and Christians. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Contact and Attitudes Toward International Students in Australia: Intergroup Anxiety and Intercultural Communication Emotions as Mediators
AN  - 1520336524; 201412259
AB  - The current study investigated the impact of intercultural contact between domestic and international students on attitudes toward international students, and potential mediators of this relationship. A total of 247 Australian-born domestic undergraduates completed a survey of the quantity and quality of their contact with international students, levels of intergroup anxiety (IA) and intercultural communication emotions (ICE), and their attitudes toward international students. Positive quality of intercultural contact, less IA, and more positive ICE were all related to more positive attitudes toward international students. In addition, ICE mediated the relationship between positive quality of contact and attitudes, and between IA and attitudes. Quality of contact exerted both direct and indirect effects (via IA and intercultural communications emotions) on intergroup attitudes. Results highlight the importance of addressing communication barriers and the emotions associated with these when promoting positive interactions between domestic and international students. Suggestions are made for a theoretical integration of intergroup and communication-based perspectives when considering attitudes toward linguistically diverse outgroups like international students.

T1  - Entitlement to concessionary public transport and wellbeing: A qualitative study of young people and older citizens in London, UK
AN  - 1692289727; 201523531
AB  - Access to transport is an important determinant of health, and concessionary fares for public transport are one way to reduce the 'transport exclusion' that can limit access. This paper draws on qualitative data from two groups typically at risk of transport exclusion: young people (12-18 years of age, n = 118) and older citizens (60+ years of age, n = 46). The data were collected in London, UK, where young people and older citizens are currently entitled to concessionary bus travel. We focus on how this entitlement is understood and enacted, and how different sources of entitlement mediate the relationship between transport and wellbeing. Both groups felt that their formal entitlement to travel for free reflected their social worth and was, particularly for older citizens, relatively unproblematic. The provision of a concessionary transport entitlement also helped to combat feelings of social exclusion by enhancing recipients' sense of belonging to the city and to a 'community'. However, informal entitlements to particular spaces on the bus reflected less valued social attributes such as need or frailty. Thus in the course of travelling by bus the enactment of entitlements to space and seats entailed the negotiation of social differences and personal vulnerabilities, and this carried with it potential threats to wellbeing. We conclude that the process, as well as the substance, of entitlement can mediate wellbeing; and that where the basis for providing a given entitlement is widely understood and accepted, the risks to wellbeing associated with enacting that entitlement will be reduced.

T1  - CSSH Notes
AN  - 1371254147
AB  - (ProQuest: ... denotes non-US-ASCII text omitted.) CSSH Notes Taifa is a work of urban social history that traces the intellectual and cultural evolution of the intertwined concepts of race and nation in the city of Dar es Salaam (capital of present-day Tanzania) from the establishment of the Tanganyika Territory in 1919 through the end of British colonial rule and the first decades of political independence.

Brennan surveys "print debates" in English- and Kiswahili-language media in the decades before and after independence, and contends that African intellectuals, far more than colonial officials, shaped the popular political vocabulary pertaining to national and racial identity in urban Tanzania.

[...]a conscious nationalist strategy to reverse the injustices of colonial-era racial exploitation isolated Dar es Salaam's residents of Asian origin and cast them as outsiders by virtue of their racially marked bodies.

T1  - The Australian space of lifestyles in comparative perspective
AN  - 1429629122; 201335903
AB  - This article (1) examines the social distribution of cultural practices in Australia, and (2) compares this with similar data for the UK in order to identify where and in what respects the social articulations of Australian cultural practices are distinctive. The article draws on the statistical data produced by the Australian Research Council-funded inquiry into Australian Everyday Cultures in the late 1990s and the data produced by the UK's 2003-6 Economic and Social Research Council inquiry into the relations between cultural capital and social exclusion in Britain. It reports the findings of a comparison of multiple correspondence analyses of the survey data for these two projects. The two spaces of lifestyle produced by these procedures show strong similarities with regard to their relations to class, age and gender as the three most significant axes of differentiation. There are, however, differences in the roles that specific cultural fields (the music, literary and media fields, for example) play relative to one another in the two national contexts. Class culture divisions also appear more attenuated in the Australian than in the British case, with a significant clustering of classes in the middle of the space of lifestyles. However, working-class tastes and those of professionals appear strongly polarised in Australia while managers and professionals are more distinctive in their cultural practices than are their British counterparts.

T1  - When white people report racial discrimination: The role of region, religion, and politics
AN  - 1429630075; 201335789
AB  - Scholarly interest in the correlates and consequences of perceived discrimination has grown exponentially in recent years, yet, despite increased legal and media attention to claims of 'anti-white bias,' empirical studies predicting reports of racial discrimination by white Americans remain limited. Using data from the 2006 Portraits of American Life Study, we find that evangelical Protestantism increases the odds that whites will report experiencing racial discrimination, even after controlling for racial context and an array of social and psychological characteristics. However, this effect is limited to the South. Outside the South, political affiliation trumps religion, yielding distinct regional profiles of discrimination reporters. These findings suggest that institutions may function as regional 'carriers' for whites inclined to report racial discrimination. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - The Framing of Islam and Muslims in the Tenth Anniversary Coverage of 9/11: Implications for Reconciliation and Moving On
AN  - 1188305896
AB  - This article analyses Australian television news programmes' framing of the tenth anniversary of the events of 9/11. Our findings build on and reaffirm the earlier work we did in this area -- showing that television news programmes in Australia have moved away from conflating terrorism with Muslims and Islam. We found that the tenth anniversary coverage was presented with the frames of "reconciliation" and "moving on" from 9/11. The dominant frame used by Australian television news was based on the US-Australia relations, including a shared worldview, common experiences of lives lost in the attacks and a unified response in the context of the "war on terror". Notably absent from the coverage was the attribution of references to bridge-building with Muslim minority communities. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Secondary Transfer Effect of Intergroup Contact: The Role of Intergroup Attitudes, Intergroup Anxiety and Perspective Taking
AN  - 964187222; 201207318
AB  - We conducted a field study to investigate the secondary transfer effect of intergroup contact, consisting in the generalisation of the positive effects of intergroup contact to outgroups uninvolved in the contact situation. Italian secondary school students (N=175) filled out a questionnaire; the effects of prior contact were statistically controlled. Results showed that contact with immigrants improved attitudes toward them. In turn, these attitudes generalised to attitudes toward two dissimilar outgroups not directly involved in contact: disabled and homosexuals. Notably, we found evidence for a secondary transfer effect of intergroup anxiety and perspective taking, which generalised from immigrants to the disabled and homosexuals. Evidence was found for the mediating role of intergroup attitudes, intergroup anxiety and perspective taking. The theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed.

T1  - In the name of "development": ethnic politics and multicultural public policy in Cameroon
AN  - 1023031211; 201226872
AB  - Purpose -- The paper begins from the premise that the efforts of the two regimes of Cameroon to manage ethnic diversity on the basis of a multicultural public policy, known as "balanced regional development", constitutes an acute problem, exacerbating rather than attenuating the struggles that are often associated with ethnic diversity in postcolonial states in Africa. The purpose of the paper is to examine this public policy in the broader context of the inter-linkages between ethnicity and politics in Cameroon. Design/methodology/approach -- The study rests on a two-step methodology. First, the authors conducted a review of the conceptual literature around the state-ethnicity diversity conundrum in postcolonial Africa, especially in terms of struggles for access to state resources and opportunities. Second, the authors used these conceptual insights to ground the historical and critical analysis of primary (newspaper articles, computed statistics from public records, national laws, long-term unobtrusive observations of everyday inter-ethnic struggles as a result of the authors' permanent stay in Cameroon) and secondary (local and international publications on the subject) sources. Findings -- While these measures of managing ethnic diversity in Cameroon's public sector-related benefits, such as employment into the country's public service may, in themselves, not be the best approaches to the problem, the main finding of this study is that the greatest obstacle to their potential to yield any serious measure of national integration lies in the tendency for their politicization and capture by those ethnic groups that are more powerful. Originality/value -- The management of ethnic diversities in postcolonial states in Africa is a major development and social policy concern. While most scholars propose succinct analyses of the challenges these may pose for postcolonial nation-building and conflict-avoidance, through the notion of a constitutionally grounded "Human Resource Bank" an original policy solution is proposed in this paper that may suit the Cameroonian context and possibly beyond.

T1  - The politics of place(ment): Problematising the provision of hepatitis C treatment within opiate substitution clinics
AN  - 1018354403; 201214288
AB  - The hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic is a significant public health challenge in Australia. Current initiatives to expand access to HCV treatment focus on opiate substitution therapy (OST) settings where the prevalence of hepatitis C among clients is high. In Australia, the provision of OST for many clients is via large clinics, with an estimated median of 150 clients per service. Conceptually informed by the work of Michel Foucault, our analysis of the proposed integrated treatment model focuses on the critical but overlooked question of organisational culture and power operating within OST. We argue that the specific context of OST not merely reflects but actively participates in the political economy of social exclusion via which the socio-spatial segregation and stigmatisation of the service user as 'drug user' is enacted. This paper analyses data collected from two samples during 2008/9: OST clients living in New South Wales, Australia and a range of OST health professionals working in Australian settings. In total, 27 interviews were conducted with current OST clients; 19 by phone and 8 face-to-face. One focus group and 16 telephone interviews were conducted with OST health professionals. Our analysis of key themes emerging from the interview data suggests that the successful introduction of HCV treatment within the OST clinic is not a given. We are concerned that particular areas of tension, if not explicit contradiction, have been overlooked in current research and debates informing the proposed combination treatment model. We question the appropriateness of co-locating a notoriously arduous, exacting treatment (HCV) within the highly surveillant and regulatory environment of OST. While applauding the intention to improve access to HCV care and treatment for people who inject drugs we caution against a treatment model that risks further entrenching (socio-spatial) stigmatisation amongst those already experiencing significant marginalisation.

T1  - Race-Ethnicity and Medical Services for Infertility: Stratified Reproduction in a Population-based Sample of U.S. Women
AN  - 1882877682
AB  - Evidence of group differences in reproductive control and access to reproductive health care suggests the continued existence of "stratified reproduction" in the United States. Women of color are overrepresented among people with infertility but are underrepresented among those who receive medical services. The authors employ path analysis to uncover mechanisms accounting for these differences among black, Hispanic, Asian, and non-Hispanic white women using a probability-based sample of 2,162 U.S. women. Black and Hispanic women are less likely to receive services than other women. The enabling conditions of income, education, and private insurance partially mediate the relationship between race-ethnicity and receipt of services but do not fully account for the association at all levels of service. For black and Hispanic women, social cues, enabling conditions, and predisposing conditions contribute to disparities in receipt of services. Most of the association between race-ethnicity and service receipt is indirect rather than direct.

T1  - Media, militarism and mythologies of the state: The Latino soldier in World War II films
AN  - 887747577
AB  - This essay examines the representation of Latino soldiers in World War II films and the social and political consequences of making these soldiers invisible or visible on screen. The Latino soldier's in/visibility has often been contingent upon state directives, genre conventions and prevailing war discourses. Films such as A Medal for Benny (1945), Battle Cry (1955) and Hell to Eternity (1960) were linked to discourses of national defense and, in later years, Cold War rhetoric. By focusing on these films, the essay calls for heightened vigilance about military and state influence in cinematic representations of Latino/a soldiers. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Winning and losing in North Carolina - Cultural citizenship struggles and lessons for Latino newspapers
AN  - 887747536
AB  - From 1990 to 2004, North Carolina's Latino population increased more than 400 per cent, from approximately 76,726 to 600,913 inhabitants. Government reports, advocacy groups, academics and mainstream media have focused on what these changes mean for communities in North Carolina and other areas of the Southeast experiencing similar growth. These discourse analyses of the changes to driver's license rules, and of the Mt. Olive boycott on behalf of migrant farmworkers, sheds light on the complexity of how Latino issues are represented in North Carolina's mainstream and Latino newspapers and ultimately address questions of cultural citizenship. Discursive approaches go beyond a study of mere language, to examine the consequences of language: the power differentials, identities and subjectivities. The results show how societal forces work to marginalize groups, yet the marginalized groups do have opportunities to counter the hegemonic discourses and practices. The conclusion discusses the implications for Latino media producers and provides strategies for future struggles. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The attitudes of primary schoolchildren in Northern Thailand towards their peers who are affected by HIV and AIDS
AN  - 868015599; 201113917
AB  - After more than a decade of the AIDS epidemic in Thailand, the number of children whose parents are living with HIV or have died from AIDS is increasing significantly and it has been reported that these children are often discriminated against by their peers. In order to better understand the current situation and to explore possible strategies to support HIV-affected children, this study examined children's attitudes towards HIV and AIDS using questionnaires and focus group discussions with children in Grades three-six in five primary schools in a northern province in Thailand. A total of 513 children (274 boys and 239 girls) answered the questionnaire and five focus groups were organised. The findings showed a strong positive correlation between children's belief that HIV could be transmitted through casual contact and their negative attitudes towards their HIV-affected peers. Most children overestimated the risk of HIV transmission through casual contact and this made their attitudes less tolerant and less supportive. After HIV prevention education (which included information on HIV transmission routes) was given in three of the study schools, the same questionnaire and focus groups were repeated and the findings showed that children's attitudes had become more supportive. These findings suggest that HIV prevention education delivered through primary schools in Thailand can be an effective way to help foster a more supportive and inclusive environment and reduce the stigma and discrimination that decrease educational access and attainment for HIV-affected schoolchildren.

T1  - A Tale of Two Counties: Natives’ Opinions toward Immigration in North Carolina<sup> 1 </sup>: IMR
AN  - 2558423079
AB  - This article compares native residents’ opinions and perceptions regarding immigration using a representative survey from a pair of matched North Carolina counties – one that experienced recent growth of its foreign-born population and one that did not. Drawing from several theoretical perspectives, including group threat, contact theory, and symbolic politics, we formulate and empirically evaluate several hypotheses. Results provide limited evidence that competition and threat influence formation of opinions about immigration, with modest support for claims that parents with school-aged children harbor more negative views of immigration than their childless counterparts. Except for residents in precarious economic situations, these negative opinions appear unrelated to the immigrant composition of the community. Claims that the media promotes negative views of immigration receive limited support, but this relationship is unrelated to the volume of local immigration. Finally, sustained contacts with foreign-born residents outside work environments are associated with positive views of immigration, but superficial contacts appear to be conducive to anti-immigration sentiments. Political orientation, educational attainment, and indicators of respondents’ tolerance for diversity explain most of the difference between the two counties in overall support for immigration.

T1  - Socializing on the Internet: Case Study of Internet Use Among University Students in the United Arab Emirates
AN  - 743050753; 201033915
AB  - This paper analyzes socializing on the Internet and attitudes towards the Internet as a medium of social interaction among university students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It stems from a larger research project conducted at seven different institutions of higher education in the Abu Dhabi Emirate between 2007-2009 through anonymous questionnaires. A total of 571 students (353 female, 183 male) participated in the survey. In this paper we present only a small portion of the data and focus on (1) the intensity and frequency of Internet use; (2) identity and gender hiding in the virtual environment; (3) meeting internet acquaintances in real life; and (4) attitudes towards the Internet as a medium for social interaction. Responses were cross-analyzed in light of the participants' gender, age, and subjectively-perceived social status. Essentially, we argue that Emirati students dedicate a substantial amount of time and turn frequently to activities related to socializing on the Internet. Yet we have found significant differences in Internet usage and attitudes towards socializing on the Internet along the lines of gender, age, and social status. Generally, respondents tend to hide their identity more than their gender in the virtual environment; yet, women tend to hide both their identity and gender significantly more than men. More than half of the respondents think that the Internet is a medium through which they can communicate without being subjected to prejudice; yet men tend to be more positive than women about being treated differently on the Internet when people do know their gender. Finally, respondents who perceive themselves as having a higher social status tend to hide their identity less and are less distrustful of relationships formed via the Internet than are their counterparts, who perceive themselves as having middle class social status. Overall, the findings presented in this paper suggest that although the Internet can largely act as a vehicle for resisting social exclusion and gender segregation, it can also simultaneously serve as a mechanism for reinforcing pre-existing norms within newly-networked traditional communities. On a more general level, this paper aims to contribute to our understanding of global patterns of Internet usage and the complex interplay between technology, culture and identity.
