T1  - ‘You sick, twisted messes’: The use of argument and reasoning in Islamophobic and anti-Semitic discussions on Facebook
AN  - 2411479124
AB  - This research used critical discursive psychology to analyse anti-Semitic and Islamophobic discourse on the English Defence League’s (EDL) Facebook page. The discussion by Facebook users began about ‘reopening’ concentration camps, in which to incarcerate Muslims. Facebook users also expressed anti-Semitic discourse such as Holocaust denial, and the idea that Jews ‘could have done more’. The analysis focuses on the reasoning used when expressing this extreme idea, and how this was contested by other Facebook users, through the use of three strategies: (1) the construction of ‘sickness’, (2) Muslims as ‘the new Nazis’, (3) devictimising Jews as victims. This research shows how the EDL used positive aligning with Jews as means to present Muslims as problematic, and how such alignment resulted in the marginalisation of both Jews and Muslims. Findings are considered in terms of how critical discursive psychology can uncover the function of extreme discourse on social media, and the potential implications of hate speech online.

T1  - Pro-Israeli Forces: Occupying Australian Minds
AN  - 2434044050
AB  - This paper provides a snapshot of the composition and function of pro-Israeli forces currently operating in Australia, specifically with regard to how its intellectuals working for self-professed Jewish organizations and the mainstream Australian news media, have gone about representing the Palestinian plight to audiences. It is revealed that the pro-Israeli Movement Intellectuals have sought to garner public support and help ensure the ongoing Australian government support for the occupation by utilizing linguistic techniques that challenge the characterization of Palestinians as refugees, cast doubt about the existence of Palestine as a place, claim Palestinians want to emigrate and represent the right of return as fantasy.

T1  - When Social Media Get Political: How Perceptions of Open-Mindedness Influence Political Expression on Facebook
AN  - 2429457360
AB  - The use of social media for developing and maintaining relationships can offer a gateway for users to open up and express their political views. Building on previous literature on the “spillover effect” in which relational use of social media motivates political expression, this study examines the circumstances under which the “spillover” effect is more likely to occur. To do so, we measured respondents’ (a) dialogic openness and (b) perception of other users’ political open-mindedness to examine how the two perceptions condition the spillover process on social media. Analyzing original panel survey data of Facebook users in the United States, we found that relational use of social media was positively associated with political expression on Facebook over time. Furthermore, there was suggestive evidence that this relationship was more likely to exist among individuals who perceive (a) themselves as dialogically open and (b) the platform as closed-minded and that the two perceptions may interact to condition the spillover effect. Possible explanations for how these self- and other-perceptions jointly shape the spillover process are discussed.

T1  - Demystifying confidence in different levels of the police: evidence from Shanghai, China
AN  - 2400047524
AB  - Extending Fei's ‘differential mode of association’ (1992) and Cao et al.'s argument that Chinese trust is layered and hierarchical (2015), this study explores the differential confidence in the different levels of police agencies and brings various forms of trust into the study of confidence in the police. Results from a household random sample reveal that Shanghainese make a distinction between hierarchical levels of the police. Their confidence level toward their municipality police department is similar to that toward the Ministry of Public Security while their confidence levels toward the police at stations and Paichusuo are more alike. In addition, the multi-variate regression analyses indicate that institutional trust is the dominant factor for explaining confidence in both local and upper-level police. Media trust, sense of safety, financial satisfaction and collectivism are significant predictors in both models. Obeying the law, gender and class influence confidence in the local police but not the upper-level police while intermediate trust and education have a significant effect only on confidence in the upper-level police. It is concluded that assessment of local police is central to the understanding of public confidence in China.

T1  - Periodical press and port cities: Creation of knowledge, representations and networks<sup>1</sup>
AN  - 2498890242
AB  - Port cities constituted dynamic axes of national territories and stood out for their opening to the outside world for the transaction of goods, the reception of the new and the exchange of ideas. They were also free spaces for new technological experiences and the foundation of modern economic, scientific, social and political projects. They stood out as privileged territories for the establishment of networks of knowledge and through these networks maintained the contact with distant lands. Intellectual production in them is remarkable and the periodical press, providing general or specialized information, as an information industry at the service of new political, scientific and economic projects, finds space for its development within the port cities. This Special Section brings together researchers working on these subjects, allowing a multidisciplinary approach involving scholars from such scientific areas as communication, information, history, literature and international relations. The objective is to analyse the relationship between the periodic press and port cities and how these urban spaces fostered public opinion and debate projects, as well as new specialized information.

T1  - NATIONAL TEAMS, MULTIPLE LOYALTIES. A DISCUSSION OF THREE FOOTBALL CASE STUDIES
TT  - Selecciones nacionales, lealtades múltiples. Una discusión de tres casos de fútbol
AN  - 2431832962
AB  - In several Western European countries, multi-ethnic societies are also reflected in national football teams that field players of migrant origin. This article presents an empirical analysis of how football players with dual identities have negotiated their allegiances to their 'home' and 'adoptive' footballing countries. Research is conducted through inductive analysis of empirical data based on three case studies from Germany, Switzerland and France, dating from 2018. These cases highlight the different manners in which such football players are confronted with their dual identities when opting for the National Team of their «country of adoption». Our findings reveal that, while the national identity of professional players seems to be largely irrelevant in the globalised Football Clubs and Leagues of Western Europe, players with migrant background face serious difficulties when expressing, spontaneously or intentionally, their dual allegiance. The main theoretical contribution of the article is the conceptualisation of a process in which large parts of public opinion and media discourse, even in countries with a long-standing history of migration, have trouble to come to terms with dual loyalties. In those cases, football players face a demand to explicitly make public their allegiance when bearing the nation's «colours» on the football pitch.Alternate abstract:En varios países de la Europa occidental podemos encontrar sociedades con una composición multi-étnica que se refleja también en la composición de sus equipos nacionales de fútbol, los que cada vez alinean más jugadores de origen emigrante. Este artículo, con un énfasis principalmente empírico, analiza cómo los jugadores de fútbol con identidad nacional dual negocian su adhesión a su país de origen y al país de adopción futbolística. La investigación se plantea mediante tres casos de estudio situados en Alemania, Suiza y Francia en 2018. En estos casos se analiza la manera en que distintos futbolistas se han enfrentado a su identidad dual al jugar en la selección nacional de su país de adopción. El principal resultado de la investigación sugiere que, mientras la identidad nacional de los futbolistas parece no ser excesivamente relevante en las competiciones Europeas de clubes, no ocurre lo mismo con las selecciones nacionales. Jugadores con origen emigrante encuentran tremendas dificultades para expresar, de manera sencilla o espontánea, su identidad dual dentro del fútbol de selecciones. La principal contribución teórica del artículo es una conceptualización del proceso por el que una gran parte de la opinión pública y del discurso de los medios de comunicación, incluso en países con una amplia tradición de acogida de emigrantes como Francia, Suiza o Alemania, tienen dificultades para entender las complejidades de las identidades duales. En esos casos, los futbolistas se ven forzados a hacer pública, de manera clara y expresa, su lealtad hacia los «colores» de su país sobre el terreno de juego.

T1  - Incumbent-led transitions and civil society: Autonomous vehicle policy and consumer organizations in the United States
AN  - 2358480563
AB  - The transition to connected and autonomous (or automated) vehicles (CAVs) in the United States is used to explore the role of civil society in the acceleration and deceleration of sociotechnical transitions. This is an "incumbent-led transition," which occurs when large industrial corporations in one or more industries lead a systemic technological change. This type of transition may generate public concerns about risk and uncertainty, which can be expressed and mobilized by civil society organizations (CSOs). In turn, CSOs may also attempt to decelerate the transition process in order to develop better regulation and to change technology design. Based on an analysis of CSO statements in the public sphere and media reports on CAVs in the U.S., the political strategy of CSOs is examined to improve understanding of the role of civil society in incumbent-led transitions. The analysis indicates that the strategy includes four main aspects: articulating an alternative political goal (slower introduction of advanced autonomous vehicles and more rapid introduction of existing driver-assisted technology), engaging multiple targets or venues of action (different government units and the private sector), forming and expanding a broad coalition, and selecting effective tactics of influence (lobbying, media outreach, and research involving public opinion polls).

T1  - NEW LABELS, NEW ROLES? CHANGES IN PORTRAYING DISABLED PEOPLE IN THE POLISH PRESS
AN  - 2388310082
AB  - Changes in the perception of disabled people and the shift towards the social model of disability should also be reflected in the media debate. On the one hand, media expose the dominant social attitudes towards disabled people, on the other hand, they play an important role in shaping public opinion, influencing ways of thinking and talking about disability. The aim of the paper is to examine the extent to which the term osoba z niepełnosprawnością (person with a disability), which is seen in Poland as being connected to the social model of disability and the ideals of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, is used by the media and whether this is accompanied by changes in the presentation of social roles performed by disabled people. The analysis encompasses articles published in the selected Polish opinion-forming weekly magazines after ratifying the Convention (2012). The study shows that although the term osoba z niepełnosprawnością is gradually gaining popularity, this is not related to the way disabled people and their social roles are presented.

T1  - Testing Partisan Selective Exposure in a Multidimensional Choice Context: Evidence from a Conjoint Experiment
AN  - 2334268086
AB  - The methodological shortcomings characterizing previous experimental research on selective and cross-cutting exposure (e.g. focusing on the impact of a few experimental factors and providing a limited range of choice alternatives) amount to an incomplete description of news choice behavior. This study proposes an alternative method that addresses these shortcomings in testing partisan news selection in the current media environment. A conjoint experiment (N = 746), which simulates a popular mobile news platform (iOS news app), showed that while partisans preferred selecting news from pro-attitudinal sources, they also selected news from counter-attitudinal sources at least once in five times (20%). The tendency to engage in selective exposure was slightly stronger among strong partisans. Our findings indicate that the concerns over partisan selective exposure may not be an issue of "selection" but more of "access" to news sources with different political views. The implications for future research are discussed.

T1  - Veiled Muslim women's views on law banning the wearing of the niqab (face veil) in public
AN  - 2299736270
AB  - In August 2018, Denmark became the latest European country to ban the wearing of the niqab (face veil) in public. Indeed, several European countries such as France, Belgium and Austria have already implemented a ban on the wearing of the niqab in public places in these countries on the basis that the niqab is a symbol of gender oppression, Islamist fundamentalism and lack of integration. This issue has been the subject of heated media, political and public debates; however, the voices of veiled Muslim women remain unheard. Within the framework of Critical Race Feminism, the paper draws on qualitative interviews with Muslim women who wear the niqab in the United Kingdom (UK), in order to explore their views on legislation banning the wearing of the niqab in public.

T1  - Public acceptance of drones: Knowledge, attitudes, and practice
AN  - 2337157085
AB  - Drones are currently being used for commercial, public safety, hobby, and scientific research purposes. Short term and long term forecasts show extensive utilization of drones in various sectors. Yet, it is uncertain if general public accepts this highly potential drone congestion. This quantitative survey study explored public acceptance of drones by using the Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) model and using statistical analysis to decrease the uncertainty. The KAP model was utilized in a recent survey study to understand the public opinion of drones. This survey instrument was thoroughly redesigned to better understand general public's knowledge and attitudes of forty different drone applications, and associated risk perceptions. The practice section was redesigned as well to better understand how public uses drones personally and on company level. The results showed that drones were not well accepted at present except for public safety and scientific research applications. Commercial and hobby uses are not supported. Public sees the drones as a risky technology that directly interferes with their privacy. Moreover, public is not aware of most of the future drone applications, and many current applications. The survey was distributed to both general public and stakeholders to represent both part of the society (153 fully completed surveys). A qualitative risk analysis was conducted in this study as well. By considering the results, this study recommends that public and private institutions should collaborate to develop risk mitigation and response strategies to minimize the risks. Also, public needs to get informed on these strategies through mass media and educational institutions. This might help improving the reputation of drones from killer machines or privacy interrupters towards a technology that helps our society.

T1  - An online experiment on the influence of online user comments on attitudes toward a minority group
AN  - 2318594529
AB  - In recent years, there is interest in examining the effects of user comments on online content consumers' attitudes and perceptions. Building on theoretical foundations from social psychology and using an online experimental design, we investigated whether exposure to online comments attached to news content affects attitudes toward refugees. We recruited students from a public university in the Mediterranean region and, after administering a printed pretest on their attitudes toward refugees, we assigned them into three groups: one that read a series of positive comments about refugees (positive experimental group), one that read a series of negative comments about refugees (negative experimental group) and one that did not read comments (control group). The comments and a neutral reference news video were communicated to the participants via email during a five-day period after the pretest. After the implementation of the experimental stimuli, we administered a modified version of the pretest as a posttest. We found that exposure to positive comments reduced prejudice and that the intensity of prior prejudice was positively associated with the magnitude of prejudice reduction. Exposure to negative comments did not affect prejudice. A repeat posttest, administered one week after the posttest, showed stability of the observed attitude change.

T1  - Anonymity, Membership-Length and Postage Frequency as Predictors of Extremist Language and Behaviour among Twitter Users
AN  - 2384584274
AB  - The rise in participation of social media networks is accompanied with a corresponding rise in online extremism. The present research was carried out to ascertain whether anonymity, membership length and postage frequency are predictors of online extremism. A total of 205 Twitter accounts and 102,290 tweets were examined. To address the research question, both a corpus linguistic analysis (CLA) and content analysis (CA) were conducted. The former looked at extreme words associated with Islam and the latter looked at four types of extremist behaviour (extreme pro-social, extreme anti-social, extreme anti-social prejudicial biases and extreme radical behaviours). Keyness tests demonstrated that extreme words were most significantly associated with Twitter accounts with high anonymity, low membership length and low postage frequency. A series of multiple regressions found that anonymity significantly predicted four types of extremist behaviour. Membership length only predicted extreme anti-social behaviour and postage frequency did not display any significant predictive power for any of the four types of extremist behaviour. These results suggest that anonymity, membership length and postage frequency differ in terms ofpredicting extremist language and behaviour.

T1  - Rebuilding a Social Contract: The Role of Media and Academia in shaping a new narrative in Pakistan
AN  - 2475010664
AB  - The paper aims to provide an insight into the role of media and academia in shaping a new narrative in Pakistan (by strengthening the national cohesion, economic and social progress), with reference to the fundamental laws as enunciated in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The initial research hypothesis envisages the necessity of providing an updated narrative for rebuilding the social contract in order to introduce greater social equality and provide better chances for the multidimensional development of Pakistan's citizens. There are three major assumptions in this research: There is a need to come up with an updated formula for the state-society relations and need to re-negotiate the social contract at multiple levels by taking into consideration the voice of the public. All decision-makers and influencers from the media, civil society, civil and military bureaucracy, business and academia, have their distinctive role in rebuilding/renewing the social contract.
The media and academia have unprecedented role in the development of a rules-based society, thus their contribution to reshaping a narrative in Pakistan should not be underestimated. Modern, 21st century social order should adhere to the principles of equality and empowerment of the underprivileged groups, as articulated in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

T1  - Pride and prejudice: opposing constructions of mixed race in Australia
AN  - 2198982822
AB  - In the Australian context, the development of a 'situated politics of mixedness' is complicated by the fact that there are (at least) two main categories of mixed race populations - the Indigenous and the migrant/settler. For those with mixed Aboriginal/non-Aboriginal ancestries, and those with mixed White and other migrant ancestries, life chances and identities differ significantly. This paper outlines some of these differences using the trope of pride and prejudice. For those of mixed migrant/settler heritage, evidence is growing that the mixed experience is predominantly one of pride. For them, misrecognition, or being asked about their racial background, is an opportunity for play, often resulting in 'the big reveal' of a valorised mixed identity associated with something other than a bland 'white bread' Australian-ness. For those of mixed Indigenous heritage however, there remains a significant level of prejudice, not (only) for being Aboriginal, but for not being visibly Aboriginal enough. Using existing studies and a number of media controversies as examples, this paper interrogates the implications of these differences for understandings of the ways in which race is recruited in the construction of legitimate identity claims. It asks particularly how 'mixed race' is helpful analytically to describe the identity constructions within these two very different experiences.

T1  - I Want a Savior, Not a Victim. The Impact of Media Representations of the EU and Economic Shocks on Citizens’ Supportive Attitudes on the European Integration
AN  - 2430086961
AB  - The Euro crisis substantially diminished citizens’ support for the European integration. Therefore, we intend to analyze the independent effects of both the depiction of the Euro crisis in national news media and macroeconomic contexts on citizens’ support for a deeper integration. Based on a combination of Eurobarometer data, results from a content analysis, and data on the economic performance of citizens’ home regions, we show that presenting the European Union (EU) as a victim impedes citizens’ supportive attitudes concerning the European integration, whereas depicting the EU as responsible for solving the crisis has a strengthening effect. Additionally, sharp economic developments in citizens’ home regions also have significant effects on their prointegration attitudes, suggesting a differential influence of close and remote economic indicators.

T1  - Transitional Injustice: Egypt's Human Rights Reversals after the Uprising
AN  - 2249731018
AB  - For a concise summary of egypt's deplorable human rights record under President Abd al-Fattah al-Sisi, we could not do better than the August 21, 2018, "memorandum of justification" accompanying US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's waiver of human rights–based restrictions on US military funding to Egypt. "The overall human rights climate," the memo states, "continues to deteriorate." It then identifies arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, torture, and deaths in detention, as well as "increased restrictions on freedom of expression, freedom of association, and the right of peaceful assembly" (Toosi 2018). The 2011 uprising had opened space for free expression, association, and assembly, space that had been closed for decades. People felt free to speak their minds about politics without fear of arrest or prosecution. There were clashes, but generally citizens could organize strikes and protests without being brutally dispersed by the police. Media outlets critiqued the government and security forces with unprecedented vigor. Once-banned movements, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, worked in the open. There were free and fair elections for president and parliament. The government of President al-Sisi, and that of the preceding military-backed interim president, systematically reversed these gains, with the often enthusiastic cooperation of the judiciary. Al-Sisi summarized his objective when he told a conference on November 5, 2018, "After all the effort we have done, all we are hoping for is that we go back to where we were before 2011" (Hendawi 2018a).Certainly, in the domain of human rights, al-Sisi has frog-marched Egypt back more than five decades with a ferocious and comprehensive political repression unmatched since the worst days of President Gamal Abd al-Nasr's rule in the 1960s. This is part of a regional trajectory that saw numerous countries ravaged by armed conflict and consolidation of authoritarian rule. But this is not the whole story; economic performances have generally been quite poor, and the recent experience of revolt has not been erased. In all the Arab countries that experienced popular uprisings starting in 2010–2011, the insurrectionary moment was provoked by systematic and egregious human rights abuses. In Egypt the trigger was torture and police brutality "on an epidemic scale" (Stork 2012, 464). Writing in these pages in 2012, I characterized the military-run transition following Hosni Mubarak's departure as "highly uncertain" in its human rights implications, but I too-optimistically forecast that, under the Muslim Brotherhood, the most difficult conflicts would concern freedom of expression and religious belief and women's rights. Surveys showed popular support for democratic rights and accountability (Pew 2012; Barsalou and Knight 2014). But the military coup that ousted Morsi just a year later, with considerable popular support at the time, ushered in a level of repression far more severe than that under Mubarak's three decades of rule.

T1  - Strategic Othering: Framing Lebanese Migration and Fraser's “Mistake”
AN  - 2190000269
AB  - Australian Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Peter Dutton, has framed the mid‐1970s immigration of Lebanese affected by civil war as Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser's “mistake”. His remarks sparked controversy in the parliament and the media. The issue became a contest of frames between the Murdoch media, which supported the Minister's “mistake” frame and argued his right to “tell the truth”, and the Fairfax media, which viewed the Minister as being “racist” for “scapegoating” the Lebanese community. Along with archival documents, this article examines the context and coverage of the Minister's remarks, noting that the frames presented in the media “indexed” those adopted amongst political elites, while failing to re‐examine the historical record. This case study demonstrates the power of framing and the media's tendency to accept rather than challenge frames used by those in the political contest, with the result that errors in the representation of history were never corrected. This article draws on framing theory and indexing theory and concludes that the “mistake” frame for the Lebanese feeds into narratives that serve to “other” Muslim and Arab groups, fanning fears and mobilising a discourse of Islamophobia around the exclusion of “undesirable” immigrants on the basis of “cultural fit”.

T1  - Reassessing NIMBY: The demographics, politics, and geography of opposition to high-density residential infill
AN  - 2409198020
AB  - Planners often attempt to accommodate growth in already developed areas. Opposition to high-density (i.e., at a higher unit density than surrounding development) residential infill in developed areas is, however, a long-established force in land use politics. We hypothesize that opposition to this development, as well as 6 specific concerns with this development’s impacts, are likely associated with a variety of ideological, demographic, geographical, and political characteristics and that these associations can tell planners much about the character of this opposition. We use a web survey of verified voters in local elections (n = 772) in medium- to medium-high-density ZIP codes to find relationships between these characteristics and respondents’ feelings toward a hypothetical high-density residential infill development. Our findings expose the varied character of responses to this development: respondents of some characteristics—for example, those who strongly value their communities’ attractiveness, vitality, walkability, and bikability—are more likely to have specific concerns while remaining open to the development, indicating the possibility of constructive conversations with these groups. On the other hand, the concerns of other groups, notably those of conservatives, may result from unfamiliarity or even prejudice.

T1  - The Liberal Plan for Resettling Syrian Refugees in Canada: The Justificatory Narrative and Counter-Narrative
AN  - 2303172351
AB  - The purpose of this article is to examine several interrelated aspects of the Liberal Party's plan proposed during the 2015 election campaign to resettle 25,000 government-assisted Syrian refugees prior to the end of that year, and the Liberal government's efforts after the 2015 election to implement that plan. The objective is to examine the following four interrelated aspects of that plan before and after the 2015 election: (a) the evolution of key provisions in the plan; (b) the composition and thematic thrusts of the justificatory narrative for the plan; (c) the composition and thematic thrusts of the counter-narrative that critiqued both the plan and its justificatory narrative; and (d) the degree of continuity and change to public opinion regarding the Liberal plan. The article also devotes some attention to the lessons that can be drawn from this case study regarding factors that shape narratives and counter-narratives, and some potentially valuable directions for further research.Alternate abstract:L'objectif de cet article est d'examiner plusieurs aspects interconnectés du plan proposé par le parti libéral lors de la campagne électorale de 2015 pour faciliter la réintégration de 25 000 réfugiés syriens assistés par le gouvernement avant la fin de cette année-lá, ainsi que des efforts déployés par le gouvernement libéral apres la tenue des élections en 2015. Le dessein consiste â examiner les quatre aspects interconnectés suivants de ce plan avant et apres l'élection de 2015 : a) l'évolution des principales dispositions du plan ; (b) la composition et les axes thématiques du récit justificatif du plan ; (c) la composition et les axes thématiques du contre-récit qui critiquait â la fois le plan et son récit justificatif ; et (d) le degré de continuité et de changement dans l'opinion publique concernant le plan libéral. L'article consacre également une certaine attention aux leçons qui peuvent étre tirées de cette étude de cas en ce qui concerne les facteurs qui façonnent les récits et les contre-récits, ainsi que certaines orientations potentiellement utiles pour des recherches ultérieures.

T1  - Using Media Literacy to Counter Stereotypical Images of Blacks and Latinos at a Predominantly White University
AN  - 2206009096
AB  - Media literacy, the critical analysis and deconstruction of media messages, has the potential to promote favorable attitudes toward members of racial minority groups. This study reports on the development and implementation of two types of media literacy interventions (i.e., critical and stereotype) aimed at enhancing college students' attitudes toward Blacks and Latinos. Students from 5 sections of the same course took part in a quasi-experiment and were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 interventions or to a control group. Students' attitudes were measured at 3 different times during the study: 6 weeks before the intervention, immediately following the intervention, and 6 weeks after the intervention. Both interventions enhanced students' attitudes toward Blacks and Latinos but the stereotype intervention was more effective than the critical one, both for short- and long-term effects, as the latter disappeared in the critical condition. Attitudes of students in the control group remained the same throughout the study. Implications address how to use media literacy to enhance conversation about race relations.

T1  - The formation of aggregate expectations: wisdom of the crowds or media influence?
AN  - 2178493778
AB  - The general elections of 2015 in Spain were elections of change. Two new parties for which voters had no previous historical reference points burst onto the parliamentary scene. Two (partially) opposed theories vie to offer an explanation as to how voters build their aggregate electoral expectations. In this paper, we investigate which mechanism has the greatest influence on the formation of expectations: published opinion or social interactions. Likewise, we also study if there is an ideological bias in the voters' perception of the future results of the electoral battle. Based on analysis of microdata from a survey (sample size = 14,262) conducted in Spain on the occasion of the general elections of 2015, we provide evidence: firstly, that the published surveys are the main source used by voters to configure their aggregate expectations; and secondly, that the interpretation and projection that voters make about reality is not neutral, but strongly influenced by their own beliefs and preferences.

T1  - Challenging the Dominant Frame: The Moderating Impact of Exposure and Knowledge on Perceptions of Sex Trafficking Victimization*
AN  - 2127567127
AB  - ObjectiveHuman trafficking problems have largely been framed by political elites and the media as a sexual crime involving innocent victims who are largely women and children. It is unclear how this framing impacts the public's attitudes about the issue. Here, we ask what types of sex trafficking victim frames produce the strongest response among the American public and how does increased exposure and accurate knowledge about the issue moderate the impact of the victim frames?MethodsTo answer these questions, we utilize data from a unique nationally representative survey experiment fielded to 2,000 Americans in which we designed a 2 × 2 × 2 experiment manipulating the gender, age, and nationality of sex trafficking victims.ResultsWe find the age of the victim has the greatest impact on affective, cognitive, and behavioral responses to human trafficking, but that these victim frames are conditional on the amount of exposure a subject has had to the issue of human trafficking and the level of correct knowledge he or she possesses about human trafficking.ConclusionVictim framing in public discourse on sex trafficking does make a difference, and the reasons these frames elicit different responses are complex and moderated by respondents’ exposure to information and knowledge about the issue.

T1  - Islamophobia in Australia: From Far-Right Deplorables to Respectable Liberals
AN  - 2302560159
AB  - In Australia since about the turn of the millennium, discrimination against Muslims has been increasingly normalized, made respectable, and presented as prudent precaution against violent extremism. Vilification of Muslims has posed as defending ‘Australian values’ against those who will not integrate. Liberal political leaders and press leader-writers who formerly espoused cultural pluralism now routinely hold up as inimical the Muslim folk devil by whose otherness the boundaries of acceptability of the national culture may be marked out and policed. The Muslim Other is positioned not only as culturally incommensurate, but dangerously so: dishonest, criminally inclined, violent, misogynist, homophobic, backward, uncivilized. On the far right, extremist nationalist organizations incite racist hatred under cover of this rhetoric, often cloaked as reasonable common sense. This paper undertakes an ideology analysis of political and media discussion, and examines the forms of social control that they advance and sustain.

T1  - Understanding the dynamics among acculturative stress, coping, and growth: A grounded theory of the Korean immigrant adolescent experience
AN  - 2167806469
AB  - The purpose of the present study is two-fold. First, it aims to develop a theoretical model of the acculturative process of immigrant adolescents based on the understanding of the relationships among acculturative stress, coping, and growth. Second, it aims to propose a typology that offers distinct patterns in the process of acculturation and the resulting outcomes. Using the grounded theory method, the study identified stress related to communication problems, ethnic prejudice, academic pressure, homesickness, and interpersonal conflict. The lack of social support and the school climate were identified as contextual factors of perceived stress. Peer mediation and motivation were identified as intervention factors of coping behaviors. The immigrant adolescent coping behaviors included media use for emotional release, focus on a goal, connectedness to the home country, and the creation of social capital in the host country. The typology of different acculturative patterns classified immigrant adolescents into three types: adaptive, academic, and competent. Based on the findings, the significance of family functioning, peer mediation, self-expansion motivation, and coping behaviors to create social capital for immigrant adolescents' normal development was discussed.

T1  - For public (and recontextualized) sociology: The promises and perils of public engagement in an age of mediated communication
AN  - 2089865186
AB  - This article argues for the analysis of public engagement as an essentially mediated activity. Although recent studies note that academic knowledge is increasingly available for consumption by nonacademic audiences, they tell us little about how it gets recontextualized while passing through the hands of media professionals on its way toward such audiences. In Burawoy's (2005) influential call for the rebirth of public sociology, as in the debates his work provoked, the media is treated solely as a means for the transportation of knowledge. But as this article demonstrates, the media does not simply transport knowledge; it also, and at the same time, translates that knowledge in various, rhetorically consequential ways. Focusing on the mediated trajectory of an attempt by a group of academics to connect with audiences beyond academia, their initial contribution is compared to its subsequent translation(s) across various British newspapers. A discursive analysis reveals the techniques via which a classic form of public sociology came to be recontextualized such that, remarkably, these authors were left appearing to voice nothing but their own petty prejudices. The article concludes by noting that where public engagement involves mediation, public sociology should pay more attention to the recontextualizing affordances of media discourse.

T1  - Perceptions of Quality of Life and Pollution among China's Urban Middle Class: The Case of Smog in Tangshan
AN  - 2057225219
AB  - After decades of rapid economic development, China is facing severe environmental problems. In particular, smog in urban areas has recently attracted a great deal of scientific and media attention both domestically and internationally. Our focus in this article is on public perceptions of smog in the northern city of Tangshan, which is routinely ranked as one of the urban areas with the worst air quality in the nation. In this article, we present the results of qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys with 341 urban residents. We examine how these residents perceive and weigh the importance of various aspects related to quality of life, including their experience with air pollution. Study participants considered environmental quality an issue of lower priority than many others; however, they surprisingly ranked it over economic concerns such as jobs and income. Their responses suggest that, for many urban residents, environmental problems like smog are fundamentally linked to basic quality of life concerns such as physical health and family well-being. We interpret our findings in the context of literature on the rise of China's middle class, the rise of environmental consciousness, and the role of gender in mediating perceptions of pollution and family health. We also consider the implications of these findings for the control and remediation of air pollution in China today.Alternate abstract:摘要经过数十年迅猛的经济发展, 中国当下面临极其严重的环境问题。尤其是近些年中国的城市雾霾引起了国内外学者和媒体的广泛关注。这篇文章探讨了生活在中国北方城市唐山的人们对于雾霾污染的公众意识。在这篇文章中, 作者总结了定性访谈和 341 份城市调查问卷的分析结果, 介绍了唐山的城市居民如何认识和权衡生活质量相关的几个方面, 包括他们自身对于雾霾的经验和认知。被调查居民认为环境质量相较其他几项生活质量相关的方面并不在优先考虑之列, 然而却优先于经济考量,比如说比工作和家庭收入。被调查居民的回答反映出对于很多城市居民来讲, 环境问题很大程度上和对于最基本生活质量的忧虑息息相关, 包括身体健康以及家庭和睦。此文章引用了中国中产阶级的崛起, 环境意识的苏醒, 以及性别在影响环境相关的公众意识的作用为框架阐述研究成果, 同时作者认为此篇研究成果对于以后中国更好的控制和改善大气污染具有实践性的意义。

T1  - Perceived Credibility of Chinese Social Media: Toward an Integrated Approach
AN  - 2430088134
AB  - Using Weblog files and an online survey on Sina Weibo (N = 754), this article (1) empirically examined Chinese social media credibility in validated indexes; (2) compared the credibility of 12 types of media, which yielded three genres: traditional media, Web 1.0, and social media; and (3) explored the predictors of social media credibility. Results indicated SW users rate social media moderately high, especially on its fairness and unbiasedness, rather than accuracy. Comparatively, they trust traditional media most (especially newspaper) and social media least (especially SNS), although social media are more popular and rated fairly credible alone. Users' frequency of traditional media use and social media use, information-seeking motivation, and innovativeness has a positive impact on social media credibility. Reversely, users’ join date, participation, trust inclination, education, and age negatively influence social media credibility.

T1  - “No Prejudice Here”: Examining Social Identity Work in Starter Pack Memes
AN  - 2313792273
AB  - As a performance venue, online social spaces afford users a variety of ways to express themselves. Many of these expressions include social identity work, such as the articulation, affirmation, or policing of a shared identity. In this study, we examine one online space in which users engage in social identity work: a Reddit forum (r/starterpacks) that primarily generates and discusses image memes of a very specific format: the “starter pack.” Users leverage these image memes to convey what we refer to in this article as prototypes of social identities. Many of these prototypical depictions are necessarily influenced by offline social groups and/or consumer culture, and are furthermore constructed around gendered, racial, or ethnic stereotypes. To understand how these image memes are used to form and perpetuate prototypes of social identities, we employed content analysis to evaluate a sample of 500 image meme artifacts created, shared, and upvoted by the subreddit’s users. We discuss the process of applying visual analysis techniques to articulate themes identified in the image meme expressions, in particular: (1) the default of the White, male identity in starter pack characterizations; (2) the production of oppressive social identities through the use of visual and textual content; and (3) the dedication to a stance of “consumption” in assembling starter pack memes, both through body politics expressed therein and use of consumer goods in images. Finally, we draw on reader response theory to frame the challenges of researchers “reading” starter pack memes, despite employing systematic methods of analysis.

T1  - Media, conflict and diaspora audiences
AN  - 2049548240
AB  - Emergence of diaspora communities has resulted in diasporic media playing a key role in enabling a reconnection of diasporic populations with a mediated homeland. This becomes more poignant amongst diaspora communities that feel marginalized, racially discriminated against and battle threats of xenophobia, Islamophobia and other forms of social exclusion in their adopted Western homes. This makes mediated co-presence more powerful than physical co-presence as diaspora individuals try to find community at a distance. Taking the Somali diaspora community as a case study, this article explores how diasporic media content is consumed amongst conflict-generated diaspora audiences. When conflict dynamics are manifested within diaspora social networks, the re-creation of conflict takes place, which then facilitates the engagement of diaspora with homeland conflicts. But their views, reactions and concerns regarding diasporic media content also indicate their potential for deliberatively engaging with it.

T1  - Trajectories of Internalized Heterosexism among Young Men Who have Sex with Men
AN  - 2015614437
AB  - Minority stress, or the unique stressors encountered by sexual minorities, has a significant impact on the mental health and well-being of this population. One minority stressor, internalized heterosexism, refers to incorporating stigma against sexual minorities into one’s self-concept as a product of social bias. This minority stressor has been consistently related to worse mental health in sexual minorities. We evaluated experiences of internalized heterosexism longitudinally, over 24 months, in a sample of 450 young men who have sex with men (YMSM; age range = 16–20 years old at baseline). Latent class growth analyses revealed three classes: individuals with low-decreasing internalized heterosexism (57.1%), medium-stable internalized heterosexism (37.3%), and high-stable internalized heterosexism (5.6%). Multinomial logistic regression analyses revealed that some racial/ethnic minorities, non-gay identified individuals (i.e., bisexual/other), and individuals with less femininity and greater masculinity were significantly more likely to be in the medium- and high-stable internalized heterosexism classes. Higher victimization, as well as lower gay/bisexual community involvement, peer support, and outness predicted membership in the medium-stable internalized heterosexism class (relative to the low-decreasing class). Further, higher past 6-month victimization and lower outness were also predictive of high-stable internalized heterosexism class membership (relative to the low-decreasing class). These findings reveal that there is not a single trajectory of internalized heterosexism—the degree to which it changes differs across men and depends on demographic characteristics and interpersonal experiences. Furthermore, the results indicate interpersonal targets for future work aimed at promoting positive identity development and decreased internalized heterosexism for sexual minority youth.

T1  - Contemporary Methodological Approaches to Qualitative Research: A Review of The Oxford Handbook of Qualitative Methods
AN  - 2013609580
AB  - Researchers can discover the dynamism of new methods of qualitative inquiry and discover new applications for the established methods. The Oxford Handbook of Qualitative Methods (2014), edited by Patricia Leavy examines topics ranging from the politics of knowledge to researcher prejudice and bias extant in qualitative research. History, ethics, philosophy, and theoretical approaches of qualitative research are presented in a cogent manner. Topics include grounded theory, feminist research, indigenous methodologies, narrative inquiry, ethnography, case studies, oral history, content analysis, Internet research, photography and arts-based research, community-based research, qualitative disaster research, and mixed-methods.

T1  - 'You opened my mind': Latinx immigrant and receiving community interactional dynamics in the United States
AN  - 1999858583
AB  - Communities are continually shaped by immigration. As immigrants join receiving community members as members of the same community, all must co-navigate emergent and evolving relationships. These intergroup relations can range from quite positive, marked by mutual enrichment and engagement, to quite negative, marked by prejudice and discrimination. This study seeks to illuminate immigrant and receiving community member relations by exploring what factors play a role in each group's attitudes and actions toward, and experiences with, one another. Thirty first- and second-generation immigrants from Latin America and 30 third-generation or more U.S.-born respondents participated in semistructured interviews, which were thematically analyzed. Results indicated that while both intergroup contact (Allport, 1954) and the formation of common in-group identities (Gaertner, Dovidio, & Bachman, 1996) helped to create positive intergroup relations, numerous personal characteristics-including values and beliefs, visible features, and relative power-affected experiences and attitudes. Further, in the absence of knowledge based on direct contact, media played a strong role in shaping attitudes toward both groups of community members. These findings show how attitudes and actions of immigrants and receiving community members are each shaped by experiences, or lack thereof, between these groups. Moreover, this pathway is iterative and reciprocal. Therefore, efforts aimed at increasing and improving positive intergroup relations must consider the bidirectional iterative process and experiences of both groups.

T1  - Public Support for Campaign Finance Reform: The Role of Policy Narratives, Cultural Predispositions, and Political Knowledge in Collective Policy Preference Formation
AN  - 1999673970
AB  - ObjectiveWe use the variation in public support for campaign finance reform (CFR) to determine factors important to collective policy preference formation.MethodsUsing a national survey, we factor analyze the latent dimensions of various reforms, and rely on an experimental design to explain the role policy narratives, cultural theory (CT), and political knowledge play in preference formation.ResultsThe reform debate groups along three dimensions: (1) strengthening limitations and regulations, (2) deregulating campaign finance, or (3) ending the dependence on private money altogether. We show policy narratives are most influential, and CT has more explanatory value, among those with higher levels of political knowledge. Certain policy narratives tend to increase support for CFR across all cultural types, including those who most oppose reforms that seek to end the dependence on private money.ConclusionAs awareness of campaign finance increases, and as particular narratives become salient, we would expect increasing support for public financing, free media time, and/or public matching funds among those with higher levels of general political knowledge.

T1  - Tweeting back while shouting back: Social media and feminist activism
AN  - 1999858886
AB  - Shouting back’ or responding using a hashtag in digital spaces is a way of exposing the prejudice faced by people on a daily basis, while sharing and reacting to it, and provoking responses; social networking sites (SNSs) provide a visible platform for feminists to address experiences relating to sexism and misogyny. Guillard (2016, p. 1) argues that digital spaces are central to defining ‘a fourth wave of feminist practice’ and allow for global engagement, yet the use of digital media can be tokenistic (Kristofferson, White, & Peloza, 2014) and use of the Internet is insufficient to demarcate a new wave of practice. As feminist academics (Braun, 2011) writing from the United Kingdom, who have engaged with social media for a number of years, we seek to explore some of the issues related to social media-based feminist campaigns and examine the process of ‘shouting back’ against hegemony, misogyny and sexism. Digital spaces are a powerful influence on social movements (Earl & Kimport, 2011), and we consider some of the ways in which social media has contributed to the feminist movement.

T1  - “Barcelona in common”: A new urban regime for the 21st-century tourist city?
AN  - 2409198802
AB  - A coalition of leftist political groups, civic movements, and grassroots organizations led by social activist Ada Colau won the Barcelona municipal elections of 2015 and is now governing the Catalan capital. The key to this success may well have been its critical positioning in relation to its tourism. Until recently considered a best practice in urban regeneration and a successful global destination, Barcelona has seen in the last 2 years a radical change in the public perception on tourism: from “manna from heaven” to serious issues that are affecting the quality of life of its citizens.This article looks into the factors that may have determined this political change, from the growth of tourism beyond what could be considered a critical threshold for an urban system, to the development of a critical discourse on tourism by the new coalition—attributed to its peculiar constituency and working methods—and the role of the media in airing this discursive shift. The article follows the thread of the “growth machine” theorizations and questions whether the increasing dimension of tourism in urban societies could be a driver for regime changes.

T1  - Rhetoric and Etiological Beliefs About Sexuality: Reader Responses to Cynthia Nixon's New York Times Interview
AN  - 2002462532
AB  - In 2012, the U.S. actress Cynthia Nixon was quoted in the New York Times Magazine as having stated that "for me, it [being gay] is a choice. I understand that for many people it's not, but for me it's a choice, and you don't get to define my gayness for me." The interview attracted international media attention and public criticism by lesbian and gay activists. This article suggests a rhetorical approach to understanding etiological beliefs and provides a discursive analysis of 198 online comments by readers of Pink News, a gay news Web site that reported on Nixon's controversial interview. This article explores common arguments used in readers' comments about Nixon and examines the rhetorical construction of sexuality. The analysis examines three themes within the data. First, biological essentialism was treated by many readers as common knowledge; second, readers suggested that only bisexuals have "choice"; and, third, it was suggested by both Nixon's critics and her supporters that counterarguments colluded with homophobia. The article suggests that there is an ideological dilemma whereby both "born-this-way" and "choice" arguments can be understood as colluding with anti-gay prejudice.

T1  - A post-American world? Assessing the cognitive and attitudinal impacts of challenges to American exceptionalism
AN  - 1991990869
AB  - A number of voices have emerged in U.S. political discourse questioning the legitimacy of American exceptionalism, suggesting we are in a "post-American world." Our research examines the effects that political messages that explicitly challenge American exceptionalism can have on U.S. public opinion. Drawing upon social identity theory, we find that explicit challenges to American exceptionalism significantly impact Americans' views toward their own nation, their willingness to denigrate foreign publics, and their broader foreign policy preferences.

T1  - The devil is not in the detail: representational absence and stereotyping in the 'Trojan Horse' news story
AN  - 1952104196
AB  - Using content analysis, this study investigated the coverage of the Trojan Horse news story aiming to ascertain whether its representation by the British press emphasized 'Islamist extremism' over 'poor school governance'. The sample coverage was extracted from five national newspapers and ranged from 9 June (the date of release of the Ofsted Advice Note) to 26 June 2014. Our analysis shows that the coverage reported evidence of Islamist ideology much more frequently (61.5%) than evidence of poor governance (38.5%). This suggests that the Trojan Horse news story was predominantly represented as a case of Islamist extremism and therefore covered in an unbalanced manner. Such a partial coverage relied on ideological dualisms and negative stereotypes to represent Islam and Muslims, and on the textual strategy of selecting some features (extremism) whilst omitting others (governors' professional misconduct). This bias has arguably diverted attention away from systemic problems within the national school system whilst reinforcing Islamophobic discourses.

T1  - Professors-in-Training or Precarious Workers? Identity, Coalition Building, and Social Movement Unionism in the 2015 University of Toronto Graduate Employee Strike
AN  - 1979383717
AB  - In this article, I argue that graduate employees took on the political identity of precarious workers who face job insecurity and income insecurity, drawing attention to the casualization of work in the academic labor market in Canada, and the cost of undertaking graduate studies in Canadian universities. Their argument appealed to media, faculty, undergraduate students, and supportive media, which was key to building solidarity and public support for graduate employees' struggle. Building on social movement unionism literature, I show how this identity moved the debate away from the bargaining table and into broader coalition building, suggesting a broader social movement unionism among academic workers.

T1  - Dating in the Time of #BlackLivesMatter: Exploring Mixed-race Women’s Discourses of Race and Racism
AN  - 2406943625
AB  - The author explores the discourses and logics that self-identified multiracial and multiethnic female online daters use to explain their own responses to social justice movements around race and racism in the United States. These women mobilize stances on the social movement Black Lives Matter (BLM) as a metric of racial progressiveness, articulating their own political views on race. Furthermore, mixed-black women in particular describe using attitudes toward the BLM movement as a way to vet potential dating partners. The implementation of BLM as a tool in the contemporary dating “toolkit” suggests that the language around, and produced by, social movements (in terms of mainstream media coverage) influences the ways in which some women discuss race, gender, and racism. Using interview data from 30 in-depth interviews, the author shows how mixed-race women navigate racial politics on an interpersonal level during a time when U.S. media and popular culture is focused on issues of racism and state-sanctioned violence. The use of BLM as a rhetorical frame demonstrates how far the logics of colorblindness and antiblackness extend into everyday life and serves as a signifier of where individuals stand on significant social issues. By analyzing the ways multiracial women talk about dating, the author provides a greater understanding of the shifting meanings of race, racism, and the “postracial” in contemporary American society.

T1  - A Test of Interactive Narrative as a Tool Against Prejudice
AN  - 1952106468
AB  - Interactive narratives allow audience members control over characters and unfolding plots. The present study tested exposure effects of an interactive narrative in which audience members adopt the perspective of an immigrant illegally crossing into the United States from Mexico. Results suggested that exposure to the interactive narrative engendered positive affect toward Mexicans in the U.S., which predicted support for social services that would benefit Mexican immigrants. Participants' enjoyment also positively predicted affect and support for social services benefiting Mexican immigrants. Results suggest interactive narratives may be effective tools in helping reduce prejudice toward marginalized social groups.

T1  - Immigrant perpetrators in the news: A terror management approach to resultant hostility, perceived vulnerability, and immigration issue judgment
AN  - 2013187444
AB  - This study found that mortality salience in TV news activated more hostile attitude toward the perpetrators and negative judgment on the immigration issue. Social group difference influenced news viewers' immigration issue judgment, but did not affect their resultant hostility and perceived vulnerability. More negative attitudes emerged toward the immigration issue when immigrant perpetrators were portrayed negatively in the news. News viewers with exposure to mortality salience in TV news reported more negative toward immigrants. Exposure to mortality-related elements in TV news could lead to social conflicts that were viewed as a severe threat by U.S. government and policymakers.

T1  - Declining News Media Viewership and the Survival of Political Disagreement
AN  - 2502806581
AB  - As news viewership has declined in recent years, concerns over the consequences of this phenomenon for democracy have increased. Theories of communication networks and news media effects suggest that accessing self-selected news sources preserves disagreement, whereas interacting with like-minded discussants homogenizes the preferences of members. This study addresses how the level of perceived disagreement within one’s networks of political discussion can be maintained when an increasing number of citizens grow disinterested in acquiring political information. Using a series of agent-based simulations with a macro–micro theoretical framework and John Zaller’s (1992) axioms as their basis, this study concludes that, if voters continue to “tune out,” the number of citizens who perceive network heterogeneity will decrease.

T1  - Encountering Misrecognition: Being Mistaken for Being Muslim
AN  - 1904811374
AB  - Exploring both debates about misrecognition and explorations of encounters, this article focuses on the experiences of ethnic and religious minority young people who are mistaken for being Muslim in Scotland. We explore experiences of encountering misrecognition, including young people's understandings of, and responses to, such encounters. Recognizing how racism and religious discrimination operate to marginalize people-and how people manage and respond to this-is crucial in the struggle for social justice. Our focus is on young people from a diversity of ethnic and religious minority groups who are growing up in urban, suburban, and rural Scotland, 382 of whom participated in forty-five focus groups and 224 interviews. We found that young Sikhs, Hindus, and other south Asian young people as well as black and Caribbean young people were regularly mistaken for being Muslim. These encounters tended to take place at school, in taxis, at the airport, and in public spaces. Our analysis points to a dynamic set of interconnected issues shaping young people's experiences of misrecognition across a range of mediatized, geopoliticized, and educational spaces. Geopolitical events and their representation in the media, the homogenization of the south "Asian" community, and the lack of visibility offered to non-Muslim ethnic and religious minority groups all worked to construct our participants as "Muslims." Young people demonstrated agency and creativity in handling and responding to these encounters, including using humor, clarifying their religious affiliation, social withdrawal, and ignoring the situation. Redressing misrecognition requires institutional change to ensure parity of participation in society.

T1  - Wounded Detachments: Cronulla, Social Memory and the Injuries of Racism
AN  - 1923057379
AB  - More than a decade since the Cronulla Riots, it could be argued that we are none the wiser about what they meant. Frequently evoked in public discourse, 'Cronulla' has become a benchmark for the worst of Australian society (whether that is seen as racism or multiculturalism). This paper reflects upon the representation of the Riots to explore three key ideas. First, we need to think about Cronulla through an exploration of the situated processes of social memory. There is no single 'meaning' of the Riots. In fact, the symbolic place of 'Cronulla' in public discourse is a contested space in which competing interests, processes and perspectives are at stake. Second, social memory is a complex and dispersed architecture of remembering and forgetting, but analysis typically focuses on the institutional and collective dimensions of social memory at the expense of other domains. Third, and drawing on some of the theoretical literature, we explore a different kind of memory that is forgotten in political and media representations of Cronulla - the embodied memory resulting from the injuries of racism experienced by those of Middle Eastern background. We see Cronulla entailing a violent and existential threat which detaches them from full belonging in Australia.

T1  - Terrorism as Ritual Process and Cultural Trauma: a Performative Analysis of ISIS’s Attacks in Europe
AN  - 1914861413
AB  - Social sciences studied terrorism focussing mainly on causes, processes of recruitment, relationships with media and new media, propaganda. At the same time, Italian and European public opinion gave voice almost exclusively to military, political and economic analysis. Sociological reflection on Islamist terrorism focussed itself almost exclusively on the religious aspect of radicalisation of Islam, spending little efforts to widen the analytic perspective to the effects of ISIS actions on the (re)definition of the identity and the collective memory of the targeted nation. This article will offer a different point of view, providing a cultural sociological reading of Paris Attacks, aimed at understanding its performative aspects. We will approach Paris Attacks as an example of social drama (Turner, 1982) and will focus on the ritual efforts spent by France to manage, repair and define the cultural trauma (Alexander et al., 2004) deriving from the attacks. Data will consist of a performative analysis of ISIS's strategy in Europe and of the counter-terrorist demonstration held in Paris on the 9th of January 2015; and of a frame analysis of the speech pronounced by Francois Hollande on November 16th 2015, after the Paris attacks, and of all the articles published on the main French newspapers during the first week after the events. In the conclusions, we will discuss how those events help to conceive a new kind of cultural trauma that is typical of the age of weak events and of distrust in public institutions.

T1  - Direct, extended, and mass-mediated contact with immigrants in Italy: their associations with emotions, prejudice, and humanity perceptions
AN  - 1883989487
AB  - Two correlational studies investigated the associations between different forms of intergroup contact, on the one hand, and Italians' prejudice and humanity attributions toward immigrants in Italy, on the other. Study 1 examined the effects of direct contact, extended contact, and parasocial contact through mass-media, assessing separately contact through TV news and newspapers and contact through entertainment programs. Study 2 analyzed the distinct effects of positive and negative episodes of the contact forms considered in Study 1. Across the studies, we tested the mediational role of intergroup anxiety, empathy, and trust. Overall, results showed the importance of taking into account different forms of contact and considering the emotional processes during contact experiences to understand intergroup attitudes.

T1  - Explaining the role of character development in the evaluation of morally ambiguous characters in entertainment media
AN  - 2063751002
AB  - The current project aims at better understanding how narrative characteristics in stories function in the liking, moral evaluation, and enjoyment of narratives featuring morally ambiguous characters (MACs). Shafer and Raney (2012) found that viewers differently enjoyed a heroic versus MAC-centered narrative. Building on this approach, a mixed-method design was used to investigate character development in two morally ambiguous narratives. Results of both a qualitative content analysis and an experiment provide support for the claim that character development is a central mechanism to explain viewer responses to MACs in narrative content. Thus, this study provides new directions for understanding characters in media research.

T1  - Political Expression on Social Media: The Role of Communication Competence and Expected Outcomes
AN  - 2342337922
AB  - The use of social media sites for political expression has added a new layer to the study of political discussion. In this type of user-generated content applications, interpersonal and mass-mediated types of communication converge in one medium. Therefore, in this study, we bring together insights from interpersonal communication theories and mass communication models that predict online expression, adding explanatory power to this form of political participation. Specifically, we contribute to the understanding of social media political expression by examining the influence of communication competence and expected outcomes on expressive behaviors. Results of a representative survey of the adult urban population of Colombian Facebook (n = 598) and Twitter (n = 185) users, suggest that social media communication competence and expected status, novelty, and social outcomes influence political expression on social media. Furthermore, users’ social media political expression expected outcomes through Facebook and Twitter differ. This study illustrates the important role that interpersonal communication factors have for social media political discussion, and the difference between users’ expectations when they express their political views through different social media platforms.

AB  - This paper combines corpus linguistics and critical discourse analysis methodologies in order to investigate the discourses and cyber activism of the British right-wing nationalist party, Britain First. A study of a corpus of texts produced by elite members of the group reveals a racist, xenophobic stance which constructs Islam and Muslims as the radical, dangerous ‘Other’. This creates a discourse of fear that threatens the way of life of the indigenous in-group of the British people. An investigation of the cyber activity of the group demonstrates that Britain First is able to achieve a significant amount of following on social media by publishing populist material that veils their true nature or ideological stance.

T1  - A critical discourse analytic approach to discursive construction of Islam in Western talk shows: The case of CNN talk shows: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1857961330
AB  - The present research aimed at examining the discourse of CNN as a mainstream media, through the application of critical discourse analysis. The goal of this research was to uncover CNN's orientation in covering Muslim-related issues and to uncover how the elements described by van Dijk (2001) play their role in constructing the discourses of Islamophobic ideologies in CNN's talk shows. To this end, an analysis was conducted at two textual and contextual levels, including 34 programs, out of 50 GPS talk shows aired in 2013. The textual analysis was done regarding the three levels of meaning, argumentation, and style and the contextual analysis with regards to levels of access and participants. The findings revealed that CNN's representation of Muslim-related issues was biased and stereotypical at all levels; textual and contextual and the scope of the talk show was in line with the Islamophobic ideologies which prevail the Western media today.

T1  - What's in a frame? A comparative content analysis of American, British, French, and Russian news articles: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1845084086
AB  - Drawing on the agenda-setting and framing literature, this quantitative content analysis examines how le Figaro, the Daily Telegraph, the New York Times, and the Moscow Times covered the Syrian war before and after the chemical weapon attack of 21 August 2013. Overall, the nationalization frame was most frequent, followed by the responsibility and conflict frames. Despite the large impact of the conflict, the morality, human interest, and economic impact frames were hardly present. Although all newspapers followed a similar pattern, the Daily Telegraph was the most heavily framed. Moreover, the stories barely provided any context while discussing several solutions largely in keeping with the suggestions of the governments. These findings raise questions about the neutrality of the newspapers and their impact on public opinion.

T1  - “You Need to Be Sorted Out With a Knife”: The Attempted Online Silencing of Women and People of Muslim Faith Within Academia
AN  - 2342302898
AB  - Academics are increasingly expected to use social media to disseminate their work and knowledge to public audiences. Although this has various advantages, particularly for alternative forms of dissemination, the web can also be an unsafe space for typically oppressed or subordinated groups. This article presents two auto-ethnographic accounts of the abuse and hate academics researching oppressed groups, namely, women and people of Muslim faith, experienced online. In doing so, this article falls into four parts. The first section provides an overview of existing literature, particularly focusing on work which explores the violence and abuse of women and people of Muslim faith online. The second section considers the auto-ethnographic methodological approach adopted in this article. The third section provides the auto-ethnographic accounts of the author’s experiences of hate and abuse online. The final section locates these experiences within broader theoretical concepts, such as silencing, and considers possible implications of such online hate in both an academic context and beyond.

We thank all of the authors, with special thanks for Gregory Noble for bringing another critical lens to both the international workshop and this special issue. We also would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments, and Anick Vollebergh for her insightful reading for a draft of this introduction. We owe a great debt to Patterns of Prejudice editor Barbara Rosenbaum for her unfailing support, patience, adroit feedback and insightful editing, for which we say a big thank-you. Anouk de Koning's work that led to this special issue was supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) under Grant W 07.68.115.00, and by the European Research Council (ERC) under Grant 640074 (MigrantParents).

T1  - Supermadres, Maternal Legacies and Women's Political Participation in Contemporary Latin America
AN  - 1756475769
AB  - Elsa Chaney once argued that Latin American women turned to motherhood to justify their political participation. Now that Latin American women have gained unprecedented access to national-level office, we ask whether these cultural narratives of maternalism still condition female politicians' access to political power. Using public opinion data, media analysis, and elite interviews, we conceptualise four strategic frames deployed by elite women to justify their national-level political careers: the traditional supermadre, the technocratic caretaker, the macho minimiser, and the difference denier. We argue that while today's female politicians have developed diverse responses to maternalism, their access to public office remains profoundly shaped by structural constraints and cultural narratives that privilege traditional feminine ideals of caretaking.

T1  - BESIEGED FORTRESS SYNDROME? OCCUPATIONAL GROUP OF PHYSICIANS AND MEDICINE STUDENTS AND THE PROBLEM OF SOCIAL RECEPTION OF HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN POLAND
AN  - 1841145135
AB  - The paper refers to the problem of decline in public confidence in health care system in Poland. Impartial reports prove that mass media are keen on showing medical mistakes, corruption as well as other thrilling news. The memorable case of “skin-hunters” from Lodz seems to be a good example. This may create the critical public opinion on functionaries of health care system (especially on physicians). Surveys by CBOS show that many of Poles reckon that doctors are incompetent, do not interested in their work and unfair when treating patients. Malevolent public opinion and “scandal-oriented” media coverage should create an hostile environment for functioning of specific occupational groups in health care system. Does it lead to besieged fortress syndrome (meaning consolidation and mobilization of an own professional group, described as not guilty, but unfairly treated by inimical social/institutional surrounding)? In the paper – in the formula of case study – results of own survey among group of 151 physicians from Lodz and 228 students of Faculty of Military Medicine at Medical University of Lodz are investigated. The aim of the research was to identify opinions of physicians and medicine students on how medical occupations were perceived by Polish society. The collected empiric material allowed (at least partially) to verify the hypothesis of besieged fortress syndrome.

T1  - Water crisis in São Paulo: news coverage, public perception and the right to information
AN  - 1788483720
AB  - Based on materials published by different media outlets on the coverage of water crisis which affected the region of São Paulo in 2014 and on the concept of publizistikwissenschaft, this article seeks to evaluate the process of information construction in the public sphere. It appears that major media outlets embraced 'news' frameworks, while smaller and independent media adopted 'interpretative' frameworks. The former emphasized the problem of climate change and issues related to water consumption, while the latter stressed the lack of transparency of the state government and the sanitation company in managing the crisis and, together with social movements, they brought proposals and made demands. We conclude that although there was a process of extensive media coverage and public awareness of the problem of water supply, some aspects were silenced and that this process remained inadequate in terms of accounting for the structural causes involving security and the governance of water.

T1  - Migrant arrivals and deaths in the Mediterranean: what do the data really tell us?
AN  - 1762665208
AB  - When looking at numbers of arrivals and deaths in the Mediterranean, it is important to ask how robust the data are and what they represent. If people are to frame and inform more accurately the policy challenges facing Europe, it is crucial that data are of good quality and as complete as possible and that their limitations are fully understood. Headline figures suggesting that over 900,000 migrants arrived on the shores of Mediterranean countries in 2015 have captured the attention of media and policymakers. These arrivals data are calculated from official sources and are usually collected at borders. Data on migration are increasingly cited in the media and used to frame migration policy discussions in Europe. Because the way in which these data are presented is likely to have an influence on public perceptions of migration in Europe and on policymakers' responses, it is important that they are presented clearly and accurately.

T1  - Differential Learning in Communication Networks. Interpersonal Communication Moderating Influences of News Media Usage on Political Knowledge
AN  - 1757244257
AB  - This article explores how interpersonal political communication moderates the effect of news media usage on political knowledge; discussant heterogeneity, and expertise are further contingent factors. Using data from the Comparative National Elections Project, these interactive relationships are investigated in East and West Germany around the 1990 election in a comparative manner. The learning effects of media consumption are both reinforced and attenuated by frequent discussions: Reevaluating media content induces both clarity and confusion. And it is not simply that more interpersonal communication matters. Heterogeneous discussions (which provide information on the ''other side'' and contribute to a broad understanding of the political landscape) and political experts (who offer high-quality information) are most conductive to learning from media sources.

T1  - Techno-cultural opportunities: The anti-immigration movement in the Finnish mediascape
AN  - 1784145190
AB  - Horsti's article analyses how transformations in the media environment shaped the political success of the anti-immigration movement in Finland from 2003 to 2013. The qualitative textual analysis of blogs and mainstream media debates that relate to racism and the national populist Finns Party demonstrates how changes in the mediascape in general and in new media technology in particular have provided opportunities for the emerging anti-immigration movement. These changes facilitated the earlier development of the Finns Party but the fragmentation of online space later hindered the internal coherence of the movement and its integration into the populist party political family. In order to regain unity, the Finns Party performed the public scapegoating of individuals for racist speech, thus distancing itself from racism. Horsti shows that, rather than being isolated and marginal, the anti-immigration movement and the 'uncivil' public sphere overlap with traditional politics and the mainstream media.

T1  - The Asymmetry of Nationalist Exclusion and Inclusion: Migration Policy Preferences in Russia, 2005-2013*
AN  - 1705245607
AB  - Objective 
The study investigates sources of asymmetry between individual attitudes toward nationalist inclusion and exclusion--focusing on why public support in Russia for deporting all migrants remained about the same from 2005 to 2013, while support for admitting all migrants significantly declined. 
Methods 
Data from surveys based on multistage random sampling of the adult population of the Russian Federation in 2005 (N = 579) and 2013 (N = 805) are subjected to multiple (OLS) regression analysis, in which support for deportation and admission of migrants are dependent variables and survey measures (with different specifications) of intergroup threat, competition, bias, contact, and the immigration security dilemma, as well as education and media exposure are the independent variables. 
Results 
Only two predictors consistently explained support for both inclusion and exclusion of migrants in Russia in both 2005 and 2013--perceived state strength and economic vulnerability. In every test, support for exclusion nonrandomly related to more predictors in the same model than support for inclusion. 
Conclusion 
In changing political and socioeconomic contexts exclusionist views are more persistent than inclusive views. Both measures need to be used in research on intergroup relations and nationalism. Otherwise, one is more likely to accept false positives while underestimating some significant enduring predictors.

T1  - Asylum, immigration and anti-racism - an interview with Amal Azzudin
AN  - 1885897709
AB  - The fight against asylum and immigration policies and their punitive impact on young people and their families was given high-profile media and political attention when the 'Glasgow Girls' at Drumchapel High School campaigned against the detention of one of their school friends in 2005. Amal Azzudin played a key role in fighting for her friend to be released from detention and, in the process, engaged with teachers, other pupils at Drumchapel High School, politicians and the media, raising awareness of the way in which asylum seekers without leave to remain were being treated. The campaign was instrumental in challenging mainstream attitudes and assumptions, and informing policy debates. Amal, in this piece, discusses the campaign and her continuing commitment to fighting against racism and inequality in all areas of society. She offers an insight into the successes that can be achieved when groups come together to fight against oppression in all its forms.

T1  - Teaching & Learning Guide for 'The Conflictual Model of Analysis in Studies on the Media Representation of Islam and Muslims: A Critical Review'
AN  - 1694605007
AB  - 'The Conflictual Model of Analysis in Studies on the Media Representation of Islam and Muslims: A Critical Review' was published in Sociology Compass 9/5 (2015) pp. 321-335, DOI: 10.1111/soc4.12264. This Teaching and Learning Guide is designed to accompany this article. In brief, the article examined the extent to which various studies on the media representation of Islam and Muslims use the conflictual model analysis that underpins theoretical frameworks, such as Orientalism, Clash of Civilisations, Cultural Racism and Islamophobia. It argued that in the context of a complex multicultural society, conflictual model of analysis is inadequate because it simply employs a binary way of thinking as clearly indicated in 'the West versus Islam' paradigm. In response to the inadequacy of this model of analysis, the article proposed an adoption of an alternative dialogical model of analysis in the light of the political theory of recognition. This guide provides useful information regarding the use of this article for teaching and learning purposes. It includes recommendation of readings, online resources, sample syllabus, focus questions and project idea.

T1  - What factors influence national image in disaster reports? Evidence from China
AN  - 1674194797
AB  - In recent years, terrible natural disasters erupt frequently on a global scale, and many countries attempt to create positive national images through disaster reports. However, there is no systematic evaluation model to measure whether the national image is successfully shaped through disaster reports. With the method of expert interviews and surveys, the study defined several levels of the primary factors that affect national image in disaster reports. In addition, using the method of analytic hierarchy process, we established the national image theoretical evaluation model in disaster reports, and determined the evaluation index weights.

T1  - 'I don't find it sexy at all': criminal investigators' views of media glamorization of police 'dirty work'
AN  - 1657418501
AB  - Public fascination with criminal detection has led to a plethora of images of investigational work in the media and to a radical reworking of public perceptions of the nature of the police investigator's role and of the occupation's dirty work elements. In this paper, we draw upon in-depth interviews with 31 Canadian police investigators to explore how they perceive the physically dirty elements of their job and their views related to the public treatment of those same elements as glamorous and exciting in the mass media. The investigators interviewed described how the daily realities of their work differ from the highly sanitised images presented in the media, although several noted that these portrayals led them to a career in policing. However, these investigators also explained that soon after entering the field they realised there is nothing glamorous or sexy about criminal investigation. Through a discussion of the contrasts between media portrayals of the physically dirty aspects of their jobs and police investigators' occupational realities, what is revealed is a far more complex portrait of police investigational work and what it is about this work that investigators themselves find to be exciting, satisfying and challenging.

T1  - Developing public support for human rights in the United Kingdom: reasserting the importance of socio-economic rights
AN  - 1667948511; 201510371
AB  - Public support for human rights in the UK remains limited, partly as a result of misleading media coverage, as well as political hostility. The UK Human Rights Act, in particular, has been under sustained attack and is now threatened by the Conservative Party's drive to repeal it. We analyse recent quantitative and qualitative data on public attitudes in order to learn how to increase public support for human rights practice and principles. The conclusion we reach is that, in order to increase support for human rights in the UK, a central objective should be to shift the focus of human rights discourse so that it better reflects the every-day concerns of the UK public. We consider that this would best be achieved through emphasising socio-economic rights. This could be an especially relevant strategy in the current austerity context which presents both opportunities and threats with regard to mobilising support for human rights.

T1  - Homohysteria: Useful Construct? Or an Unnecessary Splitting of Hairs?
AN  - 1680154409; 201517810
AB  - In this commentary to McCormack and Anderson (2014, this issue), I offer my reaction to a relatively new construct-homohysteria-that characterizes heterosexual men's negative attitudes and affective reactions toward gay men in the context of gendered (traditional) behaviors. I propose that similar to other forms of 'isms' used in both academia and the general community (e.g., racism, sexism), little is to be gained by continuing to splinter established terms such as heterosexism or homophobia. More specifically, I argue that by creating new terms for prejudice against gays and lesbians-terms that simply reflect either different degrees or motives of heterosexism-we risk muddling research findings and ultimately trivializing the pernicious phenomenon of prejudice and discrimination against the LGBT community. I also argue that in the absence of empirical support for the validity of homohysteria (as a distinct construct from heterosexism or homophobia), those embracing this new term are investigatively putting the cart before the horse.

T1  - Media, fear, and nuclear energy: A case study
AN  - 1660023475; 201506341
AB  - Although electricity generation technologies and safety have improved gradually over time, nuclear power, including generation facilities and waste repositories, are seemingly stigmatized in American culture. Contemporary literature has considered the impact of widely broadcasting nuclear accidents and how media coverage might alter public risk perceptions and in turn, U.S. nuclear policy. This paper discusses the vacillation of public support in recent decades and its ties to both media and scientific reporting. The analysis identifies how media coverage of accidents at Chernobyl, Three-Mile Island, and Fukushima overwhelmed scientific claims of safety and security in nuclear energy production. Additionally, the discussion considers how to bridge the information gap between scientists, citizens, and policymakers through increased knowledge dissemination. Finally, the implications of improved scientific communication in democratic policymaking processes are discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - The weight of words: the freedom of expression debate in Norway
AN  - 1542001773; 201426842
AB  - A confluence of interests and forces among Norwegian political, media and legal elites since the Rushdie affair and the 'Mohammed cartoon crisis' have created conditions in which minority protections against racist and discriminatory speech as guaranteed by Norwegian law, and Norwegian obligations under international law, have been rendered all but ineffective -- in the name of stronger protections for freedom of expression. In the event, Islamophobia and anti-Muslim racism have not only often gone unchallenged, but have been amplified and disseminated both through the extreme rightwing presence on the internet, and in mainstream and respected Norwegian print media. The ideology of Anders Breivik, perpetrator of the massacre of 22/7/2011, was not isolated, but forms part of a larger and by many accounts growing phenomenon. Successive government commissions on freedom of expression in Norway have only exacerbated this tendency. This article explores the philosophical and political underpinnings of the freedom of expression debate in Norway and warns about the threat to liberal democracy and equal citizenship from the sanitising and mainstreaming of virulent far-right racism and extremism.

T1  - How a New Issue Becomes an Owned Issue. Media Coverage and the Financial Crisis in Belgium (2008-2009)
AN  - 1559005722; 201432582
AB  - Classic issue ownership theory claims that voters link issues to political parties, and that the party holding the best reputation on the most salient issue at the time of election has a large chance of gaining the public's support (Budge & Farlie, 1983; Petrocik, 1996). But where does issue ownership come from? First, extant research showed that media coverage is a source for own8rship over issues (Aalberg & Jenssen, 2007; Walgrave & De Swert, 2007). When parties get the chance to address issues in the media, and when journalists talk about specific parties when covering a particular issue, a link between the party and the issue gets established. Second, because of the stable nature of an already claimed ownership, students of issue ownership have argued that mostly new or free-floating issues are subject to claiming by parties (Petrocik, 1996; Walgrave, Lefevere, & Nuytemans, 2009). Linking both arguments, we deal with the role of the mass media in establishing the ownership over a newly emerging issue. We draw on the natural experiment offered by the recent financial crisis hitting the world economy in 2008 -- 2009. In many respects, this crisis was a new phenomenon with banks on the edge of bankruptcy, the bailout of large corporations and banks, and the near collapse of entire countries. Some believe this crisis was of a nature we have not seen since the Great Depression of the thirties. It was a crisis that, next to the economy, affected every realm of the public sphere. The crisis was unexpected, and financial security, bailouts, and banking regulation were in most countries new issues that had not been on the political agenda in the preceding period. This research note examines the public's perception of the ownership over the issue of the financial crisis in Belgium (Flanders), compares it with issue ownership of other well-known issues in Belgium, and with the coverage of these issues in the Belgian news media. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Fighting Words: What's Wrong with Freedom of Expression?
AN  - 2076973876
AB  - In recent years, Norway has regularly been criticised by international anti-discrimination and anti-racism monitoring bodies for failing to curtail hate speech of a racist and/or discriminatory nature. The so-called 'racism paragraph' of the Norwegian General Penal Code, introduced in 1970, made such speech liable to criminal prosecution. Furthermore, the formal legal penalties for such speech, as well as the range of application of the legislation had if anything been increased and extended since 2005. Nonetheless, few prosecutions under the paragraph have been brought in recent years. Racist and/or discriminatory speech on the Internet has hardly been prosecuted, even if it is in these largely unregulated media that the problem is most visible. This article traces the shifting patterns of application of the Norwegian 'racism paragraph', and argues that as a result of extra-legal developments, Norway has moved in a more liberal and absolutist direction in relation to freedom of expression and its limits. This article advocates a modest defence of existing hate speech legislation in Norway and in western Europe, along the lines suggested by Jeremy Waldron.

T1  - Four facets of critical news literacy in a non-democratic regime: How young Russians navigate their news
AN  - 1531932875; 201424140
AB  - Fuelled by the Arab Spring, the question of how the rise of internet-mediated communication affects authoritarian regimes has received unprecedented attention within the discipline of communications. However, in this debate, scholars have not yet turned to the concept of literacy and addressed the role of citizens' knowledge about political media in any greater depth. This is surprising since the concept of literacy as 'emancipatory knowledge', in Sonia Livingstone's words, has a 'long and proud history' of being linked with processes of enlightenment, political empowerment and democratization. The present study contributes to filling this gap by suggesting four highly consequential facets of critical news literacy in contemporary Russia, a high-profile hybrid regime. The conceptual development is grounded in western literature and 20 in-depth interviews with young, urban and educated Russians. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - The Criminological Cultivation of African American Municipal Police Officers: Sambo or Sellout
AN  - 1728661098; 201535729
AB  - African American municipal police officers have been historically underrepresented and often face a double marginalization, arguably due to fellow officer and public perceptions. This study represents a first-step criminological cultivation analysis of the quantity and quality of African American municipal police officer depictions in the core cop film genre (1971-2011). Utilizing the unified film population identification methodology, 112 films were identified and examined to determine the overarching messages conveyed through the genre. Findings revealed that White officers were depicted in the lead or joint leading role in 89% (n = 100) and African Americans in 19% (n = 21) of films. However, White officers were predominantly depicted in a serious light unless sharing the lead with a minority, while African American officers were predominantly depicted in a comedic light. Further, the issue of double marginalization was rarely depicted. The potential implications of these portrayals on officer recruitment, retention, and perceived law enforcement legitimacy are discussed and second-step criminological cultivation studies to determine if a cultivation effect exists are proposed.

T1  - Interventions to Reduce Sexual Prejudice: A Study-Space Analysis and Meta-Analytic Review
AN  - 1542000591; 201428622
AB  - Sexual prejudice is an important threat to the physical and mental well-being of lesbians, gay men, and bisexual people. Therefore, we reviewed the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce such prejudice. A study-space analysis was performed on published and unpublished papers from all over the world to identify well-studied and underexplored issues. Most studies were conducted with North American undergraduates and were educational in nature. Dissertations were often innovative and well designed but were rarely published. We then performed meta-analyses on sets of comparable studies. Education, contact with gay people, and combining contact with education had a medium-size effect on several measures of sexual prejudice. The manipulation of social norms was effective in reducing antigay behavior. Other promising interventions, such as the use of entertainment media to promote tolerance, need further investigation. More research is also needed on populations other than American students, particularly groups who may have higher levels of sexual prejudice. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Heterosexual Men's Confrontation of Sexual Prejudice: The Role of Precarious Manhood
AN  - 1520342848; 201420699
AB  - Prejudice and discrimination are unfortunate common realities for sexual minorities yet people rarely confront such behavior (Dickter 2012). This is especially problematic because confronting prejudice is one of the most effective weapons against it (e.g., Czopp and Monteith 2003). The present study explores whether men who perceive manhood to be an impermanent state easily taken away by engaging in gender role violations (i.e., precarious manhood; Vandello et al. 2008) are less likely to react negatively to sexually prejudiced interaction partners and therefore less likely to confront sexual prejudice. In addition, we tested whether non-confrontation serves to affirm meta-perceptions of heterosexuality. To test this hypothesis, 88 heterosexual, young adult males, drawn from the undergraduate population of a university in the northeastern U.S., were randomly assigned to either pair with a confederate who expressed blatant sexual prejudice or no blatant prejudice toward a gay applicant in a hiring discussion. Consistent with predictions, precarious manhood predicted lower rates of confronting sexual prejudice, and less negative responses to their interaction partner, while confronting prejudice was associated with believing one would be viewed as gay regardless of individual differences in precarious manhood.

T1  - The Online Citizen: Is Social Media Changing Citizens' Beliefs About Democratic Values
AN  - 1680153665; 201514644
AB  - Social media websites are rapidly changing the way that Americans live and communicate with one another. Social media sites encourage individuals to constantly share information about one's self (and constantly seek information about others) that would have been private in the past. This experience can alter how an individual views the world in ways that political scientists have not been able to fully capture. In a cross-sectional survey of the American public I find a strong correlation between the use of Facebook and personal blogs and support for civil liberties. Individuals who spend more time self-publicizing on the Internet seem to value freedom of expression more, but also value the right to privacy less than individuals who use social media less often. This pattern suggests that technology may be altering American attitudes on basic democratic values and highlights the need for dynamic research designs that account for the causal effect Internet use may have on individual political development.

T1  - Climategate, Public Opinion, and the Loss of Trust
AN  - 1417525730; 201332729
AB  - Nationally representative surveys conducted in 2008 and 2010 found significant declines in Americans' climate change beliefs, risk perceptions, and trust in scientists. Drawing upon the Social Amplification of Risk Framework, this analysis empirically examines the impact of "climategate"-an international scandal resulting from the unauthorized release of emails between climate scientists in England and United States. The results demonstrate that "climategate" had a significant effect on public beliefs in global warming and trust in scientists. The loss of trust in scientists, however, was primarily among individuals with a strongly individualistic worldview or politically conservative ideology. Nonetheless, Americans overall continued to trust scientists more than other sources of information about global warming. Several other explanations for the declines in public understanding are also explored, including the poor state of the economy, a new administration and Congress, diminishing media attention, and abnormal winter weather.

T1  - The framing of climate change in Italian politics and its impact on public opinion
AN  - 1413391003
AB  - The article examines the issue of climate change and its importance to Italian politics. In particular, the authors analyse whether political parties and their leaders give due importance to the issues in their party literature and speeches. In order to investigate this phenomenon, the authors studied manifestos of those political parties represented in Parliament between 2008 and 2013, other official documents available on their websites and official statements of political leaders. The overall picture emerging is a substantial lack of attention paid to climate change, which is also poorly represented in the Italian media. One of the key problems, however, lies in what we define as the 'global' dimension of the climate change debate that makes it look unattractive to local political discourse (where Italian politics is traditionally rooted). We argue this impacts negatively on public opinion and the lack of Italian public policies aimed at ensuring sustainability and promoting good behaviour and environmental best practice.

T1  - <Brazilian Women> in the social imaginary in Portugal: an analysis of knowledge-building, power relations, and modes of subjectivation
AN  - 1622296660; 201440376
AB  - This article analyses  in the social imaginary in Portugal through the Foucaultian analytical triad 'knowledge-power-subjectivation', combined with feminist and de-colonial perspectives. The article begins with a retrospective genealogy of media and touristic discourses, based on interviews and documents, in order to unveil the knowledge-power discursive order in the image of . The second part analyzes subjectivations of Brazilian immigrant women in Portugal, drawing on interviews and participant observation, to unveil situations of prejudice and discrimination and shed light on how the women confront the discursive order by resisting and re-existing as subjects. According to the conclusions, Brazilian women are seen as a 'colonial body' to the extent that they are defined, essentialized, and stigmatized through characteristics attributed to them ever since the historical colonial period and related to hypersexuality. Three modes of subjectivation are identified by which these women resist stigma and re-exist: passive, affirmative, and combative resistance. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Armed Conflict: A Model for Understanding and Intervention
AN  - 1551002385; 201431349
AB  - Acts of deadly violence give rise to powerful emotions and trigger pre-programmed responses that often cause affected persons, including leaders, media, armed forces, and the general public, to act in ways that aggravate the situation and feed into cycles of violence. In this article, a model of the cycle of violence is presented that facilitates logical analysis and response. Starting from an act of deadly violence this model traces a series of interacting factors that can lead to armed conflict. These include distortions of perception and response that impact the public and their leaders. Negative codes, prejudices, and myths feed fear and grief, which may then escalate and lead to violent retaliation thereby triggering a similar response. Those professionals who care for bereaved individuals and families are familiar with these emotions and responses and are well qualified to analyze, explain, and support people affected by armed conflict. We suggest that they could also play educational and other important roles in reducing escalation and breaking the cycle of violence. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "Coming Clean" on Duty of Care: Australian Print Media's Representation of Male Versus Female Sex Offenders in Institutional Contexts
AN  - 1081613903
AB  - Public opinion about sexual abuse of minors is greatly shaped by mass media and the way individual cases are reported. This paper examines Australian print media's representation of sex offenders, focussing particularly on the sex of the offenders and aiming to shed light on some of the misconceptions and deep-rooted prejudices within the population at large. Given the multi-faceted nature of sexual offences, this paper focuses on sexual offences committed by both males and females against minors in the context of a companion breach of duty of care. In order to explore the effect that linguistic tools can have in the Australian print media's way of reporting sexual abuse cases, twenty-nine newspaper articles published in Australian dailies were selected for analysis. The analysis of these articles reveals a marked bias in the manner in which sexual offences perpetrated by males, as opposed to females, are reported, suggesting a male monopoly on sexual abuse. We argue that this biased representation, which hinders adequate profiling of sexual offences against minors, may stem from an androcentric view of sexuality and from the systematic denial of female agency when it comes to sex.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Positive Female Role-Models Eliminate Negative Effects of Sexually Violent Media
AN  - 1650148285; 201503755
AB  - Much debate has focused on the potential negative role of sexualized violent media on viewer attitudes toward women. One potential issue in previous literature is that depictions of sexuality and violence were confounded with subordinate depictions of female characters. The current study addressed this by randomly assigning young adults to watch either neutral media or sexually violent media with either subordinate or strong female characters. Women who watched sexually violent media were more anxious, and males who watched sexually violent media had more negative attitudes toward women, but only when female characters were subordinate. Sexual and violent content had no influence on viewer attitudes when strong female characters were present, suggesting these are not the crucial influence variables. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Violence Against Women in Video Games: A Prequel or Sequel to Rape Myth Acceptance
AN  - 1364700878; 201327530
AB  - Current research suggests a link between negative attitudes toward women and violence against women, and it also suggests that media may condition such negative attitudes. When considering the tremendous and continued growth of video game sales, and the resulting proliferation of sexual objectification and violence against women in some video games, it is lamentable that there is a dearth of research exploring the effect of such imagery on attitudes toward women. This study is the first study to use actual video game playing and control for causal order, when exploring the effect of sexual exploitation and violence against women in video games on attitudes toward women. By employing a Solomon Four-Group experimental research design, this exploratory study found that a video game depicting sexual objectification of women and violence against women resulted in statistically significant increased rape myths acceptance (rape-supportive attitudes) for male study participants but not for female participants.

T1  - The Iconic Ghetto
AN  - 1023026619; 201223768
AB  - In the minds of many Americans, the ghetto is where "the black people live," symbolizing an impoverished, crime-prone, drug-infested, and violent area of the city. Aided by the mass media and popular culture, this image of the ghetto has achieved an iconic status, and serves as a powerful source of stereotype, prejudice, and discrimination. The history of racism in America, along with the ascription of "ghetto" to anonymous blacks, has burdened blacks with a negative presumption they must disprove before they can establish mutually trusting relationships with others. The poorest blacks occupy a caste-like status, and for the black middle class, contradictions and dilemmas of status are common, underscoring the racial divide and exacerbating racial tensions.

T1  - Live Cattle Trade -- The Case of an Online Crisis
AN  - 1283637309; 201304350
AB  - This paper examines the 2011 live export cattle crisis and how the use of social media to express outrage forced the Australian Government to change its policy. The case is used to illustrate that social media is a powerful tool the government cannot ignore. We argue that social media is now a field where all stakeholders can engage in open and transparent debate with elected officials with a view to effecting change. For governments, crisis management must now include strategies for arguing their case in the court of public opinion online and engaging directly with stakeholders to influence the direction and duration of the crisis. When governments fail to respond and engage online, voters take action. This is nowhere better illustrated than when ABC Television's Four Corners program broadcast dramatic footage of Australian cattle being slaughtered in Indonesia contrary to government standards, creating a political, economic and social media storm. Large numbers of Facebook sites were created about this issue, seeking the cessation of exports. The federal government reacted to this pressure by temporarily banning live exports. This paper explores the role and power of social media in influencing crises and driving political change and decision making. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Legitimating war by victimization: state-corporate crime and public opinion
AN  - 887948278
AB  - This article argues that the ideological use of victimization helps legitimate the state-corporate crime of aggressive war. This contributes to the emerging criminology of war by offering a theoretical framework to better understand how state and corporate actors legitimate criminal military action. We argue that politicians and other elite figures promote a sense of national victimization that is amplified by the news media. We partially test our theory by measuring the association between the incidence of terror victimization ideas in the news and public support for the U.S. "war on terror." We find some evidence of relationships between our Terrorism Victimization Index and both victimization worry and aggressive war support.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Categorization and Communication in the Face of Prejudice: When Describing Perceptions Changes What Is Perceived
AN  - 925714254; 201204087
AB  - In the face of prejudice against an ingroup, common ground for communication exists when people use similar social categories to understand the situation. Three studies tested the hypothesis that describing perceptions of prejudice can fundamentally change those perceptions because communicators account for the common ground in line with conversational norms. When women (Study 1), African Americans (Study 2), and Americans (Study 3) simply thought about suspected prejudice against their ingroup, categorization guided their perceptions: Participants assimilated their views of the prejudiced event toward the perceptions of ingroup members but contrasted away from the perceptions of outgroup members. Conversely, when participants described their perceptions, they contrasted away from the given category information and actually arrived at the opposite perceptions as those who merely thought about the prejudiced event. Study 3 identified an important qualification of these effects by showing that they were obtained only when participants could assume their audience was familiar with the common ground. Implications are discussed for understanding the role of communication in facilitating and inhibiting collective action about prejudice. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Face-to-face versus telephone surveys on political attitudes: a comparative analysis
AN  - 861799621
AB  - Several researchers declared that the telephone survey reaches more accurate voting tendencies than the face-to-face surveys. Telephone survey shows numerous advantages compared to a face-to-face one but, however, the telephone survey also has some inconveniences. Among these it is important to highlight the scant quality of the sampling frame; absence of a telephone in some homes and the wide expansion of the mobile phone; low response rate of certain collectives and the overrepresentation of others. There are also some new barrierswhich make access more difficult (e.g. the automatic answering phone) and the saturation of the telephone medium because of the large amount of publicity activities which generate a large number of "unsuccessful" calls and interruptedinterviews. The objective of this paper is evaluating the adaptation of the telephone surveys in the electoral forecasts; in an attempt to see if it shows substantial improvements when they are compared to face-to-face interviews.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Racialized Media Coverage of Minority Candidates in the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary: PROD
AN  - 1928282225
AB  - This article investigates the prominence of racial content in newspaper stories about Barack Obama and three other candidates running in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primary. Content analyses of stories appearing in six national newspapers sought to ascertain how frequent racial references appeared in news accounts of the presidential contest, how salient the racial content was, and what factors explained race-related coverage. Consistent with previous studies, the presence of one or more racial minorities in the stories increased the likelihood and presence of racial references found in the story. However, results challenge the conventional wisdom that racial content is salient enough to serve as a prominent racial cue activating readers' or voters' negative racial prejudices. This study finds that more than any other factor, journalists' desire to heighten the election's competitiveness influenced the presence and degree of racial content present in stories.

T1  - Beck-Styled Liberation: Bulletpoints and Bromides
AN  - 862595611; 201109423
AB  - Over the past several months, much to the chagrin of my family and friends, I have daily tuned into Glenn Beck's television program. Admittedly, I do not engage in this activity because I share in his political opinions indeed, I regard most of them as anathema rooted in half-truths and wild associations. I also do not view Mr. Beck's show because he is, in the words of Sarah Palin, "America's professor." As an adjunct professor of theology at a major Catholic university, I find that a majority of his theses do not adhere to the most basic rules for logical argument building. Rather, I begrudgingly turn on Fox News at 5:00 p.m. because Beck has begun to position himself as a burgeoning theologian. His forays into religion are not new: during the 2008 campaign he attacked, with extreme prejudice, Rev. Jeremiah Wright and the United Church of Christ (UCC). But, as of late, he has turned his attention to liberation theology, a system of thought about which, as I explain below, his understanding is incorrect. Yet he is using his hours of daily radio and television time to unleash a vitriolic and irresponsible attack on liberation theology, positioning it as a politico-religious palimpsest masking a Marxist plot to take over the United States. This is not hyperbole on my part; Beck has made these claims repeatedly. Nevertheless, it is important to understand that Beck presents himself as a political commentator and not a fledgling religion critic; his true intention is to lambast President Barack Obama because Obama is un-American. In many ways, Beck is unabashed about this goal. He has said several times since his August 28, 2010 "Restoring Honor Rally" that he "is not attacking anyone's faith," but just wants to understand what is happening to his country. This sentiment is belied by his actions; indeed, he is attacking the faith of President Obama. And as a follower of liberation theology and a member of the UCC, my own faith is assailed. While I would be a nebbish defender of Obama's political accomplishments, as a published theologian I feel called to enter into the fray of the current religious debate.

AN  - 1928307020
AB  - The authors argue that to compare Islamophobia with anti-Semitism is not to equate them. But finding some parallels might help German society to combat a growing and dangerous anti-Muslim racism.

T1  - The BSE Crisis in German Newspapers: Reframing Responsibility
AN  - 1322716804; 201312794
AB  - The 2000/2001 German BSE crisis unfolded as a public drama where awkward crisis management and political attacks on industrial agriculture sparked intense, prolonged media coverage. Mediatisation and politicisation of BSE went hand in hand. In the process, responsibilities for problems and solutions were socially constructed. A high level of press coverage and a policy turnabout (Agrarwende) became mutually reinforcing, according to our analysis of more than 5,000 articles from five national German quality newspapers. Politicians had a prominent standing but did not dominate the BSE discourse; speakers from civil society, the private sector and the media had a relatively good 'standing'. Before the policy change, consumers appeared as the main victims in the media, while afterwards it was agriculture. Throughout the crisis, politicians were mostly blamed as problem causers and to a far lesser degree business and agriculture. Politicians were also overwhelmingly framed as problem solvers, far more than science, agriculture, business and consumers. As the new policy unfolded, more issue frames were articulated, suggesting that the debate shifted from BSE to the general direction of agriculture policy and the distribution of subsidies, but also to the relation between nature and technology and to a lesser degree the relation between food and consumers. Localisation and globalisation of food and international issues played minor roles. In the context of wider research on mass media and public opinion, the case study shows how media coverage tends to politicise food hazards. Food scares offer high news values and attract wide audiences. While industrial agriculture received much blame, major responsibility was attributed to the political system.

T1  - Questioning the Obvious: Political Events and Public Opinion on the Government's Standing in Germany 1977-2003
AN  - 1018347210; 201213355
AB  - It is well-known that events influence the standing of the governing parties. Still, important questions remain unanswered: Which characteristics are necessary for an event to have an impact? Why should voters care about events and which role does the mass media play? How are other influences on government popularity affected by the occurrence of events? To answer these questions a model of German government popularity containing the economic situation and events, selected by addressed criteria, will be advanced and tested by means of time-series regression. The results show that events have an impact on government popularity and are able to repress real-world influences. This effect is rather short-lived and does not cover all events which are normally perceived as influential. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Entrapping Christian and Muslim Arabs in Racial Cartoons in Australia: The Other Anti-Semitism
AN  - 822925100
AB  - Racial Cartoons are a powerful force disguised as entertainment operating to shape public opinion. During the 1980s, 1990s and after 9/11 in 2001, cartoons in the Australian press were particularly directed against Muslim and Christian Arabs without remorse or fear of redress or accountability. The offensive of such cartoons has essentially been directed on three fronts -- oil, politics and religion. The drawback resulting from socio-cultural, historical and other differences are no doubt visible; but equally obvious is that anti-Semitism, which was directed against the Jews in the 1930s and 1940s, is today mostly directed against the public relations deprived, opinion silenced and undemocratically governed, ethnically diverse Arabs. It is argued in this paper that several forces were behind such distorted visual strategies adopted by the Australian press. Pre-judgement stemming from an inbuilt bias of the cartoonist, or highlighting characteristics which conform to the national interest are likely factors. The debate in Australia as to whether public images and attitudes of a minority "cause" or "determine" policy or whether policy itself changes attitudes is still resting with the jury.

T1  - Popular Punitivism -- The Role of the Courts in the Development of Criminal Justice Policies
AN  - 1933206858
AB  - Abstract 
This paper was presented as a keynote address to the Annual Conference of the Australian and New Zealand Society of Criminology in 2009. It contends that it is of the utmost importance that the community have the benefit of empirical research and analysis undertaken in the field of criminal justice by impartial experts. Its central proposition is that the development of policy and sentencing practices in this important area appears to be influenced more by the perception of populist views, than the scientific evaluation of empirical data.

T1  - The "Childhood Obesity Epidemic": Health Crisis or Social Construction?
AN  - 848720310; 20420299
AB  - There has been a meteoric rise over the past two decades in the medical research and media coverage of the so-called global childhood obesity epidemic. Recently, in response to this phenomenon, there has been a spate of books and articles in the fields of critical sociology and cultural studies that have argued that this "epidemic" is socially constructed, what Natalie Boero (2007) dubs a "postmodern epidemic." As an anthropologist who has studied child nutrition and obesity in relation to poverty and the school environment, I am concerned about both the lack of reflexivity among medical researchers as well as critical scholars' treatment of the problem as entirely socially constructed. In this article I present both sides of this debate and then discuss how we can attempt to navigate a middle course that recognizes this health issue but also offers alternative approaches to those set by the biomedical agenda.

T1  - Beyond Orientalism
AN  - 60351706; 201013169
AB  - Factors beyond the control of journalists and media organizations are essential in the construction of news about the Middle East. Ideology plays a role and so do ignorance and prejudice, but even when as a correspondent one knows the local language and is hypersensitive to the pitfalls of ethnocentrism and orientalism, still the coverage one produces often reinforces stereotypes. The cause seems to lie in the dilemmas inherent in the collection and representation of information, in particular in non-western, non-democratic contexts. A solution may be to embrace rather than obscure these dilemmas but this requires a fundamental rethink of what news is, both on the part of journalists and of audiences.
