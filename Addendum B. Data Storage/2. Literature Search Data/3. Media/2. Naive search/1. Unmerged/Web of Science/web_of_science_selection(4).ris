AB  - This essay analyses the French film 120 BPM (Campillo 2017) in relation to its aesthetics and critical reception in the context of scientific advances in human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) therapy, as well as revised socio-cultural attitudes towards, and political strategies for dealing with the disease. It argues that the treatment trajectory of the virus has been parallelled by a transition in the way that the disease is both represented and received in media, film, and television. This is because advances in therapy and understanding of the disease now render it much less threatening, and, although AIDS remains a serious public health concern in certain regions, public attitudes towards the virus have correspondingly shifted. Such a refocusing reverberates in the visual style of 120 BPM, particularly its cinematography and framing, which consistently positions the spectator amidst the HIV/AIDS community. Although the film focuses on a period in the 1990s when survival rates were still low and death rates rising, it was paradoxically released at a time of relative optimism regarding the prognosis for HIV/AIDS, and thus presents a more upbeat narrative that achieved widespread critical acclaim.

AB  - In response to the widely publicized failure of most pollsters to predict the winner of the Bangkok governor election on 3 March 2013, this study examined the published results of opinion polls in the news media to see how they had affected the voter preference and what errors existed. The study analyzed a series of poll results by five major pollsters for the pre-election and exit polls during the governor election campaign from January to March 2013 and, then, compared them with the final results of governor election. The poll results lent partial support to the spiral of silence theory. Among all pollsters, only NIDA Poll projected the right prediction for Democrat candidate M. R. Sukhumbhand Paribatra as the winner. Its pre-election polls showed his final victory occurring in the last leg of the election campaign as a result of the late swing voters against the ruling Pheu Thai Party attaining monopoly on power. Suan Dusit and Abac Polls showed the existence of the bandwagon effect for Pheu Thai candidate Pol. Gen. Pongsapat Pongcharoen. Besides their polling effects, major factors accounting for errors included shy Democrat factor, late swing of voters, sampling error, and nonresponse bias.

AB  - Direct exposure to traumatic events often precipitates sleep disorders. Sleep disturbance has also been observed amongst those indirectly exposed to trauma, via mass media. However, previous work has focused on traditional media use, rather than contemporary social media. We tested associations between both traditional and social media consumption and insomnia symptoms following 2015 terror attacks in Paris France, controlling for location and post-traumatic symptomology. 1878 respondents, selected to represent the national French population, completed an internet survey a month after the Bataclan attacks (response rate 72%). Respondents indicated different media use, post-traumatic stress and insomnia. Controlling for demographics, location and PTSD, insomnia was associated with both traditional (beta 0.10, P =.001) and social media use (beta 0.12, P =.001). Associations between social media and insomnia were independent of traditional media use. Interventions targeted at social media may be particularly important following mass trauma.

AB  - Social media posts incorporate real-time information that has, elsewhere, been exploited to predict social trends. This paper considers whether such information can be useful in relation to crime and fear of crime. A large number of tweets were collected from the 18 largest Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, over a period of 70 days. These tweets are then classified as being crime-related or not and additional information is extracted, including the type of crime and where possible, any geo-location at a city level. From the analysis of collected data, it is established that around 15 out of every 1000 tweets have text related to a crime, or fear of crime. The frequency of tweets related to crime is then compared against the number of murders, the murder rate, or the level of fear of crime as recorded in surveys. Results show that, like mass media, such as newspapers, social media suffer from a strong bias towards violent or sexual crimes. Furthermore, social media messages are not highly correlated with crime. Thus, social media is shown not to be highly useful for detecting trends in crime itself, but what they do demonstrate is rather a reflection of the level of the fear of crime.

AB  - Using a data set of 2,968 articles collected from 22 different newspapers in Turkey, this article maps media responses to the ongoing Gulf Crisis. In doing so, we deploy a pioneering methodology derived from natural language processing and correspondence analysis to test whether categorical variables such as political affiliation, ownership, and ideological outlook had any impact on how a news publication covered the Gulf Crisis. In the results and interpretation sections, we attempt to connect our findings to broader discussions on agenda setting, framing, and building consent. Based on our analysis, we propose the following conclusions: (a) Political affiliation, ownership structure, and the ideological outlook all had unique effects on how a publication covered the Gulf Crisis, (b) the progovernment press embarked on a campaign to sway public opinion about the government's decision to side with Qatar. The dimensions of this campaign strongly resembled an executive act of consent manufacturing, and (c) corporate-owned news organizations were the driving force shaping both the public agenda and the dominant framing of the Gulf Crisis in the Turkish mediascape.

AB  - The present academic literature hosts volumes of information on Muslim anti-Semitism, while Jewish anti-Islamism is hardly mentioned. With the aim of filling this scholarly gap, the article deals with contemporary Jewish anti-Islamism, principally focusing on Zionism's role in such anti-Islamism, by delving into the existing literature, news media, and online sources. Since the very birth of Zionism, Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims and, finally, Islam itself have primarily been seen as "obstacles" to Zionist goals. The "chosenness," "promised lands," and "messianism" doctrines at the core of Zionism have led to the antagonization of the aforementioned. There appears to be a blatant overlap between anti-Islamism and Jewish voices in the media, the entertainment sector, popular bookshops, foundations, academia, think-tanks and the virtual world. Finally, pro-Israel influences in the West have catalyzed negativity about Islam and Muslims and propagated wars through lobbying activities. Jewish anti-Islamism is real and needs further scholarly investigation.

AB  - This article examines the thermostatic responsiveness of EU public policy. It inquires into the conditions under which EU policy decisions are responsive to wavering public demands for policy change and how European citizens in turn respond to policy change. The main argument holds that the politicization of EU policy processes facilitates both public and policy responsiveness. My expectations are tested based on a novel database containing information on 15 EU policy issues (2010-2016). The analyses draw from panel data based on Eurobarometer polls and a large-scale content analysis of 5887 media statements in eight European news outlets. The results demonstrate that under politicized conditions, the adoption of EU policy decisions is preceded by increased public support and followed by decreased public support for EU policy change. The facilitating role of politicization is primarily triggered by the mobilization of civil society groups, while media salience and polarization are less consequential for responsiveness.

AB  - This study examines the dynamic, real-time interplay between the emotional content of political television ads and individuals' political attitudes during ad processing based upon the Dynamic Motivational Activation (DMA) theoretical framework. Time-series cross-sectional models were developed to test the effects of three motivational inputs of emotional ads (arousing content, positivity, and negativity) and viewers' evaluation of the featured candidates on four psychophysiological responses (heart rate, skin conductance level, corrugator electromyography, and zygomatic electromyography). As predicted by the DMA, physiological responses during ad viewing were affected by their own first- and second-order dynamic system feedback effects. These results not only support the predicted dynamic nature of the physiological system but also help disentangle message effects from the moderating and accumulating effects of the physiological system itself. Also as predicted, message motivational inputs interacted with viewers' political attitudes to determine psychophysiological responses to the ads. Supporters of opposing political candidates showed cardiac-somatic response patterns indicative of disparate attention to the advertised information. Attentional selectivity can be a critical component in determining how information processing influences campaign message reception and effects.

It found that public discussions on the microblogging site are mostly emotional. However, advanced reasoning was also present in emotional discussions, which manifested itself in making appeals to the common good and using logical coherence. Although emotion and rationality are not mutually exclusive, they do produce different retransmission outcomes, with emotion positively related to reposts and the appeal to the common good receiving fewer shares.

AB  - Introduction: Innovation has not only modified routines and professional profiles, but also raises questions about public legitimacy and the institutional character of journalism as a political actor with the emergence of new actors, such as digital platforms and their algorithms, and the reconfiguration of the communicative space. This article aims to present the foundations of the relationship between journalism and politics today, along with future trends. Methodology: It does so through a study developed in February 2020-February 2021 in Spain based on methodological triangulation that includes, in addition to the literature review, a survey of journalists, a survey of citizens and a panel of experts with researchers in the area. Discussion: The results confirm journalists as a filter between society and politics, although the citizens are critical. Conclusions: Some dangerous trends for democracy are revealed: the choice of media agenda items in political parties, low audience participation, the concealment of the importance of algorithms and digital platforms, and the high automation o information to influence public opinion and generate disinformation.

AB  - The popularization of microblogging in China represents a new challenge to the state's regime of information control. The speed with which information is diffused in the microblogosphere has helped netizens to publicize and express their discontent with the negative consequences of economic growth, income inequalities and official corruption. In some cases, netizen-led initiatives have facilitated the mobilization of online public opinion and forced the central government to intervene to redress acts of lower level malfeasance. However, despite the growing corpus of such cases, the government has quickly adapted to the changing internet ecology and is using the same tools to help it maintain control of society by enhancing its claims to legitimacy, circumscribing dissent, identifying malfeasance in its agents and using online public opinion to adapt policy and direct propaganda efforts. This essay reflects on microblogging in the context of the Chinese internet, and argues that successes in breaking scandals and mobilizing opinion against recalcitrant officials should not mask the reality that the government is utilizing the microblogosphere to its own advantage.

AB  - Everyday political talk, a significant type of political participation, is an important democratic activity. In this regard, the primary objective of this paper is to investigate the level of justification and knowledge in Indonesians' informal political talk on Facebook. While previous studies addressed different aspects of informal political discussions such as their impact on political knowledge, influence on public opinion expression and relationship with news media use, they do not provide guidelines for analysing the modality of them. This study proposes an analytical framework for examining the users' level of justification and knowledge. A qualitative content analysis reveals that only a small number of comments had a high level of justification and knowledge. In addition, some indications of the influence of Indonesian mainstream news media content were found on people's arguments in discussions.

AB  - Attention given to the environment by the British public has fluctuated over recent decades. Having peaked in 2007 it declined, yet has recently risen dramatically. This raises questions about why public attention to the issue changes over time and to what extent this is driven by other actors and exogenous forces. This article examines these processes at the monthly level through a system of simultaneous equations. Methodologically, protest is an important confounding factor when analysing the relationship between media and public salience. Substantively, protest itself can be predicted by prior public attention, but in turn, can be successful in increasing broader environmental salience.

AB  - While scholars have long recognized that social networks impact political engagement for partisans, comparatively little work has examined the role of networks for independent voters. In this article, we contribute to existing research on social networks and politics by surveying Arizona registered voters about their political persuasion, personal networks, and media consumption habits. Our findings show that independents have networks that are structurally different from partisans. Specifically, we found that both Democrat and Republican respondents were more likely to frequently talk about politics with independents than with members of the opposing party. Independents were also less likely than partisans to end a friendship over a political dispute. Taken together these findings show that independents may be frequent and reliable discussion partners for partisans and may be able to moderate political views. We find evidence for the moderating force of independents is especially apparent in the media consumption habits of Republican respondents.

AB  - The present article is devoted to the issues of public opinion manipulation in the post-Covid era. Within the framework of the study, the author introduces the concept of "pseudo-authority" which is defined as a rhetorical strategy used by journalists with the aim of the manipulation of the Internet news reports that contain either appeals to non-experts' opinions or no indication of the authoritative source of knowledge so that the information is perceived by the audience as the truth and does not require evidence. The study is also focused on the distinction between appeals to authority and pseudo-authority, which is vital for developing skills of media literacy. Through the discourse analysis of the news stories about the Russian vaccine "Sputnik V" extracted from highly circulated British and American online newspapers, it is revealed that there are three main types of appeals to pseudo-authorities in Internet news discourse: appeals to "nominal" and "implicit" pseudo-authorities as well as appeals to "pseudo-visibility". The study found that these appeals are used with the aim of political decision-making, enhancing or discrediting the image of the country as well as polarizing social groups in digital information warfare. The results of the research can be applied in the fields of linguistics, political and media studies.

AB  - Purpose
   Citizen journalism practices through social networking sites are increasingly becoming an imperative source of public opinion formation. Given the increase in the volume of information sharing on social media during COVID-19, this study aims to grasp the largely unknown interaction of the individual's trust in citizen journalism practices and public perception formulation. Drawing on this idea, the study has twofold objectives: first, to examine the influence of user-generated information about economic policies of government during COVID-19 as the antecedent of public perception about government performance and second, to identify the moderating role of trust in citizen journalism practices during COVID-19 through social networking sites.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study used a survey method and a sample of 464 adults were collected through an online administrated questionnaire.
   Findings
   The findings specify that user-generated content that is pro-government economic policies during COVID-19 positively influenced the perception of government performance. On the other hand, user-generated information that criticized government economic policies had a negative influence on public perception.
   Originality/value
   This study seeks to intensify the understudied phenomenon of how nature and source of the information could interact to influence one's information processing during a crisis such as pandemic COVID-19. Furthermore, only a little research has been conducted in this area focusing on two mechanisms, namely; citizen journalism and trust in social media user-generated information about prevailing economic insecurities during crisis provided through citizen journalism.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 vaccine is considered to be the most promising approach to alleviate the pandemic. However, in recent surveys, acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine has been low. To design more effective outreach interventions, there is an urgent need to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines.
   Objective: Our objective was to analyze the potential of leveraging transfer learning to detect tweets containing opinions, attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward COVID-19 vaccines, and to explore temporal trends as well as automatically extract topics across a large number of tweets.
   Methods: We developed machine learning and transfer learning models to classify tweets, followed by temporal analysis and topic modeling on a dataset of COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets posted from November 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. We used the F1 values as the primary outcome to compare the performance of machine learning and transfer learning models. The statistical values and P values from the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test were used to assess whether users' perceptions changed over time. The main topics in tweets were extracted by latent Dirichlet allocation analysis.
   Results: We collected 2,678,372 tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines from 841,978 unique users and annotated 5000 tweets. The F1 values of transfer learning models were 0.792 (95% CI 0.789-0.795), 0.578 (95% CI 0.572-0.584), and 0.614 (95% CI 0.606-0.622) for these three tasks, which significantly outperformed the machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine). The prevalence of tweets containing attitudes and behavioral intentions varied significantly over time. Specifically, tweets containing positive behavioral intentions increased significantly in December 2020. In addition, we selected tweets in the following categories: positive attitudes, negative attitudes, positive behavioral intentions, and negative behavioral intentions. We then identified 10 main topics and relevant terms for each category.
   Conclusions: Overall, we provided a method to automatically analyze the public understanding of COVID-19 vaccines from real-time data in social media, which can be used to tailor educational programs and other interventions to effectively promote the public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.

TI  - Analyzing Online Sentiment to Predict Telephone Poll Results
T2  - CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING
LA  - English
AB  - The telephone survey is a common social science research method for capturing public opinion, for example, an individual's values or attitudes, or the government's approval rating. However, reducing domestic landline usage, increasing nonresponse rate, and suffering from response bias of the interviewee's self-reported data pose methodological challenges to such an approach. Because of the labor cost of administration, a phone survey is often conducted on a biweekly or monthly basis, and therefore a daily reflection of public opinion is usually not available. Recently, online sentiment analysis of user-generated content has been deployed to predict public opinion and human behavior. However, its overall effectiveness remains uncertain. This study seeks to examine the temporal association between online sentiment reflected in social media content and phone survey poll results in Hong Kong. Specifically, it aims to find the extent to which online sentiment can predict phone survey results. Using autoregressive integrated moving average time-series analysis, this study suggested that online sentiment scores can lead phone survey results by about 8-15 days, and their correlation coefficients were about 0.16. The finding is significant to the study of social media in social science research, because it supports the conclusion that daily sentiment observed in social media content can serve as a leading predictor for phone survey results, keeping as much as 2 weeks ahead of the monthly announcement of opinion polls. We also discuss the practical and theoretical implications of this study.

AB  - Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become a global hot topic in recent years. However, few studies have paid close attention to the effect of admission into the rich list of actual controllers on CSR fulfillment. Admission to that list is a "natural experiment" and attracts media attention to the listed rich and the companies they control. Consequently, that inclusion influences the personal and corporate reputation of the listed rich and their companies. To explore the effect of admission to the rich list on CSR and the related action mechanism, data regarding admission to the list and the social responsibility of listed companies actually controlled by the listed rich from 2010-2017 were selected. The PSM-DID (Propensity Score Matching and Differences-in-Differences) method and mediating effect model were used to empirically test the effect of admission to rich list on the CSR fulfillment of companies on the list. Moreover, the mediating effects of media attention and corporate reputation were investigated. Results show that compared to companies excluded from the list, companies on the list had significantly higher CSR fulfillment. Admission to the rich list is a high trigger for media attention to the listed rich and their companies. Both positive and negative media reports place external reputation pressure on listed companies. Media attention exerts external supervisory functions for listed companies and forces those companies to attach greater importance to CSR fulfillment. The halo of the listed rich and the media attention influence their personal reputations and those of the listed companies. To maintain their own reputation and corporate interests, the listed companies are willing to actively fulfill CSR. The conclusions support the notion of the media exerting the external supervisory functions of public opinion for companies on the precondition of respecting objective fact and constructing a reasonable corporate reputation transmission mechanism for enhanced corporate internal governance.

AB  - Based on a national representative sample of U.S. internet users, this article examines the impact of associational participation on the likelihood of making an online donation to a charity. The results indicated that internet users engaged in more offline groups and networks are more likely to donate online. Frequency of use of internet and social media do not influence general propensity to donate, thereby suggesting that online donations are a function of actual engagement in social groups, rather than of frequent exposure to the internet media. Individuals involved in choice-based groups were the most likely to donate online, compared to other types of organization participation and/or affiliation. The authors also find that general propensity to donate online (including charities respondents are unaffiliated with) and making monetary contributions specifically to the particular organizations individuals are active in have somewhat distinct determinants.

AB  - Means of transportation are changing through advances in automation. One issue to be considered in this development is public opinion regarding these systems, yet existing studies of automated transportation do not provide theoretical or methodological means for exploring public imagination, even though this would be relevant in exploring public acceptance of future technologies. Applied for studying public views on a future automated metro system, a method was devised that includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of media and questionnaire data (n = 913). Although supportive arguments dominated media discussion, people's attitudes were negative. The two most prominent models of media influence, repetition and cultural resonance, could not fully explain the results; therefore, public imagination, which reflected daily experiences and science fiction, was explored with reference to social representations literature. It is suggested in general that public imagination, along with media discourses and societal settings that contribute to explanations, should be considered in the design and study of automated systems. It is also discussed that the social representations approach could be beneficial for media frame studies by providing explications as to why certain frames might have or lack cultural resonance.

AB  - Sharks are among the oldest residents of the planet, they possess a unique value as top predators and constitute irreplaceable elements of marine ecosystems. Unfortunately, contemporary narratives widely presented in popular mainstream media have attached an utterly negative connotation to sharks, propagating an unsubstantiated and fabricated image of them as implacable and voracious predators. Recently a lot of attention is devoted to understanding the public perception towards sharks in order to promote their conservation given that a quarter of all shark species are facing extinction. This work assessed the current attitude of the public towards sharks on a global scale, utilizing modern technology through a single protocol that explored the importance of factors like culture, history, or educational level in shaping attitudes. We collected 13,800 questionnaires from 137 countries, with 25 countries presenting more than 100 answers each, representing in total 92% of the filled questionnaires.

AB  - In the past 2 decades, cable television and the Internet have greatly increased the availability of media content. The phenomenon has reinvigorated a longstanding debate about the effects of this media landscape, as people selectively get exposed to specific content. Based on U.S. national survey data, this article advances research in this area by analyzing the interplay between individuals' ideological predispositions, their selective exposure to cable news, and the relationship between selective exposure and their attitudes toward an issue with key policy-making implications: Mexican immigration. Results indicate conservative Republicans are more likely to watch FOX News, which is associated with negative perceptions of Mexican immigrants and higher support for restrictive immigration policies. Findings also suggest that liberals who get exposed to FOX News also show less support for Mexican immigration.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In the popular news media, public health officials routinely emphasize the health risks of obesity and portray weight as under personal control. These messages may increase support for policies designed to reduce rates of obesity, but can also increase antifat stigma. Less often, the media cover 'Health at Every Size' or 'Fat Rights' perspectives that may have the opposite effects. We investigated how exposure to different 'fat frames' shifts attitudes about weight and support for obesity policies.
   METHODS: Across four experiments (n = 2187), people read constructed news articles framing fatness as negative (unhealthy, controllable, acceptable to stigmatize) or positive (healthy, uncontrollable, unacceptable to stigmatize).
   RESULTS: Compared with people who read fat-positive frames, people who read fat-negative frames expressed more: belief in the health risks of being fat (d = 0.95-1.22), belief weight is controllable (d = 0.38-0.55), support for charging obese people more for health insurance (d = 0.26-0.77), antifat prejudice (in three out of four experiments, d = 0.28-0.39), willingness to discriminate against fat people (d = 0.39-0.71) and less willingness to celebrate body size diversity (d = 0.37-0.64). They were also less willing to say that women at the lower end of the obese range could be healthy at their weights. Effects on support for public policies, however, were generally small and/or nonsignificant. Compared with a control condition, exposure to fat-positive frames generally shifted attitudes more than fat-negative frames. In experiment 4, adding a message about the unacceptability of weight-based discrimination to unhealthy/controllable news articles only reduced antifat stigma on one of three measures compared with articles adding a discrimination-acceptable message.
   CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to different news frames of fat can shift beliefs about weight-related health risks and weight-based stigma. Shifting policy attitudes, however, is more challenging.

AB  - We propose that attributions about an endorser truly liking, using, or desiring a promoted product mediate the relationship between source and message factors and persuasion via endorsement. In this paper, we integrate the persuasion literature into a framework for examining endorser effectiveness via focus factors (e.g., involvement, cognitive load) that determine whether a consumer thinks carefully or superficially about a message, and lead consumers to rely on different source and message elements (e.g., source attractiveness, argument strength). These elements then influence attributional processing. Correspondent inferences about an endorser can lead to enhanced advertisement and brand attitudes, and spur either fleeting identification with the endorsement or more enduring internalization (Kelman, The Public Opinion Quarterly 25:57-78, 1961) of the endorser's message as a consumer's own. Implications of our framework and research directions are discussed.

AB  - New media technologies make it necessary for scholars to reassess mass communication theories developed among legacy media. One such theory is the spiral of silence theory originally proposed by Noelle-Neumann in the 1970s. Increasing diversity of media content, selectivity, social networking site (SNS) interactivity, and the potential for anonymity have posed various challenges to its theoretical assumptions. While application of the spiral of silence in SNS contexts has been theorized, its empirical testing is scarce. To fill this void, the Pew 2012 Search, Social Networks, and Politics survey is used to test the theory. Results reveal that encountering agreeable political content predicts speaking out, while encountering disagreeable postings stifles opinion expression, supporting the spiral of silence theory in the SNS environment. However, certain uses of SNSs and psychological factors demonstrate a liberating effect on opinion expression.

AB  - The aim of this article is to identify whether differences exist in local and national news framing of immigration. Using 12 years (2001-2012) of print media data from 15 Canadian and British print media sources, this article presents the first attempt to look for systematic differences in cross-city, within-country and cross-national framing on the subject of immigration. Contextual variables such as change in the unemployment rate and in the rate of foreign-born within cities and countries are introduced to test the robustness of the findings from a computer-automated content analysis. Findings suggest that, contrary to expectations, there is little by way of systematic evidence that national and local newspapers frame immigration according to different concerns. Furthermore, cross-city news coverage does not vary based on local contextual factors such as changes in the unemployment rate or rate of foreign-born. Indeed, it would appear that there is little evidence to support hypotheses that local coverage attends only to the 'local consequences' of immigration such as crime and unemployment, and that national concerns such as border security and broader economic outlook are solely the purview of national media. Rather, there are far fewer differences in the content and tone of immigration framing among print news sources than conventional wisdom might suggest.

AB  - Objective Tobacco control policies gained ground nationwide in 2006, with voters in nine states approving legislation to strengthen clean indoor air policies and increase tobacco excise taxes. Despite having the second lowest cigarette tax rate in the nation, Missouri was unsuccessful in passing its 2006 ballot initiative to raise the tax. An important way to encourage health-related policy change such as increasing tobacco taxes is through media coverage of tobacco issues. We examined how tobacco issues were presented in Missouri's print media leading up to the 2006 election.
   Methods This study analysed 1263 articles with tobacco content published in 187 Missouri newspapers in the year before the election. Articles were coded for general and tobacco-related characteristics including article type (news story, editorial, letter to the editor), tobacco control position (pro, neutral, anti) and article theme (economic, health, political).
   Results Most articles were news stories (73.6%) and pro-tobacco control (63.8%). The proportion of anti-tobacco control articles increased significantly (chi(2) = 104.9, p<0.001) the month before the election, driven by an increase in economically themed articles. Economic articles were published more often in counties with less voter support for the tax (F = 5.68, p<0.01). Finally, tobacco control position varied significantly across article types (chi(2) = 148.3, p<0.01), with letters to the editor being anti-tobacco control most often.
   Conclusion The media have a critical role in promoting public health goals and presenting health issues which influences formation of health policies. Tobacco control advocates must consider public opinion, opposition pressure, timing and themes in tobacco-related media coverage when promoting policy change.

AB  - Connections between media coverage, economic conditions, and performance evaluations of political leaders have seldom been explored in specific local media markets, due to the challenges of measuring media tone and content for a large number of media outlets or markets. In this paper, we develop a measure of media tone by comparing the economic evaluations of local media consumers and national media consumers within the same media market. We then use this measure to evaluate the relationship between media tone and objective economic conditions. We find that positive media tone increases the probability that individuals will approve of the governor's performance in office, and that tone also attenuates the negative relationship between unemployment and gubernatorial approval.

AB  - Introduction: Inadequate knowledge, negative attitudes and risky practices are major hindrances to preventing the spread of HIV. This study aimed to assess HIV-related knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) of high school students in Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR).
   Methods: A cross-sectional study on unmarried male students aged between 16 and 19 years old was undertaken in 2010 to evaluate their KAPs. We selected 300 eligible grade VII students through systematic random sampling from different high schools in one province of Lao PDR.
   Results: The majority of students surveyed were aware that HIV can be transmitted by sexual intercourse (97.7%), from mother to child (88.3%) and through sharing needles or syringes (92.0%). Misconceptions about transmission of HIV were observed among 59.3% to 74.3% of respondents. Positive attitudes towards HIV/AIDS were observed among 55.7% of respondents. Nearly half of the surveyed students (45.3%) said that they would be willing to continue studying in a school with HIV-positive friends, and 124 (41.3%) said they would continue attending a school with HIV-positive teachers. Ninety-four (31.3%) students had a history of sexual intercourse, and 70.2% of these students had used a condom. However, only 43.9% said they used condoms consistently. Students with medium and high levels of knowledge were 4.3 (95% CI = 2.1-9.0, P<0.001) and 13.3 (95% CI = 6.5-27.4, P<0.001) times more likely to display positive attitudes towards people living with HIV. Similarly, safe practices related to safe sex were also observed among students with medium (OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 0.9-8.8, P = 0.069) and high levels of knowledge (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 0.6-6.2, P = 0.284). More than three-quarters of students mentioned television and radio as major sources of information on HIV/AIDS.
   Conclusions: Despite adequate knowledge about HIV/AIDS among the school students, misconceptions about routes of transmission were found. Negative attitudes to HIV/AIDS and risky practices were also present. Educational programmes with specific interventions are recommended to increase KAPs and to prevent new HIV infections among students in Lao PDR.

AB  - Beginning in the 1960s, the United States experienced religious and partisan conflict over cultural issues such as abortion that was described as a "Culture War." Recent, highly salient battles over religious liberty and transgender rights have led the media to characterize these issues as "new fronts in the culture war," thereby giving reason to revisit the culture wars debate. In this article, I test whether the public is polarized on religious liberty and transgender rights, as well as whether these issues share the same underlying structure of public opinion as traditional culture wars issues. Using a dataset from the Pew Research Center, I find that a substantial subset of Americans hold polarized views on these issues, and that religion and party are important factors in explaining that polarization. The results suggest that the religious and partisan divides that fueled the original "culture wars" remain an important factor in American politics.

AB  - The Roma Press Center (RPC) is the first Roma news agency in Hungary with the goal of reducing prejudice against the Roma. Their profile has been changed throughout the years, since the technological developments of the media and the political and economic changes of the country challenged their way of effectiveness. Until recently, the RPC was always about reacting to the negative stories about the Roma and balancing this image in the media. In the last 3 years, RPC changed its attitude by becoming a proactive media organisation which directly participates in shaping the public discourse about the Roma with their work. The interview with the two decisive characters of the RPC tells about this process.

AB  - This study reassesses the ability of the mass media to influence voter opinions directly. Combining data on media content with individuals' assessments of British political parties during the 2005 general election campaign allows a test of newspapers' persuasive influence in a way previously considered a 'virtual impossibility'. Utilizing repeated measures from the 2005 BES campaign panel, multilevel regression analysis reveals significant impact of partisan slant not just on the evaluation of the party mentioned but also on evaluations of its competitor(s). The strongest evidence of direct media persuasion is provided by the finding that variation in slant over the campaign drives how undecided voters evaluate the incumbent government party, even when controlling for a newspaper's average partisan slant.

AB  - Based on Intermedia Agenda Setting (IAS), the current study examines how official media and semi-privatized commercial media on the Weibo platform covered the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Both supervised machine learning and time series analysis were employed to analyze 350,059 Weibo posts released by 3,883 news sources between December 2019 and April 2020. Our results indicated that, in this nonwestern state-regulated China media environment, official and semi-privatized commercial media had a significant reciprocal relationship in news coverage. Both of them focused on "treatment on patients," "work resumption," and "propaganda and mobilization." Importantly, this paper sheds light on the value of the fine-grained level of agenda in IAS research. Using a fine-grained analysis, we separately investigated the effects of official and semi-privatized commercial media on predicting the pandemic prevalence, referring to the number of confirmed cases reported in real time. Implications and future directions were further discussed.

AB  - Critics argue that the G. W. Bush administration deliberately misled the U. S. public about an Iraqi threat after 9/11 but empirical evidence that presidential deception influenced public support for war has been lacking. An examination of presidential rhetoric concerning Iraq in the U. S. media revealed that it changed in tone after 9/11, consistent with moral panic processes. Logistic regression analysis of public opinion leading up to the war revealed that shifts in support for invasion directly mirrored presidential rhetoric. The findings of this study suggest that the Bush administration engineered a moral panic over Iraq with the support of the media.

AB  - This study involves the analysis of three waves of survey data about nuclear energy using a probability-based online panel of respondents in the United States. Survey waves included an initial baseline survey conducted in early 2010, a follow-up survey conducted in 2010 following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and an additional follow-up conducted just after the 2011 Fukushima, Japan, nuclear accident. The central goal is to assess the degree to which changes in public views following an accident are contingent on individual attention and respondent predispositions. Such results would provide real-world evidence of motivated reasoning. The primary analysis focuses on the impact of Fukushima and how the impact of individual attention to energy issues is moderated by both environmental views and political ideology over time. The analysis uses both mean comparisons and multivariate statistics to test key relationships. Additional variables common in the study of emerging technologies are included in the analysis, including demographics, risk and benefit perceptions, and views about the fairness of decisionmakers in both government and the private sector.

AB  - The people we see in news media can affect our perceptions of public opinion through exemplification. Although research shows that individuals interviewed in a news story can influence perceptions of public opinion, little attention has been paid to the role that source type and audience attitudes play in the exemplification process. This study tests how the exemplification process is influenced by different types of news sources featured in an article (e.g., vox pop, protester, and interest group interviews) and the audience's own political ideology. The study finds that the perceived typicality of sources is affected by both source type and how much an audience member agrees with the source. Source type is also found to directly affect perceptions of public opinion.

AB  - Many argue that paying people for good behavior can crowd out beneficial motivations like altruism. But little is known about how financial incentives interact with harmful motivations like racial bias. Two randomized vignette studies test how financial incentives affect bias. The first experiment varies the race of a hypothetical patient in need of a kidney transplant (black or white), an incentive ($18,500 or none), and addition of a message appealing to altruism. Incentives encouraged donation but introduced a significant bias favoring white patients. The second experiment assesses willingness to donate to a patient (black or white) without an incentive and then introduces incentives varying in size ($3,000, $18,800, or $50,000) and source (charity, government, or patient's own funds). Incentives encouraged donation but were significantly more effective in encouraging donation to white patients. Biasing effects are most pronounced for medium-sized incentives. Incentives may have an inadvertent biasing effect for altruistic behavior.

AB  - One key factor that appears to be crucial in the rejection of quarantines, isolation and other social controls during epidemic outbreaks is trust-or rather distrust. Much like news reporting and social media, popular culture such as fictional novels, television shows and films can influence people's trust, especially given that the information provided about an epidemic disease is sometimes seen as grounded in 'scientific fact' by societies. As well as providing information on the 'correct science' behind disease transmission, spread and illness in films and literature, popular culture can also inform societies about how to feel and how to react during epidemics-that is to say create some expectations about the kinds of societal responses that could potentially occur. In this article we closely analyse three films that centre around epidemic diseases-Contagion (Steven Soderbergh, 2011), Blindness (Fernando Meirelles, 2008) and The Painted Veil (John Curran, 2006)-in order to highlight three categories of distrust that have recently been identified and conceptualised in broader discussions regarding trust and health: institutional, social and interpersonal. These films raise two key issues about trust and social responses during epidemics. First, while certain aspects of trust are badly diminished during epidemic disease outbreaks, epidemics can also interact with pre-existing structural inequalities within society-based on race, gender or wealth-to create mixed outcomes of discord, prejudice and fear that coexist with new forms of cohesion. Second, the breakdown in trust seen at certain levels during epidemics, such as at the institutional level between communities and authorities or elites, might be mediated or negotiated, perhaps even compensated for, by heightened solidity of trust at the social level, within or between communities.

AB  - In public the 37th President of the United States did not express hostility or disparagement, or show any signs of religious prejudice towards Jews. But inside the White House, Richard M. Nixon's remarks were often scurrilous. His antisemitism was not casual; it was close to compulsive. And it could be coupled with other seething grievances, for example, towards liberals, radicals, the media, Blacks and Italian-Americans. Yet Nixon controlled his antisemitism. It had no adverse effect on Jewish life, either at home or abroad. The malice that he nurtured remained unmobilized. Apart from a few limited personnel instances (mostly but not completely ignored by Nixon's underlings), it is impossible to connect private resentment to public policy, probably because the barriers to the expression of antisemitism in the United States have been so high. The ugliness of his utterances in the Oval Office revealed his character, but did not extend outward to shape the processes of governance. A disconnect can therefore be discerned between what he felt and how he acted. Most American Jews voted for Nixon's Democratic opponents in 1968 and 1972. But even Jews who voted against him, even those who loathed him, have often acknowledged that Nixon's policies fortified the security of Israel; and he was proud of his support for the Jewish state during the Yom Kippur War. What betrayed Nixon, and what forced him to resign the presidency, was his decision to instal a secret taping system in the Oval Office. When the tapes were played in 1974, he showed himself to be conspiring to obstruct justice. In subsequent years, further exposure of the tapes revealed the extent and intensity of Nixon's antipathy to Jews. The expletives that had to be deleted did much to besmirch the dignity of the office. But such was the stigma the political culture attached to antisemitism that, had his bigotry become public before 1968, Nixon's career would have been over.

AB  - We report findings from three survey experiments that assess how partisanship affects people's subjective and objective interpretations of factual economic data. Partisan biases substantially affect how people subjectively rate economic performance. However, we find only scattered, inconclusive evidence that these biases affect objective understanding of factual data. Our experiments also offer preliminary evidence regarding how these biases might be attenuated. In the first two experiments, we assess whether reducing the amount of volatility in the graphs we present to respondents attenuates the partisan biases we identify; in the third we assess whether attributing the data to an ideologically-friendly - or unfriendly - media source affects these biases.

This article examines the reasons for this investment, the various forms of public diplomacy India and the effectiveness of its efforts to shape public,opinion. It finds that Indian investment in public diplomacy is partly a response to concerns about the perceived growth of Chinese soft power and partly a function of changed beliefs in the foreign policy-making elite about the uses of new social media. It also finds that India's new public diplomacy seems to have met with some-albeit patchy-success in augmenting its soft power.

AB  - The hegemonic framing of the 'Greek crisis', launched by leading liberal and conservative politicians in the European Union (EU) and elsewhere and followed by mass media, reflected deep Western racial prejudices towards the periphery, and stressed typical bourgeois values affirming hard work, while publicly asserting regimes of entitlement to citizenship, welfare and consumption. The article presents a class-oriented analysis of the 'Greek crisis' discursive construction in North-Western European media, by studying articles published between 2010 and 2015 in four newspapers from Germany and Denmark. The analysis shows that, along with cultural ones, upper/middle-class biases are publicly expressed through articulations of ridicule, contempt and resentment, three interrelated 'affective modalities' connected to essentialist binary constructions of the (Western/European) self and the (non-Western/European) Other. Thus, the bourgeois ideology is crucial in reproducing depoliticized frames of economic crisis, to pursue neoliberal crisis-reforms (such as various regimes of austerity and labour deregulation). The production and affirmation of middle-class subjectivities, is crucial for the organic advance of neoliberal reforms in society, while denying the advancing of working - class identifications and solidarities in the highly uncertain times of today.

KW  - ATTITUDES
AB  - Immigration is a highly polarized issue in the United States, and negative attitudes toward immigrants are common. Yet, almost all Americans are descended from people who originated outside the country, a narrative often evoked by the media and taught in school curricula. Can this narrative increase inclusionary attitudes toward migrants? We draw from scholarship showing that perspective-taking decreases prejudice toward out-groups to investigate whether reminding Americans about their own immigration history increases support for immigrants and immigration. We propose that priming family experiences can indirectly stimulate perspective-taking and induce empathy toward the out-group, which we test with three separate survey experiments conducted over two years. Our findings show that priming family history generates small but consistent inclusionary effects. These effects occur even among partisan subgroups and Americans who approve of President Trump. We provide evidence that increased empathy for immigrants constitutes one mechanism driving these effects.

AB  - This article explores prejudicial and racist discourse in reader comments in internet news discussion forums. Based on data from an online debate among Czech commenters on the mainstream iDnes.cz news site, it seeks to contribute to the existing critical linguistic approaches to discursive strategies of othering. Analysing user comments referencing a news article on a sensitive social topic, namely the complicated reception of Central European Roma immigrants in the UK, the paper focuses on three salient themes found in the data: (a) the re-education of the ethnic minority; (b) the users' perception of the media as politically correct and siding with the outgroup; and (c) the outgroup's negative stereotype associating it with criminality. The paper argues that the discourse on these topics simultaneously relies on and reinforces the negative stereotype of the ethnic group, while revealing a complicated relationship between three stakeholders: the ingroup, represented by the commenters; the outgroup, made up of members of the ethnic groups; and the media, as representatives of the authorities and the elites. The findings reveal how quasi-humorous comments that involve such stereotypical representations contribute to the normalization of everyday racism against ethnic outgroups.(1)

AB  - Large infrastructure schemes have become part of our landscape. Their controversial nature often requires elaborate justifications including the use of intangible benefits. One intangible benefit that has increasingly been raised in support of mega-projects is the peace dividend. Yet, to date, few studies have systematically addressed the following questions: to what extent, by whom, and in what ways is the peace dividend used as a strategic tool when it comes to justifying contested mega-projects? This article examines the use of different types of arguments in mega-project justification, with a focus on the peace dividend as a political intangible benefit. Through a comparative content analysis of coverage of the Dead Sea-Red Sea Canal project in Israeli and Jordanian news media, we illustrate how the peace dividend is employed as a framing device by both project supporters and opponents and how it is positioned in relation to other types of benefits and costs. We found that the marketing of contested mega-projects to public and political constituencies entails a variety of justifications, reflected in the various framing modes used to influence public opinion in both Israel and Jordan. The nature and intensity of these justifications are sensitive to the media environment and the degree of economic development. Our findings indicate that the peace dividend as a line of defense for the project is the most controversial of all other justification domains.

AB  - Gathering public opinion by analyzing big social data has attracted wide attention due to its interactive and real time nature. For this, recent studies have relied on both social media and sentiment analysis in order to accompany big events by tracking people's behavior. In this paper, we propose an adaptable sentiment analysis approach that analyzes social media posts and extracts user's opinion in real-time. The proposed approach consists of first constructing a dynamic dictionary of words' polarity based on a selected set of hashtags related to a given topic, then, classifying the tweets under several classes by introducing new features that strongly fine-tune the polarity degree of a post. To validate our approach, we classified the tweets related to the 2016 US election. The results of prototype tests have performed a good accuracy in detecting positive and negative classes and their sub-classes.

AB  - Although education is a staple of news coverage, the reporting of school-based education rarely receives attention within journalism and media studies. Scholars in other areas, however, have argued that news coverage of education is highly influential and should be examined. The research consensus has been that education coverage is mostly negative and, further, that teachers are frequently portrayed as the ones to blame for perceived shortcomings in school systems. Such coverage is said to concern and affect schoolteachers. However, to date, very few studies have canvassed teachers' attitudes towards the reporting of education. This article contributes to this under-researched area by providing the results of a series of interviews with 25 Australian schoolteachers and principals about their perceptions of news coverage of education. The vast majority of the teachers interviewed considered news about schooling and teachers to be predominantly, and unfairly, critical. They described news reporting of education as frequently inaccurate and generally superficial. Many expressed a distrust of journalists and were wary about being interviewed. The implications of these findings are discussed, and recommendations for journalism practice and journalism education are outlined.

AB  - The concept of advertising means orienting oneself to public opinion; so today, mass media advertising, including urban advertising, which is one of the main sources of information, can promote the culture of a society. These media play an important role in changing the level of society's culture. In fact, media advertising has led to many changes in the lifestyle, values and culture of the audience. Therefore, in this research, an attempt has been made to examine the executive tricks in cultural advertising and its features in order to convey the message effectively to the audience. To achieve this goal, a descriptive-analytical method has been used and its information has been collected in a library manner Finally, using the obtained data, the samples of the world's cultural and cultural urban advertisements were analysed. As the results of this study show, the method of interaction with executive techniques such as 'participatory art and volumetric art' has had the greatest impact on persuading the audience. This has been achieved through the participation and physical intervention of the audience with cultural advertising. Accordingly, such advertisements give better cultural themes to audience.

AB  - With the increasing dissemination and usage of online mate choice, finding a partner via the Internet has attracted remarkable public attention in the last decade. Several, mostly negative prejudices toward online mate choice especially regarding its risks and disadvantages circulate constantly throughout the mass media and form public perceptions. This article presents common stereotypes on this (still) new phenomenon, derived from an investigation of newspapers online and offline, online guides, blogs, and discussion forums and confronts them with the empirical facts. Based on several descriptive analyses, we discuss whether and to what extent ten prevalent beliefs correspond to the empirical reality of finding a mate via the Internet in Germany.

AB  - More and more people are involved in sustainability-related activities through social network to support/protect their idea or motivation for sustainable development. Understanding the variety of issues of social pulsation is crucial in development of social sustainability. However, issues in social media generally change overtime. Issues not identified in advance may soon become popular topics discussed in society, particularly controversial issues. Previous studies have focused on the detection of hot topics and discussion of controversial issues, rather than the identification of potential controversial issues, which truly require paying attention to social sustainability. Furthermore, previous studies have focused on issue detection and tracking based on historical data. However, not all controversial issues are related to historical data to foster the cases. To avoid the above-mentioned research gap, Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an essential role in issue detection in the early stage. In this study, an AI-based solution approach is proposed to resolve two practical problems in social media: (1) the impact caused by the number of fan pages from Facebook and (2) awareness of the levels for an issue. The proposed solution approach to detect potential issues is based on the popularity of public opinion in social media using a Web crawler to collect daily posts related to issues in social media under a big data environment. Some analytical findings are carried out via the congregational rules proposed in this research, and the solution approach detects the attentive subjects in the early stages. A comparison of the proposed method to the traditional methods are illustrated in the domain of green energy. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed approach is accurate and effective and therefore it provides significant contribution to upsurge green energy deployment.

AB  - Previous research has identified the frames and metaphors used in the reporting on the Euro crisis. War and disease turned out to be the two most frequently used metaphorical frames. Since coverage of the current financial crisis may have a tangible effect on public opinion, research into the effects of metaphorical frames on attitudes is needed. By employing two survey experiments, a student sample (N = 259) and a nonstudent sample (N = 507), this article traces the effects of both metaphorical frames. Our results show that individuals take over the metaphorical frame elements in their evaluation of the Euro crisis. Participants in the war conditions significantly more often referred to war when answering the open questions. Alternatively, when the Euro crisis was framed as a disease, participants were more likely to use words and sentences containing disease frame elements.

AB  - We used the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak to examine the relationships between risk perceptions and media coverage (volume and content). We analyzed how public opinion from longitudinal U.S. panel data related to the number of published news articles and the proportion that discussed risks. News following, volume and risk content were positively related to U.S. and global risk perceptions. Perceptions of U.S. risk declined at different rates, depending upon news attention and potential exposure to risk content. Both media volume and content were significant factors, suggesting scholars should focus more on combined effects of news media volu me and content.

AB  - The United States Constitution allows individuals to practice any religion they choose. However, the austerity of this right is tested when an individual's belief is publicly displayed. For Muslim women wearing the hijab, or headscarf, the intersection between private religious practice and its social expression is explored on a daily basis. To fully understand the manifestation of public religious expression, this paper examines a series of interviews with 35 hijab-wearing Muslim women living in the United States. By exploring the lived experiences of Muslim-American women, this paper highlights the broader issues of the media's influence on perceptions of Muslim culture, the complex and often unclear legality of religious symbols in the workplace, and the barriers that exist for hijab-wearing women in the workplace. With the rise of Islamophobia, the participants found a stronger sense to exert their right to express their religious identities. Moreover, the women interviewed demonstrate their agency by continuing to embrace their religious practice despite intersecting forms of discrimination.

Evidence is scarce regarding citizens' individual media repertoires for staying informed about science as segmentation studies so far have primarily focused on scientific attitudes. In this paper, we explore audience segments regarding their science-related information behavior and whether such segments are comparable or vary between two countries with similar information environments. Based on two surveys in Switzerland and Germany, we identify national audience segments that differ in their science-related information repertoires, and analyze their sociodemographic characteristics and science-related attitudes. In both countries, we find very comparable information user segments ranging from those who inform themselves frequently about science ("Active Seekers"/"Science Consumers") to those who hardly get in contact with any information about science and research ("Non-Users"). Those segments which get in contact with information about science frequently show generally more positive attitudes.

AB  - Background: Stigma is a significant barrier to breastfeeding. Internationally, mothers have reported stigma surrounding public breastfeeding. In the United Kingdom, the Equality Act 2010 gives women the right to breastfeed in public, including within private businesses. In April 2014, a woman who was breastfeeding in a UK sports shop was asked to leave, resulting in a localized protest by breastfeeding mothers. This resulted in the issue of public breastfeeding being highlighted in local, national, and social media.
   Objective: To examine online opinion regarding breastfeeding in public and protesting about the right to breastfeed in public within the context of a single case.
   Methods: Online user-generated content relating to the case of Wioletta Komar was downloaded from Twitter and the comments section of a UK online news source, Mail Online. Data comprised 884 comments and 1210 tweets, collected within 24 hours of the incident. Semiotic and thematic analysis was facilitated by NVivo 10.
   Results: Comments from Twitter were supportive (76%) or neutral (22%) regarding the protesting women and public breastfeeding. Conversely, Mail Online comments were mostly negative (85%). Mail Online posters questioned the legality of public breastfeeding, while Twitter comments acknowledged and supported women's legal right to breastfeed publicly. Many Mail Online commenters stated that they found it uncomfortable to watch breastfeeding or thought it was unnecessary to breastfeed in public.
   Conclusion: If the UK government is serious about increasing breastfeeding, interventions to promote public support for public breastfeeding are urgently required.

AB  - This article maps the negative reaction of the Scottish press to devolution after the establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, and relates this episode to its coverage of the 2014 independence referendum. The article also considers how the rising profile of social media and a shift in Scottish public opinion towards the Yes side late in the 2014 referendum campaign highlights the decline of the traditional newspaper press in Scotland. It concludes by considering the value of the national press in Scotland to the nation's wider cultural health, and the negative implications for the state of Scottish civil society if the national press disappears.

AB  - The transmission of online emergency information has become an active means of expressing public opinion and has vitally affected societal emergency response techniques. This paper analyzes interactions between three groups in time and space using a classic SIR (susceptible, infected, and recovered) epidemic model. Through social network theory and analog simulation analysis, we utilize data from China's Sina Weibo (a popular social media platform) to conduct empirical research on 101 major incidents in China that occurred between 2010 and 2017. We divide these emergencies into four types-natural disasters, accidents, public health events, and social security events-and conduct a simulation using three examples from each group. The results show that government control of public opinion is both cheaper and more effective when it occurs at the initial stages of an incident. By cooperating with the government, the media can facilitate emergency management. Finally, if netizens trust the government and the media, they are more likely to make cooperative decisions, maintain interest, and improve the management of online public sentiment.

AB  - South Africa is faced with water scarcity crisis. In recent years, conservation campaigns have emerged to encourage citizens in developing a social ethic of water conservation essential in creating sustainability of resource use. The conservation campaigns are disseminated using conventional media often with messages couched in English language with the attendant highfalutin jargon which obfuscates and limits reach and effectiveness. To this end, negative attitudes towards water resources persist. Using the parallel mixed methods approach, this paper examines the potency of Folk Theatre in creating awareness about water issues as well as in alleviating and advocating attitudinal and behavioural changes against the backdrop of a worsening water crisis. Based on data on a rural community, Folk Theatre is found to be effective in raising awareness and educating rural folks about water issues and breaking down misconceptions about water conservation. In conclusion, Folk Theatre offers a sustainable alternative approach to communicating water conservation in rural South Africa.

AB  - Background: H7N9 posed potentially serious health challenges for Chinese society. The previous SARS outbreak in this country was accompanied by contradictory information, while worries about wide-spread influenza led to discrimination worldwide. Early understanding of public threat perceptions is therefore important for effective public health communication and intervention.
   Methods: We interviewed 1011 respondents by phone two weeks after the first case. Questions examined risk awareness and media use, beliefs about the emergence of the threat and those most at risk, anxiety about infection and preventive and avoidant behaviours.
   Results: Results demonstrate moderate levels of anxiety but relatively high levels of trust towards government officials. Threat emergence was associated with hygiene levels, temperature change, floating pigs in the Huangpu River and migration to the city. Anxiety predicted both recommended and non-recommended behavioural changes.
   Conclusions: Comparatively high levels of trust in Chinese government advice about H7N9 contrast positively with previous pandemic communications in China. Anxiety helped drive both recommended and non-recommended behaviours, with potentially important economic and social implications. This included evidence of ` othering' of those associated with the threat (e. g. migrants). Findings emphasise the need to manage public communications early during new influenza outbreaks.

AB  - Social media is gradually building an online information environment regarding health. This environment is filled with many types of users' emotions regarding food safety, especially negative emotions that can easily cause panic or anger among the population. However, the mechanisms of how it affects users' emotions have not been fully studied. Therefore, from the perspective of communication and social psychology, this study uses the content analysis method to analyze factors affecting social media users' emotions regarding food safety issues. In total, 371 tweet samples of genetically modified food security in Sina Weibo (similar to Twitter) were encoded, measured, and analyzed. The major findings are as follows: (1) Tweet account type, tweet topic, and emotion object were all significantly related to emotion type. Tweet depth and objectivity were both positively affected by emotion type, and objectivity had a greater impact. (2) Account type, tweet topic, and emotion object were all significantly related to emotion intensity. When the depths were the same, emotion intensity became stronger with the decrease in objectivity. (3) Account type, tweet topic, emotion object, and emotion type were all significantly related to a user's emotion communication capacity. Tweet depth, objectivity, and user's emotion intensity were positively correlated with emotion communication capacity. Positive emotions had stronger communication capacities than negative ones, which is not consistent with previous studies. These findings help us to understand both theoretically and practically the changes and dissemination of user's emotions in a food safety and health information environment.

AB  - How partisans select and perceive political news during election campaigns is an important question in political communication research. This article interrelates two prominent concepts: the selective exposure and the hostile media paradigms. I argue that some media outlets are more likely than others to be selected based on political preferences and that the partisan leanings of these outlets are perceived as friendly by their audiences. Other outlets are selected regardless of political alignment. Here I expect to find hostile media perceptions. An analysis of representative survey data from the 2009 and 2013 German national election studies reveals support for the proposed pattern. However, the overall magnitudes of selective exposure and bias perceptions are limited in the campaigns under investigation.

AB  - Social media platforms such as Twitter have gained tremendous political importance in recent years. Moreover, being considered as platforms for organizing grass root political movements or political participation in general, this positive view has given way to more critical perspectives on the negative sides of social media, such as attempts of algorithmically manipulating public opinion or the outcome of elections and racist or sexist hate speech. For the case of Japan, despite particularly xenophobic hate speech on bulletin boards such as "2channel" (ni-channeru) or Twitter has been extensively studied from various angles, misogynic forms of verbal abuse towards females on social media, female politicians in particular, have received much lesser attention in existing research. In this article we present results from an explorative analysis of instances of misogynist or sexist hate speech and abusive language against female politicians on Twitter, applying computational corpus-linguistic tools and methods, supplemented by a qualitative in-depth study of verbal abuse of four prominent female politicians, namely Renho, Tsujimoto Kiyomi, Yamao Shiori, and Koike Yuriko, thereby fruitfully combining quantitative-statistical and qualitative-hermeneutic approaches.

AB  - While exposure to stereotyped minority characters reinforces prejudice, when viewers identify with counter-stereotyped characters prejudice tends to decrease. This study examines the juxtaposition of identifying with either a counter-stereotyped Black protagonist or a stereotyped supporting cast. Participants read a prompt (group vs. individual salience), watched an episode of Luke Cage, then reported their identification with the Black protagonist (Cage) and the social group (the Black community of Harlem). Findings suggest that individual identification with a counter-stereotype reduces symbolic racism, while social identification with a stereotyped group does not.

AB  - This article considers the format and cultural politics of the hugely successful UK television program Top Gear (BBC 2002-2015). It analyzes how-through its presenting team-it constructed an informal address predicated around anti-authoritarian or contrarian banter and protest masculinity. Regular targets for Top Gear presenter's protest-curtailed by broadcast guidelines in terms of gender and ethnicity-are deflected onto the "soft"targets of government legislation on environmental issues or various forms of regulation "red tape. Repeated references to speed cameras, central London congestion charges and "excessive"signage are all anti-authoritarian, libertarian discourses delivered through a comedic form of performance address. Thus, the BBC's primary response to complaints made about this program was to defend the program's political views as being part of the humor. The article draws on critical discourse analysis and conversation analysis to consider how the program licensed a particular form of engagement that helped it to deflect criticisms, and considers the limits to such discursive positioning. We conclude by examining the controversies that finally led, in 2015, to the removal of the main presenter, Jeremy Clarkson, and the ending of this version of the program through the departure of the team to an on-demand online television service.

AB  - Synthetic biology will probably have a high impact on a variety of fields, such as healthcare, environment, biofuels, agriculture, and so on. A driving theme in European research policy is the importance of maintaining public legitimacy and support. Media can influence public attitudes and are therefore an important object of study. Through qualitative content analysis, this study investigates the press coverage of synthetic biology in the major Nordic countries between 2009 and 2014. The press coverage was found to be event-driven and there were striking similarities between countries when it comes to framing, language use, and treated themes. Reporters showed a marked dependence on their sources, mainly scientists and stakeholders, who thus drives the media agenda. The media portrayal was very positive, with an optimistic look at future benefits and very little discussion of possible risks.

AB  - It is commonly assumed that perceived threats from a rival state will make individuals more likely to "rally-round-the-flag" and support military action. Previous studies have looked at how information about threats affects public support for military action. To date, however, there has been less attention to how information about the costs of conflict affects support for military action in response to threats. In this article, we present a survey experiment designed to evaluate how information about the likely military and economic costs of conflict influences support for military action. We provide Japanese respondents with information about relations with China, and probe how support for military action in the context of the ongoing territorial dispute changes with varying information on the military costs of conflict and its economic consequences. We find that information about trade ties and military capacity exerts a pacifying effect and strengthens opposition to military action. Consistent with our proposed mechanism, we show that greater awareness of military costs is associated with stronger opposition to military action. Our results indicate that even under the existence of external threats, greater awareness of the costs of conflict affects attitudes to military action and can increase support for peaceful solutions to territorial rivalries.

AB  - This study examines public demand for Internet freedom and control along with their microindividual and macrosocietal predictors. Based on a secondary analysis of the Internet Society's Global Internet User Survey data, it is found that the picture regarding people's attitudes toward Internet freedom and censorship is more complicated and nuanced than assumed. First, Internet use was a positive predictor of demand for Internet freedom, but not of demand for Internet control. Second, freedom supply (the amount of Internet freedom in a given country), and individual perception of freedom supply in particular, was found to be negatively associated with people's demand for both Internet freedom and Internet control, which partially supports the prediction of balance theory. Finally, the results of statistical interaction analyses suggest the impact of Internet use on demand for Internet freedom and control is contingent on people's perceived freedom supply in their respective countries.

AB  - Extant findings show that voter fraud is extremely rare and difficult to prove in the United States. Voter's knowledge about voter fraud allegations likely comes through the media, who tend to sensationalize the issue. In this study, we argue that the more voters are exposed to media coverage of voter fraud allegations, the more likely that they will perceive that voter fraud is a frequent problem. We merge the 2012 Survey of Performance of American Elections with state-level media coverage of voter fraud leading up to the 2012 election. Our results show that media coverage of voter fraud is associated with public beliefs about voter fraud. In states where fraud was more frequently featured in local media outlets, public concerns about voter fraud were heightened. In particular, we find that press attention to voter fraud has a larger influence on Republicans than Democrats and Independents. We further find that media coverage of voter fraud does not further polarize partisan perceptions of voter fraud. Rather, political interest moderates state media coverage on voter fraud beliefs only among Republicans. Last, our results provide no support that demographic changes, approval of election administration, or information concerning actual reported voting irregularities have any discernable effects on partisan perceptions.

AB  - Between 2010 and 2015, as Myanmar transitioned from authoritarian rule to a more liberal and democratic state, its Muslim population increasingly faced hate speech and violence. This article goes beyond analyses that regard the growing anti-Muslim sentiment as a consequence of a liberalized media environment, enabling people to voice long-standing grievances and prejudice. Rather, the notion of a "Muslim threat" to Myanmar's Buddhist population is approached as the outcome of a dynamic process of securitization in which an alliance of political and religious elites was forged whose discourse changed the rules of the political field, forcing the reform-oriented opposition into strategic silence. It is argued that in the early period of liberalization, anti-Muslim frames were normalized and thus shaped the securitization of Muslims.

AB  - This article explores persuasive applications of humour in public diplomacy. I propose a new concept of strategic humour - the use of humour by state and proxy actors to promote instrumental interpretations of contested international events to foreign and domestic publics. Through strategic humour, states frame events in ways that advance their interests, deflect external criticism, and challenge narratives of other actors. In an entertaining form, strategic humour delivers a serious message that is simple, accessible, memorable, suited to the new media ecologies, and competitive in capturing news media and public attention. I focus on Russia as a state recently involved in a range of major controversies and demonstrate its use of strategic humour in three case studies. I argue that strategic humour is a fast-emerging, multi-format tool in public diplomacy, facilitated by the rise of social media and post-truth politics and less dependent on the state's broader power resources.

AB  - This study uses a novel approach to identifying local contextual conditions conducive, alone or in combination to far-right political violence. The studied case is asylum housing attacks occurring in Sweden 2015-16. Using a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis of eighty-six Swedish municipalities, forty-two of which have experienced arson attacks against refugee housing facilities, we operationalize and test four hypotheses derived from the literature. These assumed the causal impact of (1) objective grievances, (2) mediated grievances combined with lack of political opportunities, (3) independent alternative media effects, and (4) broader far-right mobilization. In contrast to a number of previous studies, none of the three first hypotheses received support. No operationalization of objective grievances, such as influxes of immigrants, poverty, or unemployment distinguished the municipalities where attacks had occurred. Nor did the local level of discursive or political opportunities. Only one of our expected causal pathways-arson attacks as an extension of a broader local far-right mobilization in the context of a supportive local public opinion-was a sufficient condition for a large proportion of our positive cases.

AB  - This study analyses weblog abortion-related content sampled via a search and snowball method. When weblogs located inside of established media Web sites and other weblogs are compared, they are equivalent in the use of advocacy versus objectivist frames. Media weblog posts contain a political frame more frequently than non-media weblog posts do. In terms of diversity of frame, media weblogs employ more frames in their stories. Various explanations for these findings are offered in the context of current abortion-related content patterns. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Western Social Science Association.

AB  - Muslim students and communities in Western sociopolitical and educational contexts confront substantive challenges of racisms, Islamophobia, and under- and misrepresentations in media as well as in literature. Creating a robust repertoire of curricular resources for teaching and learning, teacher development programs, and schooling in general offers a promise of developing classroom practices, which in turn promotes an inclusive discourse that recognizes the unique position and presence of a Muslim child. The present article examines the prospects of developing such a curriculum called Muslim Children's Literature for inclusive schooling and teacher development programs in the context of public education in Ontario, Canada. It is situated in the larger umbrella of creating specific theory and methodology for education that lend exposure to Muslim cultures and civilizations. Development of such a literature as curricular resources addresses the questions of Muslim identities through curriculum perceptions so as to initiate critical conversations around various educational challenges that the development and dissemination of Muslim curricular resources faces today. I make a case for developing Muslim Children's Literature to combat the challenges of having limited repertoire to engage with Muslim students in public schools and teacher candidates in teacher development programs. With the description of the necessity of such a literature, this article outlines characteristics of the proposed genre of Muslim Children's Literature, as well as the unique position of a Muslim child in the current educational scenarios. A brief peek into select fiction on Muslim themes available in English internationally that can be used as curricular resources at elementary and secondary level serves towards reinforcing the definition of Muslim Children's Literature. Further, these offer a sample that may be promoted under the proposed genre of Muslim Children's Literature.

AB  - Simple Summary Wolf management is often controversial, because this carnivore is viewed by some as a major threat for livestock, while others perceive it as a flagship for environmental conservation. Attitudes towards the wolf can be influenced by how the media portrays this canid, and media analysis can therefore be a useful tool for understanding and managing conflicts over wolf management. My aim was to study wolf media coverage in a newspaper in northern Spain, how it varied over the period 2006-2017, and in two different socio-ecological settings. Most documents focused on the conflictive relationship between the wolf and livestock, particularly in the south of the study area, where the carnivore is protected and has recolonised new localities, causing increasing damage to livestock. In the north, where wolves have been present for a long time and are a game species, wolf media coverage was more diverse and addressed other topics such as wolf conservation or hunting more frequently. In conclusion, this study suggests that the media often portrays the wolf as a risk for livestock and thus for human livelihood in northern Spain, which could have a significant influence on public attitudes towards the species and potentially compromise coexistence between wolves and humans.
   Abstract People's attitudes towards large carnivores, and thus public support for their conservation, can be influenced by how these species are framed in the media. Therefore, assessing media coverage of large carnivores is of particular interest for their coexistence with humans. I used content analysis to assess how the grey wolf was portrayed in a newspaper in northern Spain, how wolf media coverage varied over time (2006-2017), and in two different socio-ecological settings. Most documents addressed the conflictive relationship between the wolf and livestock (60%; n = 902). Moreover, coverage of this relationship increased over the study period in the south of the study area, where the wolf is strictly protected, has recolonised new localities, and damage to livestock has increased. Overall, other topics, such as wolf conservation or hunting, appeared much less frequently in the media, but predominated in the north of the study area, where the wolf is more abundant and huntable. Conflictive issues like wolf-livestock interactions are generally attractive for audiences, but drawing attention to this issue may compromise the management of conflicts associated with wolves. Ideally, the media should promote potential wolf conservation values if coexistence between wolves and humans is sought.

AB  - The increasing visibility of prominent political leaders in news media is well documented in political science literature. The main concern that has been raised in this connection is that the complexity of political processes is being reduced to achievements and standpoints of individual politicians, and the importance of rational opinion building is discounted. The results of the current study provide the first empirical evidence to account for the misgivings about emotional effects of personalized political information on media audiences. Using data from an online experiment, this study shows that news coverage regarding behaviors and personal characteristics of a foreign leader influences (a) evaluations of personal characteristics typical of his or her nation's citizens and (b) emotional perceptions of that leader's country (sentiment and respect). This effect is shown to reflect a psychological phenomenon whereby people project their emotions and perceptions regarding a leader's personal characteristics onto his or her country and people.

AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to explore college students' beliefs about childbirth and midwifery.
   Methods: A critical qualitative analysis was used to identify common themes that occurred in an online class discussion about midwifery.
   Results: This population of 459 college students drew on the larger social discourse of the medical model of childbirth to frame their discussion of childbirth and midwives. Common beliefs that emerged from class discussions included the perceived dangerous nature of childbirth, the necessity for technologic interventions in childbirth, and doubts about the quality of midwifery training and practice.
   Discussion: To promote midwifery among this population, advocates should continue public education efforts through a variety of media and communication strategies, with an emphasis on the safety of midwifery care.

AB  - This study tests the relative mobilizing effects of predispositional factors and attention to media content during a gubernatorial race that focused heavily on stem cell research as a salient campaign issue. Our analyses are based on a statewide telephone survey (N = 508 in June-July 2006) conducted prior to the midterm and gubernatorial elections in the U.S. State of Wisconsin. Results show that ideological predispositions and attention to both newspaper and online media best explain issue participation. In contrast with prior research, our findings show that religiosity did not influence issue participation on the stem cell controversy in Wisconsin. Implications of these findings and the importance of research on issue participation for the field of public opinion research and the future of political campaigns are discussed.

AB  - This article aims to extend third-person effect research into a cross-cultural context. How and why the third-person perception (perceptual gaps between media effect on self and others) has dissimilar association with the willingness to support regulation of media content in the United States and South Korea is investigated. The survey results demonstrate a larger third-person perception among U.S. respondents than among Korean respondents. Regression and mediation analyses reveal that the different levels of third-person perception mainly result from the direct influence of nationality, while cultural values were not statistically significant in accounting for the third-person perception. In contrast, Koreans show a greater level of support for the censorship of violent video games than Americans. The national difference in behavioral intention is the direct effect of nationality on the intention to support regulation and by the indirect effect of cultural values such as collectivism. In addition, gender, age, religiosity, negative prejudice against violent video games, collectivism, and the presumption of media effects on others contributed to support for preemptive behavioral measures such as censorship. However, more frequent playing of violent video games decreases support for regulation. In addition, the implications for research on third-person perception and the intention to support media content regulation are discussed.

AB  - The study investigates the impact of media coverage of protest on issue attention in parliament (questions) in six Western European countries. Integrating several data sets on protest, media, and political agendas, we demonstrate that media coverage of protest affects parliamentary agendas: the more media attention protest on an issue receives, the more parliamentary questions on that issue are asked. The relationship, however, is mediated by the issue agenda of mass media more generally, attesting to an indirect rather than a direct effect. Additionally, the effect of media-covered protests on the general media agenda is moderated by the political system and is larger in majoritarian countries than in countries with a consensus democracy. This shows the importance of political opportunity structures for the agenda-setting impact of protest.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between personal traits, news use via YouTube algorithmic searches, and engagement with misinformation about U.S. Muslim congresswomen. Based on analyses of survey data, we find that those with lower cognitive ability and frequent algorithmic use were more likely to believe and share misinformation. Republicans and those with higher levels of nationalism and prejudice against Muslims were also more likely to believe the misinformation. Moderation findings suggest that higher algorithmic use strengthens belief in misinformation about U.S. Muslim congresswomen. The results highlight the importance of both individual ideologies and systematic factors in understanding misinformation engagement.

AB  - Social realities are discursive constructs, so that attitudes and representations are the reflection of an informative approach. In this sense, the cultural and linguistic gaps between different civilizations, together with a discursive construction of a war nature, could be creating the ground for a continuous confrontation between East and West. The present study analyzes the different rhetorical frames of the international news agencies Reuters, Al Arabiya, Al Jazeera and Associated Press about the terrorist attack at the Istanbul (Turkey) airport on July 28, 2016. A quantitative study of the figures speech and the most repeated topics in the headlines of the attack is carried out. The power of the media in public opinion and the construction of reality generate a discussion about how these news are spread and their effects. The objective is to compare the different rhetorical frames in both civilizations and to identify if stereotypes are projected and if this framing contributes to the spectacularization of the conflict. The main result is that there are no significant discursive differences, which leads to the conclusion that east-west rhetorical figures are used to produce a certain effect in the population, among those that highlight the euphemisms, dysphemisms, demonization and discursive polarization, resources that serve to emphasize fear and create even larger gaps of social significance.

AB  - Several studies show media messages activate or exacerbate racial stereotypes. This analysis, however, may be the first to examine which types of information-those that directly contradict media messages (i.e., crime-related) or general news (i.e., non-crime-related)-are most effective in abating stereotypes. Its findings suggest fear of crime is becoming more a human fear, not just a racial one. Furthermore, it suggests that for younger Americans, the concomitant dyad of the black criminal stereotype-race and crime-is fueled more by crime than by race.

AB  - In recent years, academic research and investigative reports have brought to light several cases of computational propaganda (i.e. orchestrated attempts to manipulate public opinion or the outcome of elections via social media), as well as proof that filter algorithms amplify right-wing conservative content on Japanese social media. Piecing together the scattered pieces of a puzzle, this article summarizes recent findings from various disciplines and provides an overview of the mechanisms and potential scope of computational propaganda in politics. Although there is no conclusive evidence of who is behind this anonymous activity, an analysis of these findings demonstrates increasing circumstantial evidence that certain factions of the LDP are actively using computational propaganda, either by commissioning external contractors or through its online support group, J-NSC, thereby condoning and appealing to anonymous Internet right-wingers (netto uyo). The concluding discussion assesses the effects and consequences of computational propaganda on the political sphere in contemporary Japan.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the Canadian public's perspective regarding clinical trials. Methods: We surveyed 1602 Ontario and British Columbia residents to ascertain their understanding of and willingness to participate in clinical trials. Results: Clinical trials are regarded positively with overall perceptions that they provide societal and personal benefits. Most respondents were somewhat (49%) or very willing (19%) to participate in a clinical trial. This increased with age and level of education. It was also greater among those with poor or very poor health, those with multiple chronic conditions, and those who had previously been invited into a clinical trial, all of which were correlated with age. Still, there was room for improvement in awareness and understanding of clinical trials. Forty-three percent of those surveyed felt not very informed or not at all informed and 37% had no opinion regarding clinical trials. Respondents would most often turn to their treating physician if considering participating in a clinical trial and least often to social media. Conclusion: While Canadians' views about clinical trials are generally positive, they are somewhat muted and a significant minority feels poorly or not at all informed. They are less willing to participate in clinical research than Americans and are roughly equivalent to Europeans. While clinicians are the top choice for learning about clinical trials, they have little or no training and little time for this role. As we move toward integrating clinical trials into the practice setting, these issues of time, training, and resources must be addressed.

AB  - Besides the traditional methods of targeting customers, social media presents its own set of opportunities. While companies look for a simple way with a large number of responses, social media platforms like Twitter can allow them to do just that. For example, by creating a hashtag and prompting followers to tweet their answers to some question they can quickly get a large number of answers about a question while simultaneously engaging their customers. Additionally, consumers share their opinions about services and products in public and with their social circles. This valuable data can be used to support business decisions. However, it is huge amounts of unstructured data that is difficult to extract meaningful information out of them. Social Media Analytics is the field which makes insights out of social media data and analyzes its sentiment rather than just reading and counting text. In this article, we used Twitter data to get insight from public opinion hidden in data. The support vector machine algorithm is used to classify sentiment of tweets whether it is positive or negative and the unigram applied as a feature extraction method. The experiments were conducted using large set of training dataset and the algorithm achieved high accuracy around 87%.

AB  - When and why do communities accept novel ideas as intuitively convincing? In this study, we make use of the socio-cultural fragmentation of Israeli society to expose the discursive processes shaping the culture-dependent resonance of ideas. Specifically, we trace how Israeli president Reuven Rivlin's interpretation of two lethal attacks by Jewish extremists on a Palestinian family and the Jerusalem Gay Pride Parade was received across Israel's ultra-orthodox, settler, LGBT, and Palestinian communities, as well as the mainstream right, center, and left. In a comparative analysis of media coverage catering to these groups, we distinguish six discursive responses to proposed ideas, which depend on their perception as plausible and appropriate given prior community beliefs. Our findings suggest a distinction between two possible meanings of resonance: Some ideas click' and are seamlessly appropriated in passing by a community, while others strike a chord' and raise a salient and emotional public debate.

AB  - Social media websites are rapidly changing the way that Americans live and communicate with one another. Social media sites encourage individuals to constantly share information about one's self (and constantly seek information about others) that would have been private in the past. This experience can alter how an individual views the world in ways that political scientists have not been able to fully capture. In a cross-sectional survey of the American public I find a strong correlation between the use of Facebook and personal blogs and support for civil liberties. Individuals who spend more time self-publicizing on the Internet seem to value freedom of expression more, but also value the right to privacy less than individuals who use social media less often. This pattern suggests that technology may be altering American attitudes on basic democratic values and highlights the need for dynamic research designs that account for the causal effect Internet use may have on individual political development.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the extent of media-based public health advocacy versus pro-industry messaging regarding sugar-sweetened beverages ( SSBs).
   Design: We conducted a systematic analysis to identify and examine all articles regarding SSBs published in all mainstream British print newspapers and their online news websites from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2014. We initially conducted a brief literature search to develop appropriate search terms and categorisations for grouping and analysing the articles. Articles were then coded according to the publishing newspaper, article type, topic, prominence and slant ( pro-SSB or anti-SSB). A contextual analysis was undertaken to examine key messages in the articles.
   Results: We identified 374 articles published during 2014. The majority of articles ( 81%) suggested that SSBs are unhealthy. Messaging from experts, campaign groups and health organisations was fairly consistent about the detrimental effects of SSB on health. However, relatively few articles assessed any approaches or solutions to potentially combat the problems associated with SSBs. Only one-quarter ( 24%) suggested any policy change. Meanwhile, articles concerning the food industry produced consistent messages emphasising consumer choice and individual responsibility for making choices regarding SSB consumption, and promoting and advertising their products. The food industry thus often managed to avoid association with the negative press that their products were receiving.
   Conclusions: SSBs were frequently published in mainstream British print newspapers and their online news websites during 2014. Public health media advocacy was prominent throughout, with a growing consensus that sugary drinks are bad for people's health. However, the challenge for public health will be to mobilise supportive public opinion to help implement effective regulatory policies. Only then will our population's excess consumption of SSBs come under control.

AB  - Background: Throughout history, people have soothed their fear of disease outbreaks by searching for someone to blame. Such was the case with the April 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak. Mexicans and other Latinos living in the US were quickly stigmatized by non-Latinos as carriers of the virus, partly because of news reports on the outbreak's alleged origin in Mexican pig farms.
   Methods: In this exploratory study we examined the psychological processes of cue convergence and associative priming, through which many people likely conflated news of the H1N1 outbreak with pre-existing cognitive scripts that blamed Latino immigrants for a variety of social problems. We also used a transactional model of stress and coping to analyze the transcripts from five focus groups, in order to examine the ways in which a diverse collection of New England residents appraised the threat of H1N1, processed information about stereotypes and stigmas, and devised personal strategies to cope with these stressors.
   Results: Twelve themes emerged in the final wave of coding, with most of them appearing at distinctive points in the stress and coping trajectories of focus group participants. Primary and secondary appraisals were mostly stressful or negative, with participants born in the USA reporting more stressful responses than those who were not. Latino participants reported no stressful primary appraisals, but spoke much more often than Whites or Non-Hispanic Blacks about negative secondary appraisals. When interactions between participants dealt with stigmas regarding Latinos and H1N1, Latinos in our focus groups reported using far more negative coping strategies than Whites or Non-Hispanic Blacks. When discussions did not focus on stereotypes or stigmas, Latino participants spoke much more often about positive coping strategies compared to members of these same groups.
   Conclusions: Participants in all five focus groups went through a similar process of stress and coping in response to the threat of H1N1, though individual responses varied by race and ethnicity. Stigmatization has often been common during pandemics, and public health and emergency preparedness practitioners can help to mitigate its impacts by developing interventions to address the social stressors that occur during outbreaks in highly-localized geographic regions.

AB  - Are human rights a core value of US foreign policy? If so, how does the United States enforce human rights standards? Extant studies maintain that mass media, public opinion, and/or political concerns drive US decisions to engage in humanitarian military interventions. In this study, we explore the extent to which "human rights institutionalization" through the State Department's human rights reporting affects the likelihood of US humanitarian interventions. We find that human rights institutionalization is a viable, and perhaps even the best, explanation for the robust connection between human rights violations and deployment of the US military. These findings suggest that the United States is willing to undertake costly action to enforce international standards of human rights, but with some important caveats. Overall, we provide large-N, quantitative support for the broader shifts in US humanitarian intervention described by qualitative scholars and experts in US strategy and security policy.

AB  - Focusing on the salient case of news interviewing, this paper investigates the role of journalism in the normalization of radical right-wing politics and the discourses of nationalism and nativism. Normalization is related to transformations in the socio-political landscape, the discursive strategies of political actors, the professional norms of journalism, and the discursive positioning of political views in news reporting. Data include news interviews with the leaders of the Swedish right-wing populist party, the Swedish Democrats. A discourse- and conversation analytical approach is applied to analyze the discursive representations and positioning of political views in four different contexts of interviewing: routine news events, political scandals, live two-party interviews, and set piece interviews. The study shows an overall tendency to normalize and legitimize the political views and language of the radical right. Distinctive practices and mechanisms are identified. The study highlights the challenges of journalism, related to the normalizing implications of the restricted forms of impartiality applied in news journalism.

AB  - Panic buying frequently occurs in health pandemics, disturbing both the market and people's lives. The situation is exacerbated by the easy spread of misinformation online. With a web-based experiment, the present study examined how user-generated anti-panic buying messages online could be leveraged to combat panic buying. It was found that user comments discussing how panic buying affects the lives of less advantaged social groups on social media, as well as high social endorsement of the comment, significantly reduced readers' derogation of the comment, thereby increasing negative attitudes toward panic buying and lowering intention to engage in it. The message format (narrative vs. non-narrative), however, did not influence the amount of impact it had on participants' attitude and purchase intentions. The findings contribute to research on message-based and heuristic-based persuasion processes in reading reactance-inducing messages online and guide the design of persuasive messages to reduce panic buying during health pandemics.

AB  - Background The rise of the popular e-cigarette, JUUL, has been partly attributed to various teen-friendly e-liquid flavours offered. However, the possible health risks associated with each e-liquid flavour still remain unclear. This research focuses on the possible associations between JUUL flavours and health symptoms using social media data from Reddit. Methods Keyword filtering was used to obtain 5,746 JUUL flavour-related posts and 7927 health symptom-related posts from June 2015 to April 2019 from Reddit. Posts from September 2016 to April 2019 were used to conduct temporal analysis for nine health symptom categories and the 8 JUUL flavours. Finally, associations between the JUUL flavours and health symptom categories were examined on the user level using generalised estimating equation models. Results According to our temporal analysis, Mango and Mint were the most discussed JUUL flavours on Reddit. Respiratory and throat symptoms were the most discussed health issues together with JUUL on Reddit over time. Respiratory symptoms had potential associations with the Mango, Mint and Fruit JUUL flavours. Digestive symptoms had a potential association with the Creme flavour, psychological symptoms had a potential association with the Cucumber flavour, and cardiovascular symptoms had a potential association with the tobacco flavours. Conclusions Mango and Mint were the two most mentioned JUUL flavours on Reddit. Certain JUUL flavours were more likely to be mentioned together with certain categories of health symptoms by the same Reddit users. Our findings could prompt further medical research into the health symptoms associated with different e-liquid flavours.

AB  - Partisan effects on media consumption have been widely documented, with considerable attention given to partisan influences on selective exposure. Although researchers have debated the degree to which selective exposure drives media consumption in general and partisan consumption of the news in particular, one of the hypothesized mechanisms linked to this phenomenon seems inherently plausible: Exposure to disliked news coverage can generate psychological discomfort. The physiological effects of this hypothesized discomfort were examined by determining how political partisanship influences release of the stress hormone, cortisol, following exposure to news coverage of a presidential election. The study was conducted in the week following the 2008 election. Participants were students at a large, mostly conservative state university who read news coverage about the election victory of Barack Obama or a set of control news stories. Results indicated that conservative political identification was associated with more negative and less positive emotional responses and with a spike in salivary cortisol levels. Contrary to predictions, however, the cortisol spikes appeared to operate independent of self-reported emotional distress. The implications of these results are considered as they relate to selective exposure and the physical health of partisans who follow political news.

AB  - When a political issue rises to the top of the public agenda, it puts pressure on decision-makers, shifts power to actors engaging with the issue, and opens a window of opportunity. This article shows that online mass media contributed to the rapid rise of climate change on European public agendas in and around 2019. It also suggests that climate issue publics, that is particularly concerned and interested citizens, were influenced most. Conversely, citizens without strong climate opinions are not subject to influence from intensive media coverage. The results come from vector autoregression (VAR) models that take advantage of unique daily salience time series. The time series are constructed from weekly repeated nationally representative surveys of the public (N = 25,445) and online news articles (N = 6,905) by a dominant mass media news outlet that boasts a particularly large, trustful, and diverse audience. Traditional mass media can retain a powerful agenda-setting role even in increasingly fragmented media environments. But the target of their influence depends on the issue and the composition of corresponding issue publics, plausibly due in part to individual differences in use and processing of information about the issue.

AB  - Despite a large body of literature documenting factors influencing general political participation, research has lagged in understanding what motivates participation regarding specific issues. Our research fills this gap by examining the interplay of perceptions of media bias, trust in government, and political efficacy on individuals' levels of general and issue-specific political participation. Using survey data with indicators related to general political participation, our results demonstrate that perceptions of media bias overall are negatively related to general political participation. Moreover, this relationship is an indirect one, mediated by trust in government and political efficacy. Using survey data with indicators of issue-specific political participation in the context of stem cell research, our results show thatcontrary to the relationship found for general political participationperceptions of media bias are directly and positively associated with issue-specific participation. Implications for political participation and media bias theories are discussed.

AB  - This paper examines and deconstructs the Rio Scale, focusing primarily on the recently published Rio Scale 2.0 concept, from the perspective of a social scientist. I argue that although there is value in developing tools to help astronomers and other scientists communicate their perceptions about the significance of a contact event to the media and the general public, the Rio Scale 2.0 remains problematic conceptually and, thus, does not represent a robust method for assessing or communicating the import of a valid contact. Therefore, it should not be used as a method for informing the media or the general public about scenarios that involve the detection of valid signals suggesting the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence.

AB  - This work is based on the mediatisation of society theory, which establishes more attached importance and the presence of the mass media as mediators in various social processes, as well as on Production Studies, that analyse creative skills to draw an audience, to apply these theories to the media representation of the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective is to analyse how the generalist media have represented male/female scientists, who have become social benchmarks during the first COVID-19 wave in Spain. Our initial hypothesis considers that the purpose of the mediatisation of scientific discourse was to contribute answers to, and to keep society calm, in an uncertainty context. By content and discourse analyses with a sample formed by 172 pieces of work published between 25 January and 5 July 2020 in four Spanish digital newspapers, we observed how these specialists not only became the usual sources of journalistic information but were also the main leading figures in them. The mass media pay attention to their statements, but also to their aesthetics and communication style, which are singular compared to conventional power to date. Science enters the national section with its own image and explanatory intentionality. Nonetheless, constant overexposure and its link with governments making controversial decisions influence the image held by the public opinion of scientists with time, which dissociates them from its knowledge and identifies them with political power.

AB  - Even though a certain degree of political bias is unavoidable in the media, strong media bias is likely to have an impact on society, especially on the formation of public opinion. This research proposes a data-driven method for quantifying political bias of media contents. With a document classification technique called doc2vec and social data from Facebook posts, a model for analysing the bias is developed. By applying the model to contents of major South Korean newspapers, this paper demonstrates quantitatively that significant political bias exists in the newspapers in line with the perceived political bias.

AB  - The internet provides a free and convenient platform for the public to obtain political information and participate in political life. Meanwhile, there occurs fierce confrontation of various values and ideologies, shaping a complicated and changeable field of public opinion. The strategies of civic participation and the generation of public opinion show quite different characteristics in such a mediatized society. This article aimed to study civic participation in Chinese cyberpolitics and to find its patterns and the logic behind it. Due to the natural advantage of the environmental issues in its commonality, the internet events in the last decade related to the PX (para-xylene) project were selected as the research object. This study used grounded theory as the method and conducted a cross-case analysis on the original data captured on Weibo-one of the most popular social media sites in China. Finally, four patterns of civic participation in internet events were found and summarized, as well as the intervention and influence of media logic in different modes. However, it is political logic, rather than media logic, that reveals greater vitality in the civic participation of cyber deliberation. Mediatization does exist but is far from dominance. It has certain significance for the supervision and management of public opinion and the rational and harmonious development of civic participation in public issues.

AB  - Diabetes is a growing yet misunderstood health concern in the United States. This study examined the ways in which diabetes has been framed by the New York Times over the past decade. The public's perception of the causes and solutions to complex problems such as diabetes has significant implications for the way public policy interventions are viewed; therefore, understanding how diabetes is being framed in the media can be an important first step in shifting public opinion about ways to combat the disease. A content analysis of 239 articles published in the New York Times between 2000 and 2010 revealed that nearly one-third of articles failed to differentiate between type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes, which may cause confusion given substantial differences in the root cause and treatment of each. An examination of frames used within each type of diabetes showed that the overall dominant frame across types was either a medical frame or a behavioral frame, with deficient use of a societal frame. The limited use of societal-level framing may make it difficult for the public to see the wider consequences of diabetes and decreases the likelihood of public support for policy solutions to combat the disease.

AB  - This study explores the confluence of moral reasoning and strategic framing in public relations tactics to address cultural variations in national policy debates. While much scholarly attention has been paid to the ways in which news media both represent and misrepresent U.S. Muslims through the ways stories are framed, much less work has been devoted to Muslim self-framing in public discourse, and its implications for public relations theory. To address this gap in understanding the ways some Muslim Americans use public relations as a tool of self-representation, this study examines more than 700 press releases issued by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) during the first year of the Donald Trump presidency. Using Moral Foundations Theory to operationalize the moral evaluations present in the frames, this study found four strategic frames: Islamophobia reactions, legal responses, public sphere engagement, and interfaith solidarity. It also examines the calls to action employed in the press releases. The findings show that the press release as a public relations tactic served as a critical venue for emphasizing individual rights and participation in public life through the deployment of moral language.

AB  - Bounded Generalized Reciprocity (BGR) hypothesizes that expectations of reciprocity provide the foundation for ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation. These expectations can be influenced by interaction with outgroup members, including vicarious interaction through media. This analysis examines how non-Black participants view helping behavior by Black individuals, and how their interpretations of helping scenarios influence intergroup attitudes. Participants (n= 211) were randomly assigned to view a news clip in which a Black or White hero saves someone White, or whose race was not portrayed. When viewing a clip with an ambiguous victim, participants were significantly more likely to report that the victim was not White when the hero was Black - indicating an expectation of helping behavior between Whites and Blacks. However, when a Black hero saved an unambiguously White victim, participants were more accurate in their recall. Victim race recall and hero race interacted to predict future reciprocity expectations, such that Black heroes saving a victim recalled as White (regardless of accuracy) resulted in increased positive reciprocity expectations. Positive reciprocity then predicted motivation to avoid prejudice and prejudiced attitudes. These results have implications for how media depictions of helping behaviors may impact intergroup beliefs and attitudes.

AB  - Echoing the anti-pollution and resource conservation campaigns in the United States in the early-to-mid-twentieth century, some scholars advocate mobilising support for environmental issues by harnessing the notion of environmental patriotism. Taking action to reduce the impact of global warming has also been cast as a patriotic cause. Drawing upon quantitative data from a recent national survey, we examine the link between patriotism and environmental attitudes in Australia, focussing upon climate change. We find that patriotism has a largely neutral association with concern over environmental issues, with the exception of climate change and, to a lesser extent, wildlife preservation. Expressing concern over climate change appears to be unpatriotic for some Australians. Even after controlling for political party identification and other important correlates of environmental issue concerns, patriots are less likely than others to prioritise climate change as their most urgent environmental issue and less likely to believe that climate change is actually occurring.

AB  - The number of multiracial candidates seeking office is growing in an increasingly diverse America. This raises questions about how the media frame candidates with potentially complex racial backgrounds and how voters respond to these frames. We investigate the impact of media frames that emphasize race and gender attributes using survey experiments on Kamala Harris-the first Black woman and first Asian woman vice president. Our findings are mixed. In a survey experiment conducted after her nomination, headlines emphasizing different elements of Harris's race or gender had no impact on public attitudes. In an experiment conducted after Harris was inaugurated, however, headlines that cued her gender only or both her gender and her Black racial background boosted popular support. Taken together, these findings suggest that some types of identity-based cues may matter, but the effects are sensitive to experimental settings and contexts.

AB  - The European Commission initiative on collective redress was a failed attempt to introduce a form of class action in the European Union. Business organizations were firmly opposing the proposal, while citizen interest groups were mobilized to support it. The outcome was rather puzzling because some previous research suggests that business organizations in the European Union most often find themselves unsuccessful in defending the status quo, especially in the field of environmental and consumer protection. Business lobbying success in this case is explained by the low media salience of the issue and diverging preferences among public officials. The article illustrates how lobbying success in the European Union can also be achieved by maintaining the status quo and contributes to our understanding of contextual factors, most notably the role of policymakers.

AB  - Though the contemporary media environment is filled with many different sources disseminating communications about science-including journalists, politicians and opinion leaders, and researchers-few studies have examined how messages about science communicated by different sources directly influence audience opinion about scientific research itself. This experiment (N = 170) used stimuli articles that reflected different presentation sources (3: political/public relations/researcher) and types of science research (2: "hard"/"soft") to examine effects on people's attitudes toward the featured research project's (a) utility and (b) worthiness of federal grant funding, while controlling for individual differences in political attitudes and interest in science. Overall, political-source messages suppressed ratings of the project's worthiness of funding and utility, and while messages from the researcher source produced greater utility ratings compared to the public relations source for soft science projects, this pattern was reversed for hard science research. Additionally, different sources influenced people's comprehension of articles they read. We interpret these results within the larger landscape of science communication and conclude with brief practical recommendations for those engaging in science communication.

AB  - Recent research has noted the persistence of a long continuum of "anti-welfare" discourses that are increasingly embedded in the UK news media, political communication, and popular culture (e.g. Golding and Middleton 1982. Images of Welfare: Press and Public Attitudes to Poverty. Oxford: Mark Robertson; Jensen 2014. "Welfare Commonsense, Poverty Porn and Doxosophy." Sociological Research Online 19 (3): 277-283; Morrison 2019. Scroungers: Moral Panics and Media Myths. London: Zed Books). Historical distinctions between the "deserving" and "undeserving poor" have been sharpened by successive governments in the service of varying shades of neoliberal governance. While Margaret Thatcher castigated "shirkers" in fostering an ideology of economic self-reliance, both New Labour and the Coalition obsessed over "welfare reform": promoting an ideology of "work" in symbolic opposition to supposed cultures of "worklessness". But, while "scroungerphobia" (Deacon 1978. "The Scrounging Controversy: Public Attitudes Towards the Unemployed in Contemporary Britain." Social Policy and Administration 12 (2): 120-135) is now a widely recognised sociological phenomenon, scholarly attention to the concept has largely been reserved for its manifestation in tabloid newspapers, political rhetoric and, latterly, "poverty porn" television. Even recent work considering the public's contribution to scrounger discourse(s) on social media focuses on mainstream platforms, such as Twitter and newspaper comment threads (e.g. Van Der Bom et al. 2018. "'It's not the Fact They Claim Benefits but Their Useless, Lazy, Drug Taking Lifestyles we Despise': Analysing Audience Responses to Benefits Street Using Live Tweets." Discourse, Context & Media 21: 36-45; Morrison 2019. Scroungers: Moral Panics and Media Myths. London: Zed Books; Paterson 2020). This paper begins to address this oversight, by examining how normative anti-welfare discourses infiltrate everyday communication in more disparate online communities - including niche consumer forums. It draws on previously unpublished findings from an analysis of welfare-related conversations in these and other spaces at the height of a recent moral panic over "scroungers": the period from 2013-2016, when Conservative-led governments strove to legitimise sweeping benefit cuts and punitive "welfare reform".

AB  - What explains variation in individual attitudes toward government deficits? Although macroeconomic stance is of paramount importance for contemporary governments, our understanding of its popular politics is limited. We argue that popular attitudes regarding austerity are influenced by media (and wider elite) framing. Information necessary to form preferences on the deficit is not provided neutrally, and its provision shapes how voters understand their interests. A wide range of evidence from Britain between 2010 and 2015 supports this claim. In the British Election Study, deficit attitudes vary systematically with the source of news consumption, even controlling for party identification. A structural topic model of two major newspapers' reporting shows that content varies systematically with respect to coverage of public borrowing-in ways that intuitively accord with the attitudes of their readership. Finally, a survey experiment suggests causation from media to attitudes: deficit preferences change based on the presentation of deficit information.

AB  - As with many other infectious and chronic conditions, the COVID-19 crisis in the United States (U.S.) reveals severe inequities in health. The objective of this study was to describe public perceptions of disparities in mortality from COVID-19 and examine correlates of those perceptions. We fielded a nationally-representative survey in late April 2020, asking participants how much they agreed with four statements describing group-level COVID-19 disparities: older people compared to younger, people with chronic health conditions compared to those without, poorer people compared to wealthier, and Black people compared to white people. We also measured personal characteristics, experience with COVID-19, and information sources. Overall agreement with age- and health condition-related disparities was high (> 80%) while agreement with socioeconomic (SES) and racial disparities was lower (52%). Higher education and income were generally associated with greater agreement with disparities. Partisanship and information sources used were associated with perceptions of SESand racial-disparities, with Democrats and those attune to national news-but not Fox cable news-more likely to perceive these disparities. As of April 2020, information about age- and health condition-related disparities in COVID-19 was well known by the U.S. public, while information about social disparities was less recognized and varied along socioeconomic and partisan lines.

KW  - IDEOLOGY
AB  - Policy elites use rhetoric in speeches and press releases to provide framing that is intended to influence public opinion. These rhetorical events can be treated as instances in which speech usefully promotes particular discourses. Indeed, elected officials are able to influence how individuals think about problems and solutions through speeches and press releases. Two important rhetorical events in which political elites advance frames for social issues are annual state of the state addresses (SoSA) given by U.S. governors and gubernatorial press releases that inform media reporting about state policy. This study employed policy discourse and rhetorical analyses to examine SoSAs and press releases as rhetorical events within the context of educational policy. Our findings show that governors framed the roles of state government, governors, and educational stakeholders within a discourse that perpetuates a neoliberal version of education. In this framing, governors situated education's purpose as being workforce and economic development, ignoring its role in addressing social issues and preparing informed, engaged participants for democratic society. Given that individuals make decisions about how to address social issues and understand public institutions based on framing provided by political elites, these findings raise implications for state educational policies and the public purposes of education.

AB  - This paper describes a moral panic as a social phenomenon in relation to the issue of mineral development projects. A moral panic involves creating a sense of insecurity in a group of people by exaggerating facts that are perceived as a social problem. Mineral exploration and exploitation are activities that are particularly likely to spark public protests because of the common misunderstanding of the character and scale of the impact that they might have on the natural environment and local community. The paper presents the sources, mechanisms and results of such a moral panic based on the examples from Poland concerning various kinds of mineral resources that are extracted with the use of different methods and on a different scale. The perceived threats associated with mineral exploitation are often exaggerated and sometimes completely false, which is because society is susceptible to manipulation by the media. This causes substantial financial losses not only for exploration and mining companies which are forced to give up their projects even though particular environmental requirements are met, but also for the local communities themselves since they are deprived of potential jobs as well as income from taxes and mining royalties. The phenomenon of moral panic related to mineral development is a serious problem also because local government activists increasingly more often create such a panic out of political expediency. This kind of panic can also be created by other interest groups. It should be emphasised that resistance to a moral panic does not mean that one cannot object to geological and mining activities when this is justified; then such protests can be even more effective.

AB  - Social media now plays a pivotal role in electoral campaigns. Rapid dissemination of information through platforms such as Twitter has enabled politicians to broadcast their message to a wide audience. In this paper, we investigated the sentiment of tweets by the two main presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, along with almost 2.9 million tweets by Twitter users during the 2016 US Presidential Elections. We analyzed these short texts to evaluate how accurately Twitter represented the public opinion and real world events of significance related with the elections. We also analyzed the behavior of over a million distinct Twitter users to identify whether the platform was used to share original opinions and to interact with other users or whether few opinions were repeated over and over again with little inter-user dialogue. Finally, we wanted to assess the sentiment of tweets by both candidates and their impact on the election related discourse on Twitter. Some of our findings included the discovery that little original content was created by users and Twitter was primarily used for rebroadcasting already present opinions in the form of retweets with little communication between users. Also of significance was the finding that sentiment and topics expressed on Twitter can be a good proxy of public opinion and important election related events. Moreover, we found that Donald Trump offered a more optimistic and positive campaign message than Hillary Clinton and enjoyed better sentiment when mentioned in messages by Twitter users.

AB  - Public opinion in the United States about human-caused climate change has varied over the past 20 years, despite an increasing consensus about the issue in the expert community. Attitudes about climate change have been attributed to a number of factors including personal values, political ideology, the media environment and personal experience. Recent studies have found evidence that the temperature can influence one's opinion about climate change and willingness to change behaviour and/or support climate policy. Although there is some evidence that individual cool or warm years have influenced large-scale opinion about climate change, the extent to which temperature can explain the past variability in public opinion and public discourse about climate change at the national level is not known. Here we isolate the relationship between opinion about climate change and temperature at the national scale, using data from opinion polls, a discourse analysis of opinion articles from five major daily newspapers, and a national air temperature database. The fraction of respondents to national polls who express "belief in" or "worry about" climate change is found to be significantly correlated to U.S. mean temperature anomalies over the previous 3-12 months. In addition, the fraction of editorial and opinion articles which "agree" with the expert consensus on climate change is also found to be significantly correlated to U.S. mean temperature anomalies at seasonal and annual scales. These results suggest that a fraction of the past variance in American views about climate change could potentially be explained by climate variability.

KW  - Societal narcissism

KW  - WESTERN
AB  - Narcissism has become inculcated in many aspects of modern society. It can be found in the growing popularity of social media which enable users to post "selfies;" in the competitive race for fame, beauty and extravagant lifestyles; and in the public's fascination with power-hungry and greedy politicians and businesspeople featured on television and in the movies. Narcissism thrives when members of society admire, flatter and promote individuals with grandiose ideas and fantastical dreams. This paper extends the research of Mullins and Kopelman (The Public Opinion Quarterly, 48: 720730,1984), which studied whether or not excessive concern with the self is on the rise, using bestsellers as an unobtrusive indicator of societal narcissism for the period, 1950-1979. Carrying this research forward for another thirty years, it was found over a 60-year period that the proportion of narcissistic-related bestsellers increased approximately 100 % for hardcovers (from 19 % to 35 %); and also over a 19-year period for Amazon sales (from 15 % to 35 %).

AB  - How did the Austrian public think about immigrants at the peak of the 2015 migrant crisis? News media and policy makers suggested a cleavage in public opinion along the lines of humanitarian support and economic competition. We empirically disentangle these groups using a Single Category Implicit Association Test (SC-IAT). The data were collected by Project Implicit as a part of an online panel survey initiated by the Austrian National Election Study (AUTNES). The analyses reveal that Austrian citizens predominantly associate immigrants with the need for support. However, implicit associations also seem to vary depending on citizens' backgrounds and beliefs. The findings further indicate that implicit associations towards immigrants affect citizens' policy preferences.

KW  - the U.S. presidency
AB  - Film and television, as forms of popular culture, have the ability to both reflect and shape attitudes about a wide range of topics, including the American presidency. The role of popular media in shaping attitudes about political phenomena is particularly relevant in democracies where public opinion drives both the election and policy-making processes. Drawing on literature in political science, communication studies, and women's and gender studies, this article analyzes fictional portrayals of female presidents since the 1920s, as they both represent and challenge prevailing national attitudes about gender and the American presidency. The article identifies three key messages derived from popular cultural depictions of women presidents between 1980 and 2008, including how women presidents gain access to the nation's highest office, the ways in which masculine traits are valued in the administration of that office, and the unique challenges of negotiating the gender "double-binds" that women presidents are subject to beyond the Oval Office.

AB  - Forest certification has emerged as a market-based tool to safeguard the sustainability of the world's forests. Since media can shape public opinion, this study examines media treatment of forest certification in the United States, the world's largest producer and consumer of forest products. This study utilizes 309 print and digital newspaper articles published in the United States between 1989 and 2019 to evaluate which aspects of certification are highlighted, which are favored, and how these vary by region. We found that coverage of forest certification is overwhelmingly positive at both the regional (85%) and national (90.7%) levels. Environmental themes are most discussed nationally (48.8%) and regionally (36%), but thematic emphasis differs regionally. Although the Forest Steward Council is the most covered certification scheme at the national level, the Sustainable Forestry Initiative certification scheme prevails in southern media outlets. The focus of articles related to the American Tree Farm System (ATFS) is mostly sociocultural. This was expected as the ATFS focuses on certifying forestlands of family forest landowners in the United States. Our findings suggest newspaper coverage of forest certification is geographically heterogeneous, with regions establishing their preferred themes and schemes. This research will better situate forest certification as a tool for sustainable forest management in the United States.

AB  - Since the 1968 Chapel Hill study by McCombs and Shaw (1972), agenda-setting theory has become a main perspective of research on media effects, and it has been tested in many other countries outside the United States. The thematic meta-analysis of Chinese agenda-setting articles performed in this study identifies some important trends of agenda-setting research in mainland China, including an increase of interest in agenda-setting theory, a dominance of the original agenda-setting approach and focus, a diversity of topical domains, an atheoretical and non-empirical research tradition, and an increasing concern about the Internet. Challenges and future directions of Chinese agenda-setting research are also discussed in this study.

AB  - Purpose: To examine the relationship between disability-related humor and attitudes toward persons with disabilities in business students (i.e. "future employers"). Method: Students watched one of two films designed to reduce negative attitudes toward persons with disabilities (one humorous in tone and the other serious in tone) or no film at all, and completed a measure of attitudes toward persons with disabilities. Results: Results indicated that, after controlling for previous contact with persons with disabilities, age, and gender, students who watched the humorous film reported significantly more positive attitudes toward persons with disabilities. Conclusions: Disability humor may be an effective means of positively influencing attitudes toward persons with disabilities in future employers.

AB  - The rise of networked media has brought new opportunities and challenges for individuals' engagement with politics. Some scholars propose that norms around good citizenship are evolving as well. Yet, little attention has been paid to how those debates play out in everyday cultural understandings. Drawing on the case of Kony2012, a highly visible social change campaign, we illustrate how perceptions of good citizenship can be understood as a contest between frames, one conducted not only by elites but also by individuals as they create and spread user-generated content. Using the theoretical lens of the frame contest, we contrast the hopeful image of the networked citizen, presented in the Kony2012 campaign, with counter-frames of slacktivism, presented in memes circulated in response to the campaign and its supporters. We posit the frame contest as a mechanism through which to understand how conceptions of good citizenship may change over time.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH

KW  - NEWS
AB  - One of the main lines of reasoning in the contemporary debate on media effects is the notion that selective exposure to congruent information can lead to political polarization. Most studies are correlational, potentially plagued with self-report biases, and cannot demonstrate time order. Even less is known about the mechanisms behind such an effect. We conducted an online quasi-experiment with a sample matching the characteristics of the Dutch population closely (N = 501). We investigate how selective exposure can lead to polarized attitudes and which role frames, facts, and public opinion cues play. While we find that facts learned can help explaining attitude change and that selectivity can influence the perception of public opinion, we cannot confirm that people generally polarize.

AB  - How is it that the Swedish populist nationalist party the Sweden Democrats receives its strongest support from the established working class, in spite of the high degree of class voting and left-right mobilization which is known to characterize Swedish politics? Based on surveys from the SOM (Society, Opinion, Media) Institute as well as the Swedish National Elections Studies, this article shows that this is not a result of increasing anti-immigrant attitudes in the working class or of decreasing left-right polarization among voters. Rather, we present the argument that the weakening alignment between the working class and the Social Democratic Party and the weakened left-right polarization between the main parties have created a structure which has left room for a realignment between large parts of the working class and the Sweden Democrats along the alternative underlying ideological dimension of authoritarianism/libertarianism.

AB  - Conventional wisdom suggests that efforts to improve the lives of workers within oppressive labor conditions would be viewed at least neutrally, if not positively. Recent work, such as Powell (2014), counters this assumption. Our work extends this idea, applying it to deleterious effects on employee action rather than on employee opportunity. Specifically, we look at the case of Foxconn employee suicides in the spring of 2010. We conclude with a cautionary note: that public influence is indeed a powerful tool capable of much good, but that care must be taken to prevent it from being misused, even if unintentionally.

AB  - The "proximate casualties" hypothesis holds that popular support for American wars is undermined more by the deaths of American personnel from nearby areas than by the deaths of those from far away. However, no previous research has tested the mechanisms that might produce this effect. This omission contributes to three areas of lingering uncertainty within the war support literature: whether national or local losses have a greater effect on war support, whether the negative effects of war deaths are durable or temporary, and whether the negative effects of war deaths have a greater influence on the most or least attentive citizens. Analysis of Iraq War data shows that local losses have a greater effect on war support than national losses, that these casualty effects decay rapidly, and that citizens who closely follow news at the national and local levels are least affected by new information about war costs. These findings run contrary to the prevailing cost-benefit calculus model of war support.

AB  - This study explores the effect of negative news about an organization on its sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices. We focus on how public reports about controversial business practices motivate a company to make adjustments so that environmental and social concerns are better included in its supply chain management practices. Using agenda-setting theory, we identify managerial commitment as an important factor in transmitting external media pressure. We analyse longitudinal data, ranging from 2002 through 2014 and collected for more than 700 US-based corporations. Our findings reveal that companies significantly increase SSCM after being the subject of negative news, particularly when management commitment to environmental sustainability and social welfare is high. Our findings should encourage supply chain decision makers to consider more broadly how external stakeholders view their global supply chain operations. Our research sheds light on negative news as an external factor; previous literature used media attention as anecdotal evidence and focused more on internal company factors. We contribute to research in SSCM by studying the mediation effect. It is essential that supply chain decision makers better apprehend the importance of negative news, management commitment, and SSCM and understand their role in influencing public opinion.

AB  - It is widely thought that news organizations exhibit ideological bias, but rigorously quantifying such slant has proven methodologically challenging. Through a combination of machine-learning and crowdsourcing techniques, we investigate the selection and framing of political issues in fifteen major US news outlets. Starting with 803,146 news stories published over twelve months, we first used supervised learning algorithms to identify the 14 percent of articles pertaining to political events. We then recruited 749 online human judges to classify a random subset of 10,502 of these political articles according to topic and ideological position. Our analysis yields an ideological ordering of outlets consistent with prior work. However, news outlets are considerably more similar than generally believed. Specifically, with the exception of political scandals, major news organizations present topics in a largely nonpartisan manner, casting neither Democrats nor Republicans in a particularly favorable or unfavorable light. Moreover, again with the exception of political scandals, little evidence exists of systematic differences in story selection, with all major news outlets covering a wide variety of topics with frequency largely unrelated to the outlet's ideological position. Finally, news organizations express their ideological bias not by directly advocating for a preferred political party, but rather by disproportionately criticizing one side, a convention that further moderates overall differences.

AB  - To what extent does the public support the use of cyber weapons? We propose that public exposure to the destructive potential of cyber-attacks will dispel the clear cross-national preference for cyber strikes. To test this, we conducted two survey experiments (n=2,585) that examine support for cyber versus conventional military strikes in the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel. In study 1, we exposed respondents to television news reports depicting various forms of terror attacks, and then measured the subsequent support for retaliatory options. Findings indicate that the high public support for deploying cyber weapons dissipated entirely among respondents exposed to lethal cyber-attacks. In study 2, we probed this vanishing support, finding that exposure to destructive cyber-attacks undercuts the perception of cyber as a less lethal domain, therefore diminishing its appeal. We conclude by discussing how the fragile public preference for cyber weapons encourages military escalation in the short-term.

AB  - This article examines the centrality of Brazil within the future of climate policy and politics. The state of the carbon sink of the Amazon rainforest has long been an iconic marker of the condition of the Earth. Brazil has been innovative in developing many non-carbon forms of energy generation and use and it has played a major role in international debates on global warming since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. We examine various ways in which climate change has come to be centrally important in Brazilian public opinion. Survey evidence shows that Brazilians are the most concerned about issues of climate change - with less climate change scepticism as compared with more advanced' societies. Through using techniques of corpus linguistics we examine how Brazilian media has engendered and stabilized such a high and striking level of climate change concern. We show that the media helped to fix a climate change framing' of recent often strange weather. The article analyses the newly constructed Brazilian Corpus on Climate Change, presenting data on a scale and reach that is unique in this area of research.

AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly affected health care priorities. Objective: To explore and analyse trends in public online search for urological can-cers.Design, setting, and participants: We performed a retrospective analysis using the Google Health Trends online tool. Data related to urological cancer terms ("prostate cancer", "kidney cancer", and "bladder cancer") were extracted. We analysed trends for the whole world and for five countries: Italy, the UK, France, Sweden, and the USA.Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: A join-point regression model was used to define significant changes in trends over time. Week percentage changes (WPCs) were estimated to summarise linear trends. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the search volume during the COVID-19 pandemic period (from January 2020 to April 2021) and the equivalent period of 2018 and 2019.Results and limitations: During COVID-19, worldwide online interest decreased significantly for all urological cancers, especially prostate cancer (WPC: -13.9%, p = 0.004; WPC: -5.4%, p < 0.001; and WPC: -4.3%, p < 0.001, for prostate, kidney, and bladder cancers, respectively). The most important decline was observed in the USA. The interest for all cancers was significantly less during the COVID-19 pandemic than in the same periods of 2018 and 2019.

AB  - Background: Stigmatizing references to schizophrenia have a negative impact on self-esteem, deter treatment seeking and diminish the effectiveness of treatment.Aims: To analyze the reporting of schizophrenia in Portuguese newspapers.Method: We analyzed five high circulation Portuguese newspapers between 2007 and 2013. We selected all news containing the word esquizofrenia (schizophrenia). Several variables were collected.Results: About 1058 news items contained the word schizophrenia. Schizophrenia was mentioned metaphorically in 40% of the cases and in the context of Crime in 22%. When used in a Criminal context, schizophrenia was mostly attributed to people who were the perpetrators of the crime (93%). When used metaphorically, schizophrenia had a negative connotation in 90% of cases. We found an increasing reporting of schizophrenia in the criminal news and serious crimes.Conclusions: Our results suggest the media has an active role promoting stigma, as well as passively broadcasting and thus passing on prejudices.

AB  - Proceeding globalization and the increase in global mobility entail that a growing proportion of people in economically developed countries have a migration background, so that cultural diversity has become an integral characteristic of many societies. Consequently, national identifications and attitudes towards immigrants are gaining importance in both international and intra-societal contexts. Previous studies revealed that in some countries, including Germany, national identification is associated with negative attitudes towards outgroups. In the present article, the interplay between national identification and intergroup contact is analyzed, with xenophobia as the criterion. The study is based on a cross-sectional survey amongst members of the majority population in Germany. It was predicted and found that the association between national identification and xenophobia is moderated by intergroup contact. There was only an association between national identification and xenophobia in participants with below-average or average levels of contact, whilst for those with above-average levels of contact, there was no significant association. Thus, the results point to the importance of contact experiences as a path to neutralize the effects of national identification on xenophobia, possibly by assisting in a redefinition of national belonging.

AB  - Changes in the perception of disabled people and the shift towards the social model of disability should also be reflected in the media debate. On the one hand, media expose the dominant social attitudes towards disabled people, on the other hand, they play an important role in shaping public opinion, influencing ways of thinking and talking about disability. The aim of the paper is to examine the extent to which the term osoba niepeinosprawnaciq (person with a disability), which is seen in Poland as being connected to the social model of disability and the ideals of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, is used by the media and whether this is accompanied by changes in the presentation of social roles performed by disabled people. The analysis encompasses articles published in the selected Polish opinion-forming weekly magazines after ratifying the Convention (2012). The study shows that although the term osoba niepeinosprawnaciq. is gradually gaining popularity, this is not related to the way disabled people and their social roles are presented.

AB  - Britain's war in Afghanistan - specifically its latter stages, where the UK's role and casualties sustained in the conflict rose dramatically - coincided with the institutional emergence of Ministry of Defence-led 'Strategic Communication'. This article examines the circumstances through which domestic strategic communication developed within the UK state and the manner in which the 'narratives' supporting Britain's role in Afghanistan were altered, streamlined and 'securitised'. I argue that securitising the Afghanistan narrative was undertaken with the intention of misdirecting an increasingly sceptical UK public from the failure of certain aspects of UK counter-insurgency strategy - specifically its counter-narcotics and stabilisation efforts - by focusing on counter-terrorism, and of avoiding difficult questions about the UK's transnational foreign and defence policy outlook vis-a-vis the United States by asserting that Afghanistan was primarily a 'national security' issue. I conclude this article by arguing that the UK's domestic strategic communication approach of emphasising 'national security interests' may have created the conditions for institutionalised confusion by reinforcing a narrow, self-interested narrative of Britain's role in the world that runs counter to its ongoing, 'transnationalised' commitments to collective security through the United States and NATO.

AB  - Objectives Advance care planning is a key preparatory step in ensuring high-quality palliative and end of life care, and should be considered as a process, beginning with community-level conversations among lay persons. There is, however, indication that death talk among community-dwelling adults is not occurring, and there is a dearth of research examining why this is the case. This study aims to provide the first examination of barriers and facilitators to talking about death and dying among the general population in a UK region (Northern Ireland), and to provide a novel application of health behaviour change theory towards developing a theoretical understanding of the sources of this behaviour. Methods The study involved qualitative analysis of responses (n = 381 participants) to two open-ended questions within a cross-sectional online survey, with recruitment via social media of adults currently living in Northern Ireland. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted on open text responses per question, with the barriers and facilitators mapped on to health behaviour change models (the Behaviour Change Wheel COM-B and the Theoretical Domains Framework). Results The findings evidence a myriad of barriers and facilitators to engaging in death talk, with themes aligning to areas such as lack of acceptance of death in social contexts and fear of upsetting self or others, and a need to improve interpersonal communication skills for facilitating conversations and improve knowledge of the existing services around death and dying. A theoretical understanding of the drivers of death talk is presented with findings mapped across most components of the COM-B Behaviour Change Model and the Theoretical Domains Framework. Conclusions This study contributes to a small but emergent research area examining barriers and facilitators to talking about death and dying. Findings from this study can be used to inform new public health programmes towards empowering adults to have these conversations with others in their community towards upstreaming advance care planning.

AB  - A content analysis of top-selling video game magazines (Study 1) and of 149 video game covers (Study 2) demonstrated the commonality of overt racial stereotyping. Both studies revealed that minority females are virtually absent in game representations. Study 1 revealed that, in video game magazines, minority males, underrepresented generally, were more likely to be portrayed as athletes or as aggressive, and less likely to be depicted in military combat or using technology, than White males. Study 2 also showed evidence of the "dangerous" minority male stereotype in video game covers. Again, underrepresented overall, minority males were overrepresented as thugs, using extreme guns, and nonviolent games with both White and Black characters. Participants were faster at classifying violent stimuli following games with Black characters and at classifying nonviolent stimuli following games with White characters, indicating that images of popular video game characters evoke racial stereotypes.

AB  - This study employed digital footprints to explore why people engage in genetically modified (GM) food rumormongering on Chinese social media, Sina Weibo at both the group level and individual level. 9070 posts about GM food were obtained from 1 million users. Social network analysis was used to analyze the effect of peer influence on GM food rumormongering at the group level, and we did not find any effect that users would depend on their friendship network on social media to spread GM food rumors. To determine the effect of social media extravert, reputation and attitude on scientific rumormongering at the individual level, we used logistic regression. Results revealed that people who hold negative attitudes towards GM food and who are social media extraverts are more likely to spread rumors, while social reputation did not influence the spread of rumors.

AB  - This article employs Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) on a sample from British tabloid newspapers to unearth the representation of Islam and Muslims. It attempts to unpack the evolving discursive language and its impact on the reinvention and diffusion of negative stereotypes such as the 'terrorism' frame. With a specific focus the study considers the media's systematic distortion of Islamic conceptions/religious terminologies such as 'Islamist: Fatwa', Sharia', jihad: 'Hijab' and 'Islamic State: which are founded on what Edward Said calls the 'ideology of difference: Findings from this study show that such conceptions have not only lost their original significance as established in the mainstream Islamic literature, but have become on the one hand associated with the War on Terror and its ramifications and on the other have become exclusively signifying specific pejorative connotations. Fear and threat have become the meanings and flumes firmly embedded in these Islamic terminologies. In the minds of the public this association is now taken for granted due to the prevailing values being recurrently circulated through the media, political speeches, 'think-tanks' literature and policy-making documents.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of personalized news recommender system design on selective exposure, elaboration, and knowledge. Scholars have worried that proliferation of personalization technologies will degrade public opinion by isolating people from challenging perspectives. Informed by selective exposure research, this study examines personalized news recommender system designs using a communication mediation model. Recommender system design choices examined include computer-generated personalized recommendations, user-customized recommendations, and full or limited news information environments based on recommendations. Results from an online mock election experiment with Ohio adult Internet users indicate increased selective exposure when using personalized news systems. However, portals recommending news based on explicit user customization result in significantly higher counterattitudinal news exposure. Expected positive effects on elaboration and indirect effects on knowledge through elaboration are found only in personalized news recommender systems that display only recommended headlines. Lastly, personalized news recommender system use has a negative direct effect on knowledge.

AB  - The Trojan Hose Affair scandal alleged that there was a hardline extremist Islamism plot to take over British state schools in Birmingham. While community groups and government officials battled to take control of the narrative, the pupils who were ultimately at the center of the scandal, were not considered. This paper is based on research conducted in 2015, with students at one of the schools implicated in the Trojan Horse Affair. Through seven one-to-one interviews and a group discussion, the research finds that students portrayed their selves in a state of constant psychological reconciliation due to the heightened mediatization, racialization, and securitization of Islam and Muslims, during and after the Trojan Horse affair. This caused increased levels of anxiety in students, which peaked around the constant surveillance through the gaze of the media, teachers, and Ofsted inspectors, creating a double-edged Panopticon. The paper particularly underscores student concerns for potential social exclusion and discrimination they may experience as a result of the school affiliation.

AB  - Past studies have shown positive relationships between use of social network sites (SNSs) and political engagement, but an understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship is limited because the studies often did not take into account the diverse affordances of SNSs that can influence participation in different ways. Adopting the O-S-R-O-R (Orientation-Stimulus-Reasoning-Orientation-Response) model of political communication effects, this study examined the roles of Facebook network size, connections with public political actors, use for news, and political expression on political attitudes, protest, and participation. Structural equation analyses were conducted based on data from a national sample in Hong Kong, a city-state with one of the world's highest Facebook penetration rates. Results showed that Facebook network size and connections with public political actors exhibit both direct and indirect effects on participation through Facebook news, expression, and efficacy. Facebook news exhibited indirect effects primarily though political expression. A discriminant function analysis also showed that age, education, and online news exposure were the most influential variables for distinguishing Facebook users and nonusers. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - This study explored the stigmatized portrayals of single womanhood in news media by content analyzing news coverage from Mainland China of single women and single men from 2008 to 2013. Among the three prevalent news frames (conflict, responsibility, and human interest), the results showed that news reports relating to single women commonly employed more human-interest frames and concentrated on single women's conflicts with other social groups as well as the conflicts between singles and societal expectation of population sustainability. News stories also unduly ascribed the responsibility for being single' to the women themselves, but such individual attribution was not applied to single men. As an exploratory study, our research shed light on how news framing is gendered to reinforce stereotypes and facilitate mechanisms for control. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in relation to public opinion about single womanhood and the intersectional oppression of single women in Chinese society.

AB  - Comments in designated sections of newspaper websites and on social media platforms are the most prominent form of user participation in journalism, offering the opportunity to connect to the audience. Yet, rising levels of dark participation in the form of hate speech, disinformation, and strategic attempts to influence public opinion, provide new challenges for media organizations and require moderators to ensure a minimum of discursive quality. Newsrooms employ a variety of moderation strategies. Based on computer assisted telephone interviews with German journalists working for online newspapers (N = 274), we identified explanatory factors for the implementation of discursive-interactive and authoritative-interactive moderation practices. The results suggest that left-leaning media tend to engage more in authoritative-interactive as well as discursive-interactive moderation than right-leaning media. If media organizations establish a participative communicative setting, moderators engage more with the audience although the prevalence of dark participation is higher.

AB  - Objective: Initiatives to reduce neighborhood-based health disparities require access to meaningful, timely, and local information regarding health behavior and its determinants. We examined the validity of Twitter as a source of information for neighborhood-level analysis of dietary choices and attitudes.
   Materials and Methods: We analyzed the "healthiness" quotient and sentiment in food-related tweets at the census tract level, and associated them with neighborhood characteristics and health outcomes. We analyzed keywords driving the differences in food healthiness between the most and least-affluent tracts, and qualitatively analyzed contents of a random sample of tweets.
   Results: Significant, albeit weak, correlations existed between healthiness and sentiment in food-related tweets and tract-level measures of affluence, disadvantage, race, age, U.S. density, and mortality from conditions associated with obesity. Analyses of keywords driving the differences in food healthiness revealed foods high in saturated fat (eg, pizza, bacon, fries) were mentioned more frequently in less-affluent tracts. Food-related discussion referred to activities (eating, drinking, cooking), locations where food was consumed, and positive (affection, cravings, enjoyment) and negative attitudes (dislike, personal struggles, complaints).
   Discussion: Tweet-based healthiness scores largely correlated with offline phenomena in the expected directions. Social media offer less resource-intensive data collection methods than traditional surveys do. Twitter may assist in informing local health programs that focus on drivers of food consumption and could inform interventions focused on attitudes and the food environment.
   Conclusions: Twitter provided weak but significant signals concerning food-related behavior and attitudes at the neighborhood level, suggesting its potential usefulness for informing local health disparity reduction efforts.

AB  - Drawing from learning and attitude theories, the current investigation explores the effect of media on students' attitudes. Study 1 was a content analysis of 34 films classified as university-themed comedies and showed that such films highlighted risk-taking (e. g., alcohol consumption) and minimized the importance of academics (e. g., studying). The purpose of Study 2 was to demonstrate the impact of these films on the attitudes university students hold. One hundred and twenty-four undergraduates viewed a segment of either Animal House or a neutral film and results showed that viewing Animal House brought about positive attitudes towards substance use and negative attitudes towards academics even when controlling for past substance use and movie viewing frequency. The discussion focuses on future directions.

AB  - In contrast to the European tendency toward parliamentary enactment of euthanasia reforms, policies on physician-assisted suicide (PAS) in both Canada and the United States were promulgated by high court rulings. These rulings were very different, however: the Supreme Court of Canada upheld a constitutional right to assisted-suicide while the Supreme Court of the United States denied that any constitutional right exists. This comparative analysis of public opinion, media coverage, federalism, interest groups, and jurisprudence argues that the key variable explaining these divergent policy outcomes was the one-sided debate over PAS in the United States, while a two-sided debate occurred in Canada.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 is one of the greatest threats to human beings in terms of health care, economy, and society in recent history. Up to this moment, there have been no signs of remission, and there is no proven effective cure. Vaccination is the primary biomedical preventive measure against the novel coronavirus. However, public bias or sentiments, as reflected on social media, may have a significant impact on the progression toward achieving herd immunity.
   Objective: This study aimed to use machine learning methods to extract topics and sentiments relating to COVID-19 vaccination on Twitter.
   Methods: We collected 31,100 English tweets containing COVID-19 vaccine-related keywords between January and October 2020 from Australian Twitter users. Specifically, we analyzed tweets by visualizing high-frequency word clouds and correlations between word tokens. We built a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model to identify commonly discussed topics in a large sample of tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis to understand the overall sentiments and emotions related to COVID-19 vaccination in Australia.
   Results: Our analysis identified 3 LDA topics: (1) attitudes toward COVID-19 and its vaccination, (2) advocating infection control measures against COVID-19, and (3) misconceptions and complaints about COVID-19 control. Nearly two-thirds of the sentiments of all tweets expressed a positive public opinion about the COVID-19 vaccine; around one-third were negative. Among the 8 basic emotions, trust and anticipation were the two prominent positive emotions observed in the tweets, while fear was the top negative emotion.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that some Twitter users in Australia supported infection control measures against COVID-19 and refuted misinformation. However, those who underestimated the risks and severity of COVID-19 may have rationalized their position on COVID-19 vaccination with conspiracy theories. We also noticed that the level of positive sentiment among the public may not be sufficient to increase vaccination coverage to a level high enough to achieve vaccination-induced herd immunity. Governments should explore public opinion and sentiments toward COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination, and implement an effective vaccination promotion scheme in addition to supporting the development and clinical administration of COVID-19 vaccines.

AB  - The current study examined the phenomenon of teenage sexting through an analysis of 1030 comments from 15 online stories in the US and the UK. Four competing messages emerged: (1) Innocuity: Is sexting a harmless or harmful activity?; (2) Comparability: Were teenagers in the past the same or different than current teenagers?; (3) Criminality: Is teenage sexting a criminal offense or a legal activity?; and (4) Sexuality: Is teenage sexting sexual exploration or sexual exploitation? The online comments indicated an overall struggle between two different discursive constructions of sexting: A discourse of normal connection and a discourse of aberrant exposure. Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Censorship, banning, and imprisonment are different methods used to suppress dissenting voices in traditional media and have now evolved into a new form with bot and troll accounts in the digital media age in Turkey. Is it possible to construct a bloc with counter-trolls against the escalating political pressure on the media in the post-truth era? Are counter-trolls capable of setting the agenda? This article discusses the possibility of constructing a bloc against the escalating political pressure in Turkey on the media through counter-trolls in the context of communicative rationality. First, it observes the ruling party's troll politics strategy on Twitter, then examines the counter-discourses against political pressure today; thereafter it analyzes the discourse in hashtags on the agenda of the Bogazigi University protests. Firstly, 18,000 tweets are examined to understand the suppress-communication strategy of the AK Party trolls. Secondly, the agenda-setting capacity of counter-trolls is observed between January 1, 2020, and February 5, 2021, and 18,000 tweets regarding Bogazigi protests are examined to analyze the communication strategy of the counter-trolls. The study shows that the populist government instrumentalizes communication in social media, and Twitter does not have enough potential for the Gramscian counter-hegemony, but the organized actions and discourses have the potential to create public opinion.

AB  - As part of the recent recovery of forgotten histories of early media research in the United States, this article examines a correspondence between Chicago political scientist and Social Science Research Council (SSRC) founder, Charles E. Merriam, and journalist Walter Lippmann. The correspondence indicates that media and communication research was a significant constituent of Merriam's original vision for the SSRC. The 1921-1927 correspondence describes this vision; it also suggests that the formative idea for the SSRC was profoundly influenced by Lippmann's Public Opinion (1922), especially the final chapter on "Organized Intelligence.''

AB  - Seizures have long been associated with misconceptions and stigma. Exponential growth in Internet use has seen the rapid expansion of social media, such as Twitter, for health promotion. In view of the popularity of Twitter, we sought to explore how seizures are being portrayed on this social networking website and to consider its potential for information dissemination. A 48-hour Twitter search was used as a preliminary data set to determine an appropriate classification scheme of "seizure"-related posts ("tweets"). Analysis was then conducted using "seizure" tweets from a 7-consecutive day sample period. Tweets were analyzed and coded by two independent reviewers. Predominant categories were Metaphorical (32%), Personal Accounts (31%), Informative (12%), and Ridicule/Joke (9%). This study supports the notion that stigmatization associated with seizures continues to flourish, as 41% of "seizure" tweets were derogatory in nature. Although Twitter could be used to disseminate accurate information on seizures and epilepsy, this study suggests that it is currently propagating negative attitudes toward seizures with potential for fueling stigma. In recent years there have been significant advancements in technology offering many new methods of sharing information. Social networking sites allow real-time communication while providing the opportunity for exchange of information and opinions. Twitter, a website launched in 2006, allows users to communicate through "tweets" limited to 140 characters. Twitter's popularity has drastically increased since its inception, with approximately 110 million tweets per day from 200 million users worldwide, as of January 2011 (http://blogs.forbes.com/oliverchiang/2011/01/19/twitter-hits-nearly-200m-users-110m-tweets-per-day-focuses-on-global-expansion/). Such social media facilitate communication about an array of health-related topics including seizures and epilepsy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, online social networks have become vital platforms for political discussions as well as electoral campaigns. Political organizations have leveraged social media as a tool for distributing information, monitoring public opinion, promoting candidates, and even influencing the election outcomes. To achieve their goals, groups or organizations may purchase or register plenty of accounts, the so-called sockpuppets, to shape the opinion and influence the public atmosphere. In this article, we investigate sockpuppet accounts based on their activity behaviors. A series of user behavior based, network-based, content-based features, and temporal features are proposed and extracted for the classification task. To categorize users into sockpuppets and legitimate users, we employ ensemble learning as well as single classifiers and a thorough evaluation is presented. Experimental results on an officially verified dataset obtained from the largest social forum in Taiwan show that a maximum value of area under the curve score achieves 0.904 via an ensemble learning with feature engineering in our proposal.

AB  - The aim of this article is to analyse citizens' attitudes towards governmental accountability in 24 European countries and to examine the influence of contextual and individual factors on perceptions of accountability. Using as a dataset the 2012 European Social Survey, the results show that citizens respond positively when the media provides reliable information on which to judge the government, when individuals perceive that governments perform well, when individuals live in more extensive and generous welfare states and when they live in countries where the rule of law is firmly established. In addition, the findings also provide evidence that compared to politically left-wing citizens, right-wing supporters have, on average, a higher perception of governmental accountability. In particular, the findings show strong positive evaluations of right-wing governments by right-wing voters in comparison with left-wing governments by left-wing voters.

AB  - Although only 23 people on average have been killed per year by terrorist attacks in the United States since 2001, American citizens and politicians consistently rank terrorism as a top security threat, leading to costly wars abroad and the repression of civil liberties at home. To what extent can education about terrorism alter perceptions of the threat? Much existing scholarship-and consistent polling over the past two decades-suggests that it cannot, but we disagree. Evidence gathered from an extensive series of experimental and observational surveys involving students in 31 terrorism and non-terrorism related courses at 12 universities-including massive open online courses (MOOC) and online surveys-reveals that the more individuals learn about terrorism, the smaller they perceive the threat to be to themselves and to the U.S. In the fight against terrorism and the fear it inspires, knowing really is half the battle.

AB  - Media exposure for dark consumption products mostly shows glamorized and positive portrayals, rarely showing the negative consequences of consuming those products. However, the Netflix series Squid Game addresses the issue of gambling in its most extreme forms and shows the negative consequences related to it in a shocking manner, which begs the question whether watching the series could act as a preventive tool to increase risk perceptions, de-normalize gambling and reduce gambling behavior. A pre-registered survey study (N = 271) examined whether watching the Netflix series Squid Game affected young adults' (18 to 35 years old) gambling intentions and play behavior through risk perceptions, subjective norms and attitudes toward gambling, and what role audience involvement plays. Although the results show that watching Squid Game increased young adults' subjective norms of gambling (i.e. belief that significant others approve of the behavior in question) and further increased their positive attitudes toward gambling and gambling intention, the study also found an important impact of audience involvement. Audiences who were more involved with the series saw greater risks of gambling and perceived gambling to be less common. This resulted in more negative attitudes toward gambling and further less gambling intention and more motivation to change gambling behavior due to watching Squid Game.

AB  - During unexpected social events, information extracted from social media content posted by the people could play a crucial role in understanding the public opinion about the event. In this study, a mixed method procedure, which combines automated and human-based methods, is proposed to mine information from tweets to understand people's thoughts toward an unexpected turn of events. The proposed framework was applied on tweets posted regarding the police shooting to disperse protesters during the anti-Sterlite protests on May 22, 2018, at Thoothukudi in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The tweets were analyzed in two ways: (i) sentiment classification with automated computational methods and (ii) qualitatively examining the context of the expressed sentiments. In the case of anti-Sterlite protests, people expressed mixed emotions toward the protests for the closure of the Sterlite plant. A large negative sentiment toward the police shooting could be gleaned from the tweets. Analyzing tweets by the proposed method provides clear insights regarding the incident, which in turn will aid in planning an emergency response.

AB  - Studies of a variety of media have found a negative slant in portrayals of individuals with mental illness. These portrayals may contribute to harmful public stigma. As consumers shift focus to online sources of news, it is important to understand whether negative portrayals are also found online. The current study analyzed language use and other coverage choices in online articles (N = 811) about mass shooting events as a function of the mental illness status of the shooter. Regression analyses controlling for relevant crime characteristics showed that less angry language was used and more positive details about the shooter were included when the shooter had a mental illness. The number of victim fatalities, location of and motive for the crime, and shooter age were also related to language use and coverage choices. Whereas the current results do not align with prior findings of overtly negative media portrayals of individuals with mental illnesses, it is not clear whether this reflects a modern improvement in media portrayals or whether it is perhaps a more subtle sign of continued bias toward associating mental illness with dangerousness and lack of responsibility for committing violent acts. Future work should focus on the impact of online information sources on public attitudes and stigma toward individuals with mental illness.

AB  - This study examines the use of the ideograph territorial sovereignty by the Times of India (TOI; U.S./New Delhi editions) in its reports on China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Using McGee's (1980) notion of ideograph and Entman's (1993) framing theory, it uncovers a discursive strategy used by elite media for swaying public opinion regarding international and domestic information flow when promoting its preferred "Indian" understanding of the BRI. This study reviews historical uses of the ideograph territorial sovereignty to establish an analysis of the TOI's use of it.

AB  - With the advancement of technology and the arrival of the era of integrated media, big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and virtual reality are gradually changing the ecology of public opinion. This will bring new challenges to the technical discovery, data analysis, and response of network disease dissemination to public opinion. Internet data barriers are still widespread. The specific requirements are to explore the application mode of blockchain technology to bring a better service experience to the people. Therefore, this paper focuses on the dissemination of disease public opinion information and risk management research in the blockchain environment. Furthermore, the application of advanced blockchain technology is used to seek breakthroughs in the field of risk management of network disease transmission and public opinion in terms of technology and data. This paper systematically sorts out the research results of domestic and foreign disease transmission network public opinion, public opinion risk management, and blockchain through comprehensive use of literature analysis, grounded research, empirical research, simulation research, and other research methods. Based on theories of the disease transmission network, public opinion, risk management, blockchain, and system dynamics, we conduct research on network public opinion and risk management of disease transmission in the block chain environment. At the theoretical level, the research in this paper can promote the risk management of disease transmission network public opinion in the blockchain environment and carry out the construction of the theoretical system to deepen the application of blockchain technology in the field of disease public opinion risk management. At the practical level, the research in this paper can guide the improvement of the effect of public opinion risk management. Then, blockchain technology is applied to manage the risk of disease public opinion. In future research, the theory of public opinion risk management will be further enriched. We will apply blockchain technology to develop the evolution of the risk of disease public opinion transmission, carry out research on public opinion management and other aspects, and at the same time, try the design and development of a blockchain public opinion system. In this way, the innovation of blockchain in the development and application of disease network public opinion research will be promoted.

AB  - The increasing popularity of social network sites (SNSs) has raised questions about the role of social network media in the democratic process. This study explores how use of SNSs influences individuals' exposure to political difference. The findings show a positive and significant relationship between SNSs and exposure to challenging viewpoints, supporting the idea that SNSs contribute to individuals' exposure to cross-cutting political points of view. Partisanship was not found to interact with SNS use, suggesting that SNSs contribute to expanding exposure to dissimilar political views across individuals' partisanship. Online political messaging also has a direct effect on exposure to dissimilar viewpoints, and it mediates the association between SNSs and exposure to cross-cutting political views.

AB  - Brands are increasingly embracing social activism and adopting positions on controversial issues, prompting some consumers to react by making uncivil comments on social media. How should brands reply to such incivility while maintaining their positions and protecting their reputations? Two common types of reply include either a sarcastic or an assertive tone, but the effects of these types of communication on consumers' attitudes toward brands remain largely unexplored. Results from a series of five studies exploring different causes (LGBT+ phobia, sexism, and racial equity) show that consumers evaluate brands that reply using an assertive tone more favorably than those using a sarcastic tone, which can be partially explained by the perceived aggressiveness of sarcasm. Additionally, support for a brand's stance acts as a boundary condition on the effect the type of reply adopted by the brand has on consumer attitudes toward the brand. So, the more someone supports a brand's stance, the less their perception of aggressiveness will negatively influence their attitude to that brand. We discuss the implications of these findings for marketing theory and practice.

AB  - This study integrates corpus-assisted text analysis with frame semantics to study a social problem. Taking a cognitive-linguistic approach to critical discourse studies (CDS), in this article I examine the linguistic construction of minors (i.e. people aged 13-18) in a corpus of 489 articles from the Uruguayan newspaper El Pais in the context of the so-called Criminal Imputability Referendum'. Throughout, I focus on the construal operation of framing and identify a host of discursive patterns via which minors and adolescents are recurrently placed within the semantic frame CRIME, and within this, they profile the frame elements (as per the mappings in the database FrameNet) of perpetrators of violent crimes rather than victims (e.g. of abuse and domestic violence). I argue that, in the context of the referendum, these discursive strategies run the risk of facilitating the consolidation of a strong conceptual link whereby youth become readily associated with criminality (ignoring other aspects of children's situation in Uruguay, such as their waning access to education, child poverty, child protection laws and health issues), and are subservient to the political views of groups supporting a lower cut-off age for criminal responsibility and more stringent punishments. The observations arrived at in this instance set the foundations for a future experimental study testing whether the discursive patterns unearthed here have an effect on how readers conceptualize minors outside the texts.

AB  - This study combines two research methods to explore how female leaders are portrayed in the news in Vietnam, and Vietnamese journalists' perception of female and male leaders. Content analysis indicated that female leaders are under- and misrepresented. Female leader sources seldom appear in the news. When they do, they are more likely to be interviewed on traditionally feminine issues. Survey findings demonstrated that gender stereotypes are pervasive among journalists, influencing their perception of news sources. Journalists believe male sources possess stronger work-oriented and agentic traits while female sources are more socially oriented and communal. Results confirmed role congruity theory's applicability in studying media in a non-Western country.

AB  - Can presidential misinformation affect political knowledge and policy views of the mass public, even when that misinformation is followed by a fact-check? We present results from two experiments, conducted online and over the telephone, in which respondents were presented with Trump misstatements on climate change. While Trump's misstatements on their own reduced factual accuracy, corrections prompted the average subject to become more accurate. Republicans were not as affected by a correction as their Democratic counterparts, but their factual beliefs about climate change were never more affected by Trump than by the facts. In neither experiment did corrections affect policy preferences. Debunking treatments can improve factual accuracy even among co-partisans subjected to presidential misinformation. Yet an increase in climate-related factual accuracy does not sway climate-related attitudes. Fact-checks can limit the effects of presidential misinformation, but have no impact on the president's capacity to shape policy preferences.

AB  - Most of the e-campaigning literature claims that the Internet can reinforce political attitudes, but not change them. In this article, I analyze the issue through the receive-accept-sample (RAS) theory, which postulates that messages can change attitudes if they are both received and accepted by audiences. Based on qualitative elite interviews with 31 consultants and operatives involved in the 2008 United States presidential election, I argue that campaigns are finding new avenues to improve both reception and acceptance of their messages, and the implications merit close empirical scrutiny. The probability of message reception can be increased by citizens' propensity to seek out issue positions online and by diffusion through low-threshold activities by supporters; the probability of message acceptance can be augmented by video and the targeting of content; finally, indirect persuasion through interpersonal communication can increase the probability of both reception and acceptance.

AB  - The public's understanding of forensic DNA databases remains undertheorized and few empirical studies have been produced. This article aims to address this omission by exploring the answers to an open-ended question taken from an online questionnaire regarding the reasons for individuals' voluntarily accepting or refusing to allow their DNA profile to be included in the Portuguese forensic DNA database. The analysis is undertaken from the perspective of biological citizenship and the simultaneous empowering and disempowering effects of surveillance. The results indicate a pragmatic ethical framework that is linked to the cultural and emotional elements of altruism, resistance, stigma, and social representations of what is beneficial or harmful to the individual and to society. These subjectivities are anchored in commonplace images and metaphors for genetics, DNA, and forensic science that circulate in the messages transmitted by the media which pervade everyday life; hierarchies of trust in science and the justice system; and moral categories associated with the individual self-judgment in relation to crime, surveillance, and social order.

The data offer empirical support for the notion that narratively structured political satire processing models should consider relevant entertainment psychology and narrative persuasion concepts such as how audiences respond to the main characters and the role enjoyment plays in the process. Using structural equation modeling, media enjoyment significantly mediated the relationship between character liking and narrative consistent attitude formation (about the antagonist), but appears to have functioned as a suppressor variable. Competing models are offered in an Online Appendix.

AB  - Social media interactions can inform public health risk perceptions. While research has examined the risk relationships between obesity and cancer, public attitudes about their associations remain largely unknown. We explored how these constructs were discussed together on two social media platforms. Publicly accessible Facebook and Twitter posts from a 2-month period in 2012 containing references to obesity ("obese/obesity," "overweight," and "fat") and cancer-related words were extracted (N = 3702 posts). Data cleaning yielded a final set of 1382 posts (Facebook: N = 291; Twitter: N = 1091). Using a mixed-methods approach, themes were inductively generated, and sentiment valence, structural elements, and epistemic stance were coded. Seven relational themes emerged: obesity is associated with cancer (n = 389), additional factors are associated with both obesity and cancer (n = 335), obesity causes cancer (n = 85), cancer causes obesity (n = 6), obesity is not linked to cancer (n = 13), co-occurrence (n = 492), and obesity is valued differently than cancer (n = 60). Fifty-nine percent of posts focused on an associative or causal link between obesity and cancer. Thirty-one percent of posts contained positive and/or negative sentiment. Facebook was more likely to contain any sentiment, but Twitter contained proportionately more negative sentiment. Concurrent qualitative analysis revealed a dominance of individual blame for overweight/obese persons and more support and empathy for cancer survivors. Our study reflects wide recognition of the evidence linking obesity to increased risk of cancer, a diverse set of factors perceived to be dually associated with both conditions and differing attribution of responsibility. We demonstrate that social media monitoring can provide an important gauge of public health risk perception.

AB  - Muslims are consistently the target of dehumanization and hostile policies. Previous research shows that interventions that highlight the hypocrisy wherein people collectively blame entire groups for the heinous acts of individual members of outgroups but not ingroups are effective in reducing animosity towards Muslims. However, these interventions rely on aversive materials (e.g., terrorist acts), which can hinder the scalability of interventions due to individuals' tendency to resist/avoid challenging and aversive stimuli. In three preregistered studies (combined N = 2,635), we developed and tested a nonaversive, hypocrisy-based intervention that highlights the hypocrisy involved in attributing ingroup members' prosocial acts to the entire ingroup (i.e., Christians) but not doing the same for outgroup members (i.e., Muslims). Results indicated that this collective praise intervention reliably reduces dehumanization of Muslims, anti-Muslim policy support, and collective blame of Muslims. We argue that the intervention's use of nonaversive stimuli allows for both practical and scalable applications.

AB  - The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) government engages in a vast range of measures aimed at moulding global and domestic public opinion on the Taiwan issue. The Taiwan frames set by the CCP are not just aimed at shaping domestic Chinese public opinion and global discourse on Taiwan-related matters; they also succeed in curtailing the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan's global political and commercial space. The CCP's Taiwan frames are in direct conflict with the evolving Taiwanese identity frames coming out of the ROC. Moreover, they form part of the CCP government's wider ideological project to frame global concepts of Chineseness, which is aimed at combating other ideological challenges to that trope such as the Falun Gong movement, Tibetan independence activism and Chinese democracy groups. Yet, political, economic and technological changes in the PRC and globally suggest that, despite the CCP government's increased efforts, it may be harder than ever to ensure that the CCP frames have the desired effect.

AB  - Research on policy responsiveness of the European Union has adopted the systemic model from national contexts. This focusses on the static congruence or the dynamic adaptation of aggregated policy output and similarly aggregated public opinion. Approaches in this vein provide relevant insights and uncover a surprising degree of EU responsiveness. Yet, this debate contribution argues that they only insufficiently capture indirect accountability chains and the emerging challenges of public EU politicization and mediatization. We establish the need for procedural perspectives that addresses how the different EU institutions perceive and digest public opinion and subsequently influence it through communication. To further this research agenda, we sketch the contours of a procedural model by highlighting possible variation at the input, throughput and output stages. Going full circle, we suggest, allows us to better understand the responses to public opinion and their wider implications for the societal acceptance of the unfinished supranational polity.

KW  - nonlinear dynamics
AB  - Information diffusion and opinion evolution are often treated as two independent processes. Opinion models assume the topic reaches each agent and agents initially have their own ideas. In fact, the processes of information diffusion and opinion evolution often intertwine with each other. Whether the influence between these two processes plays a role in the system state is unclear. In this paper, we collected more than one million real data from a well-known social platform, and analysed large-scale user diffusion behaviour and opinion formation. We found that user inter-event time follows a two-scaling powerlaw distribution with two different power exponents. Public opinion stabilizes quickly and evolves toward the direction of convergence, but the consensus state is prevented by a few opponents. We propose a three-state opinion model accompanied by information diffusion. Agents form and exchange their opinions during information diffusion. Conversely, agents' opinions also influence their diffusion actions. Simulations show that the model with a correlation of the two processes produces similar statistical characteristics as empirical results. A fast epidemic process drives individual opinions to converge more obviously. Unlike previous epidemic models, the number of infected agents does not always increase with the update rate, but has a peak with an intermediate value of the rate.

AB  - Media systems where political parallelism co-exists with political clientelism have contradictory influences on journalistic practices. Journalists are encouraged to actively defend a cause and influence public opinion while expected to remain subservient to their political masters. The media studies literature has analyzed the impact of political parallelism and clientelism separately, without reflecting on the tensions that emerge when they operate together. The article examines journalism under instrumentalized political parallelism and argues that it plays out in a field defined by both horizontal and vertical conflicts. We add an elite-grassroots analytical perspective to the inter-elite tensions associated with a polarized public sphere. Political parallelism in non-democratic contexts seemingly leaves little room for journalistic agency, as the politically powerful tend to instrumentalize media outlets. However, by looking closely at the case of Lebanon, we argue that journalists are still able to act independently of and contrary to the elite's intentions. The empirical analysis shows how journalists navigate vis-a-vis the politicians by playing the relations game, exploiting internal contradictions in the system and connecting with popular grievances. The article contributes new knowledge about journalists' resilience to instrumentalization in a context of media/politics connections that is commonly found outside the West.

AB  - This article explores how interpersonal political communication moderates the effect of news media usage on political knowledge; discussant heterogeneity, and expertise are further contingent factors. Using data from the Comparative National Elections Project, these interactive relationships are investigated in East and West Germany around the 1990 election in a comparative manner. The learning effects of media consumption are both reinforced and attenuated by frequent discussions: Reevaluating media content induces both clarity and confusion. And it is not simply that more interpersonal communication matters. Heterogeneous discussions (which provide information on the "other side" and contribute to a broad understanding of the political landscape) and political experts (who offer high-quality information) are most conductive to learning from media sources.

AB  - What are the lessons of the 2016 referendum on UK membership of the European Union (EU) regarding the effects of message framing? This article reports findings from an innovative online survey experiment based on a two-wave panel design. The findings show that, despite the expectation that campaign effects are generally small for high-salience issues - such as Brexit - the potential for campaign effects was high for the pro-EU frames. This suggests that within an asymmetrical information environment - in which the arguments for one side of an issue (anti-EU) are 'priced in', while arguments for the other side (pro-EU) have been understated - the potential for campaign effects in a single direction are substantial. To the extent that this environment is reflected in other referendum campaigns, the potential effect of pro-EU frames may be substantial.

AB  - Most of us now have instant access mobile phones with integrated cameras so we are able to record an unplanned video at any time and place within a matter of seconds. Modern technology has provided us with the ability to create spontaneous videos. Spontaneous videos are a new way of portraying our society and communicating events and, by means of the internet and web 2.0 applications, they have the potential to reach every corner of the globe, form an integral part of mass media news reports, and influence public opinion. This study establishes the basis for identifying and understanding the spontaneous video, analysing its application in video activism and citizen journalism, and investigating its impact on the digital press. To this end, we have analysed spontaneous videos created and shared online by IES Lluis Vives students in Valencia on the 15th of February, 2012. Students held a protest on this date against education cuts carried out by the Valencian Community government in Spain. The resulting spontaneous videos had a great impact on the media and were reported by Spanish digital newspapers including El Pais, El Mundo, La Razon, ABC and Publico.

AB  - In an effort to advance agenda-setting theory in the web environment, this study examined shifts in newswire coverage and search interest among Internet users in President Obama during the first two years of his administration (2009-2010). Both the volume and valence of media coverage influenced search attention, with volume exerting a stronger effect. Coverage volume was also driven by search trends. The impact of coverage volume on search was relatively stronger than the reverse, though it moved at a slower pace. These findings suggest a reciprocal, more complex process of salience transmission online.

AB  - In language planning for minority languages, policy often aims to positively influence attitudes towards the language by increasing its salience in key areas of public life such as broadcasting and signage. This is true for Gaelic in Scotland, where recent national initiatives have included the establishing of a Gaelic language television channel in 2008, and the launch, in the same year, of a bilingual brand identity for ScotRail (Reile na h-Alba), resulting in Gaelic-English signage at railway stations across Scotland. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the effects of such an increase in national visibility of Gaelic on public attitudes towards the language. The present paper explores this using a national survey of public attitudes conducted in Scotland in 2012. Exposure to Gaelic broadcasting was found to be positively associated with attitudes towards the status of the Gaelic language (as a language spoken in Scotland, and as an important element of cultural heritage), and with attitudes towards the greater use of Gaelic (in public services and in the future). However, exposure to Gaelic signage was often negatively associated with such broader attitudes to the language and culture. The implications of the results for Gaelic language planning, and for future academic studies of language attitudes in Scotland, are explored.

AB  - Objective: To understand current public perceptions of in vitro meat (IVM) in light of its potential to be a more environmentally sustainable alternative to conventional meat.
   Design: A qualitative content analysis of the comments made on online news articles highlighting the development of IVM and the world's first IVM hamburger in August 2013.
   Setting: News article comment sections across seven US-based online news sources (The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Cable News Network and National Public Radio).
   Subjects: Four hundred and sixty-two commenters who made eight hundred and fourteen publicly available online comments addressing IVM.
   Results: Key themes in commenter perceptions of IVM included environmental and public health benefits, but also negative themes such as IVM's status as an unnatural and unappealing food. Overall, the tone of comments was more negative than positive.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that while the environmental and public health motivations for developing and in turn consuming IVM resonate with some segments of the population, others find that reasoning both uncompelling and problematic. Concerns about IVM as an unnatural and risky product also appear to be a significant barrier to public acceptance of IVM. Supporters of IVM may wish to begin to develop a regulatory strategy for IVM to build public trust and explore messaging strategies that cast IVM as a new technology with benefits to individuals rather than primarily a solution to global challenges. Those in the public health nutrition field can make an important contribution to the emerging public discussion about IVM.

AB  - This study draws on survey data obtained from members in neo-Nazi discussion forums and builds on evidence that participation in these forums exacerbates false consensus, that is, overestimating public support for own views. This study goes further to test whether contacts with dissimilar offline social networks as well as exposure to ideologically dissimilar news media attenuate false consensus and its association with online participation. Contrary to predictions, politically dissimilar networks do not reduce false consensus among the analyzed sample. Exposure to ideologically dissimilar news media, on the other hand, results in more accurate estimates (main effect), but it exacerbates false consensus as resulting from participation in neo-Nazi online groups (interactive effect). Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Public opinion, especially the online public opinion is a critical issue when it comes to mining its characteristics. Because it can be formed directly and intensely in a short time, and may lead to the outbreak of online group events, and the formation of online public opinion crisis. This may become the pushing hand of a public crisis event, or even have negative social impacts, which brings great challenges to the government management. Data from the mass media which reveal implicit, previously unknown, and potentially valuable information, can effectively help us to understand the evolution law of public opinion, and provide a useful reference for rumor intervention. Based on the Dynamic Network Analysis method, this paper uses ORA software to mine characteristics of public opinion information, opinion topics, and public opinion agents through a series of indicators, and quantitatively analyzed the relationships between them. The results show that through the analysis of the 8 indexes associating with opinion data mining, we can have a basic understanding of the public opinion characteristics of an opinion event, such as who is important in the opinion spreading process, the information grasping condition, and the opinion topics release situation.

AB  - This article explores perceptions and representations of Nigeria and Nigerians in the popular global imaginary. It analyses selected popular media narratives in order to foreground contradictions and paradoxes in the ways in which the country and people of Nigeria are discursively constructed. By doing so, it interrogates stereotypes of corruption and criminality as well as myths of exceptionalism about Nigeria and Nigerians originating from both within and outside the country. The analysis reveals that the generalised portrayal of Nigeria and Nigerians as exceptional social subjects is characterised by contradictions and inaccuracies in dominant representational practices and cannot be justified by the verifiable empirical information available on the country and its people.

AB  - Context-Knowledge is linked consistently with organ donation attitudes, willingness, and consent. Negative information about donation and the recipients of donation can affect public opinion and donation willingness. However, it is unclear which information sources are most important in forming knowledge, particularly in Australia where little prior research exists.
   Objectives-To identify information sources that may inform Australians' organ donation knowledge and attitudes toward transplant recipients.
   Participants-1487 Australian residents aged 18 years or older who completed an online survey.
   Main Outcome Measures-Self-reported knowledge, information sources, and attitudes toward transplant recipients.
   Results-Participants felt fairly well informed about organ donation, particularly if they registered donation wishes, were female, and were older. More than half reported their driver's license, television news, and discussion with family/friends as donation information sources. However, information sources contributing to knowledge were personal experience, online, hospital, government campaign, discussion with family/friends, Medicare, doctor's surgery, and the newspaper. Differences based on registration status, sex, and age, were found. Discussion with family/friends and movies or television shows, as well as not having seen information in a newspaper or doctor's surgery, contributed to positive attitudes toward recipients, although the variance explained was small.
   Conclusions-People felt more informed by personal, medical, and government information sources than by mass media. Family discussion was not only a common information source but also contributed significantly and positively to both donation knowledge and attitudes toward recipients. Further exploration of information sources contributing to donation knowledge and community attitudes toward, transplant recipients among young men is needed.

AB  - While ride-hailing ridership declined in 2020 due to COVID-19 induced restrictions like stay-at-home orders, food/grocery delivery services became quasi-essential. This study investigates if and how public perceptions of gig work related to platform-based ride-hailing and food/grocery delivery services changed during the early stages of the pandemic. We collected a sample of 23,845 Twitter posts ('tweets') related to these platform-based services within two-week periods before and after the US COVID-19 emergency declaration. Sentiment analysis on tweets was conducted to investigate changes in public perception of gig work. Tweet content was analyzed by descriptively coding about 10% of the sample of tweets manually along ten different dimensions (e.g., personal experience, informative, and about driver); then we used thematic analysis to gain an understanding about the public's views towards gig work/workers. We tested supervised machine learning methods to explore their potential to classify the rest of the sample along the ten descriptive dimensions. The number of tweets increased by approximately 150% after the emergency declaration and became more positive in sentiment. Qualitative results indicate that tweets about negative personal experiences with drivers/companies decreased during COVID-19, while tweets exhibiting a sense of community (e.g., sharing information) and concern towards gig workers increased. Findings can inform policy and workforce changes regarding platform-based service companies.

AB  - In many countries, intense political contestation unfolded around the question of how Sars-CoV-2 should be contained. In this case study, I try to understand why members of the German public came to vastly differing judgements on the containment policies. In summer 2020, I conducted 48 semi-structured interviews to investigate respondents' belief systems, attitude structures, and communicative practices. I found that disparate policy preferences were partly based on incompatible interpretations of the crisis and went hand in hand with deep institutional mistrust between strict opponents. Stereotypes about supporters and opponents had formed, and people avoided discussions with opposing camps. However, my data also suggest that moderate opponents and supporters overlapped in their criticism of anxiety-inducing media coverage and fuzzy governmental communication. No fully-fledged social identities had formed, and respondents were forcibly exposed to other opinions in their close personal networks. Altogether, my study extends the knowledge of political polarisation around COVID-19 by unravelling the interpretations and mechanisms that underlie disparate policy preferences during the pandemic.

AB  - Background: Americans remain under-informed about cancer and other health disparities and the social determinants of health (SDH). The news media may be contributing to this knowledge deficit, whether by discussing these issues narrowly or ignoring them altogether. Because local media are particularly important in influencing public opinion and support for public policies, this study examines the prevalence and framing of disparities/SDH in local mainstream and ethnic print news.
   Methods: We conducted a multi-method content analysis of local mainstream (English language) and ethnic (Spanish language) print news in two lower income cities in New England with substantial racial/ethnic minority populations. After establishing intercoder reliability (kappa = 0.63-0.88), coders reviewed the primary English and Spanish language newspaper in each city, identifying both disparities and non-disparities health stories published between February 2010 and January 2011.
   Results: Local print news coverage of cancer and other health disparities was rare. Of 650 health stories published across four newspapers during the one-year study period, only 21 (3.2%) discussed disparities/SDH. Although some stories identified causes of and solutions for disparities, these were often framed in individual (e.g., poor dietary habits) rather than social contextual terms (e.g., lack of food availability/affordability). Cancer and other health stories routinely missed opportunities to discuss disparities/SDH.
   Conclusion: Local mainstream and ethnic media may be ideal targets for multilevel interventions designed to address cancer and other health inequalities.
   Impact: By increasing media attention to and framing of health disparities, we may observe important downstream effects on public opinion and support for structural solutions to disparities, particularly at the local level. (C) 2016 AACR.

AB  - Japan disputes the sovereignty of two islands: Senkaku/Diaoyu with China and Takeshima/Dokdo with South Korea. These disputes have triggered political performances. In August 2012, Chinese activists landed on Senkaku/Diaoyu, and South Korean politicians landed on Takeshima/Dokdo. The group threat theory suggests that these events constitute threats to Japanese citizens, which lead to negative attitudes towards these countries. The theory also expects personal variations in the reactions to the threats, and the empirical findings of the theory predict an improvement in the worsened attitudes immediately after the event. Drawing on a Japanese social survey that was conducted every month for the two years during which these landing events occurred, I tested the effect of the events on Japanese attitudes towards China and South Korea in a natural experimental framework. The results show that the events negatively impacted Japanese attitudes towards both countries. However, contrary to the expectations of the group threat theory, individual variations (i.e., socioeconomic status, media exposure, and political orientation) in the responses to the events are not supported. Additionally, the attitudes do not return to preevent levels for one year. The contradictions between previous studies and this study potentially originate from the importance of the territories.

AB  - This paper addresses the role of cultural tourism in bridging cultural gaps; looking specifically at the potentials of communicating Islamic knowledge. This paper comes in two folds: assessing the impact of visitors' knowledge of Islam on their perception, followed by an unsolicited assessment of visitors' impressions of their visit gathered via a content analysis of the visitors' reviews on trip advisor. To that effect the case of Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque (SQGM) in Muscat, Oman was selected to explore visitors experience and knowledge. 213 questionnaires were distributed in an exit survey exercise to asses the type of Islamic knowledge non-Muslim visitors have and the impact of this knowledge on their perception of Islam. This methodology was validated by a content analysis of visitors' reviews on trip advisor offering an unsolicited assessment of visits to SQGM. On one hand, the results revealed a strong association between breadth of knowledge about Islam and the positive perception of Islamic faith and civilisation. On the other hand, the content analysis results revealed a focus on materialistic components of the mosque, highest positive repetition, for example, were received by mentions of the chandelier, the carpet and not mentions of conceptual and cultural content. The paper also concluded that the focus of the interpretation assessed via the trip advisor content analysis did not address the current problematic situation of the image of Islam but was rather superficial. The main recommendation of this paper is to effectively use cultural tourism to promote cultural understanding and bridge gaps.

AB  - A recently announced shift in the global military strategy of the United States involves an increase in the presence of the U.S. Armed Forces in the Pacific. Drawing from propositions of the system-maintenance role of local media, this study examines how the Pacific Daily News (PDN), a newspaper on the Western Pacific island of Guam, covers a U.S. military buildup, and the extent to which such coverage influences residents' opinions. A content analysis revealed the PDN reported more frequently on the military buildup's economic benefits, and less on its potential risks. A representative survey showed that reading the PDN influenced residents' support for the buildup and endorsement of the buildup's economic benefits, but not its risks. Implications are discussed.

AB  - Analysis of Russian films in 1992-2017 on the school-university topis shows that:
   - the educational / educational process left in the past the Soviet framework of communist orientations and anti-religious orientation;
   - the number of entertaining interpretations has sharply increased;
   - the stories are not directly related to key international political events, although they are to some extent dependent on domestic political attitudes;
   - the main conflicts are built on the confrontation of extraordinary teachers and students with stagnation, bureaucracy, the grayness of the bosses / colleagues / team; very often the focus is on problem zones (crisis, disappointment and fatigue, professional "burnout" of teachers, bureaucracy, corruption, pragmatic cynicism of students, teenage cruelty, etc.);
   - Among the characters distinctly manifested materialistic differentiation;
   - the pupil characters are mainly divided into the following categories: optimistic and vital perspectives (often associated with material status and hedonism), or in a state of depression and hopelessness;
   - activity of students is more directed towards entertainment, sex and material gain;
   - the attitude of teachers and students has lost the barriers of subordination, largely because the prestige of the pedagogical profession in the eyes of students and the public continued to fall;
   - in the pedagogical collectives, the images of female teachers, often lonely and unsettled, still come to the fore;
   - the appearance of students and teachers has become even more "free", vividly denoting female sex appeal;
   - film stories about students, in contrast to a number of Soviet counterparts, are virtually devoid of intellectual disputes, but are densely immersed in the genre element of melodrama and / or comedy; and in general, the theme of love in the cinema on the school-university theme is for the most part given accented comedic and / or melodramatic.

AB  - Although political scandals receive unprecedented attention in the contemporary media, the knowledge of political scientists regarding the consequences of such scandals remains limited. On the basis of two nationally representative survey experiments, we investigate whether the impact of scandals depends on the traits of the politicians involved. We find substantial evidence that politicians are particularly punished for political-ideological hypocrisy, while there is less evidence that gender stereotypes matter. We also show that voters evaluate scandals in the personal lives of politicians in a highly partisan manner - other-party voters punish a politician substantially harsher than same-party voters. Interestingly, voters show no gender bias in their candidate evaluations.

AB  - The organizational culture elite is studied as a new elite group emerging within a stable neo-corporatist state. Does this new elite adopt existing modes of operation or place itself at bay from the more established elite groups? The emergence of and changes in the culture elite are discussed from a historical perspective in terms of social background, recruitment processes, occupational careers, gender composition, political outlooks, lobbying, and media strategies. The culture elite is systematically compared to two other elites: the university elite, the most similar among the elites, and the economic elite, assumedly representing the greatest contrast. Despite special characteristics in the social situations and political views of the culture elite, it is concluded that the mode of operation of this group indicates a high degree of adaptability to the general system of elites. A main reason is assumed to be the integrative power and liberal quality of the state in a neo-corporatist regime.

AB  - Risk society theory posits that the transformation of industrial to postindustrial society corresponded with a transformation of societal power structured by capital, to one structured by the ability to define risk. Perceptions of risk are, in part, socially constructed and created through the framing efforts of various institutional actors. The resulting struggle over meaning is particularly acute when the issues contain many unknown elementsas is the case with emerging technologies. Applying insights from media studies, frame analysis, and organizational theory, we analyze coverage of nanotechnology (NT) in popular press, trade, and general science publications. The findings document the extent to which the risks of this emerging technology are presented or ignored across, between, and within organizational subfields. The analysis empirically assesses a key proposition of risk society theory and reveals how institutional processes reflect and reproduce power differentials. We discuss the implications of the empirical findings for sociological theories of risk and society, power, and collective action.

AB  - This study was aimed at determining perception and awareness levels about climate change in three city centers located in the West Mediterranean Region of Turkey and identified differences in public perceptions and knowledge about regional climate change. The study utilized a questionnaire method to obtain data. The results found that approximately half of the participants had inadequate climate change knowledge. In particular, knowledge levels regarding climate change adaptation were comparatively low. Women were more concerned about climate changed compared to men. Additionally, primary and high school graduates and married individuals were also more concerned. Age and income were not determining variables. There were no significant differences in terms of gender, age, income and educational status apart from marital status as to whether or not adaptation to climate change will be achieved. There are varying levels of awareness among the public regarding climate change, and thus it is especially important to organize outreach programs supported by media to increase climate change adaptation knowledge levels. Institutions need to improve their ability to promote public awareness and knowledge about climate change in order to reach a larger proportion of the public.

AB  - Public interest in most aspects of the environment is sharply declining relative to other subjects, as measured by internet searches performed on Google. Changes in the search behavior by the public are closely tied to their interests, and those interests are critical to driving public policy. Google Insights for Search (GIFS) was a tool that provided access to search data but is now combined with another tool, Google Trends. We used GIFS to obtain data for 19 environment-related terms from 2001 to 2009. The only environment-related term with large positive slope was climate change. All other terms that we queried had strong negative slopes indicating that searches for these topics dropped over the last decade. Our results suggest that the public is growing less interested in the environment.

AB  - international empirical research on the perception that journalists have of their professional roles and functions has increased considerably in recent years, although not in the case of Spain. The present research, included within the transnational comparative study "The Worlds of Journalism Study", analyses data from a survey conducted in Spain (representative and stratified by type of media and autonomous community) of 390 journalists from 117 media, who were consulted about their work to detect the professional functions they most identified with. The study establishes six roles: watchdog, citizens' spokesperson, instructor of the audience, promoter of the status quo, infotainment journalist and disseminator of objective information. in line with recent political, economic and social developments in Spain, professionals feel more identified with the role of citizens' spokesperson. This function downplays the predominant role of disseminator of objective information reflected in recent studies of a similar nature on the subject of Spanish journalists. A further finding of the research is the existence of two large groups of journalists: the stimulators and the "narcotizers" of public opinion. Moreover, it is observed that some organizational factors (in particular, media ownership) and other individual ones (gender, age and years of professional experience) significantly influence the perceptions of professional roles.

AB  - Peace processes are complex, protracted, and contentious involving significant bargaining and compromising among various societal and political stakeholders. In civil war terminations, it is pertinent to measure the pulse of the nation to ensure that the peace process is responsive to citizens' concerns. Social media yields tremendous power as a tool for dialogue, debate, organization, and mobilization, thereby adding more complexity to the peace process. Using Colombia's final peace agreement and national referendum as a case study, we investigate the influence of two important indicators: intergroup polarization and public sentiment toward the peace process. We present a detailed linguistic analysis to detect intergroup polarization and a predictive model that leverages Tweet structure, content, and user-based features to predict public sentiment toward the Colombian peace process. We demonstrate that had proaccord stakeholders leveraged public opinion from social media, the outcome of the Colombian referendum could have been different.

AB  - Political action and electoral behavior often stem from a conviction that an issue is important. Yet despite a growing literature on partisan bias, it remains unclear whether partisan attachment also affects the perceived importance of various issues. We propose a theory of partisan-motivated issue attention (PMIA), wherein citizens satisfy partisan instincts by shifting the perceived importance of an issue. We apply our theory to an issue involving a fundamental tool of the federal government-the power to deficit-spend-and test the hypothesis that partisans' concern about government overspending significantly changes depending on which party presides over deficit-spending. Leveraging pre-registered experimental and observational studies, we find strong support for this hypothesis among both Republicans and Democrats. Lastly, using text analytical methods, we also find evidence of PMIA in televised partisan media. Our study thus demonstrates that putative concern about deficit-spending contains a sizable partisan component and, more broadly, uncovers an additional means by which partisan bias guides citizens' attitude formation on policy-relevant issues in the United States.

AB  - Does exposure to cyberattacks influence public support for intrusive cybersecurity policies? How do perceptions of cyber threats mediate this relationship? While past research has demonstrated how exposure to cyberattacks affects political attitudes, the mediating role played by threat perception has been overlooked. This study employs a controlled randomized survey experiment design to test the effect of exposure to lethal and nonlethal cyberattacks on support for different types of cybersecurity policies. One thousand twenty-two Israeli participants are exposed to scripted and simulated television reports of lethal or nonlethal cyberattacks against national infrastructure. Findings suggest that exposure to cyberattacks leads to greater support for stringent cybersecurity regulations, through a mechanism of threat perception. Results also indicate that different types of exposure relate to heightened support for different types of regulatory policies. People exposed to lethal cyberattacks tend to support cybersecurity policies that compel the government to alert citizens about cyberattacks. People who were exposed to nonlethal attacks, on the other hand, tend to support oversight policies at higher levels. More broadly, our research suggests that peoples' willingness to accept government cybersecurity policies that limit personal civil liberties and privacy depends on the type of cyberattacks to which they were exposed and the perceptions associated with such exposure.

AB  - The future of any country in the contemporary era lies in its ability to harness the knowledge potential. The fruits of knowledge society have transformed the terrain of social and political scenario of countries around the world. Democracy as a form of government, to be successful, requires a critically-engaged and politically literate population. Democracy, therefore, requires not only political literacy but also media and digital literacies given the influence of media in our lives. If democracy is viewed as a relationship between knowledge and power, there needs to be a strong distinction between the ideas, the truth of power and the power of truth. The term, 'Post- truth', signifies that objective facts have become less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal beliefs. The political processes in various democracies seem to have become more managerial and technologically fixated. There has been significant erosion in the ideas of transparency of information and political leadership has become nothing but a propaganda exercise. The paper analyses how the information technology revolution and the surge of new media has impacted the political processes in democracies, and presents the phenomenon of post-truth as a threat to the modern democratic systems.

AB  - In multi-ethnic nation-states, opposition to immigration has manifested itself in attitudes and behaviors. Past research has typically focused on:anti-immigrant attitudes, and relied on threat and competition theories to explain patterns in such attitudes. These theories suggest that perceived threats stemming from new influxes or large concentrations of immigrants should prompt dominant groups to protect their interests, leading to anti-immigrant attitudes. We extend the literature with a focus on anti-immigrant activity, and introduce the legitimating contexts model, which argues that dominant groups may actually hesitate to engage in exclusionary public actions in places where the political and demographic strength of immigrant and ethnic groups is strong. In contrast to theories of group threat, we contend that in contexts with low levels of immigrant political power and demographic strength, anti-immigrant activity is less likely to be noticed, let alone challenged, and thus more likely to become part of the status quo. Extending political opportunity theory, we also claim that conservative elites and voters in local areas coupled with low levels of threat further legitimate anti-immigrant activity. We test these ideas using a new data set of exclusionary action targeted at immigrants in over SO U.S. metropolitan areas. In support of the legitimating contexts model, we find that low levels of demographic and political threat when immigrants enjoy less power alone and coupled with a higher share of conservative voters act to legitimate and encourage restrictive events on the part of noninstitutional actors.

AB  - Political tolerance for extremist groups often involves a conflict between the competing values of freedom of speech and public order and safety. In 2 experiments, we investigated the role of these values in tolerance for a political rally by right-wing extremists and Islamic fundamentalists. The combination of individual differences in value priorities and written media framing was examined. Participants who valued order and safety expressed higher tolerance when the rally was framed as a free-speech issue. Participants who valued freedom of speech showed higher tolerance when this value was either reinforced or contradicted by the media framing. In addition, concerns about a safe and secure society only predicted tolerance for Islamic fundamentalists.

AB  - Background: In order to support evidence-based policies for reduction of stigma, a better understanding of its components: ignorance (knowledge), prejudice (attitude) and discrimination (behaviour) is necessary. This study explores public perceptions and quantifies stigma for three chronic mental disorders: autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders in France.
   Methods: Survey of 1000 adults selected from an established market research panel. The 21-item questionnaire explored knowledge, attitudes and behaviours toward each disorder.
   Results: Although 95% respondents recognized the names of each disorder fewer than 70% could report specific characteristics and only 33% considered that publically available information was adequate; most respondents identified the media as their main resource. Labeling of conditions in a negative way was frequent (61%) when referring to mental disorders in general, but fell significantly (18%) when linked to an individual with a disorder. Individuals with schizophrenia are assumed to be dangerous; 65% respondents would engage in social distancing from such an individual, versus 29% for bipolar disorders and 7% for autism (p < 0.001). In contrast to other disorders, discrimination against schizophrenia was only partly attenuated in those with familiarity with mental disorders (through personal or family illness).
   Conclusion: This first population-based survey in France shows that attitudes towards bipolar disorders and autism are less prejudicial than towards schizophrenia. However, most public attitudes and behaviours towards different disorders appear to be based on assumptions rather than knowledge or evidence suggesting a generic information or anti-stigma programme is unlikely to be effective.

AB  - In this article, I examine the American public's reaction to two recent infectious disease outbreaks: Ebola and Zika. Using a set of parallel questions, I investigate the ways in which public reactions to these distinct threats diverge and converge. I compare the microfoundations of public reactions to these two disparate infectious diseases-and, specifically, I use a behavioral immune system account to examine how disgust sensitivity and group-based prejudice shape understandings of these diseases and policies relating to them. I find the most prominent predictor of views on Ebola and Zika is disgust sensitivity-particularly individual differences in disgust-based reactions to contamination. The evidence in this article suggests that public opinion on these policies is grounded not necessarily in the cold cognition of scientific risk management but in visceral disgust reactions-reactions that can easily be distorted by imagination.

AB  - Rationale: Individuals living in Scotland's most deprived communities experience a higher burden of morbidity and early mortality than those living in more affluent areas. Experiences of poverty-based stigma may be one psychosocial mechanism through which socioeconomic position influences health, although there is little available data on this issue from a Scottish perspective.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to identify which aspects of poverty stigma are particularly salient to individuals with lived experience of poverty, and may therefore contribute to health inequalities.
   Methods: Five focus groups were conducted with 39 individuals with experience of living on low incomes in Scotland in order to explore their experiences and perceptions of poverty stigma.
   Results: Five main themes were identified, reflecting aspects of poverty stigma operating at various structural, public and individual levels: media representations of poverty; negative encounters with social security systems; perceived public attitudes regarding poverty in Scotland; lowered self-esteem and intemalisation of negative attitudes, and; emotional responses to stigma.
   Conclusion: These dimensions of stigma potentially influence public health and health inequalities in Scotland, although future research will be necessary to quantify these and estimate their relationships with health outcomes.

AB  - In this article, I present findings from a survey experiment in which Chinese university students exposed to a treatment designed to increase feelings of national threat were-based on their responses to the four-item postmaterialism values-priority battery-significantly more likely to be classified as "pure materialists." These findings are presented in support of the proposition that perception of a hostile international environment may tend to exaggerate citizens' authoritarian and nationalistic sentiments at the expense of more democratically favorable value orientations. Media and political figures in the West who rail against the evils of China's authoritarian leadership might believe that they are championing and encouraging democratic aspirations among the Chinese people, but might instead be inciting impulses and attitudes that are far less "democracy-friendly."

AB  - The article concerns the strategic narratives concept as a tool of soft power and proposes methods and techniques of analysing strategic narratives. We argue that the best approach should apply a methodological triangulation which combines different methods and techniques while simultaneously addressing gaps in the implementation of theoretical perspectives. We present a theoretical concept of analysis and validate it using the example of a case study of the Crimea conflict in 2014 and 2015. Relying on the following three sources of original data: content analysis of media coverage (press comments over 8 weeks of 2014 and 2015), a cross-sectional survey (Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing), and survey and focus group interviewing on the reception of Internet memes; we show that a strategic narrative works both in the media and in the opinions of media recipients. Investigating the 'Machiavellian Russia' strategic narrative, we show that mass-media interpretation of present events seems to depend on historical context and comparisons, which create a specific bubble around recipients of media messages.

AB  - Fake news and disinformation are not a new phenomenon. However, in recent years, they have acquired great prominence on the public agenda, conditioning electoral results and generating episodes of political destabilization. Academic interest runs in parallel with the consideration of disinformation as a growing priority for governments and international organizations, due to its geostrategic relevance and its importance for national sovereignty and security. The interference of countries such as Russia or China in other nations' electoral processes, using new tools and methods to manipulate public opinion and proliferate cyberattacks have led to the creation of agencies or regulations aimed at curbing disinformation in some states. The UN, the EU and other countries' governments have tried to develop strategies to respond to this growing threat. The pandemic has accelerated the decline of local media, which leaves communities in a state of serious vulnerability. Reliable resources and sources around local information are scarce assets, information is increasingly consumed through social media, and in them disinformation easily proliferates. With this proposal, we intend to start a discussion around disinformation at a local level, something that has been absent in disinformation studies.

AB  - Starting from late 2019, the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global crisis. With the development of online social media, people prefer to express their opinions and discuss the latest news online. We have witnessed the positive influence of online social media, which helped citizens and governments track the development of this pandemic in time. It is necessary to apply artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to online social media and automatically discover and track public opinions posted online. In this paper, we take Sina Weibo, the most widely used online social media in China, for analysis and experiments. We collect multi-modal microblogs about COVID-19 from 2020/1/1 to 2020/3/31 with a web crawler, including texts and images posted by users. In order to effectively discover what is being discussed about COVID-19 without human labeling, we propose a unified multi-modal framework, including an unsupervised short-text topic model to discover and track bursty topics, and a self-supervised model to learn image features so that we can retrieve related images about COVID-19. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed models, and also have shown the considerable application prospects for analyzing and tracking public opinions about COVID-19.

AB  - Two studies explored the role of perceived threat in predicting White Australians' acculturation preferences for Muslim immigrants, with particular focus on the impact of their reliance on the mass media. In Study 1, students completed a survey that indicated that their tolerance of Muslim practice was largely explained by their general attitudes to multiculturalism. However, among those who were highly reliant on the media, symbolic threat from Muslims played an additional role, with those who perceived more threat being less tolerant. Study 2 further explored these findings in a second survey that included other measures of threat that comprise the integrated threat theory. While intergroup anxiety was the form of threat with the strongest main effect on tolerance, the impact of symbolic threat was again moderated by reliance on the mass media. The implications for understanding the role of media in facilitating interethnic disharmony were discussed.

AB  - Will Arctic warming affect mid-latitude weather? Many researchers think so, and have addressed this question through scientific articles and news media. Much of the public accepts such a connection as well. Across three New Hampshire surveys with more than 1500 interviews, 60% of respondents say they think future Arctic warming would have major effects on their weather. Arctic/weather responses changed little after Superstorm Sandy brushed the region, but exhibit consistently strong partisan divisions that grow wider with education. Belief in an Arctic/weather connection also varies, in a nonlinear pattern, with the temperature anomaly around day of interview. Interviewed on unseasonably warm or cool days, respondents are more likely to think that Arctic warming would have major effects on their weather. This unscientific response seems to mirror the scientific discussion about extremes.

AB  - This article aims at exploring a case of information crisis in Italy through the lens of vaccination-related topics. Such a controversial issue, dividing public opinion and political agendas, has received diverse information coverage and public policies over time in the Italian context, whose situation appears quite unique compared with other countries because of a strong media spectacularization and politicization of the topic. In particular, approval of the "Lorenzin Decree," increasing the number of mandatory vaccinations from 4 to 10, generated a nationwide debate that divided public opinion and political parties, triggering a complex informative crisis and fostering the perception of a social emergency on social media. This resulted in negative stress on lay publics and on the public health system. The study adopted an interdisciplinary framework, including political science, public relations, and health communication studies, as well as a mixed-method approach, combining data mining techniques related to news media coverage and social media engagement, with in-depth interviews to key experts, selected among researchers, journalists, and communication managers. The article investigates reasons for the information crisis and identifies possible solutions and interventions to improve the effectiveness of public health communication and mitigate the social consequences of misinformation around vaccination.

TI  - How the Chinese Government Fabricates Social Media Posts for Strategic Distraction, Not Engaged Argument

AB  - The Chinese government has long been suspected of hiring as many as 2 million people to surreptitiously insert huge numbers of pseudonymous and other deceptive writings into the stream of real social media posts, as if they were the genuine opinions of ordinary people. Many academics, and most journalists and activists, claim that these so-called 50c party posts vociferously argue for the government's side in political and policy debates. As we show, this is also true of most posts openly accused on social media of being 50c. Yet almost no systematic empirical evidence exists for this claim or, more importantly, for the Chinese regime's strategic objective in pursuing this activity. In the first large-scale empirical analysis of this operation, we show how to identify the secretive authors of these posts, the posts written by them, and their content. We estimate that the government fabricates and posts about 448 million social media comments a year. In contrast to prior claims, we show that the Chinese regime's strategy is to avoid arguing with skeptics of the party and the government, and to not even discuss controversial issues. We show that the goal of this massive secretive operation is instead to distract the public and change the subject, as most of these posts involve cheerleading for China, the revolutionary history of the Communist Party, or other symbols of the regime. We discuss how these results fit with what is known about the Chinese censorship program and suggest how they may change our broader theoretical understanding of common knowledge and information control in authoritarian regimes.

AB  - Our study examined the relationship between media portrayals of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement in hard and fake news in varying media modalities (print versus video) and participant attitudes toward African Americans. We also examined sociodemographic factors that may be related to susceptibility of fake news. Participants were primed with either hard or fake news (print or video) prior to completing the online questionnaire. Participants included 385 college students from a large southeastern public university. The findings revealed a direct effect of fake news on attitudes toward African Americans but only if the news was from a printed media modality. Hard news also had a positive impact on participant attitudes if from a printed media modality. These findings may help explain why information learned via fake news is persistent over time. Biological sex and political affiliation were associated with the impact of media priming on participants, with male and Republican participants being more susceptible to the effects of fake news. The results of this study should be helpful to those involved in policy making regarding social media and fake news and are timely considering that the BLM movement is growing stronger and the increase in fake news is ongoing.

AB  - Celebrity culture was a crucial, though unrecognised, component of the early anti-apartheid struggle. Between 1948 and the foundation of the Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) in Britain in 1960, activists discovered celebrity to be a valuable political tool. The strategic use of celebrity secured media coverage, mobilised support for the struggle, and built a transnational network of activists and collaborative institutions. By analysing celebrity as a tool of protest in the pre-Sharpeville era, this article will illuminate its centrality in the future "war of representation" between South African authorities and global anti-apartheid protest. I focus on British Anglican priest and anti-apartheid activist Trevor Huddleston who reached international fame in the early 1950s as a leader of the moral crusade against apartheid. The South African state increased its offensive on Huddleston as his reputation grew, leading to his recall to England in late 1955. The Huddleston affair instructed both sides about the promises and perils of the use of celebrity in the global war over public opinion. I argue that this standoff was a precursor of the 1970s campaign of propaganda and disinformation that the South African government launched to counter anti-apartheid movements in the West.

AB  - The current economic crisis has triggered fierce debates among policy-makers and the media across and within European countries about the need for a closer European fiscal union. Using a novel dataset derived from the Eurobarometer surveys, this article investigates European citizens' opinions towards such fiscal integration. We find that both country-level variables (such as expected country-level costs/benefits) and individual-level variables (such as distrust towards European Union institutions, ideology and altruism) have significant explanatory power. We also uncover a notable intra-generational divide across young citizens of euro creditor and euro debtor countries, and show that this reflects their varying expectations regarding the future costs and benefits of fiscal integration. This demonstrates that the same demographic groups in different countries may have widely varying positions towards fiscal integration.

AB  - New ubiquitous information and communication technologies, in particular recording-enabled smart devices and social media programs, are giving rise to a profound new power for ordinary people to monitor and track each other on a global scale. Along with this growing capacity to monitor one another is a new capacity to explicitly and publicly judge one another-to rate, rank, comment on, shame and humiliate each other through the net. Drawing upon warnings from Kierkegaard and Mill on the power of public opinion to produce conformity, I argue a new apparatus of surveillance and control is being generated that threatens individual freedom through a coercion of the will by an anonymous and interconnected crowd. I conclude that we must urgently assess how to protect individuals from a social tyranny of the public enabled by these new technologies while effective measures can still be taken to mitigate their dangers.

AB  - Drawing on a multidisciplinary approach to explore the causal links between gender and sociotropic anxiety, this article studies the characteristics and magnitude of gender differences in anxiety to a range of social risks and threats. Specifically, it tests whether gender differences with regard to perceived vulnerability, personality traits, ideology and values, and awareness (political interest and news media exposure) mediate the effect of gender by means of mediational regression analyses. The analysis also includes a test for acquiescence bias. Gender is found to be a significant predictor of an individual's sociotropic anxiety. Vulnerability, personality traits, ideology and values, and awareness all mediate the effect of gender. A significant effect of gender remains even when all other mediating factors were taken into consideration.

AB  - A repeated argument to invalidate the legitimacy of a debate on Catalonia's independence is the existence of a spiral of silence affecting unionist supporters. However, we find inconclusive empirical evidence to sustain this claim. Although survey data show that willingness to talk about secession is higher among pro-independence supporters both in face-to-face and online environments, multivariate regression models - taking into account the perception of the opinion climate - reveal a different and more complex picture. Pro-independence supporters are highly mobilized particularly in like-minded and private environments, but this enthusiasm decreases when they perceive their ideas not to be shared by the majority, whereas unionist supporters show a more stable pattern irrespective of the opinion climate. In publicly exposed arenas like social media, where activists abound, willingness to talk is lower and differences between both sides are minimal. Overall, the results are hardly consistent with the patterns of behaviour that would be expected in a spiral of silence.

AB  - This study examined how news audience's predispositions (value and outcome involvement, political and gun ownership identities) predicted perceived media bias in mass shooting coverage against gun owners and intention to participate in discursive activities concerning gun issues. Republicans, strong identifiers of gun ownership, and those who perceived the outcome of tightening gun ownership would affect their lives predicted perceptions of media bias. Strong party identifiers, gun ownership identifiers, and those who displayed outcome involvement predicted intention to participate in discursive activities. Perceived media bias was not found to predict the intention to participate in discursive activities concerning gun issues. The results extended the theoretical discussion of corrective action hypothesis and increased our understanding of both individual-level (personal involvement) and social-psychological level (social identities) factors relevant to biased media perception.

Through a gender-focused content analysis of 878 news items, we show how, despite the scholarly argument regarding a 'gender-blind' socio-historical attitude towards Meir, the Israeli media discourse did in fact strongly emphasise gender-oriented elements while covering her 1969 candidacy. However, the historical comparison also shows that, with the passage of time, the Israeli press was significantly affected by political personalisation trends, as well as by a growing influence of more conservative voices, and as a result became far more gender-centred and stereotypical in Livni's case.

AB  - This study examines the interrelationships amongst and between news attention, education, and political tolerance. Based on the theoretical presumption that the mainstream news media tend to reflect the prejudices and ideologies of the dominant groups in a society, news portrayal of groups regarded as deviant and/or controversial can be expected to be negative in valence. Hence, news attention is expected to lead to more negative attitudes toward such groups, which in turn breeds intolerance toward them. Meanwhile, education may moderate the relationship between news attention and tolerance. Research questions and hypotheses are examined through analyzing the data from a representative survey conducted in Hong Kong. The findings confirm the negative, indirect effect of news attention on tolerance through attitude toward deviant groups. Education is also found to relate to tolerance in a complicated and contradictory manner: while education has a direct positive effect on tolerance, it also strengthens the negative impact that attitude toward deviant groups has on tolerance. The theoretical and social implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Aquaculture plays a significant role in meeting the world's demand for seafood. There is much controversy about aquaculture, and fish farming in particular. Previous research has explored public perceptions about risks and benefits of aquaculture, but some areas remain understudied. We sought to explore public opinion about inland aquaculture among individuals in the U.S. Furthermore, we sought to better understand predictors of environmental policy support. We examined risk/benefit perceptions, emotions, media, and objective knowledge. We considered two dimensions of policy - those related to regulation, and those related to growth. We gathered data though a survey of 3,000 randomly sampled households in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. We found that individuals generally viewed aquaculture favorably. Furthermore, we found that emotions were strong predictors of support for policies that promote the growth of Wisconsin aquaculture. Alternatively, risk/benefit perceptions were strong predictors of policy related to regulation. Thus, different predictors explained different dimensions of policy support.

AB  - In this paper, we assess public attitudes on climate change in Europe over the last decade. Using aggregate figures from the Special Eurobarometer surveys on Climate Change, we find that environmental concern is directly re-lated to per capita income, social trust, secondary education, the physical distress associated with hot weather, media coverage, the share of young people in the total population, and monetary losses caused by extreme weather episodes. It is also inversely related to greenhouse gas emissions, relative power position of right-wing parties in government and tertiary education. Moreover, we find a significant, opposite impact for two dummies for years 2017 and 2019, which we respectively associate with the effects of Donald Trump's denial campaigns and the U.S. Paris Agreement withdrawal announcement, and Greta Thunberg's environmental activism.

AB  - In this article we analyse the news coverage of the 2009 EP elections in all 27 EU member states (N = 52,009). We propose that the extent to which these second-order elections are salient to the media depends on political parties contesting the elections. Consistent with expectations, the findings suggest that the saliency of EP elections is increasing and that the degree of political contestation over Europe contributes to this development in a nonlinear fashion so that only when contestation develops beyond a certain point, does media coverage increase.

AB  - In this article, I examine the discursive portrayals of gendered experience and subject positions through Sarjita Jain's "Girliyapa," an online entertainment channel (on YouTube) for female-oriented content in India. I demonstrate how the question of female pleasure that the channel repeatedly foregrounds by way of introducing relatively censored topics of discussion (such as girls buying condoms or articulating their orientation toward same-sex love) is inextricably intertwined with a gender politics that never turns a blind eye to the existing conventions, stereotypes, or structural inequalities that precipitate gender-based violence and discrimination throughout the country. The widespread prevalence of marital rape, color prejudice, and workplace sexism which, in turn, does not allow for a straightforward valorization of girl power is thus satirically interrogated by "Girliyapa."

TI  - 'Your Rights at Work' campaign: Australia's 'most sophisticated political campaign'
T2  - LABOR HISTORY
LA  - English
AB  - The Australian labor movement faced an unprecedented challenge to trade union and workers' rights when the conservative coalition government introduced the Work Choices legislation in 2005. The unions' Your Rights at Work campaign became the most significant political campaign mounted by a non-party political group in Australian history for its blend of television advertising, mobilizing and grassroots organizing, web-based campaigning and televised national days of protest. The unions' strong campaign influenced public opinion powerfully against the laws, and in response the government mounted a fierce attack on the legitimacy of unions as 'bullies' and unrepresentative of ordinary working people. The contest had high stakes for the future of unions in Australia and for the 2007 federal election. This article examines the unions' campaign strategies, with a particular focus on their use of information communication technologies. It argues that the significance of the campaign was its hybrid nature, combining innovative media-based campaigning with traditional organizing through communities. The campaign was a major influence over people's votes and the Australian Labor Party's victory in the November election.

AB  - This article investigates the complex relationship between endogenous and exogenous, deterministic and stochastic stimulating factors in public opinion dynamics. An asynchronous multiagent network model is proposed to explore the interaction mechanism between individual opinions and the public opinion in online multiagent network community, including both the micro and the macro patterns of opinion evolution. In addition, based on random network models, a novel algorithm is provided for opinion evolution prediction. The model property analysis and numerical experiments show that the proposed asynchronous multiagent network model can assimilate and explain some interesting phenomena that are observed in the real world. Further case studies with numerical simulation and real-world applications confirm the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed model in public opinion analysis. The results challenge the common perception that mass media or opinion facilitators play the fundamental role in controlling the development trends of public opinion. This study shows that the formation and evolution of public opinion in the presence of opinion leaders depend also on an individual's emotional inertia and conformity pressures from peers in the same topic group.

AB  - Vaccines and climate change have much in common. In both cases, a scientific consensus contrasts with a divided public opinion. They also exemplify coupled human-environment systems involving common pool resources. Here we used machine learning algorithms to analyze the sentiment of 87 million tweets on climate change and vaccines in order to characterize Twitter user sentiment and the structure of user and community networks. We found that the vaccine conversation was characterized by much less interaction between individuals with differing sentiment toward vaccines. Community-level interactions followed this pattern, showing less interaction between communities of opposite sentiment toward vaccines. Additionally, vaccine community networks were more fragmented and exhibited numerous isolated communities of neutral sentiment. Finally, pro-vaccine individuals overwhelmingly believed in anthropogenic climate change, but the converse was not true. We propose mechanisms that might explain these results, pertaining to how the spatial scale of an environment system can structure human populations.

AB  - The present paper explores not only the psychological effects of 11 September in the political fields, but also connects with the risk of pre-emption in US international affairs. What is important to discuss in this work is the role played by the media in portraying news, and a pejorative image of Islam. This ancient religion is presented as being backward and barbaric in many senses. Beyond having an encompassing understanding of the history of Islam, the media dissuades public opinion the preventive war is the only valid resource. The project of Enlightenment has been gone forever. It was replaced by modernity. As civilization West developed a technophile sentiment of superiority that fulfilled the gap given by secularization. It is hypothesized that 9/11 represents the encounter of two civilizations whose cultural values are at odds. This belief is oriented at creating a demonization of Islam. First and foremost, both religions, Islam and Christianity have coexisted in peace over centuries. Secondly, Arabs even supported Judaism in its attempts to achieve independence from Rome. This begs a striking question, to what groups these stereotypes are conducive? While demonization paves the ways to reduce the sentiment of culprit, preemption give a reason to act.

AB  - Context: Although observers have long highlighted the relationship of public distrust, government regulation, and media depictions of nursing-home scandals, no study has systematically analyzed the way in which nursing homes have been portrayed in the national media. This study examines how nursing homes were depicted in four leading national newspapersthe New York Times, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, and Los Angeles Timesfrom 1999 to 2008. Methods: We used keyword searches of the LexisNexis database to identify 1,704 articles pertaining to nursing homes. We then analyzed the content of each article and assessed its tone, themes, prominence, and central actor. We used basic frequencies and descriptive statistics to examine the articles content, both cross-sectionally and over time. Findings: Approximately one-third of the articles were published in 1999/2000, and a comparatively high percentage (12.4%) appeared in 2005. Most were news stories (89.8%), and about one-quarter were on the front page of the newspaper or section. Most focused on government (42.3%) or industry (39.2%) interests, with very few on residents/family (13.3%) and community (5.3%) concerns. Most were negative (45.1%) or neutral (37.0%) in tone, and very few were positive (9.6%) or mixed (8.3%). Common themes were quality (57.0%), financing (33.4%), and negligence/fraud (28.1%). Both tone and themes varied across newspapers and years. Conclusions: Overall, our findings highlight the longitudinal variation in the four widely read newspapers framing of nursing-home coverage, regarding not only tone but also shifts in media attention from one aspect of this complex policy area to another. The predominantly negative media reports contribute to the poor public opinion of nursing homes and, in turn, of the people who live and work in them. These reports also place nursing homes at a competitive disadvantage and may pose challenges to health delivery reform, including care integration across settings.

AB  - The goal of the present work is to analyze the use of social networks as a tool for social empowerment by Spanish university students, and their perception of the university as an institution that contributes to the formation of a critical and active citizenship, that provides them with the relevant digital competences. The literature review shows possible discrepancies regarding the effect of new forms of digital communication in empowering young people, specially university students, as well as the existence of issues related to clarify this digital stage. Following, a typological analysis of the perception of university students regarding social information networks, social empowerment and the role of the university is presented. Using the data collected through a structured questionnaire of a sample of 236 students of social science degrees, an analysis of typologies is performed with the algorithm K Medias. Three clusters significantly different - labeled as "total sceptics", "dual moderates" and "pro-digitals"- are identified. Its prevalence and its characterization are explained: belief and behaviour profiles related to these beliefs. The paper concludes with several recommendations for future research regarding the perception of the students about the use of social networks as a tool for social transformation and the role of the university in this area.

AB  - Volunteers are extensively involved in monitoring and controlling invasive species. Most research has examined volunteer activity in groups organized "top-down", but we examined a local community-based group removing lionfish in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) with a specific focus on the use of social media by the group. Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois miles, P. lunulate and P. russelii) are invasive in the Western Atlantic Ocean and can impact the composition and function of coral reef communities. In response, resource managers and scientists have organized programs using divers and snorkelers to remove lionfish. In the volunteer-led BVI program, participants searched for and culled lionfish in their spare time and used a public Facebook group to record their activity. We compiled all lionfish-related posts from 2012 to 2014 (n = 654). Lionfish were reported at 147 sites, and 1451 lionfish were culled from 117 sites, but activity was concentrated at 35 established dive/snorkeling sites. We also performed SCUBA surveys (n = 27 sites). Survey results were consistent with Facebook reports in suggesting that culling made lionfish wary but did not consistently reduce lionfish abundance or size-distributions. Most removals were conducted by a core group of locals whereas a much larger group of locals and visitors, some of whom apparently participated after seeing the Facebook page, contributed mainly by reporting the location of sightings. Those removing lionfish frequently followed-up on posted sightings, suggesting that social networking facilitated information sharing by guiding the selection of hunting sites. Posts were also used by participants to encourage one another and share negative attitudes about lionfish. Community-based groups are challenged by limited resources, however social-media networks may facilitate communication among participants in ways that help motivate, coordinate and direct group activity.

AB  - This article explores the use of conspiracy theories by the Russian international television channel Russia Today (RT). Based on Mark Fenster's definition of conspiracy theory as a populist theory of power, the article studies the process of how various conspiratorial notions in programmes broadcast by RT legitimise Russian domestic and foreign policies and, in turn, delegitimise policies of the American government. It argues that the conspiratorial component of RT's broadcasting appears as a political instrument in the context of the post-Cold War world and is applied to attract various global audiences with different political views.

AB  - Traditionally, two competing claims have arisen that attempt to explain the role of political sophistication in media effectiveness. I reassess the positive versus negative impacts of political sophistication on media priming effects by considering a curvilinear approach. I combine public opinion data (National Election Studies) on candidate selection criteria in 1992 and 2000 presidential elections with content analyses of campaign news coverage to see which segment of voters at different sophistication levels is most susceptible to media agendas. Quadratic regression analyses reveal that an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between voters' susceptibility to campaign news and their level of political sophistication. Such a curvilinear relationship means that the moderately sophisticated are more likely to accept news agendas than the least or most sophisticated. The findings illuminate the long-standing debate about the inconsistent linear relationships between the two variables, providing a more cogent explanation underlying media priming effects.

AB  - This article traces the transnational flows of constructions of the hypersexualized Muslim male through a comparative analysis of love jihad in India and the specter of grooming gangs in the UK. While the former is conceived as an act of seduction and conversion, and the latter through violent rape imaginaries, foregrounding both of these narratives are sexual, gender, and family dynamics that are integral to the fear of demographic change. Building upon these narratives, this study analyzes how influential women in Hindu nationalist and European/North American far-right milieus circulate images, videos, and discourses on social media that depict Muslim men as predatory and violent, targeting Hindu and white girls, respectively. By positioning themselves as the daughters, wives, and mothers of the nation, these far-right female influencers invoke a sense of reproductive urgency, as well as advance claims of the perceived threat of, and safety from, hypersexualized Muslim men. This article illustrates how local ideological narratives of Muslim sexuality are embedded into global Islamophobic tropes of gendered nationalist imaginaries.

AB  - Background: Monitoring public confidence and hesitancy is crucial for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Social media listening (infoveillance) can not only monitor public attitudes on COVID-19 vaccines but also assess the dissemination of and public engagement with these opinions.
   Objective: This study aims to assess global hesitancy, confidence, and public engagement toward COVID-19 vaccination.
   Methods: We collected posts mentioning the COVID-19 vaccine between June and July 2020 on Twitter from New York (United States), London (United Kingdom), Mumbai (India), and Sao Paulo (Brazil), and Sina Weibo posts from Beijing (China). In total, we manually coded 12,886 posts from the five global metropolises with high COVID-19 burdens, and after assessment, 7032 posts were included in the analysis. We manually double-coded these posts using a coding framework developed according to the World Health Organization's Confidence, Complacency, and Convenience model of vaccine hesitancy, and conducted engagement analysis to investigate public communication about COVID-19 vaccines on social media.
   Results: Among social media users, 36.4% (571/1568) in New York, 51.3% (738/1440) in London, 67.3% (144/214) in Sao Paulo, 69.8% (726/1040) in Mumbai, and 76.8% (2128/2770) in Beijing indicated that they intended to accept a COVID-19 vaccination. With a high perceived risk of getting COVID-19, more tweeters in New York and London expressed a lack of confidence in vaccine safety, distrust in governments and experts, and widespread misinformation or rumors. Tweeters from Mumbai, Sao Paulo, and Beijing worried more about vaccine production and supply, whereas tweeters from New York and London had more concerns about vaccine distribution and inequity. Negative tweets expressing lack of vaccine confidence and misinformation or rumors had more followers and attracted more public engagement online.
   Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is prevalent worldwide, and negative tweets attract higher engagement on social media. It is urgent to develop an effective vaccine campaign that boosts public confidence and addresses hesitancy for COVID-19 vaccine rollouts.

KW  - COMMUNICATION
AB  - While watching television, more and more citizens comment the program live on social media. This is especially interesting in the case of political debates, as viewers' comments might not only allow us to tap into public opinion, but they can also be an influential factor of their own and contribute to public discourse. This article analyzes how the TV debate between the candidates for chancellor during the German election campaign 2013 was discussed on Twitter. To do so, the transcript of the debate is linked to a set of N = 120,557 tweets containing the hashtag #tvduell. The results indicate that the candidates were only to a minor degree successful in getting their topics to the Twitter debate. An optimistic reading of the results suggests that Twitter serves as a complement to draw attention to topics neglected in the official debate. A more pessimistic reading would point to the fact that the discourse on Twitter seems to be dominated by sarcastic or funny rather than by substantial content.

AB  - Public awareness of water-and drought-related issues is an important yet relatively unexplored component of water use behavior. To examine this relationship, we first quantified news media coverage of drought in California from 2005 to 2015, a period with two distinct droughts; the later drought received unprecedentedly high media coverage, whereas the earlier drought did not, as the United States was experiencing an economic downturn coinciding with a historic presidential election. Comparing this coverage to Google search frequency confirmed that public attention followed news media trends. We then modeled single-family residential water consumption in 20 service areas in the San Francisco Bay Area during the same period using geospatially explicit data and including news media coverage as a covariate. Model outputs revealed the factors affecting water use for populations of varying demographics. Importantly, the models estimated that an increase of 100 drought-related articles in a bimonthly period was associated with an 11 to 18% reduction in water use. Then, we evaluated high-resolution water consumption data from smart meters, known as advanced metering infrastructure, in one of the previously modeled service areas to evaluate breakpoints in water use trends. Results demonstrated that whereas nonresidential commercial irrigation customers responded to changes in climate, single-family residential customers decreased water use at the fastest rate following heavy drought-related news media coverage. These results highlight the need for water resource planners and decision makers to further consider the importance of effective, internally and externally driven, public awareness and education in water demand behavior and management.

AB  - There is an ongoing academic debate whether social media empowers activists and advocacy groups in relation to established political actors and media gatekeepers. This article investigates these premises by analysing the influence of various actors in two policy debates on Twitter, environmental policy (climate change) and Internet governance (net neutrality). We extract tweets on both topics and code the respective 500 most central accounts according to a categorisation of relevant political actor groups. Applying methods from social network analysis, we reveal temporally fluctuating actor constellations and network structures which converge to elite actors during high attention periods. Furthermore, a comparative keyword analysis shows that non-governmental organisations and citizen media emphasise personalised connective action frames, whereas political actors and traditional media tend to refer to the political decision-making process and its institutions. Both findings are in line with cyclical conceptions of policy processes.

AB  - The topic of childhood vaccinations has received much news media attention recently, prompting scholars to examine how the public has responded. In light of this news, and the deep divide that seems to exist between parents who support childhood vaccinations and those who do not, this study examines how and why individuals may involve themselves in communication about vaccinations, particularly on social media or in other online environments. Focusing on the concept of communicative action and drawing from spiral of silence and other research, a survey of mothers (N=455) found that those who do not support childhood vaccinations are more likely to engage in communication about the issue, including information seeking, attending, forefending, permitting, forwarding, and sharing. In addition, issue importance and affective and cognitive involvement help drive communicative action regarding childhood vaccinations, which could affect public opinion or public perceptions of the issue. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - This article identifies and analyzes the emergence of an educational film revolution in Turkey during the Cold War era as a result of a transnational communication network. This network of institutions including the United States Information Services (USIS) and the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) engaged in film diplomacy by influencing the government and ministries of Turkey to sponsor, produce, distribute and exhibit educational films. This study identifies key institutional agents and investigates how feedback-loops between institutions create asymmetrical power relations to shape culture, policy and public opinion through film technologies. This examination expands upon the existing historical knowledge about educational films by analyzing previously unexamined archival materials from the Turkish and American archives.

KW  - migration policy
AB  - Moving beyond short-term public opinion accounts for Brexit this article considers how Britain's historic policy and political dynamics on migration led to the outcome of the EU referendum and how the latter is likely to transform current immigration policies. To do so, we explore historic and theoretical tensions in UK migration policy and politics over the last six decades. We show how these unresolved tensions allowed Eurosceptics to harness negative attitudes to the increasingly salient issue of immigration. We argue that a sufficient proportion of the UK's elite and electorate proved unable and unwilling to subordinate its desire for entirely domestic control' over immigration to the EU's right-based regime, let alone see fellow EU citizens in the UK as anything other than immigrants, ultimately giving Leave victory. The referendum process and outcome exposed the debate about free movement and migration to much wider public scrutiny and so raised more profound questions about the future of the British economy and the political model necessary to sustain it. We argue that, with the Brexit negotiations under constant public scrutiny a new, largely immovable parameter was set by the EU referendum result for the medium term that seems likely to lead to a decline in Europeanised' migration policy in the UK.

AB  - Online social networking platforms allow people to freely express their ideas, opinions, and emotions negatively or positively. Previous studies have examined sentiments on these platforms to study their behavior in different contexts and purposes. The mechanism of collecting public opinion information has attracted researchers to automatically classify the polarity of public opinions based on the use of concise language in messages, such as tweets, by analyzing social media data. In this paper, we extend the preceding work where an unsupervised approach to automatically detect extreme opinions/posts in social networks is proposed. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on five different social network and media datasets. In this work, we use a semi-supervised approach known as BERT to reevaluate the accuracy of our prior approach and the obtained classified dataset. The experiment proves that in these datasets, posts that were previously classified as negative or positive extreme are extremely negative or positive in many cases while using BERT. Furthermore, BERT shows the capability to classify the extreme sentiments when fine-tuned with an appropriate extreme sentiments dataset.

AB  - Who and what influences the issues that policymakers attend to is central to the question of how power is exercised in politics. This study builds upon research by Soroka that proposes an expanded model of agenda setting as a means to examine how the media influences issue salience for the public and policymakers. It expands on Soroka's model by investigating the hypothesis that photographic attention to environmental issues in the news media influences issue salience for the mass public and governmental decision makers. There is little research that substantiates the idea, but it is widely believed that photographs have influence on the policy agenda. I use a dynamic, multidirectional model to estimate whether the volume of news photographs, in addition to news stories, influences issue salience among the mass public and policymakers. Data are longitudinal and measures of attention are operationalized as the number of congressional committee meetings, concern for the environment as a most important problem in public opinion polls, environmental news stories in The New York Times, and environmental news photographs in Time magazine. Results suggest that photographic attention does influence environmental policy agenda dynamics in some counterintuitive ways that are distinct from the effects of the news stories. While news stories appear to increase public attention toward the environment, they have little influence on policymaker attention. News photographs, on the other hand, appear to drive congressional committee attention but elicit an ambivalent public response.

AB  - Objective To analyse the prevalence and correlates of smoking in cars as well as attitudes towards the extension of smoking bans in private vehicles among Italian adults.
   Methods We used data from two surveys conducted in 2011 and 2012 on an overall sample of 6167 individuals representative of the Italian population aged 15years.
   Results The prevalence of smoking while driving was 65.5% among adult smokers. There was a negative trend with age and a positive one with education level. Smoking while driving was more prevalent among men, heavy smokers and smokers who believe there is little or no increased risk of accidents from smoking while driving. Among smokers who smoke while driving, 20.9% smoke in cars carrying children. Overall, 79.6% of Italians (88.2% non-smokers and 48.8% current smokers) support a ban on smoking in cars, and 92.5% (95.0% non-smokers and 83.5% current smokers) support such a ban in cars carrying children.
   Conclusions Despite the high percentage of smokers who smoke in private vehicles, the majority of the Italian population (including smokers) support the introduction of a smoking ban in cars, particularly in cars carrying children. Smoke-free laws should therefore be extended to private vehicles, particularly if they are carrying children. Moreover, warning labels on cigarette packages should include information on the increased risk of accidents when smoking while driving. Mass media campaigns should also consider targeting this topic.

AB  - Recently, many companies have adopted smart factories to increase productivity and efficiency. However, the fashion industry is one of the industries that have been relatively slow at embracing automation and switching to a smart factory. The purpose of the study is to suggest the future direction of the low-maturity smart factory in the fashion industry through newspaper analysis. In this study, semantic network analysis and convergence of iterated correlation (CONCOR) analysis were performed on 15,523 news articles. The analyses revealed that the smart fashion factory was developing to incorporate automated, unmanned, and intelligent operation. The problem of job loss owing to the smart factory was also heavily addressed in the news articles. In the newspaper articles, the view that the smart factory is efficient, fast, and innovative, and concerns regarding the possible damages that will result from hacking and machine malfunction were simultaneously expressed. Therefore, if news about security improvement emerges in the future, negative public opinion will be reduced, positively influencing the government's support for smart factories and policy making.

AB  - The aim of this article is to analyze how the Spanish newspapers covered an international event such as the Egyptian spring from 2011 to 2013. From the perspective of the representation of Arab-Islamic issues, this study carries out a quantitative content analysis on the four reference newspapers in Spain (ABC, El Mundo, El Pais, and La Vanguardia) to find out whether there was an Islamophobic or Islamophilic treatment during the Egyptian revolution. The results of the 3,045 articles analyzed show that Spanish newspapers were remarkably interested in Egyptian events and that cultural discourses were not relevant in the coverage. However, it is necessary to specify these outcomes by newspaper, because each paper proposed its own take on the matter based on information provided by press agencies.

AB  - Background The psychiatric treatment gap is substantial in Korea, implying barriers in seeking help. Objectives This study aims to explore barriers of seeing psychiatrists, expressed on the internet by age groups. Methods A corpus of data was garnered extensively from internet communities, blogs and social network services from 1 January 2016 to 31 July 2019. Among the texts collected, texts containing words linked to psychiatry were selected. Then the corpus was dismantled into words by using natural language processing. Words linked to barriers to seeking help were identified and classified. Then the words from web communities that we were able to identify the age groups were additionally organized by age groups. Results 97,730,360 articles were identified and 6,097,369 were included in the analysis. Words implying the barriers were selected and classified into four groups of structural discrimination, public prejudice, low accessibility, and adverse drug effects. Structural discrimination was the greatest barrier occupying 34%, followed by public prejudice (27.8%), adverse drug effects (18.6%), and cost/low accessibility (16.1%). In the analysis by age groups, structural discrimination caused teenagers (51%), job seekers (64%) and mothers with children (43%) the most concern. In contrast, the public prejudice (49%) was the greatest barriers in the senior group. Conclusions Although structural discrimination may most contribute to barriers to visiting psychiatrists in Korea, variation by generations may exist. Along with the general attempt to tackle the discrimination, customized approach might be needed.

AB  - This paper explores newspapers' representation of different actors in infrastructure projects, and analyses the power relations between them through a case study in Hong Kong. The case in question is the highly controversial Express Rail Link, which connects Hong Kong to the extensive high-speed railway network in mainland China. It finds that under an immature democratic system, opponents' political power and free press play important roles in forcing the government to make concessions outside the formal framework. The methodological framework employs a concept that takes media representation as a reflection of power [Van Dijk, Teun A. 1996. "Discourse, Power and Access." In Texts and Practices: Readings in Critical Discourse Analysis, edited by Carmen Caldas-Coulthard and Malcolm Coulthard, 84-104. London: Routledge], and three theories seldom used in the planning field Indexing Theory [Bennett, W. Lance. 1990. "Toward a Theory of Press-State Relations in the United States." Journal of Communication 40 (2): 103-127. doi:10.1111/j.1460-2466.1990.tb02265.x], Agenda Setting Theory [McCombs, Maxwell E., and Donald L. Shaw. 1972. "The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media." Public Opinion Quarterly 36 (2): 176-187] and Law of Anticipated Reactions [Zelditch, Morris, and John Ford. 1994. "Uncertainty, Potential Power, and Nondecisions." Social Psychology Quarterly 57 (1): 64]. A new method for Critical Discourse Analysis, in the form of colour charts, is developed to portray the competition for representation in newspapers of different actors, paying special attention to power inequalities and which actors gain access to newspaper discourse and how they use it to convey specific messages. In this study, 500 newspaper articles (from two key newspapers - SCMP and Apple Daily) and 75 government publications in Hong Kong are analysed.

AB  - Renewable energypolicies havebeen recognized as a cornerstone in the transitiontoward low-emission energy systems. Media reports are an important variable in the policy-making process, interrelating politicians and the public. To understandthe changes inmedia framing of a pioneering renewable energy support act, wecollected 6,645 articles fromfive Germany-wide newspapers between 2000 and 2017 on the German Renewable Energy Act. Wedevelopeda structural topicmodel basedon a change-point analysis to assess the temporal patterns of newspaper coverage. Weintroduced the notion of topic sentiment to elucidate the emotional content of topics. The results show that after its enactment, optimism about renewable energies dominated the media agenda. After 2012, however, the Renewable Energy Act was more associated with its costs. Such shifts in renewable energy policy framing may limit political leverage to reach ambitious climate and energy targets.

AB  - Why are some interest groups successfully using social networks for their lobbying campaign whereas others don't? This article suggests that some actors are aware that social networks can be used in a positive direction to lobby their target. It also shows that some others are not aware of the dimension of those networks. In order to test the effect of social networks, this article draws on an unprecedented dataset of interest groups in the European Union. Using quantitative and qualitative analysis of more than 44,000 tweets through dedicated software, this article studies the success and the failure of several interest groups. The findings indicate that Intermarche, a French supermarket chain, failed to communicate with the general public, leaving scope to the NGO Bloom helped by a successful comic posted on the web. By doing so, Intermarche has won on the field of lobbying to decision makers in Brussels, but lost on the public opinion field. This is a clear case of an absence of social media strategy in a lobbying campaign. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper investigated contemporary journalistic English translations of Arabic Islamic terms and concepts in light of the current civil wars in the Middle East and North Africa, and the war on terror as well as Islamophobia and the refugee crisis. It studied the critical role of translation agencies in reframing and renegotiating the Islamic glossary through their own lens, which may be ideologically positioned. The paper further examined the English translations of the Arabic Islamic terms and concepts in the target texts which were published by the Washington-based advocacy group the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI). The data were collected manually from MEMRI's online archive from the years 2013 to 2016. The data selection was based on a designed search that linked Daesh (ISIS) and any of its aliases with any of the Islamic terms and concepts which are repeatedly used in media narratives within the context of the 'war on terror' and 'Islamic extremism'. The study employed Baker's (2006) narrative-informed theory and Newmark's (1988) translation procedures taxonomy to assist in the data analysis. The findings suggested that transference (transliteration) is a significant procedure used by MEMRI in justifying, legitimizing and normalizing particular narratives to the public and that translators are decisive participants in constituting and informing the social and political reality. The findings also demonstrated that narrativity features, relationality in particular, are significant tools in reconstructing reality in translation. Through translation, MEMRI draws upon the metanarrative of the 'war on terror' in promoting its ideologically laden agenda of terrorist Arabs and Muslims.

AB  - Although the Syrian refugee crisis has received global media attention, studies exploring the representation of Syrian refugees in American media have been lacking. Using both content and critical discourse analysis methods, this paper examines the discursive constructions of Syrian refugees in the New York Times during the 2016 presidential election. The findings reveal that despite the overall "neutral" tone of media coverage, this did not negate the existence of implicit bias toward refugees. The linguistic strategies employed, though at times engaging in narratives of victimhood, result in the demarcation of Syrian refugees as "universal refugee subjects" rooted in past historical and geographical contexts. Together with an emphasis on vulnerability over agency, pernicious depictions of Syrian refugees as terrorists or political bargaining tools, and an assumption of popular resentment by the public, these seemingly disconnected discursive strategies collectively contribute to the dehumanization of Syrian refugees, with damaging implications for the case of their acceptance into American society.

AB  - Background: Twitter is an indicator of real-world performance, thus, is an appropriate arena to assess the social consideration and attitudes toward psychosis.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to perform a mixed-methods study of the content and key metrics of tweets referring to psychosis in comparison with tweets referring to control diseases (breast cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer, and human immunodeficiency virus).
   Methods: Each tweet's content was rated as nonmedical (NM: testimonies, health care products, solidarity or awareness and misuse) or medical (M: included a reference to the illness's diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, or prevention). NM tweets were classified as positive or pejorative. We assessed the appropriateness of the medical content. The number of retweets generated and the potential reach and impact of the hashtags analyzed was also investigated.
   Results: We analyzed a total of 15,443 tweets: 8055 classified as NM and 7287 as M. Psychosis-related tweets (PRT) had a significantly higher frequency of misuse 33.3% (212/636) vs 1.15% (853/7419; P<.001) and pejorative content 36.2% (231/636) vs 11.33% (840/7419; P<.001). The medical content of the PRT showed the highest scientific appropriateness 100% (391/391) vs 93.66% (6030/6439; P<.001) and had a higher frequency of content about disease prevention. The potential reach and impact of the tweets related to psychosis were low, but they had a high retweet-to-tweet ratio.
   Conclusions: We show a reduced number and a different pattern of contents in tweets about psychosis compared with control diseases. PRT showed a predominance of nonmedical content with increased frequencies of misuse and pejorative tone. However, the medical content of PRT showed high scientific appropriateness aimed toward prevention.

KW  - TRUST
AB  - This article reverses the direction of the causal link between corruption and media, in particular, journalism, as it has been commonly investigated in communication studies. Few existing studies have explored the effects of corruption on journalists' practices and self-conceptions. Based on a comparative survey of 1,764 journalists in 12 European countries and two Arab states, conducted in 2011 and 2012, this article investigates how perceived corruption-considered as an extra-media macro determinant-affects journalists' perceptions of Media Accountability Instruments (MAI) impact and of governmental pressures on journalism quality. The empirical results obtained show that the more widespread corruption is in a country's public sector, the lower the journalists' perceptions of the MAI impact and the higher their perceptions of government pressures.

AB  - Purpose Public attitudes towards COVID-19 and social distancing are critical in reducing its spread. It is therefore important to understand public reactions and information dissemination in all major forms, including on social media. This article investigates important issues reflected on Twitter in the early stages of the public reaction to COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach A thematic analysis of the most retweeted English-language tweets mentioning COVID-19 during March 10-29, 2020. Findings The main themes identified for the 87 qualifying tweets accounting for 14 million retweets were: lockdown life; attitude towards social restrictions; politics; safety messages; people with COVID-19; support for key workers; work; and COVID-19 facts/news. Research limitations/implications Twitter played many positive roles, mainly through unofficial tweets. Users shared social distancing information, helped build support for social distancing, criticised government responses, expressed support for key workers and helped each other cope with social isolation. A few popular tweets not supporting social distancing show that government messages sometimes failed. Practical implications Public health campaigns in future may consider encouraging grass roots social web activity to support campaign goals. At a methodological level, analysing retweet counts emphasised politics and ignored practical implementation issues. Originality/value This is the first qualitative analysis of general COVID-19-related retweeting.

AB  - Motivated by the environmental challenges and the increase in energy demand, this review assesses the suitability of nuclear power production as an alternative option to using fossil fuels. First, we assess the competitiveness of nuclear power compared to other power sources considering its economic efficiency, environmental impact and implications for health, and conclude that this is a viable option to serve in addition to and as a backup to renewable sources. Second, we review previous findings in various fields on advantages and disadvantages of nuclear power technology and conclude that there is a gap between reality and perception. Third, we discuss challenges related to nuclear weapons proliferation and misperceived public opinion on nuclear power. We conclude that the gap between perception and reality stems from a lack of consolidated interdisciplinary view, media communications focusing mainly on unilateral assessments.

AB  - This study examines how the term "schizophrenia" is used in Italian newspapers.
   The survey was carried out on the 22 Italian newspapers which allow word scanning on their online website. In each newspaper, the terms "schizophrenia" and "schizophrenic" were scanned in all articles, from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008. Each article containing these terms was analyzed in relation to metaphorical usage to describe or denigrate people or groups not diagnosed "schizophrenic" and in relation to non-metaphoric, direct descriptions of people using mental health services, or the illness itself.
   "Schizophrenia/schizophrenic" was reported in 1,087 articles. It was used far more frequently as a metaphor (73.7%) than in reference to people actually given the diagnosis (19.2%) or to the disorder itself (7.1%). The 801 metaphoric uses were classified into the following categories: incoherence/contradiction/split (682, 85.1%), dangerousness/aggressiveness (34, 4.4%), and eccentricity/oddness (84, 10.5%). 117 out of 209 (55.9%) articles on people diagnosed with the disorder were in news section of which 57 (48.7%) referred to homicides, 17 (14.5%) to other assaults by the person, and 33 (28.2%) to assaults directed at the person.
   These data confirm previous studies showing that the media disproportionately report negative stories about people diagnosed with "schizophrenia", and in particular, equate the diagnosis with violence. The study also demonstrates that the metaphorical use of the term to denigrate groups or individuals may be an equal or greater contributor to the stigma and prejudice experienced by people with this mental disorder.

AB  - This study is a cross-national comparative content analysis of the broadsheet press coverage of EU Common Foreign and Security issues (n=1453) focusing on the presence of indicators of a European Public Sphere. Specifically, we investigated the visibility of Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) stories, featuring actors, the tone of coverage and the presence of 'risk' and 'opportunity' frames. We found that CFSP was more visible in broadsheets during key events. In terms of actors in the news, coverage was primarily Europeanized. When evaluative, CFSP news had a distinctive, positive dimension, especially with reference to the European Union (EU) as an entity. CFSP issues were more frequently framed in terms of 'opportunity' rather than in terms of 'risk'. Our findings suggest that the news coverage of CFSP is truly different from the coverage of EU affairs in general. Implications for the formation of public opinion and the legitimacy of CFSP are discussed. Comparative European Politics (2011) 9, 52-75. doi:10.1057/cep.2009.10

AB  - The popular notion of a trade-off between social and defense spending-or guns versus butter-appears often in elite discourse, popular media, and empirical studies of budgetary politics. Yet, there are good reasons to suspect that the public's preferences for these types of spending do not reflect that trade-off. I develop a theory that whether social and defense spending preferences are competing or complementary depends on if the respondent views the government as an important contributor to job creation. Using data from fifty-nine surveys in twenty-seven countries from 1985 to 2008, I show that favoring government-financed job creation makes a respondent much more likely to view social and defense spending as complementary. Indeed, aside from the anomalous case of the United States, preferences are consistent with guns yield butter instead of guns versus butter. This theory has important implications for the thermostatic model of policy responsiveness and theories of budgetary politics.

AB  - Welfare states are exposed to a host of cost-inducing 'reform pressures'. An experiment implemented in Germany, Norway and Sweden tests how variousreform pressure framesaffect perceptions about the future financial sustainability of the welfare state. Such perceptions have been shown to moderate electoral punishment for welfare reform, but little is known about their origins. Hypotheses are formulated in dialogue with newer research on welfare state change, as well as with older theory expecting more stability in policy and attitudes (the 'new politics' framework). Research drawing on 'deservingness theory' is also consulted. The results suggest large variations in impact across treatments. The most influential path to effective pressure framing is to 'zoom in' on specific economic pressures linked to undeserving groups (above all immigration, but also to some extent low employment). Conversely, a message emphasizing pressure linked to a very deserving group (population aging) had little effect. A second conceivable path to pressure framing entails 'zooming out' - making messages span a diverse and more broadly threatening set of challenges. This possibility, however, received weaker support.

AB  - Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the commonly used treatment modalities for patients with severe mental disorders. However, acceptance of ECT by the patient and relatives often depends on how the health-care professionals themselves present the treatment modality to the patients and their relatives. There is a lack of information about the knowledge and attitude toward ECT among health professionals. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge about and attitude toward ECT among nursing students. Methodology: Knowledge of and attitudes toward ECT among nursing students were assessed using ECT knowledge and attitude questionnaires. Results: The study included 183 nursing students. Majority (n = 62; 60.8%) of the participants obtained information about ECT from media (movies, television, print media, etc.). None of the students had full knowledge about ECT. Although a significant proportion of students had knowledge about the ECT procedure and consent procedure, majority of them had poor knowledge about the effectiveness, mechanism of action, indications, and side effects of ECT. Negative attitudes were also highly prevalent, with more than two-thirds of the participants having negative attitudes toward ECT on more than half of the attitude items of the scale. Total knowledge score positively correlated with total attitude score, suggesting that higher knowledge was associated with more positive attitude. Conclusions: Although nursing students have knowledge about basic ECT procedure and consent, they lack knowledge about the effectiveness, mechanism of action, indications, and side effects of ECT. Negative attitude toward ECT is also highly prevalent among nursing students. Accordingly, there is a need to improve the knowledge and address the negative attitude of nursing students, which may ultimately lead to better acceptance of the treatment.

AB  - Despite the lingering conflict between the government of Vietnam and the Vietnamese diaspora in the United States, issues of remittance and relationship relaxation between the refugees and Vietnamese government happened both in the 1990s. Recent years have seen the attitude-change of the returning diaspora and their shifting strategies of working in Vietnam. This paper describes the first step toward rapprochement between Vietnam and its diaspora in the United States, by analysing the attempts of Vietnam to approach its diaspora in the United States and the reactions of the diasporic community members. On the other hand, it also describes the efforts of Vietnamese Americans to empower Vietnamese people through philanthropic and civic engagement activities. The rapprochement via media and civic engagement reveals a shift from hard, intense ideological conflict to soft tactics in the transnational relation between Vietnam and the Vietnamese diaspora in the United States. This paper concludes that the process to rapprochement is still challenged by the significant differences in political views between the two sides. It suggests that the process of negotiation and conflict resolution be conducted with openness, honesty and acceptance of differences.

AB  - Think tanks in the last half-century have replaced universities as the main source of new policy ideas. The big Washington think tanks have taken their place alongside interest groups, media, and political parties as among the most influential organizations in American politics, including foreign policy. The author discusses the world of the Washington think tanks, how and why they are able to influence policy in ways that university-based academics do not, and the attractions and negatives of a think tank career. He analyzes the recent trends in think tanks, including their global spread. He concludes by asking if think tanks have now become victims of their own earlier success.

AB  - The 14th General Election saw a significant transition in political views and voting inclinations on social networking sites (SNSs) such as Facebook and Twitter among Malaysian youths despite their absence in the electorate. These digital natives rely heavily on SNSs to consolidate information, to interpret social structures and to engage among themselves as political cognizance is often limited to them. This study proposes that peer engagement through SNSs significantly affects Malaysian youth attitudes on political views, particularly on the act of voting. The study also investigates the extent of information sharing and identifies the motivations that drive Malaysian youths to seek information on voting from their SNSs. A self-administrated questionnaire was conducted with a total of 371 participants; of which 60% were female and 40% male. Our analysis showed that Malaysian youths are significantly influenced by their social connection to others hence posts by their peers and political figures on SNSs receive a higher engagement. There is strong evidence that discussing politics with friends on SNSs is preferred and is in line with their personal interests, thus creating a more inclusive experience among them. This further substantiates the positive impact of SNS consumption by Malaysian youths towards their potential voting participation. The outcomes of the study will ascertain the benefits of SNSs in reaching out to youth to nurture patriotism that could create a sophisticated social networking framework to understand the social impact of new media in the Malaysian context and onwards - on a global scale.

AB  - Sentiment is important in studies of news values, public opinion, negative campaigning or political polarization and an explosive expansion of digital textual data and fast progress in automated text analysis provide vast opportunities for innovative social science research. Unfortunately, tools currently available for automated sentiment analysis are mostly restricted to English texts and require considerable contextual adaption to produce valid results. We present a procedure for collecting fine-grained sentiment scores through crowdcoding to build a negative sentiment dictionary in a language and for a domain of choice. The dictionary enables the analysis of large text corpora that resource-intensive hand-coding struggles to cope with. We calculate the tonality of sentences from dictionary words and we validate these estimates with results from manual coding. The results show that the crowdbased dictionary provides efficient and valid measurement of sentiment. Empirical examples illustrate its use by analyzing the tonality of party statements and media reports.

AB  - Traditional heterosexual dating and courtship scripts (e.g., men pay for date, women take partner's last name in marriage) reflect different standards of desirable behavior for women and men. Analogous to sexual double standards, dating double standards reflect the greater agency and power traditionally accorded to men in society. In the present study, we investigated factors related to young heterosexual adults' endorsement of dating double standards. Participants were 330 female and male U.S. undergraduates at a California public university (57 % female, ages 18-25 years-old) from diverse ethnic backgrounds. In the Heterosexual Dating Double-Standards Scale, respondents rate the desirability of five dating and courtship behaviors (initiate date, hold door open, pay for date, propose marriage, take spouse's last name) separately for women and men. Preliminary analyses revealed participants generally expressed double standards by rating the desirability of behaviors differently for female and male characters in the traditional direction (e.g., paying for a date rated more desirable for a man than for a woman). We predicted dating double standards would be positively related to factors previously found to predict traditional gender roles (viewing popular media, religious attendance) as well as attitudes that reflect traditional views (conservative political beliefs, benevolent and hostile sexism, disavowing a feminist identity). These hypotheses were generally supported. Among these correlations, dating double standards were strongly associated with benevolent sexism (among women and men) and with hostile sexism (among men). Implications for future research are discussed.

AB  - Exemplification research has consistently shown effects of vox pops' exemplars on audience judgments, whereby people tend to follow the opinion of a few fellow citizens. In this study, we gain some insight into why-and especially for whom-ordinary citizens are such influential "opinion-givers." Importantly, we look at populist attitudes as a potential moderator for exemplification effects by comparing news reports containing vox pops with purely journalistic news reports providing the same arguments. In a web-based experiment, we show that both perceptual and persuasive effects are moderated by participants' populist attitudes, and thus, their resonance with the "voice of the people."

AB  - We explore at a world level the awareness of nanotechnology expressed through the most popular online social media: Facebook. We aimed at identifying future trends, the most interested countries and the public perception of ethics, funding and economic issues. We found that graphene and carbon nanotubes are the most followed nanomaterials. Our poll showed that the continents with the most interest are Asia and Africa. A total of 43% would like to have a world commission regulating nanomedicine. In addition, 43% would give priority to theranostics. Over 90% believe that nanomedicine has an economic impact. Finally, we observed that the continents of living and origin of poll contributors correlated with ethic and funding opinions. This study highlights the potential of online social media to influence scientific communities, grant committees and nanotechnology companies, spreading nanotechnology awareness in emerging countries and among new generations.

AB  - Objective In 2017, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reached an agreement with Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company (SFNTC) stipulating that SFNTC will remove 'natural' and 'additive-free' from Natural American Spirit (NAS) marketing to combat misperceptions that NAS is a healthier cigarette. The purpose of this study was to assess experimentally the potential effectiveness of the agreement in addressing NAS misperceptions.
   Methods In an online experiment, 820 current and former smokers were assigned randomly to advertising conditions with existing claims from NAS advertisements, modified claims or a no-exposure control. Advertising conditions included (1) 'original' NAS advertising text before the agreement; (2) '2017 agreement' language permissible under the FDA-SFNTC agreement (removing 'natural', 'additive-free'); (3) more restrictive ('stricter') language representing additional regulation (removing 'natural' from the brand name and the phrases 'tobacco+water', 'no chemicals'). Participants completed outcome measures assessing misinformed beliefs and intentions towards NAS.
   Results One-way ANOVA showed that relative to the 'original' language, the '2017 agreement' language reduced misconceptions about NAS addictiveness, but not about health or constituent composition. Yet 'stricter' language significantly reduced all categories of misinformed beliefs, which in turn mediated effects on (lower) intentions to use NAS.
   Conclusion The 2017 agreement helps dispel some misconceptions about NAS addictiveness, but does not sufficiently rectify misinformation about health or composition. Since 'stricter' language more effectively corrects misinformed beliefs, our results suggest the need for further regulations in addressing misinformation that drives intentions towards NAS.

AB  - Plastic pollution through small particles, so-called microplastics, is acknowledged as an environmental problem of global dimension by both politicians, and the public. An increasing number of environmental studies investigate the exposure and effects of microplastics. Although there are many open questions, current scientific evidence does not confirm a high risk for the environment. At the same time, the issue receives great public attention, which in turn motivates various political and policy actions. So far, little research has examined the underlying social dimensions, i.e., the factors explaining individual risk perception of microplastics. This paper studies the perception of risks associated with microplastics concerning the environment and human health using data from a representative online survey conducted in Germany (n = 1027). We particularly examine the role of socio-demographics, individual awareness, knowledge factors, and the media's influence on risk perception. Our results show that a majority of the respondents rates the risks through microplastics very high for both the environment and human health. Regression analyses demonstrate that environmental awareness and knowledge of media narratives are the strongest predictors for this risk perception. Our study illustrates the incongruence between scientific knowledge, media framing, and the public opinion concerning the risk posed by microplastics.

AB  - The influence of partisan identification infiltrates all aspects of a democracy. This study employs an innovative design to explore the presidential debate-viewing experience among young citizens. Data were collected from across the United States for all three 2016 presidential debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump using pretest/posttest surveys and debate viewers' Twitter posts. Examining Twitter expression as a form of political elaboration, the study employs a social identity theoretical perspective to better understand the process through which viewers form political attitudes. Applying the theory of identity-motivated elaboration (TIME) to presidential debates, the current research illuminates how partisan social identification changes the way viewers think about political issues and, resultantly, evaluate candidates and form political opinions. A strong partisan social identification results in greater identity-consistent elaboration and Twitter expression throughout one's presidential debate viewing, which results in more biased candidate image evaluations and, subsequently, stronger preference for the in-party candidate.

Little research has investigated how biological attributions are spontaneously generated in real-world discourse regarding sexual rights. Through content analysis of newspaper and Twitter discussion of the referendum, this study aims to (1) establish the frequency of appeals to nature and their distribution across the various sides' of the debate and (2) analyse the forms these natural claims took and the rhetorical functions they fulfilled. Appeals to nature occurred in a minority of media discussion of the referendum (13.6% of newspaper articles and .3% of tweets). They were more prominent in material produced by anti-marriage equality commentators. Biological attributions predominantly occurred in relation to parenthood, traditional marriage, gender, and homosexuality. The article analyses the rhetorical dynamics of these natural claims and considers the implications for marriage equality research and activism. The analysis suggests appeals to nature allow anti-marriage equality discourse adapt to a cultural context that proscribes outright disapproval of same-sex relationships. However, it also queries whether previous research has overemphasized the significance of biological attributions in discourse about groups' rights.

AB  - On 2 December 2010, a forest fire broke out in the Carmel Mountains of northern Israel and burned for four days, becoming the biggest fire in Israel's history. Forty-four people were killed, 17,000 were evacuated from their homes, and 25 million square meters of land with millions of trees burned down, in what became known as the 'Carmel disaster.' This article examines Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's communication of the Carmel disaster, using content, rhetorical risk communication, performance analysis, and a national public opinion survey. We claim it exposes the dilemma of what we label 'cover-up risk communication.' The analysis will examine the geo and social political context in which the Carmel disaster occurred, the rhetorical and performance strategies the prime minister chose to use to communicate the risk in his television appearances during the crisis, and the mass media's response to them. The public's response to the prime minister's risk communication is presented through the national public opinion survey we conducted. This case study indicates that even if a leader makes effective use of central tenets of risk communication (inclusion, clarity, and addressing the public's values and norms), when risk communication serves to cover-up failure rather than being part of an overall policy of changing priorities for the benefit of the population, then it becomes what we labeled 'cover-up risk communication.' In addition, when the press does not fill its role as the public's 'watchdog,' it might reinforce cover-up communication by the leadership and compromise the chance to correct defects.

AB  - This article explores the events leading to the closure of the Zimbabwe Mirror Newspapers Group (ZMNG) in 2007. It narrates how the state in Zimbabwe, through its intelligence arm, the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), covertly took over the privately owned newspaper stable, publishers of the Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror, leading to the organization's demise. The article is informed by critical political economy theory, particularly the Propaganda Model and the concept of Social Control in the newsroom, linking Mirrorgate to the narrative of media control by the state in Zimbabwe. Interviews were conducted with key personnel former Mirror staff members -to collect data. Archival newspaper reports were also analysed to trace the development of Mirrorgate and its consequences on the Mirror's performance as a media entity. The article also benefits from experiential data accumulated through observation by the author as a former Mirror employee. The article shows that the Mirror takeover by the state had debilitating consequences on the organization's performance, and can be attributed as the major reason behind the newspaper stable's eventual collapse. The article also speculates on the possible reasons why the state could have taken over the newspaper company, particularly to manipulate public opinion during a time of political strife.

AB  - Considering that cable news has become a primary source of political information for many Americans, this article examines the role and impact of Fox News in the United States, particularly as it compares to other news outlets. We begin by offering a historical analysis of Fox News' formation and growth in popularity, including a review of existing scholarship on the network's impact on news consumers. Prior research as well as an additional nationally-representative dataset reveals that two policy areas are particularly potent among Fox News' consumers: immigration and climate change. Additionally, scholars have found initial evidence for the role of Fox News in shaping its viewers' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We then consider the cognitive processing utilized by news consumers, explaining how it may differ among individuals who opt to consume Fox News and those who get news from other sources. We conclude by reviewing why three specific areas-immigration, climate change, and COVID-19-resonate so strongly with Fox News consumers.

AB  - The article presents the results of a comparative analysis of subjective modality in literary and media texts. Subjective modality is connected with the speaker's attitude to the statement. In the text, it is realized in the form of the so-called modal meanings. We compare the ways of expressing subjective modality in the texts belonging to different functional styles: belles-lettres (emotive prose, drama, poetry), newspaper, and publicistic. We have chosen examples from fiction as well as from media texts, because we suppose that the modal meanings they convey depend on lexical and grammatical means of expressing subjective modality in the text; if it is a recorded text than the major role belongs to intonation. If modal markers can be found in the whole text, one can speak of the so-called 'diffuse modality'. The results of our analysis show that it is possible to single out three types of modal meanings forming three groups: group A - speaker's attitude to the content of the speech, group B - speaker's attitude to the addressee; group C - the attitude of the speaker towards themselves. Modal markers are mainly concentrated in leading segments of the text. In most of the texts, these means of expressing text modality are connected with text genre, especially in media texts, which belong to rational and emotional journalism. In media texts, subjective modality is often displayed by various communicative manipulative strategies used to form the public opinion.

AB  - Introduction Surveys suggest a dichotomy in how citizens view research for public benefit and research for commercial gain. Therefore, a research initiative, such as a learning health system, which works for both public and commercial benefit, may be controversial and lower public trust. Methods This study aimed to investigate what informed citizens considered to be appropriate uses of health data in a learning health system and why they made those decisions. Two-paired 4-day juries were run, with different jurors but the same purpose, expert witnesses, and facilitators. Overall, 694 people applied; 36 jurors were selected to match criteria based on demographics and privacy views. Jurors considered whether and why eight exemplars of anonymised patient data were acceptable. The exemplars were either planned initiatives to improve care pathways (Planned Examples) or possible commercial data uses (Potential Examples). Results These citizens' juries found that all Planned and two of the Potential Examples were considered appropriate by most, but not all, jurors because they could deliver public benefit. In general, positive health outcomes for patients were more acceptable than improved efficiency of services for the NHS, although they recognised that the latter also improved health. Jurors had concerns about whether improving efficiency would lead to inequitable distribution or closure of services, based on their existing understanding from media reports. Commercial gain that accrued secondary to this benefit was acceptable, with some jurors becoming more accepting of commercial uses as they understood them better. Prioritising profit, however, was unacceptable, regardless of any governance arrangements. Conclusions Jurors tended to be more accepting of data sharing to both private and public sectors after the jury process. Many jurors accept commercial gain if public benefit is achieved. Some were suspicious of data sharing for efficiency gains. Juries elicited more informed and nuanced judgement from citizens than surveys.

AB  - BackgroundWe compared knowledge about and attitudes toward epilepsy and the issuing of driver's licenses to people with epilepsy among non-medical students before and after media controversies.
   MethodsThe survey was performed in 2012 and 2014 using a structured questionnaire. Participants were non-medical students who attended a lecture on neurological diseases in children. The proportion of positive answers to each question in 2012 was compared with that in 2014. In addition, questions regarding attitudes toward driver's licenses were compared according to knowledge about car accidents linked to people with epilepsy.
   ResultsMore participants were familiar with epilepsy and had a favorable attitude toward epilepsy in 2014 than in 2012. In contrast, the proportion of participants who knew of car accidents linked to people with epilepsy was reduced in 2014 compared with 2012. The proportion of participants who did not think that severe punishment should be given to people with epilepsy if they caused a car accident decreased in 2014 among those without knowledge of car accidents.
   ConclusionsFamiliarity with and attitudes toward epilepsy were improved in 2014, whereas the decrease in proportion of positive answers on punishment among participants unfamiliar with car accidents suggests a latent worsening of public attitudes.

   This study examines the factors that shape public acceptance of homosexuality and support for same-sex marriage across age cohorts.
   Methods
   We analyzed data from two national surveys. We constructed hierarchical logistic and hierarchical ordinary least squares regressions for relevant age cohorts in order to test our hypotheses and explore our research questions.
   Results
   Our models suggest that personal contact has a greater impact on the attitudes of younger respondents, positively influencing public acceptance of homosexuality. Alternatively, religious and ideological predispositions have a greater impact on the attitudes of older individuals. When examining public support for gay marriage, we find that younger individuals have higher levels of deliberative engagement with the issue debate, while older individuals rely more heavily on their predispositions when determining issue stance. Interestingly, measures of media exposure are not significantly related to either public acceptance of homosexuality or support for same-sex marriage, suggesting that other factors may have a greater impact on public attitudes at this point in time.
   Conclusion
   The implications of these findings are discussed in light of the emergence of a new political generation and the continuing struggle for gay civil rights.

AB  - Seasonal influenza, causing complications, hospitalizations and deaths, generates a serious socio-economic burden, especially among elderly and high-risk subjects, as well as among adult individuals. Despite the availability and active free-of charge offer of influenza vaccines, vaccine coverage rates remain low and far from the target established by the Ministry of Health. Notwithstanding their effectiveness, vaccines are victims of prejudices and false myths, that contribute to the increasing phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy and loss of confidence. Media and, in particular, new media and information and communication technologies (ICTs) play a major role in disseminating health-related information. They are extremely promising devices for delivering health education and promoting disease prevention, including immunization. However, they can also have a negative impact on population's health attitudes and behaviors when channeling wrong, misleading information. During the 2014/2015 influenza vaccination campaign, the report of four deaths allegedly caused by administration of an adjuvanted influenza vaccine, Fluad - the so-called "Fluad case" - received an important media coverage, which contributed to the failure of the vaccination campaign, dramatically reducing the influenza vaccine uptake. In the extant literature, there is a dearth of information concerning the effect of the "Fluad case". The current study aims at quantifying the impact of the "Fluad effect" at the level of the Local Health Unit 3 (LHU3) ASL3 Genovese, Genoa, Italy. Ethical implications for health-care workers and health communication practitioners are also envisaged.

AB  - The recent spate of mass public shootings in the United States raises important questions about how these tragic events might impact mass opinion and public policy. Integrating research on focusing events, contextual effects and perceived threat, this article stipulates that residing near a mass shooting should increase support for gun control by making the threat of gun violence more salient. Drawing upon multiple data sources on mass public shootings paired with large-N survey data, it demonstrates that increased proximity to a mass shooting is associated with heightened public support for stricter gun control. Importantly, the results show that this effect does not vary by partisanship, but does vary as a function of salience-related event factors, such as repetition, magnitude and recency. Critically, the core result is replicated using panel data. Together, these results suggest a process of context-driven policy feedback between existing gun laws, egregious gun violence and demand for policy change.

AB  - Are citizens willing to accept journalistic fact-checks of misleading claims from candidates they support and to update their attitudes about those candidates? Previous studies have reached conflicting conclusions about the effects of exposure to counter-attitudinal information. As fact-checking has become more prominent, it is therefore worth examining how respondents respond to fact-checks of politicians-a question with important implications for understanding the effects of this journalistic format on elections. We present results to two experiments conducted during the 2016 campaign that test the effects of exposure to realistic journalistic fact-checks of claims made by Donald Trump during his convention speech and a general election debate. These messages improved the accuracy of respondents' factual beliefs, even among his supporters, but had no measurable effect on attitudes toward Trump. These results suggest that journalistic fact-checks can reduce misperceptions but often have minimal effects on candidate evaluations or vote choice.

AB  - The research analyses media discourse on migration in Italy, regarded as a means of reproducing and maintaining a racist interpretation of inter-group relations. The theoretical framework is the Critical Discourse Analysis approach. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed on data consisting of headlines and articles from the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, published between 1992 and 2009. Overall, it emerged that discourse is built according to themes and discursive strategies already identified by similar research based on European media, indicating how this system of representations defines a common sense of cultural belonging and a shared construction of ethnic relations. The rather long time span considered in the study allowed us to focus on how the discourse on migration in Italy might have evolved over time, but also to identify any elements that may have remained unchanged.

AB  - This paper focuses on migrants and migration in the context of the Czech Republic, an ethnically and nationally homogeneous country without significant migration experience. Despite this fact, the issue of migration became very prominent in 2015 and has been an integral part of Czech political and public discourse since then. Although the topic has attracted scholarly interest, but the reflection on migrant images held by citizens has been omitted. To fill this gap, first, we conducted a quantitative computer-assisted content analysis of the main Czech media (2015-2018) to investigate how important the issue of migration was and in what context migrants and migration were discussed in the media. We then conducted a series of focus groups with Czech citizens to answer not only how they perceived migrants and migration in general, but also how they perceived the (quality of) media coverage of this issue. The findings offer insight into patterns of media consumption: Our respondents were well aware that media representation of the topic is exaggerated and does not include all possible points of view. The prevailing perception was that the mostly negative media representation was fixated on the image of a migrant coming from the Middle East, most likely to be a terrorist who is not going to adapt to a "normal" life in the Czech Republic. Indeed, the very term migrant is mainly associated with someone who, according to the mental projections of the respondents, is "different" at first sight, fails to fit in and integrate into the majority society, does not look for work thus becoming dependent on the social system of the host country. In other words, for Czechs, people who come to settle and work are excluded from the socially constructed category of migrants.

AB  - Less researched than the second-order character of elections to the European Parliament (EP) is the 'Europeanness' of European elections and its implications for voter participation in these elections. This article aims to fill this gap by studying the Europeanness of the public debate in the run-up to the 2019 EP elections and the mobilizing power of European issues in these electoral contests. In doing this, we draw on a new data set covering intriguing aspects of the 2019 EP elections. The findings of the empirical analysis of media and survey data indicate that the elections to the EP were more European contests than ever before in the history of these elections - yet this is not true in the same way for all of the countries under consideration. Moreover, the Europeanness of electorates, measured as genuine orientations towards EU politics, matters for electoral participation and thus has the power to mobilize citizens. Nonetheless, national factors still play an important role in these elections. These findings are insightful for the future assessment of EP elections and the scholarly debate over multi-level electoral politics in Europe.

AB  - Gun violence is a large and growing problem in the United States. Many reformers look towards elections to spur policy change in this area. In this paper, we explore the effects of school shootings on electoral mobilization and election outcomes. We pair data from several sources that measure validated voter registration; validated voter turnout; and the electoral performance of officials at the local, state, and federal levels with regression discontinuity and panel methods. Our effects show that shootings have little to no effect on electoral outcomes in the United States. Our work demonstrates thateven whentragic events occur that are squarely in the realm of elected officials' responsibility, have high levels of issue salience, are highly-covered by the media, draw citizens' attention, and (perhaps) shift public opinion, these seemingly favorable conditions may not be enough to elicit democratic accountability.

AB  - Conventionalized images of wartime loss picture scripted, ceremonial events, such as flag-draped coffins off-loaded from planes or soldiers handing a triangular folded flag to grieving relatives saying, "on behalf of a grateful nation." In comparison, unconventionalized war photographs, such as battlefield pictures, present more chaotic, less standardized images. I develop a theory of wartime media that examines how qualities of both the signal (whether photographs deal with military loss or militarism, and whether images employ conventionalized or unconventionalized imagery) and the receiver (the partisanship of the individual) influence individual opinion. I anticipate that viewing conventionalized images of loss will affect the likelihood that individuals shift from supporting to opposing a conflict and that partisanship can mitigate this effect. Results from analyses of seven experimental studies with 1,769 subjects and varied research designs strongly support the theory, finding that qualities of the signal and individual (and their interaction) influence the likelihood of wartime opinion change. These findings help to explain previous weak results linking wartime photography and public opinion, improve our understanding of wartime public opinion dynamics, and speak directly to current policy debates.

AB  - As the energy industry became one of the most important aspects in our society, many nations took significant efforts toward energy policies and plans reflecting on public perceptions of energy issues. To efficiently address it, the current study collects user-created contents in social networking services and proposes a new word network model for swiftly observing public perceptions regarding energy issues. The results indicate that the proposed model and employed methodologies can successfully address public perceptions regarding specific energy issues. Based on the results of the network model and comparison with traditional media channels in this study, we found that social networking services can be one of the notable resources for exploring public perceptions of specific energy issues. In particular, although the majority of energy-related issues were presented and reported by traditional media channels and responded by social networking services, social networking services can show faster responsiveness than traditional media channels regarding several energy issues, which were crucially related to economic (cost) or accident-related events, and categorized as energy related threats or burdens. This means that the public can immediately respond to specific energy-related issues that may directly affect an individual's situation or environment compared to more general and international energy issues.

AB  - Few studies examine whether the public agenda responds to different types of issue coverage in the same way. After outlining why such differences are likely, this study takes advantage of daily polling data and a rare sequence of news cycles surrounding the issue of gun control to compare how coverage of different political actors and events drives an issue's placement on the public agenda. Coverage generated by the citizen activist group, the Million Mom March, is estimated to have a greater influence on public opinion compared to coverage of a string of school shootings or, finally, President Clinton's campaign. Tests show that group or political biases do not drive these results but, along with evidence from the 2009 health care protests, coverage of citizen demonstrations consistently outperforms presidential news in its association with the mass public agenda. Although elected officials are granted greater access to news media coverage, the findings suggest that such access does not grant a corresponding influence on the public agenda. More generally, it demonstrates that news storyline content has measurable implications for news media agenda setting at the national level.

AB  - To what extent are groups selectively exposed to news that affects their self-interest? We theorize that having an interest at stake in an issue increases the importance of related information, promoting selective exposure to politics. The framework we develop generates hypotheses we test with data from 29 U.S. public opinion surveys conducted between 1997 and 2007 with a combined sample size of over 40,000 respondents. We find that though the propensity to follow news is a general predisposition, people's exposure to specific issues varies based on whether or not information is relevant to their interests, as defined by social group (or issue public) membership. While general awareness of political matters is normatively desirable, exposure to issues relevant to one's self-interest is an equally important and necessary precondition for political engagement and issue public formation. Evidence from this study suggests that citizens with low levels of general news exposure may, nonetheless, attend to personally relevant information, enabling democratic accountability across dynamic information environments.

AB  - The Enlightenment has often been presented as the ideological programme of modernity, the set of ideas and values from which modern, democratic and secularized Western societies have emerged. This reading, however, fails to account for the diversity and polyphony of the Enlightenment. Another reading, that of Michel Foucault, insisted on the ethos of modernity that the Enlightenment would have brought: a critical relationship with the present and current events. Conversely, this interpretation neglects the militant and collective dimension of the Enlightenment that favoured emancipation through knowledge. This article suggests, rather, seeing in the Enlightenment a way of problematizing modernity, of thinking about its contradictions. It develops this argument from a case study: the philosophes' reflections on the public and its ambivalences. The optimism of the Enlightenment's fight against prejudice was counterbalanced by a more pessimistic analysis of the new public space and of the media obstacles to the dissemination of knowledge and critical thinking.

AB  - The debates relating to social class and whether it is still a useful concept in describing a lived reality of the British population has never been far away from media, political and academic dispute. Thatcher's Britain throughout the 1980s attempted to dilute class meaning with what was called a home owning democracy' and thus end class collective politics through easily available credit for the working class while simultaneously attacking trade union organization, recruitment and political action.
   During the late 1990s and into the noughties a New Labour' administration attempted to exacerbate the end of class politics through an agenda of a cultural distinction' to class identity. Class struggle, class politics and class identity is embedded deep within the cultural norms practices, and history of British democracy. Consequently it is difficult if not impossible to prise class inequality in the UK away from and out of national, local and personal politics (Savage et al. 2015: 393-8). This paper focuses upon the sense that class politics, and cultural class distinction, within the UK had the biggest influence in determining a working-class Leave Vote' in the 2016 referendum within the UK. This paper explores accounts and narratives from working-class leave' voters though an ethnographic study of the political and social viewpoints of working-class communities of East London, and of ex-mining towns of Nottinghamshire. Framing into fuller context the anger and apathy of being left out', arguing that being left out' has been part of working-class political narratives for over 30 years. Going beyond frustration and apathy, a significant part of the narrative of working people was of not existing', suggesting certain important linkages with ongoing debates about new ways of conceptualizing class differences and class structures.

AB  - Many states have criminalized "revenge porn," an increasingly common form of online sexual abuse. Yet, we know little regarding attitudes toward these laws. Through an original survey of nearly 500 U.S. residents, we find widespread public support for criminalization, but support varies by respondent's self-identified gender and revenge porn type. Women favor criminalization more than men, but support falls among women and men when the subject created the media, colloquially known as "selfies" or "noodz." Results suggest that women expressing their sexuality are deemed less deserving of protection, reinforcing feminist legal critiques of criminal law as insufficient to prevent sexual abuse.

AB  - This study aimed to gauge the Hong Kong's public support towards new e-cigarette regulation, and examine the associated factors of the support. We conducted a two-stage, randomized cross-sectional telephone-based survey to assess the public support towards the banning of e-cigarette promotion and advertisement, its use in smoke-free venues, the sale to people aged under 18, and regulating the sale of nicotine-free e-cigarettes. Adults (aged 15 years or above) who were never smoking (n = 1706), ex-smoking (n = 1712) or currently smoking (n = 1834) were included. Over half (57.8%) supported all the four regulations. Banning of e-cigarette promotion and advertisement (71.7%) received slightly less support than the other three regulations (banning of e-cigarette use in smoke-free venues (81.5%); banning of e-cigarette sale to minors (93.9%); sale restriction of nicotine-free e-cigarettes (80.9%)). Current smokers, and perceiving e-cigarettes as less harmful than traditional cigarettes or not knowing the harmfulness, were associated with a lower level of support. Our findings showed a strong public support for further regulation of e-cigarettes in Hong Kong. Current stringent measures on tobacco and e-cigarettes, and media reports on the harmfulness of e-cigarettes may underpin the strong support for the regulation.

AB  - This article examines how and when populist discourses were mobilised within the 2016 UK European Union (EU) Referendum campaign, by examining the specific temporal conjunctions between the changing strategy of the official 'Vote Leave' campaign, British national newspaper reporting of the Referendum and shifts in public opinion. Our analysis shows that Vote Leave only started to utilise anti-elitist and exclusionary populist rhetoric at the mid-point of the campaign, in response to constricting political opportunities, but by so doing transformed the dynamic of the Referendum. We term this an example of 'strategic populist ventriloquism', where elite politicians appropriate the language of insurgency for political advantage, and argue that current conceptual frameworks on media and populism need to be broadened to accommodate these occasions.

AB  - In an era of digital technology and the Internet, terrorists can communicate their threats directly to citizens of Western countries. Yet no research has examined whether these messages change individuals' attitudes and behavior or the psychological processes underlying these effects. Two studies (conducted in 2008 and 2010) examined how American, Australian, and British participants responded to messages from Osama bin Laden that threatened violence if troops were not withdrawn from Afghanistan. Heightened fear in response to the message resulted in what we call "aggressive capitulation," characterized by two different group-protection responses: (1) submission to terrorist demands in the face of threats made against one's country and (2) support for increased efforts to combat the source of the threat but expressed in abstract terms that do not leave one's country vulnerable. Fear predicted influence over and above other variables relevant to persuasion. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Beliefs in conspiracy theories have attracted significant international media attention in recent years. This phenomenon has been studied in the US but while anecdotal evidence suggests it is also widespread among the Italian public, little evidence has been collected to assess it empirically. Using data from a 2016 survey, this pioneering study of the Italian case investigates the extent of diffusion of conspiracy theories among Italians and tests several hypotheses concerning individual determinants. The paper finds that conspiracism is indeed widely diffused in Italy. It is negatively associated with education and positively with religiosity, while no correlation is found with political trust. Beliefs in conspiracies are also related to rightwing orientation and support for the populist Five Star Movement.

AB  - In recent years, scholars have increasingly revealed the importance of celebrities in society, among them celebrity politicians. These celebrities not only influence political attitudes but also serve as role models for many individuals. Yet, little is known regarding what types of role models' politicians serve as in the context of health. To fill this gap, we examined three influential contemporary political leaders: Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, and the type of mediated role models each possibly comprise in the context of healthy living. By conducting a qualitative content analysis, we analyzed 90 articles from 2018 to 2019 from two leading newspapers in each of the three politician's countries, namely Russia, the USA, and Israel as well as the respective politician's Facebook pages. Our findings point to three types of potential role models' as political leaders: a health-promoting model (Putin), a hybrid model (Trump), and a model of non-existence (Netanyahu), as the literature points to mediated role models influencing individuals' beliefs and behaviors. This study contributes to the understanding of mediated types of role models' politicians potentially serve as in the context of health vital to people's personal health.

AB  - Health information and communication technologies (ICTs) are increasingly used but little is known about routine exposure to health information from ICTs and its associations with health behaviors. A territory-wide population-based dual landline and mobile telephone survey was conducted in 2016 in Hong Kong, where smartphone ownership and Internet access are among the most prevalent, easiest and fastest in the world. Health information exposure from traditional sources (television/radio/newspaper/magazine), Internet websites, social media sites and instant messaging (IM); and information on smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity were recorded. Prevalence was weighted by age, sex and education level of the general population. Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the association of health information exposure with smoking and alcohol consumption, whilst multivariable linear regression was used to assess the association with frequency of moderate and vigorous physical activity (days/week). Of 3063 respondents, most (71.6%) were often or sometimes exposed to health information from traditional sources, followed by Internet websites (40.9%), social media sites (40.7%), and IM (27.0%). Respondents with lower education and household income were less frequently exposed to health information from Internet websites, social media sites and IM (all P < 0.001). Health information exposure from IM was associated with being never smokers, and more frequent moderate and vigorous physical activity (all P for trend< 0.05). Health information exposure from IM was least frequent but associated with healthier behaviors. Further public health education campaigns can consider using IM to deliver information, particularly to disadvantaged groups.

AB  - Prosecuting anti-immigration party leaders for hate speech is theorized to yield electoral ramifications. We assess to what extent these trials are mediatized and whether news visibility of hate speech prosecution affects levels of anti-immigration party support. We compare four Western European countries (Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands) for which aggregate-level media and public opinion data are combined. We find that hate speech trials were highly mediatized, and dominated the headlines for protracted periods. This short-term news attention drives general news visibility for anti-immigration party actors. Thus, news about hate speech prosecution of anti-immigration politicians creates a reinforcing spiral of attention by increasing the general newsworthiness of a political actor. The findings seem to point to the cautious conclusion that hate speech prosecution is either directly or indirectly related to increased electoral support. While in France and Germany, general news visibility of anti-immigration party actors is associated with higher levels of electoral support, in the Netherlands and Belgium, news about hate speech prosecution has a weak and direct positive relationship with anti-immigration party support. This finding yields implications for political communication strategies of parties by suggesting that hate speech prosecution does not undermine the electoral performance of anti-immigration parties. In fact, initiating legal actions yields unintended effects by granting these parties a media platform.

AB  - This study examines how exposure to media characters of color shapes viewers' opinions of race-targeted policies. Exemplar-based information processing, attribution theory, and heuristic policy decision-making formed the theoretical foundation for the study. A 2 x 2 factorial experiment (N = 363) exposed participants to stereotypical or counterstereotypical exemplars representing the in-group (Whites) and the out-group (Blacks). The experiment revealed that exposure to stereotypical African American media characters compared to exposure to counter-stereotypical ones influenced real-world beliefs of African American stereotypes, internal attributions for perceived failures of this out-group, prejudicial feelings toward this outgroup, and lack of support for pro-minority affirmative action policies. A structural model established "internal attributions for out-group failures" as a crucial mediator. Implications for entertainment studies and political communication are discussed.

T2  - AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST
LA  - English

KW  - Catalonia
AB  - This article is a follow-up to an article published in the American Behavioral Scientist in 2017, titled "Shaping public opinion for confrontation: Catalan independence claims as represented in Spanish, Catalan, Valencian, and Basque Editorials." At that time, our study was based on opinions expressed in mainstream newspaper editorials during two significant events in Catalonia's recent history: the demonstration against the Spanish Constitutional Court ruling on the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of July 10, 2010, and the mass pro-independence demonstration held on September 11, 2012. The research sought to compare the press reports published in Catalonia, Valencia, and the Basque Country with those from the rest of Spain (primarily Madrid).
   This study applies the same methodology to analyze editorial pieces published during the campaign prior to the Catalan parliamentary elections on December 21, 2017. This date was historically significant for Catalonia because for the first time since the restoration of democracy following the Franco regime, the Spanish state had intervened in Catalonia's self-rule by using Article 155 of the Spanish constitution to call snap elections. At the time, the lead candidates for the pro-independence parties were Oriol Junqueras (Republican Left of Catalonia) and Carles Puigdemont (Together for Catalonia), the former in prison and the latter abroad (or in "exile," according to secessionists). In light of the opposing opinions and perspectives, we believe it is worth analyzing and comparing mainstream editorials from Catalonia (Barcelona) and Spain (Madrid) once again, to ascertain the dominant narratives used in both to explain the Catalan and Spanish position and frame of reference. We have extended the scope to include mainstream online as well as printed media with a view to achieving a better understanding and providing a wider overview of the public agenda and debate at that time.

AB  - Conflicts over environmental sustainability are increasingly being fought in court, such as the use of Public Environmental Litigation (PEL) to challenge developments impacting the environment in Australia and elsewhere. News media coverage of PEL introduces legal actors to the dynamics of mediatized environmental conflict, which provides a platform for conflict actors to gain mediated visibility for their cause to influence public debate. When legal opportunities, such as PEL, are used as a campaign tactic, the dynamics of contest are exposed and, while courts have some power over legal actors, parties seek news media to favorably translate legal outcomes to the public. This article explores the nexus of PEL, news media, and communication strategies to find greater understanding of who gains from the mediated visibility that occurs when transnational environmental campaigns take their claims to court. Using content analysis and discourse analysis of news texts and semi-structured interviews relating to eight PEL cases instigated to stop the Adani Carmichael coal megamine in Australia, we seek better understanding of the mechanisms at play when PEL campaigns appear in news media, and find that the dominance of outside court sources in news coverage not only privilege the political aspects of PEL over the legal, but highlights how strategic litigation, such as PEL, can be used to influence public opinion and, therefore, a political response, regarding environmental conflict.

AB  - Objective: Focusing dentists and dental hygienists employed in the Public Dental Health Services (PDHSs) in Norway, this study set out to assess whether socio-demographic factors, familiarity with nanotechnology and social trust are associated with dental health care workers' perceived risks and benefits of use of nanomaterials in dentistry and whether those associations varied according to professional status. It was hypothesized that increased knowledge, trust in stakeholders and familiarity with nanomaterials would decrease the risk and increase benefit perceptions among dental health care workers. Methods: Electronic questionnaires were administered to a census of 1792 dentists and dental hygienists. Results: About 64% and 69% of respondents perceived respectively, risk and benefits associated with use of nanomaterials. Multiple variable logistic regression revealed that dentists were more likely than hygienists to perceive risks (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.3) and benefits (OR = 3.6, 95% CI 2.1-6.2). Having experience with dental nanomaterials (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.7) and feeling safe (OR = 6.6, 95% CI 3.1-14.2) increased perceived benefits. Having moderate or much correct knowledge about nanotechnology (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.5-3.5) increased the likelihood of perceived risk. Conclusions: Policy makers should consider the factors that influence dental health care workers' risk and benefit perceptions associated with the use of nanomaterials in dentistry.

AB  - Crisis communication scholars have used framing theory to argue that how the media characterizes varying aspects of a crisis can influence the public's perception of the event. While much of the crisis-framing research has been content analysis-driven, providing numbers and percentages of news stories that fit a certain story type, it is also important to examine how shifts in public opinion and policy may be indicative of and influenced by the ongoing discourse that news outlets use to characterize international crises. In this study, we use inductive analysis to describe the frames used by US evening network news to characterize the 2011 Japan nuclear crisis and outline how this coverage may have shaped and reflected public opinion and policy in the US during and following the crisis.

AB  - This article investigates the third level of agenda setting during the anti-Moral and National Education movement in Hong Kong-a Chinese society-in the summer of 2012. Our content and network analyses focus on 532 newspaper articles and 342 public surveys describing the event. Evidence reveals a strong correlation between the media and online and off-line public attribute network agendas. Results also demonstrate that, at the third level, the media agenda can lose its influence on the setting of the off-line public agenda. Several contingent factors include the political stance and news media credibility. In addition, Hong Kong activists' young age may influence the agenda-setting effects. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of competing frames in newspaper coverage of offshore outsourcing, an issue that is characterized by a predominantly negative, unemployment-focused media framing. The findings of a randomized, controlled experiment (N = 152) demonstrate that conventional framing effects do hold for this issue and for this media context by moving recipients' attitudes in the direction consistent with the valence of the frame. However, they also show the backfire effect of the positively valenced frame among recipients with greater interest in political and economic news, who become less supportive of outsourcing if they read a story framing outsourcing from a consumer-oriented perspective. Our results contribute to the ongoing debate about the limits of framing effects on forming opinion about contentious policy issues and demonstrate the challenges for nondominant perspectives to make their way to news-savvy audiences even when the nature of the issue in question necessitates considering them.

TI  - REINFORCEMENT EFFECTS BETWEEN DIGITAL MEDIA USE AND POLITICAL PARTICIPATION A META-ANALYSIS OF REPEATED-WAVE PANEL DATA
T2  - PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY
LA  - English
KW  - INTERNET USE
KW  - COMMUNICATION
AB  - As digital media use has rapidly increased in prevalence and diversified in form, scholars across the globe have focused extensive attention on how the use of digital media relates to political participation. To assess the results of this emerging body of research, we conduct the first meta-analysis of repeated-wave panel data studies on the relationship between digital media use and political participation. The findings, based on 38 survey-based, repeated-wave panel studies (279 coefficients) bring new evidence to bear on two questions central to this literature. First, the findings provide new insight into the classic mobilization versus reinforcement debate: contrary to common assumption, the findings support a reinforcement effect, whereby those who are already politically active are motivated to use digital media. Second, the results indicate that the relationship between digital media use and political participation is durable, as studies with a longer time lag were more likely to yield positive and significant effects. Taken together, this evidence in support of a durable reinforcement effect implies the potential for digital media use to contribute to increased inequality in political participation over time. In the concluding discussion, we outline directions for further theoretical inquiry and empirical research that leverage the value of repeated-wave panel studies to make causal inferences.

AB  - This article examines the evolving process of China's information management at sub-national level through the prism of a crisis event. Specifically, it investigates the response of officials and the media to Beijing's fatal floods of 2012the heaviest and the deadliest floods the Chinese capital has seen in 60years. The article draws on ethnographic observations, the analysis of interviews with Chinese media professionals, officials and media scholars, as well as the coverage of the storm by two prominent, but distinct Beijing news outlets: an official daily, Beijing Ribao and a commercial daily, Jinghua Shibao. The analysis reveals various strategies deployed by Beijing authorities to positively shape public opinion, and the media's creative implementation of official directives. Namely, the two newspapers fused regular news coverage with different styles of positive framing. This process of mutual and diverse adaption highlights the increasingly dynamic nature of China's crisis communication and public opinion management.

AB  - Consumers are becoming increasingly aware and sensitive to the negative environmental impact caused by the fashion industry and by consumers' high consumption of fashion. This study analyzes people's unfiltered comments and behaviors on social media sites related to the sustainability of fashion products. Recently, the number of social media data, called big data, has exploded, transcending the level that can be analyzed with existing tools. This study aims to identify consumers' perceptions of sustainable fashion using the search words "sustainable fashion" to examine public opinion trends found in SNS big data. Text mining was employed to extract meaningful words from the SNS texts using semantic network analysis to analyze the connectivity and propagation trends. The text data were collected from Facebook using the Google search engine to detect tendencies in the occurrence of keywords related to sustainable fashion in SNS over the past five years (2016 similar to 2020). The results revealed that the keywords "eco-friendly", "ethical", and "recycle" had the highest frequency and centrality. As a result of grouping the keywords based on their correlations, sustainable fashion texts from the SNS data could be classified into four groups: "supply chain of sustainable fashion", "circular fashion", "fashion business concepts for sustainability", and "academic importance of sustainable fashion". This study strengthens the extent of research by using SNS big data and provides guidelines for product development and communication strategies for a sustainable fashion industry based on customers' meaningful opinions.

AB  - From a critical discourse analysis of all gay-related news reports in five mainstream Beijing newspapers between 2010 and 2015, this article distils four dominant categories of images of gays and lesbians represented by the news media: gays as crime victims because of their presumed inherent weakness, as violent subjects, as enemies of traditional values and as a source of social instability. This means that despite legal and official recognition of homosexuality in China, it is still tainted with sin and perversion in the mainstream public discourse. The way in which the Chinese news media and journalists construct the image of the homosexual person notably differs from that in the West. Newspapers treat gay men and lesbians separately, with the former deemed socially destabilising elements of violence and promiscuity and the latter seen as closer to normal' heterosexuals in the way they think and act. In addition, Chinese news reports almost completely silence gay people who are rarely interviewed, and the few who are see only their expressions of shame or regret published. This article discusses and interprets such discursive strategies within the specific sociocultural context of Chinese society.

AB  - Our everyday life is influenced by an overproduction of images and by an iconogenic surplus that is connected to the proliferation of media. These contribute to both the quality and quantity of communication, but simultaneously amplify the knowledge gap between an audience that is able to critically process messages and another that is affected uncritically by prejudices and stereotypes. Bellino argues for a critical media education to address this gap by encouraging the development of students' critical thinking and social awareness. In this article we will discuss the results of a research-driven design project in which visual communication design students engaged with theories of cultural stereotypes and critiqued the role of media in their perpetuation. We adopted Kolb's model of experiential learning as recent published research demonstrates that art and design students have difficulties in conventional academic approaches to learning theory. In this regard students learned theories of stereotype through doing and making and embodied this learning in their critical project outcomes.

T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Chimpanzees are endangered in their native Africa but in the United States, they are housed not only in zoos and research centers but owned privately as pets and performers. In 2008, survey data revealed that the public is less likely to think that chimpanzees are endangered compared to other great apes, and that this is likely the result of media misportrayals in movies, television and advertisements. Here, we use an experimental survey paradigm with composite images of chimpanzees to determine the effects of specific image characteristics. We found that those viewing a photograph of a chimpanzee with a human standing nearby were 35.5% more likely to consider wild populations to be stable/healthy compared to those seeing the exact same picture without a human. Likewise, the presence of a human in the photograph increases the likelihood that they consider chimpanzees as appealing as a pet. We also found that respondents seeing images in which chimpanzees are shown in typically human settings (such as an office space) were more likely to perceive wild populations as being stable and healthy compared to those seeing chimpanzees in other contexts. These findings shed light on the way that media portrayals of chimpanzees influence public attitudes about this important and endangered species.

AB  - This contribution provides evidence for the sources of sympathies for radical right-wing populist (RRP) parties in a longitudinal perspective. We extend previous knowledge by evaluating the impact of media attention on individual changes of RRP party sympathies. To test our hypotheses, we use panel data from The Netherlands and combine it with information on the saliency of RRP parties and their issues in major Dutch newspapers. Drawing on multilevel structural equation models, our findings indicate that media attention positively affects changes in RRP party sympathies. Furthermore, we find that the effect of media attention on RRP party sympathies is enhanced by perceived ethnic threat and Euroscepticism, respectively. In sum, this study shows that media attention to RRP parties is pivotal for the fortune of such parties.

AB  - Does public support for immigration depend on race? One set of literature argues that natives focus on reaping economic benefits and prefer to admit high skilled immigrants. Yet, a second group of studies challenges the notion that natives evaluate skills in a race-neutral fashion. Recent qualitative work argues that natives socially construct the value of foreign workers' skills. Furthermore, recent experimental studies find that Americans and Europeans prefer immigrants from developed White-majority countries. Do these findings reflect a general preference for White immigrants which also shapes immigration attitudes in non-western countries? Our study explores this question using a survey experiment fielded in Japan at a time when that country was grappling with economic pressures to admit more immigrants. Consistent with the social construction of skills literature, we find that Japanese unevenly apply skill requirements to prospective immigrants based on nationality but that they do not necessarily prefer White immigrants.

TI  - Vigilantism, public shaming, and social media hegemony: The role of digital-networked images in humiliation and sociopolitical control
T2  - COMMUNICATION REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - Digital-networked images of torture, abuse, and humiliation are increasingly used by nonstate agents to form online communities based upon prejudice and bigotry and/or to propagate violent vigilante justice. This article discusses the circulation, impact, and permanence of digital-networked images that perpetuate nonstate hegemony and function as mechanisms for exercising power, disciplinary force, and social control reminiscent of Foucauldian theories of power-knowledge and governmentality.

AB  - Mining is a very important activity for economic and social development, but traditionally research has centered on its technical and operative aspects, instead of studying the image transmitted to the rest of society. This has originated diverse problems, fundamentally due to the information which the population receives via the mass media and which sometimes creates a current of opinion contrary to the development of this extraction activity. In order to resolve the mining communication problems it is necessary to develop a measure of the mining image based on a reliable and valid scale. This is a useful tool in developing a procedure to connect the society with other mining stakeholders and to analyze whether the real image of mining activity is similar to the image transmitted and perceived by society, since the news about the mining industry usually are focused on extreme situations or catastrophes that monopolize the information in the media. In this study a field research based on an attributes scale is developed, with the aim of measuring the mining image. The surveys were carried out in a mining area, where people have direct and real information about the mining industry and its consequences on society, environment and economy. (c) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - This paper reports the results of a factorial survey on the effects of harm caused to the victim by a criminal offense and of sympathy for the victim on punitive attitudes. Participants (N=1345) of nationwide representative survey read a brief description of an assault case in which the amount of harm (low vs. high) caused to the victim by the offense and the characteristics of the victim (unpleasant vs. pleasant) which affect the level of sympathy for the victim were varied (2x2 design). The respondents then rated the appropriateness of a sentence imposed on the offender. As hypothesized, persons who read the conditions where the victim suffered a high harm were on average more punitive than persons who read the low harm version. Also the sympathy for the victim mattered: when the victim was a pleasant person the respondents demanded a higher penalty compared to an unpleasant victim. The biggest effect was found when the victim was pleasant and suffered a high amount of harm. These findings show the importance of characteristics of the victim and the amount of harm caused to the victim for public punitive attitudes. The results are linked to the patterns of media coverage on crime.

AB  - Claims that Thomas Jefferson fathered the children of Sally Hemings, a slave at Monticello, have received support over the past 35 years from revisionist biographies, DNA testing and other evidence. The claims have also been communicated to the general public through novels, films and other popular media. Both those persuaded by the claims and those critical of them assume that collective memory of Jefferson has been changed importantly, and that a considerable portion of the American public accepts the changes, which also include a new focus on Jefferson's views and actions regarding slavery more generally. But collective memory at the individual level requires some degree of collective knowledge, and after reviewing the nature of memory of Sally Hemings at the cultural level, we explore the extent to which knowledge and belief about a Jefferson-Hemings liaison and Jefferson's paternity has spread through the American population. We also consider differences in knowledge by race, education, gender and birth cohort. As part of our investigation, we compare the extent of knowledge of Sally Hemings - and the degree to which it carries hints of uncertainty - with what is true for other names and events from the past, including the name of another woman associated with an even more famous American president.

AB  - Entrepreneurial journalism relates broadly to digital-native news organizations that are innovating in the field. A chief innovation in Latin America is a newfound opportunity for editorial independence, according to focus groups with entrepreneurial journalists from 16 organizations across the region. Entrepreneurial journalism organizations believe their financial structure gives them editorial autonomy. This study looked at the background for and the reasons why independence is considered a necessary innovation in Latin American journalism. It found that pressures against editorial independence varied from government funding (Argentina and Brazil) to corporate impositions (Peru) and government pressures (Mexico). Our focus group participants found a need for a space to cover topics and issues that were not being addressed or were being misrepresented by mainstream media from the Amazon region of Brazil to investigative reporting in Venezuela and under-covered communities in Chile. This innovation has al-lowed journalists to embrace an interventionist role (Hanitzsch,Hanusch, & Lauerer, 2016), based on social engagement and the ability to set the agenda, as our expert group stated, and to be a protagonist of public discourse. While the impact of such news organizations is fairly new, some organizations have developed a sizable and strong community of users, and have influenced public opinion.

AB  - Successful responses to societal challenges require sustained behavioral change. However, as responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in the US showed, political partisanship and mistrust of science can reduce public willingness to adopt recommended behaviors such as wearing a mask or receiving a vaccination. To better understand this phenomenon, we explored attitudes toward science using social media posts (tweets) that were linked to counties in the US through their locations. The data allowed us to study how attitudes towards science relate to the socioeconomic characteristics of communities in places from which people tweet. Our analysis revealed three types of communities with distinct behaviors: those in large metro centers, smaller urban places, and rural areas. While partisanship and race are strongly associated with the share of anti-science users across all communities, income was negatively and positively associated with anti-science attitudes in suburban and rural areas, respectively. We observed that emotions in tweets, specifically negative high arousal emotions, are expressed among suburban and rural communities by many anti-science users, but not in communities in large urban places. These trends were not apparent when pooled across all counties. In addition, we found that anti-science attitudes expressed five years earlier were significantly associated with lower COVID-19 vaccination rates. Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of using spatially resolved social media data to monitor public attitudes on issues of social importance.

AB  - Since the fall of communism in 1989, many formerly communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe have undergone a tremendous amount of social, political, and economic change. In the nearly 30 years after communism, these countries have become democratic and integrated into the European Union. Despite these changes, the consolidation of democracy is in question as citizen trust in government remains low and nationalist populism has risen. Given that other studies have shown that online media can affect attitudes toward government and that a massive technological revolution has occurred alongside democratization, it is imperative to better understand whether the Internet can aid consolidation by making citizens more supportive of democratic governance. This study uses Eurobarometer data to evaluate this question empirically and finds that online news consumption leads to more positive evaluations of government in the region.

AB  - Although police, lawyers, judges, and even some community members believe that CSI-type shows have seriously affected the criminal justice system (termed the CSI effect), empirical research has not demonstrated a link between crime television viewing and verdicts. However, the literature has established that higher frequencies of crime television viewing are associated with increased expectations of evidence, different attitudes toward evidence types, and varying self-reported levels of understanding of scientific evidence. The present study sought to extend our understanding of the influence of crime television on attitudes, expectations, and verdicts by examining the influence of perceived realism (i.e., the degree to which television programs are viewed as accurate and realistic depictions of the field that they portray) in this context, since some research has identified perceived realism as a moderator of the effects of television on attitudes. Participants were asked to play the role of mock jurors and read a trial transcript in which the Crown presented DNA evidence. Participants also indicated the frequency with which they watched crime television programs (frequency), as well as the degree to which they felt these programs were accurate and realistic depictions of the criminal justice system (perceived realism). Results revealed a number of interesting direct and indirect effects of both frequency of viewing and perceived realism on mock juror information processing, attitudes, and decision making, suggesting that in order to truly understand the effect that crime television may have on potential jurors, their frequency of watching must be considered in combination with the degree to which they perceive these programs as realistic depictions of the justice system.

AB  - Indicators of collective user behavior and opinion are increasingly common features of online news stories and may include information about how the story made users feel. An experiment (N = 298) examined the effects of the presence and valence of a "mood meter" posted alongside an online human-interest story on memory for, attitude toward, emotional response to, and intentions to share the story. The presence of a mood meter led to lower recall of story content, more negative attitudes toward the story, and less positive emotional responses. The results suggest that participating in a mood meter may attenuate positive responses to human-interest stories.

AB  - This study explores the individual- and country-level factors that influence how getting news from social media relates to people's beliefs about anthropogenic climate change. Concepts of psychological distance and motivated reasoning are tested using multilevel analysis with survey data in 20 countries (N=18,785). Results suggest that using social media for news is associated with a decrease in climate skepticism across the sample. However, social context at the individual-level (conservative political ideology and low trust in science) and at the macro-level (high gross domestic product and individualism) moderate the effect, and therefore reduce social media's potential to inform the public about climate change. This study contributes to conversations about the ability of emerging media to address science issues, particularly in developing countries.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Increasingly, support for water fluoridation has come under attack. We seek an explanation, focusing on the case of Waterloo, Ontario, where a 2010 referendum overturned its water fluoridation program. In particular, we test whether individuals perceive the risks of water fluoridation based not on 'hard' scientific evidence but on heuristics and cultural norms.
   METHODS: A sample of 376 residents in Waterloo were surveyed in June 2012 using random digit dialing. We use factor analysis, OLS regression, as well as t-tests to evaluate a survey experiment to test the credibility hypothesis.
   RESULTS: Perceptions of fluoride as a risk are lower among those who perceive fluoride's benefits (B = .473, p < 0.001) and those whose cultural view is 'egalitarian' (B = .156, p < 0.05). The experiment shows a lower level of perception of fluoride's benefits among respondents who are told that water fluoridation is opposed by a national advocacy group (Group A) compared to those who are told that the government and the World Health Organization support fluoridation (Group B) (t = 1.6547, p < 0.05), as well as compared to the control group (t = 1.8913, p < 0.05). There is no difference between Group B and the control, possibly because people's already general support for fluoridation is less prone to change when told that other public organizations also support fluoridation.
   CONCLUSION: Public health officials should take into account cultural norms and perceptions when individuals in a community appear to rise up against water fluoridation, with implications for other public health controversies.

AB  - On the screens of televisions and computers in their California homes, the women of the Egyptian Sisters Club (ESC) have witnessed the unfolding of political crisis and the unravelling of certainty about the meaning of home'. Drawing from concepts of diaspora and social support, the study explores how the ESC, an informal group of young Egyptian mothers living in Southern California, maintains cohesion in a time of conflict in their home country, and hostility towards visibly Muslim women in their host country. This qualitative study draws from participant observation, interviews and focus groups over a period of 9 months in 2014. Findings, largely expressed in members' own words, suggest that despite heterogeneous perspectives and subjective motives, participants largely negotiate a prioritization of cultural values over political differences. This case offers insights into how local context and life stages influence how diaspora members adapt to contentious home and host country politics.

AB  - Background: In the current phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are witnessing the most massive vaccine rollout in human history. Like any other drug, vaccines may cause unexpected side effects, which need to be investigated in a timely manner to minimize harm in the population. If not properly dealt with, side effects may also impact public trust in the vaccination campaigns carried out by national governments.
   Objective: Monitoring social media for the early identification of side effects, and understanding the public opinion on the vaccines are of paramount importance to ensure a successful and harmless rollout. The objective of this study was to create a web portal to monitor the opinion of social media users on COVID-19 vaccines, which can offer a tool for journalists, scientists, and users alike to visualize how the general public is reacting to the vaccination campaign.
   Methods: We developed a tool to analyze the public opinion on COVID-19 vaccines from Twitter, exploiting, among other techniques, a state-of-the-art system for the identification of adverse drug events on social media; natural language processing models for sentiment analysis; statistical tools; and open-source databases to visualize the trending hashtags, news articles, and their factuality. All modules of the system are displayed through an open web portal.
   Results: A set of 650,000 tweets was collected and analyzed in an ongoing process that was initiated in December 2020. The results of the analysis are made public on a web portal (updated daily), together with the processing tools and data. The data provide insights on public opinion about the vaccines and its change over time. For example, users show a high tendency to only share news from reliable sources when discussing COVID-19 vaccines (98% of the shared URLs). The general sentiment of Twitter users toward the vaccines is negative/neutral; however, the system is able to record fluctuations in the attitude toward specific vaccines in correspondence with specific events (eg, news about new outbreaks). The data also show how news coverage had a high impact on the set of discussed topics. To further investigate this point, we performed a more in-depth analysis of the data regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine. We observed how media coverage of blood clot-related side effects suddenly shifted the topic of public discussions regarding both the AstraZeneca and other vaccines. This became particularly evident when visualizing the most frequently discussed symptoms for the vaccines and comparing them month by month.
   Conclusions: We present a tool connected with a web portal to monitor and display some key aspects of the public's reaction to COVID-19 vaccines. The system also provides an overview of the opinions of the Twittersphere through graphic representations, offering a tool for the extraction of suspected adverse events from tweets with a deep learning model.

AB  - This article exploits the synergy of critical discourse studies and Corpus Linguistics to study the pervasive representation of Islam and Muslims in an approximate 670,000-word corpus of US news media stories published between 2001 and 2015. Following collocation and concordance analysis of the most frequent topics or categories which revolve around the representation of Islam and Muslims in US news stories, the Discourse-Historical Approach to critical discourse analysis was adopted to investigate how the discursive strategies of nomination (construction of in-groups and out-groups) and predication (labeling social actors more or less positively or negatively) are used in US news media stories. The findings indicated that, in general, Islam and Muslims are associated with violence, religious radicalism, and Islamic extremist militants. Finally, the article discusses the discursive themes resulting from the analysis of personal pronouns as well as the educational implications of the findings for social studies and multicultural education.

AB  - Gender-based political stereotypes pervade the media environment in the United States, and this may cause voters to automatically activate these stereotypes while evaluating politicians. In the research reported here, we investigate whether voters are able to reduce the automatic activation of unwanted stereotypes and how political sophistication influences this capacity. The current experiment uses self-reports to measure controlled stereotyping, and we develop a new eye movement metric to measure automatic stereotyping. We find that political sophisticates are more effective than novices at reducing unwanted gender-based political stereotypes. This study has two main implications for communication research. First, the results suggest that the effects of gender-based automatic stereotypinginduced by the information environmenton political judgments may not be as powerful as some of the current literature portrays them to be. Second, this study adds eye movements to the arsenal of tools available to communication scholars interested in measuring covert forms of stereotyping.

AB  - Public discussions about the harmfulness of violent media are often held in the aftermath of violent felony. At the same time, we know little about whether and how experiencing real-life violence impacts the way laypersons perceive and evaluate debates about virtual violence. In Study 1, we provided data indicating that both real-life violence and violent video games are perceived as morally threatening by people who regard nonviolence to be an important moral value (i.e., pacifists). In Study 2, we hypothesized and found that when pacifists perceive threat from the presence of real-life violence, they are especially susceptible to scientific and political claims indicating that violent video games are harmful. Our findings are in line with the value protection model and research on the psychological consequences of threat. Implications of the present findings are discussed with regard to a better understanding of the violent video games debate in the general public.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic with large global attention. However, spreading false news on social media sites like Twitter is creating unnecessary anxiety towards this disease. The motto behind this study is to analyses tweets by Indian netizens during the COVID-19 lockdown. The data included tweets collected on the dates between 23 March 2020 and 15 July 2020 and the text has been labelled as fear, sad, anger, and joy. Data analysis was conducted by Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, which is a new deep-learning model for text analysis and performance and was compared with three other models such as logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), and long-short term memory (LSTM). Accuracy for every sentiment was separately calculated. The BERT model produced 89% accuracy and the other three models produced 75%, 74.75%, and 65%, respectively. Each sentiment classification has accuracy ranging from 75.88-87.33% with a median accuracy of 79.34%, which is a relatively considerable value in text mining algorithms. Our findings present the high prevalence of keywords and associated terms among Indian tweets during COVID-19. Further, this work clarifies public opinion on pandemics and lead public health authorities for a better society.

AB  - In the aftermath of a terrorist attack on an Islamic community in New Zealand, how has the stigma and perceptions of the West about Islam impacted the reaction of audiences? Drawing on Tweets (Twitter) and the statements of Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, this paper explores how individuals construct their messages to establish a discourse that aspires to blend Islam into the "norm" of Western ideas and values. Applying the Goffman framework, we observe how the two compose their messages to resist the West's stigma and perceptions of Islam and plea to being "normal." Specifically, attention is placed on how normality is constructed through the presentation of Muslim's place of worship, mosques, and their communities. A qualitative textual analysis revealed different interpretations of how these places of worship and their communities identify "normalness" in an attempt to de-stigmatize the negative construction of Islam in the West. Therefore, we consider how these interpretations produce normality amongst a perceived stigma of Islam in the West in the aftermath of a terrorist attack.

AB  - Human-interest narratives are journalistic tools to captivate and engage the audience, influence public opinion and bring revenue to media organizations. This paper analyses how human-interest narratives are used in contemporary health journalism across media systems and health systems. Based on a comparative content analysis of Norwegian, Spanish, U.K. and U.S. newspapers (2016-2017), it studies how human-interest stories are contextualized, health problems explained and responsibility attributed. The article reveals a complex picture of the role of human-interest stories in health coverage. In line with expectations, the study finds that human-interest stories do tend to emphasize individual biomedical treatment of illness and to privilege idealized victims who fit the routines of dominant media dramaturgy. In contrast to theories that consider personalization of news as an individualization of responsibility and dumbing down of public debate, however, the study finds that human-interest narratives are also used to explain health as a structural phenomenon and a collective responsibility, appealing to political intervention and accountability of health authorities. Such claims are more prominent in European human-interest health stories and less frequent in the more strongly commercialized U.S. health and media system.

AB  - As Britain prepares for a possible referendum on continued membership of the European Union, it is essential that more careful thought is paid to the dynamics of referendums. Polling data reveal the existence of a substantial knowledge deficit in the UK and other parts of the EU: large numbers of voters simply do not understand the EU. There is also reason to question the conventional view that voters can correct for such a deficit by using cues from opinion leaders and the media. The experience of recent referendums in other EU member states suggests that many voters will take part in the proposed British referendum without independent and informed knowledge of the issues at stake, that many will have been swayed by partisan elite opinion, and that many will decide on the basis of their views about domestic politics rather than their views about Europe.

AB  - The presumed underlying mechanism of exemplification effects is that people generalize single-case media depictions and overestimate their position of social relevance, while at the same time neglecting more valid base-rate information. A 2 x 2 between-subjects experiment with n = 112 participants explored whether these exemplification effects can be explained by presumptions of strong media influences on others. Participants were shown a "rate my professor"-type website stimulus in which a single user had commented on a university course. Results show that fundamental assumptions of exemplification research interact with presumed media influences: exemplification effects can be amplified by third-person perceptions, particularly when people assess public opinion.

AB  - The potential of games in empowering underrepresented groups is a central theme in the field of media studies. However, to ensure that everyone can benefit from them, it is necessary to ensure that they are inclusive and accessible. In the present work, we have implemented a Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach to target this problem, right at the stage of training new game designers and game developers. Thus, through a game-design-based or experimental game design pedagogical approach, we intended to promote inclusive and accessibility-driven game design and development skills in students, while decreasing their negative attitudes towards people with Intellectual Disability (pwID). A protocol with a Non-Governmental Organization in the field was established and, during two semesters, students were challenged to develop 10 accessible games and physical interfaces for pwID and motor disabilities, through participatory processes. Pre and post assessment was conducted, through a mixed-method approach. After participating in this process, students reported satisfaction and increased knowledge of cognitive and motor accessibility, and inclusive game design in general. Moreover, the attitudinal assessment showed significantly lower levels of prejudiced beliefs towards pwID (p < 0.05).

AB  - Grounded in social representation theory and its empirical investigation into the 'social arena', inspired by the 'modelling paradigmatic approach', the research presented in this article is part of a larger project aimed at reconstructing the 'multivoice', and 'multi-agent' discourse about (im)migration. Specifically, this contribution's focus is on the exploration of shaping and sharing social representations about (im)migrants through communication via the social medium 'Twitter'. A total of 1,958 tweets (967 Italian and 991 English tweets) were analysed through Systeme Portable Pour L'Analyse Des Donnees Textuelles [Portable System for Textual Data Analysis]SPAD in two lexical correspondence analyses. The results show a dichotomous discourse organising a semantic space structured around five different factors for the two distinct Twitter corpora: both clearly show polarised social representations of 'immigrants-migrants', leading to exclusion-inclusion policies depending on the discursive agent's ideological affiliation in the Italian and the international political frame. Used as a propaganda tool, Twitter echoes the related pro- and anti-immigration polemical representations of opposite political leaders in posts that are positioned differently in relation to the progressive/conservative ideology.

AB  - Studies on organizational crisis communication via social media have mainly focused on the effects of messages from one source, organizations. Little is known about the interaction effects of multiple messages from multiple sources through social media on audiences' perceptions of organizational reputation. Guided by the Message Convergence Framework, this study used a 2 x 2, between-subjects experiment (N = 165) to explore the impact of crisis communication strategies and message convergence on Facebook on audiences' perceived organizational reputation in a preventable crisis. The results suggest that organizational reputation was affected by the consistency between the organization's Facebook posts and followers' comments, and the effects were moderated by the perceived credibility of the comments by Facebook followers. The results also revealed that unlike pre-existing positive attitudes toward an organization, which were negatively affected by inconsistent information on Facebook, pre-existing negative attitudes did not change significantly because of the information on Facebook. The theoretical and practical implications of this study are then discussed.

AB  - Research indicates that uncertainty in science news stories affects public assessment of risk and uncertainty. However, the form in which uncertainty is presented may also affect people's risk and uncertainty assessments. For example, a news story that features an expert discussing both what is known and what is unknown about a topic may convey a different form of scientific uncertainty than a story that features two experts who hold conflicting opinions about the status of scientific knowledge of the topic, even when both stories contain the same information about knowledge and its boundaries. This study focuses on audience uncertainty and risk perceptions regarding the emerging science of nanotechnology by manipulating whether uncertainty in a news story about potential risks is attributed to expert sources in the form of caveats (individual uncertainty) or conflicting viewpoints (collective uncertainty). Results suggest that the type of uncertainty portrayed does not impact audience feelings of uncertainty or risk perceptions directly. Rather, the presentation of the story influences risk perceptions only among those who are highly deferent to scientific authority. Implications for risk communication theory and practice are discussed.

AB  - The management literature has typically taken a relatively narrow view when considering the relationships between firms and state actors by conceptualizing regulatory agencies simply as a source of external pressure for firms. The literature has, accordingly, tended to emphasize the strategies that firms adopt in efforts to influence and control public policy. The authors argue that future research needs to go beyond the traditional understanding of the firm-regulator relationship and should instead focus more attention on other sources of influence on regulator behavior. Specifically, further research is needed that focuses on other external sources of influence, such as the media and public opinion, as well as research that helps identify how issues within the regulatory body itself, such as intraorganizational politics and leadership turnover, affect agency behavior. In this essay, the authors examine the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) Office of Defects Investigation's (ODI) actions regarding unwanted acceleration in Toyota vehicles in an effort to illustrate the dramatic influence that external events, public activism, and political power shifts have in influencing regulatory behavior. The results of this analysis support the notion that the role of firms in the regulatory process has been somewhat overstated and that future research examining the state would benefit from focusing on additional internal and external issues that may influence government agency action.

T2  - PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY-AN ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - The USA
KW  - Fake news
KW  - Democratic elections
AB  - Purpose - Since the end of 2016, "fake news" has had a clear meaning in the USA. After years of scholarship attempting to define "fake news" and where it fits among the larger schema of media hoaxing and deception, popular culture and even academic studies converged following the 2016 US presidential election to define "fake news" in drastically new ways. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - In light of the recent elections in the USA, many fear "fake news" that have gradually become a powerful and sinister force, both in the news media environment as well as in the fair and free elections. The scenario draws into questions how the general public interacts with such outlets, and to what extent and in which ways individual responsibility should govern the interactions with social media.
   Findings - Fake news is a growing threat to democratic elections in the USA and other democracies by relentless targeting of hyper-partisan views, which play to the fears and prejudices of people, in order to influence their voting plans and their behavior.
   Originality/value - Essentially, "fake news" is changing and even distorting how political campaigns are run, ultimately calling into question legitimacy of elections, elected officials and governments. Scholarship has increasingly confirmed social media as an enabler of "fake news," and continues to project its potentially negative impact on democracy, furthering the already existing practices of partisan selective exposure, as well as heightening the need for individual responsibility.

AB  - Sparked by a collaboration between academic researchers and science media professionals, this study sought to test three commonly used headline formats that vary based on whether (and, if so, how) important information is left out of a headline to encourage participants to read the corresponding article; these formats are traditionally-formatted headlines, forward-referencing headlines, and question-based headlines. Although headline format did not influence story selection or engagement, it did influence participants evaluations of both the headline's and the story's credibility (question-based headlines were viewed as the least credible). Moreover, individuals' science curiosity and political views predicted their engagement with environmental stories as well as their views about the credibility of the headline and story. Thus, headline formats appear to play a significant role in audience's perceptions of online news stories, and science news professionals ought to consider the effects different formats have on readers.

AB  - The importance of quality of police contacts on confidence in the police is well established in data from big cities. This relationship, however, has not been tested with data from a medium-sized city situated in a rural environment. The present study contributes to existing literature by testing this important relationship with data from a medium-sized city in a rural environment. Results from the ordinary least square regression show that the quality of contacts is indeed the most important predictors of confidence in the police. The relationships hold after controlling for the effects of institutional confidence complex, another important predictor of confidence in the police, and several instrumental and expressive concerns, and socio-demographic factors. Uniquely, reporting a crime and request for services reduce confidence in the police whereas the effects of fear of crime and community disorder are statistically insignificant. These results and their policy implications are discussed within data limitations.

AB  - The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) The Real Cost campaign advertisements (ads) have targeted U.S. youth with messages designed to prevent and reduce tobacco use. This study examined exposure to The Real Cost campaign, including ad and slogan recall, and associations with attitudes and risk perceptions among U.S. adolescents. We analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents aged 13 to 17 years (n = 1125) surveyed by phone from October 2014 to June 2015. We assessed aided recall of and attitudes toward four campaign ads and the one slogan. Logistic regression models assessed whether aided recall of The Real Cost ads or slogan was associated with perceived likelihood of serious health consequences of cigarette smoking. Most (88%) adolescents reported seeing or hearing at least one of four ads for The Real Cost, and 54% recalled The Real Cost slogan. The majority of adolescents reported more negative attitudes toward tobacco products after seeing or hearing the ads. Recall of any The Real Cost ad was significantly associated with greater perceptions of serious health consequences of cigarette smoking (Adjusted Odd Ratios (AOR) = 5.58, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.20-25.90). The FDA's The Real Cost campaign has achieved very high reach and is associated with more negative attitudes toward tobacco products and greater risk perceptions of cigarette smoking among U.S. adolescents.

AB  - Conflicts between wildlife, invasive species, and agricultural producers are increasing. Although direct management actions taken to mitigate these conflicts remain controversial, most stakeholders agree that better policies are needed to balance socioeconomic considerations with invasive species management, wildlife conservation, and agriculture. However, the interaction between societal and biological drivers that influence human-invasive species-wildlife conflict mitigation policy is poorly understood. We identify factors influencing policy leading to the establishment of a new federal program to control invasive wild pigs (IWPs) in the United States. We fit generalized linear models relating frequency of congressional policy activity, such as congressional hearings and reports, to frequency of print newspaper media and percent of the U.S. agricultural industry co-occurring with IWPs for 29 yr preceding the establishment of the federal program in 2013. Our models explained 89% of the deviance in congressional policy activity indicating a strong linkage between congressional IWP policy activity and predictors representing the number of negative of newspaper articles, geographic distribution of print media, and percent of agricultural producers co-occurring with IWPs. These effects translated to 3.7% increase in the number of congressional policy actions for every additional five states with negative news media. Invasive wild pig congressional policy activity increased 6.7% for every additional 10 negative newspaper articles. Increases in co-occurrence of agriculture and IWPs had the largest effect; for every 1% increase in co-occurrence, there was a 41% increase in congressional policy activity. Invasive wild pig congressional policy activity that explicitly addressed livestock increased at nearly twice the rate of policy activity addressing crop agriculture. These results suggest that agriculture and media coverage may act as determinants for invasive species policy. Our approach may provide early insight into emerging policy areas enabling proactive policy development by agencies or early engagement by scientists to find solutions before the policy area becomes gridlocked. Our results can also support policy and program evaluation providing a means of determining if the implemented policies match the original policy determinants ensuring best alignment with public, environmental, and stakeholder interests.

AB  - Ageism refers to stereotyping (how we think), prejudice (how we feel), and discrimination (how we act) against people based on their age. It is a serious public health issue that can negatively impact older people's health and quality of life. The present protocol has several goals: (1) adapt the Ambivalent Ageism Scale for the general Portuguese population and healthcare professionals; (2) assess the factorial invariance of the questionnaire between general population vs. healthcare professionals; (3) evaluate the level of ageism and its predictors in the general population and evaluate the level of ageism and its predictors in healthcare professionals; (4) compare the levels of ageism between groups and the invariance between groups regarding the explanatory model of predictors of ageism. This quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive, observational study will be developed in partnership with several Healthcare Professional Boards/Associations, National Geriatrics and Gerontology Associations, and the Universities of the Third Age Network Association. The web-based survey will be conducted on a convenience sample recruited via various social media and institutional channels. The survey consists of three questionnaires: (1) Demographic data; (2) Ambivalent Ageism Scale; (3) Palmore-Neri and Cachioni questionnaire. The methodology of this study will include translation, pilot testing, semantic adjustment, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and multigroup analysis of the Ambivalent Ageism Scale. Data will be treated using International Business Machines Corporation (IBM (R)) Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software and Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS). Descriptive analysis will be conducted to assess the level of ageism in the study sample. The ageism levels between the two groups will be compared using the t-student test, and two Structural Equation Modeling will be developed to evaluate the predictors of ageism. Assessing ageism is necessary to allow healthcare professionals and policymakers to design and implement strategies to solve or reduce this issue. Findings from this study will generate knowledge relevant to healthcare and medical courses along with anti-ageism education for the Portuguese population.

AB  - Immigration became a hot issue during the 2016 presidential election, in part due to Donald Trump's offensive campaign against immigrants and minorities in general. Drawing upon the belief gap hypothesis, we tested if support for Donald Trump increased false beliefs about immigrants. The belief gap hypothesis explains differences in beliefs about empirically verifiable and politically contested issues, relying on ideology and partisanship-instead of education-to predict people's beliefs. By using nationally representative panel data, this study explored how political ideology and education work together to predict belief gaps about immigrants. Findings suggest that conservative ideology and education interact to predict attitudes, showing that highly educated conservatives hold more negative beliefs about immigrants as compared to highly educated liberals or less educated conservatives. We also found that Trump's supporters exhibit negative attitudes and beliefs about immigration-yet results indicate that Donald Trump is not the cause of such attitudes but the catalyst that reveals them. Implications for theory and future research are discussed.

AB  - Media coverage of climate protests within the United States and internationally has shown growing public frustration about governmental responses to climate change. But what are the effects of conveying that people are angry? And how do they contrast with more traditional norm messages about climate policy support? Here, we investigate whether social norm messaging about collective anger can impact perceptions of consensus and public support for climate mitigation. In a pilot study and two survey experiments (total N = 1529), we find that relative to control messages, normative appeals that convey growing public anger about U.S. inaction on climate change (i.e., dynamic anger consensus messaging) can enhance Americans' consensus estimates of other Americans' climate-related beliefs and support for mitigation policy, and expectations for future climatemitigating collective action. Moreover, exposure to a dynamic anger consensus message led to similar estimates of Americans' policy support and belief in climate change as messages that explicitly conveyed public support for climate mitigation (Study 1) or consensus belief in anthropogenic climate change (Study 2). When tailored for a cross-partisan audience, anger consensus messaging was also effective in bolstering personal support for climate mitigation (Study 2). Notably, similar effects were observed across partisan groups. These findings suggest that, by signaling shared motivational states, emotion consensus appeals can enhance expectations for social change, with the potential to mobilize bipartisan support for climate mitigation.

AB  - There exist many parallels between the experiences of Irish communities in Britain in the past and those of Muslim communities today. However, although they have both been the subject of negative stereotyping, intelligence profiling, wrongful arrest and prejudice, little research has been carried out comparing how these communities are represented in the media. This article addresses this gap by mapping British press coverage of events involving Irish and Muslim communities that occurred between 1974 and 2007. The analysis shows that both sets of communities have been represented as 'suspect' to different degrees, which the article attributes to varying perceptions within the press as to the nature of the threat Irish and Muslim communities are thought to pose to Britain. The article concludes that a central concern of the press lies with defending its own constructions of Britishness against perceived extremists, and against abuses of power and authority by the state security apparatus.

AB  - Media coverage has long been thought crucial to shaping the electoral fortunes of presidential primary candidates in the post-reform era, making how the media allot coverage a topic of paramount importance. Sides and Vavreck (2013. The Gamble: Choice and Change in the 2012 Presidential Election. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press) make a notable contribution to the study of media coverage in primaries with their "discovery, scrutiny, and decline" (DSD) model. This model, based on the 2012 Republican primary, suggests that the media's preference for novelty leads to a cyclical identification of new and interesting candidates, a surge in coverage of that candidate, and a culminating drop of coverage back to baseline levels. But the generalizability of the DSD model beyond the 2012 GOP primary has not yet been thoroughly tested. This paper conducts such a test using the Presidential Primary Communication Corpus (PPCC) which contains news stories by The New York Times and the Washington Post of each candidate in the nine primaries from 2000 to 2020. The evidence is most supportive of the DSD model in the 2008 and 2012 Republican primaries and the 2004 and 2020 Democratic primaries but less supportive in the remaining five. This paper concludes with a discussion of why some campaigns don't match the DSD model's expectations.

AB  - This work studies the use of disinformation to construct an image of otherness through the internet. We applied a content analysis methodology to the 161 racist, xenophobic or Islamophobic fake news pieces that were discredited in 2020 by the four Spanish information verification media entities accredited by the International Fact-Checking Network: Maldita.es, Newtral, Efe Verifica and Verificat. The results show that the most commonly used formats were image and video, that disinformation was most often based on taking information out of context and deception, and that the source could not be identified. The most shared characteristics associated otherness with receiving aid, violence and illegal immigration. The most commonly used images were photographs, which mostly showed people in a general manner (not individually). Despite this, disinformation was not generated by manipulating images, but by inserting text over images. The use of supposed screenshots to create fictitious references or take truthful screenshots out of context was also notable.

AB  - This study explores two primary dimensions of salience, such as attention and prominence, among coverage of four major online newspapers, which are NYTimes.com, USATODAY.com, washingtonpost.com, and LATimes.com. The four major online newspapers agree with not only issue agendas (attention of salience) but also story placement (prominence of salience). Specifically, NYTimes.com and washingtonpost. com post more important stories on the most visible areas of their major sections and publish less important stories on the bottom areas of the sections. This indicates the potentials of major online newspapers to influence other news media. Because news Web sites are major information sources, the convergence of attention and prominence is likely to affect public opinion.

AB  - If nothing else, democratic politics requires compromise. Mass polarization, where citizens disagree strongly and those disagreements magnify over time, presents obvious threats to democratic wellbeing. The overwhelming presumption is that if polarization is occurring, a substantial portion of it is attributable to the fragmentation attendant an increasingly choice-laden media environment where individuals expose themselves only to opinion-reinforcing information. Under what conditions does mass opinion polarization occur? Through two over-time laboratory experiments involving information choice behavior, this paper considers, first, the effects of slant in one's information environment on over-time opinion dynamics and, second, the moderating role of attitude importance on those effects. The experiments reveal that, despite similar information search behavior, those with strong attitudes are dogmatic, resisting even substantial contrary evidence; those with weak attitudes, by contrast, hear opposing arguments and develop moderate opinions regardless of the prevalence of those arguments in their environment. Evaluations of information, rather than information search behavior per se, explain why individuals with strong attitudes polarize and those with weak attitudes do not. Polarization therefore seems to require more than media fragmentation and, in fact, a more important factor may be the strength of citizens' prior attitudes on particular issues.

AB  - Many researchers argue that the news media play a significant role in the education policy arena, influencing the way in which issues are prioritized and understood. This article draws on a content analysis of the South African English news media articles over 21 months (October 2018-June 2020) to discern themes that were prioritized and given prominence and to explore the way in which these themes might present additional insights for framing the curriculum for initial teacher education programmes. We engaged with articles about basic education that were on the Government Communications and Information System site during this period and analysed those that we considered significant for the context or situational components in teacher education. We selected a final subset of 360 news articles that related to contextual aspects in schooling and we analysed the content of these articles. The analysis is regarded as being participatory in the sense that we engaged with the voices of civil society articulated via the mass media. Our engagement with the media was considered action oriented for purposes of informing curriculum design, with the media being a significant realm of social life through which public opinion can both be formed and, through the participation of citizens, used as a vehicle to have an impact on the political expressions by citizens who have information they would like to share. In this sense, the public and advocacy organisations can use the media as a watchdog to protect public interests against malpractice and to create public awareness about issues of societal importance.

AB  - Existing research suggests that, in contemporary liberal democracies, complaints of racism are routinely rejected and prejudice may be both expressed and disavowed in the same breath. Surveys and historical research have established that - both in democratic states and in those of the Soviet Bloc (while it existed) - antisemitism has long been related to or expressed in the form of statements about Israel or 'Zionist', permitting anti-Jewish attitudes to circulate under cover of political critique. This article looks at how the findings of a survey of anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli attitudes were rejected by users of three Facebook pages associated with the British Left. Through thematic discourse analysis, three recurrent repertoires are identified: firstly, what David Hirsh calls the 'Livingstone Formulation' (i.e. the argument that complaints of antisemitism are made in bad faith to protect Israel and/or attack the Left), secondly, accusations of flawed methodology similar to those with which UK Labour Party supporters routinely dismiss the findings of unfavourable opinion polls, and thirdly, the argument that, because certain classically antisemitic beliefs pertain to a supposed Jewish or 'Zionist' elite and not to Jews in general, they are not antisemitic. In one case, the latter repertoire facilitates virtually unopposed apologism for Adolf Hitler. Contextual evidence suggests that the dominance of such repertoires within one very large UK Labour Party-aligned group may be the result of action on the part of certain 'admins' or moderators. It is argued that awareness of the repertoires used to express and defend antisemitic attitudes should inform the design of quantitative research into the latter, and be taken account of in the formulation of policy measures aiming to restrict or counter hate speech (in social media and elsewhere).

AB  - In the last 10 years, we have seen an increased frequency of fear and criticism of Islam and Muslims in the Czech media scene. Even though the percentage of Muslims in the Czech Republic is tiny (approx. estimate is 0.2%), there are active groups and movements in the country that seek to stop the spread of Islam in the Czech Republic, and the discussion of threats from Muslims routinely permeates political statements. A very common argumentation of Czech anti-Islamic claims uses the presentation of jihad as evidence of the danger that threatens the Western world from Muslims. The most widespread understanding of this phenomenon still presents jihad as armed violence against non-Muslims, which is supposed to be clear evidence of the warlike and violent nature of Islam. However, in the Czech-language milieu in recent years, there have also been descriptions of other forms of so-called "creeping" or "stealth" jihad. The article focused on the analysis of the concepts of "population jihad" or "demographic jihad", violent "sexual jihad", "womb jihad" or "wombfare", and the so-called "great replacement" as presented on websites, radio, and social networks by the authors of the Czech-language anti-Islamic milieu. The present text thus illustrated the use of interpretations of sexual and demographic jihad to rationalize the fear and hatred of Muslims and Islam in the Czech Republic.

AB  - Sharks are often depicted in the media as violent killers that actively seek out opportunities to harm humans. This framing may impact human tolerance and support of shark conservation, underscoring the need to identify strategies that counteract these negative representations. Social media, given its widespread use, could be an effective platform for shaping public tolerance for sharks and other wildlife species. In this experimental study, we conducted an online pre-post survey in Spring 2020 to determine how viewing shark-related YouTube videos impacted tolerance for sharks among residents (n = 335) in the coastal state of North Carolina (NC), USA and neighboring states. The study employed framing theory, which suggests that the ways in which information is presented influence how it is processed and the actions that result from it. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two video treatments where sharks were framed positively or negatively. Each video treatment impacted tolerance for sharks in the direction of their framing: positive framing influenced positive changes in tolerance (70% more positive attitudes toward sharks, a 130% increase in acceptance of sharks and a 46% increase in intended shark conservation behaviors), and negative framing influenced negative changes (25% more negative attitudes toward sharks, a 18% decrease in acceptance of sharks and a 3% decrease in intended shark conservation behaviors). These findings suggest positive messages about sharks on social media promote tolerance of sharks and can be more impactful than negative messages. At least one form of social media, YouTube, appears to be a valuable tool for encouraging tolerance for sharks.

AB  - Background: Several options are advocated by policy experts to mitigate alcohol-related harms, although the most effective strategies often have the least public support. While knowledge of tobacco-related health risks predicts support for relevant public health measures, it is not known whether knowledge of alcohol health risks is similarly associated with the acceptability of policies intended to reduce alcohol consumption and related harms. This study aims to gauge public support for a range of alcohol policies and to determine whether or not support is associated with knowledge of a long-term health risk of alcohol consumption, specifically cancer.
   Methods: 2482 adults in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, participated in an online survey. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between demographic data, alcohol consumption, smoking status, knowledge of alcohol as a risk factor for cancer and support for alcohol-related policies.
   Results: Most participants were supportive of health warnings, restricting access to internet alcohol advertising to young people, and requiring information on national drinking guidelines on alcohol containers. Almost half of participants supported a ban on sport sponsorship, while less than 41% supported price increases, volumetric taxation, or reducing the number of retail outlets. Only 47% of participants identified drinking too much alcohol as a risk factor for cancer. Knowledge of alcohol as a risk factor for cancer was a significant predictor of support for all policies, while level of alcohol consumption had a significant inverse relationship with policy support.
   Conclusion: The finding that support for alcohol management policies is associated with awareness that drinking too much alcohol may contribute to cancer could assist in the planning of future public health interventions. Improving awareness of the long term health risks of alcohol consumption may be one avenue to increasing public support for effective alcohol harm-reduction policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In their analysis of interviews with demonstrators and speeches by leaders of the movement, they discuss first how the movement imagined its enemies, and then describe its vision of positive core values. They conclude that the movement's key ideological features are: an emphasis on social and civilizational decline (declinism); a return to an assumed naturalness in economic and gender relationships (naturalization); and the open evocation of violence and severity (brutalization). In terms of Rogers Brubacker's distinction between xenophobic ethno-nationalism in Eastern Europe, and the xenophobic defence of liberal values in the West, Slacalek and Svobodova find that the Czech case fits the allegedly western pattern better than the eastern one, which may cast doubt on the whole essentialization of distinctions between 'western' and 'eastern' populisms.

AB  - Overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States will require most Americans to vaccinate against the disease. However, considerable research suggests that a significant proportion of Americans intend to forego vaccination, putting pandemic recovery at risk. Republicans are one of the largest groups of COVID-19 vaccine hesitant individuals. Therefore, identifying strategies to reduce vaccine hesitancy within this group is vital to ending the pandemic. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of messages from co-partisan sources in reducing vaccine hesitancy. In a large (N = 3000) and demographically representative survey, we find that exposing "Middle-of-the-Road" partisans to pro-vaccine messages from co-partisan source cues reduces vaccine hesitancy. However, for those who identify as "Strong" or "Weak" partisans, we find no statistically significant differences in vaccination intentions when exposed to pro-vaccine messages from co-partisan sources. We conclude by discussing how our findings are helpful for vaccine communication efforts.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the public opinion on the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) on Twitter. Using Twitter Application Program Interface (API), we collected the tweets containing the hashtags #CommonCore and #CCSS for 12 months from 2014 to 2015. A Common Core corpus was created by compiling all the collected 660,051 tweets. The results of sentiment analysis suggest Twitter users expressed overwhelmingly negative sentiment toward the CCSS in all 50 states. Five topic clusters were detected by cluster analysis of the hashtag co-occurrence network. We also found that most of the opinion leaders were those who expressed negative sentiment toward the CCSS on Twitter. This study for the first time demonstrates how text mining techniques can be applied to education policy research, laying the foundation for real-time analytics of public opinion on education policies, thereby informing policymaking and implementation.

TI  - The 'spiral of silence' in election campaigns in a post-Communist society The case of Belarus
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MARKET RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - This article analyses the 'spiral of silence' as a mechanism of political communication in post-Communist Belarus in the cases of the presidential elections in 2001 and the general election in 2008, using methods of public opinion polls and content analysis of Belarusian state-run press. The authors argue that the phenomenon of the 'spiral of silence' - a classic problem in political communication - has some important peculiarities in the case of authoritarian post-Communist societies. On the one hand, authorities use mass media as an instrument of political control, mainly control of public opinion, especially during important political campaigns (elections and referenda). On the other hand, post-Communist society has an 'additional precondition' for the effectiveness of this mechanism: contrary to democratic societies (in both developed and developing countries), people in this society have much less cultural and psychological heritage of resistance to pressure from the majority due to the dominance of the principles of collectivism and unity.

AB  - In many public policy areas, such as climate change, news media reports about scientific research play an important role. In presenting their research, scientists are providing guidance to the public regarding public policy choices. How do people decide which scientists and scientific claims to believe? This is a question we address by drawing on the psychology of persuasion. We propose the hypothesis that people are more likely to believe local scientists than national or international scientists. We test this hypothesis with an experiment embedded in a national Internet survey. Our experiment yielded null findings, showing that people do not discount or ignore research findings on climate change if they come from Europe instead of Washington-based scientists or a leading university in a respondent's home state. This reinforces evidence that climate change beliefs are relatively stable, based on party affiliation, and not malleable based on the source of the scientific report.

AB  - Since 2005, reforms in the National Health Service in England, overseen by the British government's Department of Health (DH), have further stimulated a market by increasing the number of providers and encouraging patient choice. This study compares the DH's reporting until 2010, on its website, of what patients want and the research evidence for its statements. It will consider whether the evidence is more ambiguous than the website summary implied; obscuring the voices of those with opinions running counter to patient choice, as the DH defined it. Finally, it reflects on whether there has been a subsequent change of approach.

AB  - Theoretical research on political communication between MPs and the public has focused on the role, activities, and perceptions of the MPs themselves without noting the existence of an intermediate layer: parliamentary assistants (PAs). This study attempts to investigate how the public perceives, practically and ethically, the (non)involvement of MPs, that is, reliance on PAs for SNSs (social network sites) communication with the public and to fill out the theoretical void in the discourse process. Questionnaires were sent to all 120 members of the 20th Israeli Knesset (MKs), with 44 responding. We examined the extent of their involvement and the MKs' use patterns of Facebook, creating a model of four MK involvement levels. The idea was to check the extent of PAs' authoring posts on behalf of MKs, what we call "Postwriting" (= post ghostwriting) in the MK's name (or giving the impression that the MKs had themselves posted). Then we conducted a public opinion poll (N = 505) in order to discern what the public thought about the nature of its relationship with MKs on Facebook, compared to the findings that emerged from the model of the MKs' involvement in actual practice. The two parts of the study also enabled us to investigate the ethical perceptions and implications arising from the study.

AB  - We examined (a) the effect of threat messages (media messages suggesting that an outgroup is threatening to an ingroup) versus nonthreat messages (messages refuting the outgroup's threat) on intergroup bias, (b) the mechanisms underlying that effect, and (c) whether nonthreat messages would result in smaller effects of negative stereotypes on intergroup bias, compared with threat messages. We found that exposure to a threat message about immigrants (compared with a nonthreat message) resulted in more support for punitive immigration policies. This occurred via two sequential mediators: feelings of anger and contempt toward the outgroup, and outgroup derogation. The effect of negative stereotypes on intergroup bias was smaller in the nonthreat message condition than the threat message condition. We discuss implications for the effects of minority news portrayals.

AB  - With finite resources to advance their missions, regional health foundations should critically evaluate the investments they make. This article reviews the costs and associated benefits of large-scale public opinion polling-specifically, the annual Kentucky Health Issues Poll, which is sponsored by the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky and Interact for Health, formerly the Health Foundation of Greater Cincinnati. In addition to the information generated by the poll, the sponsoring foundations have benefited from increased name recognition and credibility with key stakeholders, including state policy makers and the media. Furthermore, jointly funding the poll has strengthened the relationship between the sponsoring foundations and has fostered other key collaborations. We find that the benefits from this poll more than justify its modest costs ($120,000 per year) and hope that this assessment may prove informative for other funders considering similar investments.

AB  - Faith communities support a variety of public health initiatives as conduits of information and service distribution points. However, with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), there is concern that religious communities may be echo chambers for misinformation and conspiracy theories that are undercutting the adoption of precautions to prevent transmission and the use of COVID-19 vaccines. The purpose of this study is to identify the receptivity to and spread of misinformation about COVID-19 by faith communities and whether embracing these inaccuracies constitutes a uniquely religious effect. This study conducted three small analyses approach. First, we engaged in the automated text mining of approximately 2.3 million discussion posts from discussion forums noted for their conspiracism and extremism. Next, secondary quantitative analysis of two recent surveys from the American Trends Panels by Pew Research conducted in April 2020 (N = 9482) and February 2021 (N = 9429) were conducted to determine whether sources of information and preventive behaviors related to the pandemic were associated with uniquely religious effects or possibly mediated by other factors such as sociodemographic characteristics or political views. The association of White evangelicals with politicized misinformation was consistent across all three small studies. Prior to the availability of vaccines, religious themes consistently appeared in 15-19% of COVID-19 social media posts and were higher in subsets of the discourse tied to misinformation. The framing of COVID-19 using religious language was associated with the Christian right in about half of the religiously-themed posts. Religious themes fell below the 15% threshold once the vaccine was available. In the survey research, small, uniquely religious effects were found with White evangelical receptivity of COVID-19 information from Donald Trump and less reliance on information from public health experts, and small, uniquely religious associations were found with preventive measures. Among White nonevangelical Protestants and non-Hispanic Roman Catholics, there was found the same combination of a higher likelihood of reliance on messages from the Donald Trump Presidency and a lower likelihood for news-media use. Black Protestants showed a higher level of use and trust in state and local government officials. The study confirmed higher use of social media among non-Hispanic Roman Catholics but did not find this relationship among Hispanic Protestants. Faith communities are not always receptive to public health messages that promote the public good. This study indicates that the religion effects can appear early, giving time for health education specialists to address them, and that these effects can diminish once preventive measures are available.

KW  - public polling
AB  - The geopolitical reorientation of New Zealand from Britain to Asia has occurred over recent decades, and is manifested in the changing mix of New Zealand's trading partners and in an altered demographic profile for the country. By 2014, seven of New Zealand's top 10 trading partners were in Asia. New Zealand had multiple Asian-language newspapers, television and radio stations, and websites. In 2013, 23% of Aucklanders were Asian, and by 2021, it is anticipated that almost 30% of Aucklanders will be Asian, a mix of those born in New Zealand and born elsewhere. The issue that is explored here is how opinions have changed in response to - or alongside - these changing geopolitical connections and a much more significant Asian presence in terms of a domestic demography. Given the relative rapidity of the change to the latter and the significance of the shift of alignment, especially in relation to trade (from Europe to Asia), do public opinion data reflect an enduring or new level of anxiety, or is there evidence of an accommodation and an acceptance? As the material presented in this article indicates, New Zealanders are largely positive about the economic benefits of this realignment, but there are signs of ambivalence to the changed demography of New Zealand, including signs of particular concern among Maori.

AB  - This content analysis considered the San Francisco Homeless Project (SFHP), a collaboration of media organizations working to generate a wave of coverage to alleviate homelessness. The effort stood out for its proposed solutions to a systemic and complex issue involving multiple ecological levels of a community, the number and variety of organizations involved, and the ongoing nature of the project. Yet, little is known about its impact and potential for replication. Researchers coded 977 articles published by 134 media organizations over an 18-month period split into three phases (Preliminary, Wave 1, and Wave 2). Article frequency, characteristics, and content (code groups) were stratified by SFHP participation and described overtime. Results revealed that in addition to creating a media blitz, SFHP participants generated significantly longer and more visual articles and were influenced by nonprofits and government agencies. However, the SFHP did not lead to a sustained change in terms of article frequency and content.

AB  - Statistics about citizen satisfaction regarding urban facilities and services are required for governing urban areas. Such statistics are often unavailable or outdated. At times, existing statistics are irrelevant to the major problems of most citizens. In this article, we propose a cost-effective method for estimating citizen satisfaction regarding urban facilities and services using crowdsourced place data. Two indicators are proposed based on place data derived from the Foursquare social media application. Both indicators are based on the hypothesis that the higher the number of places is that belong to a facility or service type on social media, then the higher the satisfaction of citizens regarding this facility or service type will be. This hypothesis was tested by using the Eurobarometer survey data as reference. The accuracy assessment revealed strong and statistically significant linear relationships (R-2 > 0.6) between the reference percentage of very satisfied citizens and some categories (i.e. ''Sport facilities'', ''Cultural Categories,'' and Streets & buildings). Other categories showed moderate and statistically significant linear relationships (i.e. Public spaces'' and Green spaces). Therefore, the proposed indicators provide estimates about citizen satisfaction with regard to these five categories. The new indicators can be used to better design public opinion surveys by making them more relevant to the public in terms of topics, space, and time.

AB  - Detecting and monitoring collective public opinion via social media platforms can provide real-time information to researchers and policymakers. Human emotions, culture, and opinions can be tracked over time to understand where different sentiments manifest themselves geographically. Expanding on existing methodology, the present study draws from sentiment analysis and point pattern analysis to categorize and analyze sentiment toward natural gas across the United States as a means of applying these techniques together. Three methods of machine learning were used to classify collected tweets into positive and negative categories: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression. Spatial clustering methods and spatial scan statistics were then applied to geocoded tweets to examine the distribution of sentiment about natural gas. In this analysis, the Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine methods outperformed Naive Bayes in classifying sentiment. The different methods produced not rather different classification results but also produced varying geographic results. The spatial analyses successfully indicated persistent patterns of negative and positive tweeting about natural gas that correlate with expectations given the physical and cultural environment of various regions. Further, the temporal variation of geographic hotspots of sentiment was readily apparent, suggesting that these approaches can reveal dynamic sentiment landscapes.

AB  - Grounded in scholarship on both the perceptual and behavioral components of the third-person effect, the present experimental study examined the effects of perceived impact of political parody videos on self and on others, by varying the perceived intent of the video producer and perceived level of exposure. Building on previous research on the behavioral consequences of such presumed influence, we tested a hierarchical regression model to show how perceived influence on others predicted individuals' willingness to engage in social media activism (i.e., corrective actions). Results demonstrated that participants in our study showed greater perceived influence of the political parody video when it was presented by a source of highly persuasive intent than by a source of low persuasive intent. Unlike our prediction for the effect of perceived exposure, we did not find the effect of perceived level of exposure on the presumed influence on others. Finally, the results of a hierarchical regression analysis showed that the perception of influence on others was positively associated with participants' willingness to take a corrective action-the likelihood of engaging in political social media activism.

AB  - Politicians and social activists frequently employ media designed to "change hearts and minds" by humanizing out-groups. These messages, it is assumed, lead to empathic concern, which motivates individuals to reconsider punitive policy attitudes. How effective is this approach? Using two experiments, we find that while media messages humanized Latinos for all respondents, the treatment messages produced the largest empathy response among those with the most positive prior attitudes. A key intended target of the media messages-those with the highest pretreatment antipathy toward the out-group-reported a dramatically lower increase in empathy. In a second study, we show that unpleasant affect from dissonance is one important mechanism driving these differential results. In both studies, treatments designed to provoke increased empathic concern produced little change in policy attitudes. Thus, changing hearts using empathy-inducing media is a complex task, making the ability to change minds elusive.

AB  - Pride events challenge hegemonic notions of sexuality and gender within places they are held. This is particularly the case in rural communities that are perceived, rightly or wrongly, as prejudices towards individuals with a diverse sexuality or gender identity. However, although academic literature has extensively explored Pride events within an urban context, limited attention has been paid to the rural context, and still little to those in their infancy. This article examines how stakeholders responded to the cancellation of a Pride event in the Australian rural township of Wagga Wagga due to COVID19. The pandemic, in this context, provided an opportunity to understand attitudes towards the event and its cancellation. Through this process. eight topics were identified as: council funding. cancellation as homophobic, last-minute cancellation, cancellation regretted, cancellation supported, organizers acknowledged, LGBTIQI+, and Pride event. Based on these findings, implications for the cancellation of social contentious events in response to such circumstances are identified. These implications suggest the need for a more considered approach to communicating about the cancellation to prevent allegations of prejudice and demonstrate the value of such events.

A survey shows the motives for following political leaders on the social media platform and how followers' motives are associated with their demographics and political attitudes. Findings indicate that information/guidance motives are the most important for following political leaders on Instagram, with social utility being the next highest motive. Also, males use Instagram more for social utility purposes than females, and having an entertainment motive is related to being young. The results also provide insight into how the politically active can be more influential on Instagram.

AB  - Satirical news shows such asThe Daily Showare popular with students, but are they appropriate for classroom use? In this two-group, pretest-posttest study, I examine differences in engagement, political knowledge, and political attitudes between two American Government classes: one assigned to watchThe Daily Showand the other assigned to readThe New York Times. The findings reveal no differences in engagement between the groups, but greater political knowledge inThe Daily Showgroup, as well as more cynicism and less trust in government. I conclude that given the surprising lack of greater engagement inThe Daily Showclass, along with higher levels of cynicism and mistrust in government,The Daily Showmay not be an appropriate substitute forThe New York Timesas a primary political information resource.

AB  - This article demonstrates the utility of combining individual survey data with social media content data in order to analyze how social context predicts individual behavior. The lack of valid and reliable measures of the contexts of social interaction in which individuals are embedded has remained an Achilles heel of the survey method. The reason is that the collection of direct observation of social interaction requires qualitative analysis of the context, which, hitherto, has been too costly to collect on a large scale. Instead, researchers have resorted to indirect measures such as aggregate group composition, respondent reports of social context, and institutional accounts. However, with the recent advent of social media data, contemporary social scientists now have social interaction data on an unprecedented scale. To utilize these data for quantitative analysis, researchers have to transform text prose into good measurement. We combine qualitative content analysis and supervised machine learning in order to ensure both semantic validity and accuracy in our measure of social interaction in Facebook groups. To test the substantive performance of the direct measures of social interaction, we use it to predict individual participation in refugee solidarity activism in Denmark. Additional testing indicates that the direct measure cannot easily be replaced by indirect measures of social interaction derived from group composition and institutional accounts. We also show how contexts and individual respondents can be effectively sampled using Facebook groups. Finally, the article discusses the limitations of social media data and points to alternate settings where our design is applicable.

AB  - Theoretical and empirical evidence suggest that how elites talk about race may shape mass racial attitudes. But current work limits understanding this possibility by not systematically characterizing elite rhetoric on race. To shed light on the nature of racially liberal and conservative elite rhetoric, and therefore the potential for elites to shape mass racial attitudes, I analyze transcripts from two partisan news shows: The Rachel Maddow Show and The O'Reilly Factor. Pairing a case study with text-as-data methods, I provide insight into themes constituting racially liberal and conservative elite discourse. Racial liberals like Maddow emphasize that race matters-racial bias and discrimination still shape nonwhites' life chances. In contrast, racial conservatives like O'Reilly contend that race does not shape life chances and serves only as an attention-seeking device. Identifying these divides helps shed light on the origins and dynamics of mass racial attitudes.

AB  - Introduction: Continued action is needed to tackle health inequalities in Canada, as those of lower income continue to be at higher risk for a range of negative health outcomes. There is arguably a lack of political will to implement policy change in this respect. As a result, we investigated public awareness of income-related health inequalities in a generally representative sample of Ontarians in late 2010.
   Methods: Data were collected from 2,006 Ontario adults using a telephone survey. The survey asked participants to agree or disagree with various statements asserting that there are or are not health inequalities in general and by income in Ontario, including questions pertaining to nine specific conditions for which inequalities have been described in Ontario. A multi-stage process using binary logistic regression determined whether awareness of health inequalities differed between participant subgroups.
   Results: Almost 73% of this sample of Ontarians agreed with the general premise that not all people are equally healthy in Ontario, but fewer participants were aware of health inequalities between the rich and the poor (53%-64%, depending on the framing of the question). Awareness of income-related inequalities in specific outcomes was considerably lower, ranging from 18% for accidents to 35% for obesity.
   Conclusions: This is the first province-wide study in Canada, and the first in Ontario, to explore public awareness on health inequalities. Given that political will is shaped by public awareness and opinion, these results suggest that greater awareness may be required to move the health equity agenda forward in Ontario. There is a need for health equity advocates, physicians and researchers to increase the effectiveness of knowledge translation activities for studies that identify and explore health inequalities.

AB  - Beliefs form a major component of public attitudes, and attitudes have a role in determining how people behave as consumers and as citizens. Their behavior in turn affects the commercial viability and even the sustainability of animal industries. Beliefs are subjective facts, that is, matters that individuals consider to be true. The process of informing the community necessarily involves changing beliefs and, to this extent, persuasion. Education strategies relating to welfare issues depend on the target group and the desired outcome. Target groups include farmers, post-farm gatekeepers including transport drivers and abattoir workers, carers of companion animals, legislators and regulators, retailers, and the general community. These target groups may not be homogeneous, but each nevertheless has identifiable needs for knowledge and skills relevant to welfare. The approach that is likely to be most effective is to provide appropriately targeted dispassionate and factual information to the community. In this way, when debates about animal welfare occur, all the stakeholders-including animal-rights groups, retailers, farmers, legislators, and regulators who are involved in the debate are more likely to produce good outcomes if discussion is based on a shared understanding of what current practices are and what science can reveal about welfare. Given that the mass media are the preferred source of information, the use of science-based media coverage and informed ethical debate is likely to have the best effect, albeit over a fairly long time frame.

AB  - Creating community awareness of reproductive tract infections (RTI), including sexually transmitted infections (STI), and how to prevent them is essential to minimize their spread. Data on people's views about RTI/STI are entirely lacking in Laos. The aim of this study was thus to explore people's perceptions, treatment-seeking behaviour and understanding of information about RTI/STI, in urban and rural communities in two provinces in Laos. Fourteen focus group discussions and 20 in-depth interviews were held with 76 women and 56 men, selected purposively to provide diversity of socio-demographic backgrounds. Qualitative content analysis was employed for the data analysis. The major finding was that both male and female participants had a variety of misconceptions about the causes and symptoms of RTI/STI and their cure, and a reluctance to seek health care, which could cause delay in appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The most common treatment-seeking behaviour was self-medication through private pharmacies, following advice mostly given by friends and drug sellers. The main reasons for not going to health facilities were fear of social discrimination or shyness of genital examination. Complaints were also made about clinicians' negative attitudes towards 'dirty disease'. Although condom use was mentioned as a way to prevent RTI/STI, an unwillingness to use condoms was commonly expressed. The main media sources of RTI/STI information were radio and television, and access to health information was more difficult in rural areas. The health messages provided were mostly understood, except for some technical terms. The findings indicate that strengthening health education and promotion through interventions at the community level is recommended to improve quality of RTI/STI management. Health education messages should be more accessible in rural areas. There is also an urgent need to improve communication between RTI/STI patients and clinicians.

AB  - This study uses the Stereotype Content Model to examine how mixed-media stereotypes about older workers affect the implicit activation and application of competence and warmth stereotypes among employees. By means of a 2x2 experiment, we show that a newspaper article portraying older workers in a stereotypical manner (i.e., high rather than low in warmth, low rather than high in competence) inhibits and evokes negative employability perceptions, resulting in a net negative effect on intentions to hire an older worker. Findings indicate that mixed-media portrayals have stronger effects on implicit stereotype activation compared to stereotype application. We propose a tailored media-based stereotype reduction strategy, whereby the negative component of older workers' stereotypes is replaced by stereotype-disconfirming information.

AB  - Previous studies on public opinion expression in communication, political science and discourse analysis are restricted to a censorship-/counter-censorship frame and focus their analysis on events with political agendas. This study explores netizens' discursive practice by focusing the analysis on netizens' language use in context per se, rather than from a censorship/counter-censorship viewpoint. It adopts a discursive pragmatic approach to examine a 'mundane' trending topic regarding a dispute between two public figures rather than 'major' events with acute social and political agendas. This study present evidence that Weibo users criticise public figures through indirect discursive strategies, including parody of name, constructed dialogues and rhetorical questions. It also highlights two prominent sentiments in Weibo public spheres during the COVID-19 pandemic - cyber nationalism and binary opposition between China and the rest of the world. The online backlash against Fang demonstrates how easily netizens can change their views towards a certain event.

TI  - Stance Detection Based on User Feature Fusion
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Rapid development of the Internet has contributed to the widespread adoption of social network platforms. Network media plays an important role in the process of public opinion dissemination and bears significant social responsibility. Public opinion mining is of great significance for online media to improve the quality of content provision and enhance media credibility. How to make full use of user-generated content is the key to improving the accuracy of position detection tasks. In this paper, we proposed a stance detection model based on user feature fusion by using comments of netizens in false news events on Weibo as research content. The method of feature fusion is adopted to integrate vectors including user sentiment, cognitive features, and text feature at the feature layer for model training and position prediction. The model is evaluated on a dataset of related microblog comments in false news. The result shows that our proposed method has a certain improvement in the effect of stance detection.

AB  - Research has indicated that many video games and virtual worlds are populated by unrealistic, hypersexualized representations of women, but the effects of using these representations remain understudied. Objectification theory suggests that women's exposure to sexualized media representations leads to self-objectification. Further, we anticipated this process would lead to increases in rape myth acceptance (RMA). Two experiments (Study 1, N = 87; Study 2, N = 81) examined the effects of avatar features on women's experiences of self-objectification. In both studies, college women exposed to sexualized avatars experienced higher levels of self-objectification after the virtual experience than those exposed to nonsexualized avatars. Furthermore, in Study 2, self-objectification mediated the relationship between controlling a sexualized avatar and subsequent levels of RMA. We discuss the implications of women using sexualized avatars in video games and virtual environments, which may lead to negative attitudes about the self and other women off-line due to heightened self-objectification.

AB  - Public opinion about gay rights is often shaped by egalitarian values. While the extant literature has suggested that African Americans' value structure tends to be very egalitarian, many popular media accounts as well as some scholarly research indicate that Blacks have, at times, opposed gay rights. We assert that when the media frame gay rights as equality issues, Blacks are more likely to rely on egalitarianism to form their opinions. We use content analysis to show that equality framing of gay rights dramatically increased in 2012, and we use national survey data to show that Blacks' support for marriage equality also precipitously rose beginning in 2012. Then, we use data from an original framing experiment to show that exposure to an equality frame does, indeed, encourage Blacks to be more reliant on their egalitarian values to form an opinion about same-sex marriage and to be more supportive of the policy.

It is very important to consider the significance of public opinion while performing transdisciplinary research. This study integrates public opinion in the bibliometric analysis method by using grey data from information available in the public information space: mass media and social networks. The network of factors influencing the development of bioeconomy, created with the help of social network analysis method, was compared with the one obtained from bibliometric analysis of SCOPUS database in order to find out the difference between scientific tendencies and the overall atmosphere in the information space. Although the structure of these networks varies, there is a common tendency in literature to identify the following factors as the key factors in the development of the bioeconomy: research and innovations; technology; energy and energy consumption.

AB  - This article examines the news business in Africa during decolonization. While UNESCO stimulated enormous discussion about creating independent 'third world' alternatives for news exchange, African countries such as Kenya and Tanzania sought to secure informational sovereignty by placing international news agencies within their control. Reuters and other international news agencies, in turn, adapted to decolonization by reinventing themselves as companies working to assist new nation-states. In the subsequent contest over news distribution, the Cold War, and inter-agency competition, Africa became a battleground for disputes between Reuters' capitalist vision of news as a commercial product and UNESCO's political conception of news. Ironically, decolonization enabled Reuters to gain greater control over information supply across Africa, because African leaders viewed the capitalist model of news as better suited to their diplomatic goals and political views.

AB  - Climate change studies are mainly focused on disaster management and inundated with scientific jargons that the public could not fathom. Thus, the dissemination of climate change discourse to the public has been less effective due to lack of information and understanding which explains the lack of public engagement and participation. Studies on climate change that consider linguistics aspects are beginning to emerge, but are still lacking. Therefore, the present study intends to conduct a linguistic analysis by identifying themes in news on climate change and by analysing the extent of media propagation about climate change. 922 news articles from Malaysiakini were analysed using a corpus-driven approach through frequency and collocation analysis. This enabled us to identify themes on climate change. Discourse analysis was then conducted to find out about the linguistic manifestations of the identified themes. The findings reveal that governance is the most propagated theme, followed by mitigation and adaptation, contributor and impacts, and threats, which may polarise the public's understanding of climate change. Instead, the themes of contributors and impacts, and threats are those which should be put forward as they may provide facts on the causal relationship of climate change that may help in assisting the public in understanding what to do, what to avoid, and the consequences of not acting on climate change. An understanding of the temporal aspects of public involvement in engaging with climate change issues through thematic analysis could assist in identifying the types of public participation in this issue.

AB  - This article discusses how ordinary Zimbabweans use jokes and mobile phones to construct their counter-publics. Jokes are an important part of the oral public sphere and have been used as outlets for political expectoration, to navigate and subvert state power and media censorship. Most of the jokes are often transmitted through mobile phones, which have become part of African social and cultural life. In view of restrictive media laws and an exclusive and dominant public sphere since the year 2000, jokes and mobile telephony have been used by some Zimbabweans to articulate their political views and to express dissatisfaction with the deteriorating economic and political situation in the country. In addition, the income status barrier to mobile phone ownership has been reduced tremendously, giving the mobile phone the potential to bridge the digital divide between rich and poor, urban and rural.

AB  - Journalists, government agency and the public may hold different opinions about the same event; these opinions flow within and across multiple social groups. Understanding opinion flow in multiple social groups is conducive to have a quick grasp of the information on social media. Our study aims to explore the opinion flow within or across the pre-defined social groups and the mutual influence of these groups' views about the same event. First of all, to depict the opinion flow, we propose a topic transition model, and for expressing the interaction of groups' opinion, we propose a quantitative approach. Secondly, according to 4Ws, we design a visual analytic system to let users analyze public opinion events through our system. The visual interface is tightly coupled with the analytical methods to present a concise summary of the opinion flow of events. A novel forwarding-network slicing diagram is designed to depict the forwarding process. To describe the result of the topic transition model, we also propose a topic transition graph to characterize the opinion flow. And a novel glyph is designed to visualize the characteristic of the influence. Our system provides a variety of interactions to assist users in exploring data, and we demonstrate the functionality of the system through two case studies.

AB  - Solidarity among society is considered crucial to tackle the corona pandemic. With the crisis evoking a high need for orientation, the information people obtain from different sources may shape whether they feel a strong sense of cohesion in the pandemic. To test this assumption, an online two-wave panel survey among a quota sample representing the German population aged 18+ was conducted in March and April 2020. Applying a path model, we show that using high-quality news media for information on the corona crisis (e.g., public broadcasting services) nourished people's sense of cohesion, while using alternative and hyperpartisan news sites had a detrimental effect. Relying on information from low-quality news media (e.g., tabloids) did not affect people's sense of cohesion, while talking to private contacts had a limited positive effect. Perceiving the public discourse as constructive vs. dramatized mediated the effects. These insights illustrate how the news media and other information sources in high-choice media environments contribute to a solid vs. polarized community in disruptive times of a crisis.

AB  - The research examines politically entertaining media through a mass communication lens, applying the disposition theory of humor toward the study of political parody appreciation and the effects of exposure to varied humor types on political attitudes. The analyses rely on experimental data (N = 269) collected in 2013. The results of the first analysis suggest that the interaction of disposition and exposure to different types of humor significantly influences variation in political parody appreciation. The findings from the second analysis show that negative affect toward the opposing candidate, or the presumed victor of a humorous situation, can dampen attitudes toward the victim given exposure to critical humor. The strategic implications for campaigns looking to engage with humor are discussed.

AB  - Israel is covered extensively by the American press. Several studies have examined US news coverage during specific events, yet a systematic analysis of the nature of this coverage is still lacking. This article provides an in-depth investigation of the coverage of Israel from 1981 to 2013 in three leading newspapers in the United States. Using computer-based content analysis of 56,490 news articles, we examine how the intensity of the coverage and the specific topics discussed vary over time. Our empirical findings demonstrate a relative decline in coverage of Israel, and confirm existing theories about media coverage of foreign events-mainly that coverage increases during periods of tumult, especially instances of armed conflict resulting in military action, and decreases during periods of heightened peace talks.

AB  - Background: In 2014, the world was startled by a sudden outbreak of Ebola. Although Ebola infections and deaths occurred almost exclusively in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, few potential Western cases, in particular, caused a great stir among the public in Western countries.
   Objective: This study builds on the construal level theory to examine the relationship between psychological distance to an epidemic and public attention and sentiment expressed on Twitter. Whereas previous research has shown the potential of social media to assess real-time public opinion and sentiment, generalizable insights that further the theory development lack.
   Methods: Epidemiological data (number of Ebola infections and fatalities) and media data (tweet volume and key events reported in the media) were collected for the 2014 Ebola outbreak, and Twitter content from the Netherlands was coded for (1) expressions of fear for self or fear for others and (2) psychological distance of the outbreak to the tweet source. Longitudinal relations were compared using vector error correction model (VECM) methodology.
   Results: Analyses based on 4500 tweets revealed that increases in public attention to Ebola co-occurred with severe world events related to the epidemic, but not all severe events evoked fear. As hypothesized, Web-based public attention and expressions of fear responded mainly to the psychological distance of the epidemic. A chi-square test showed a significant positive relation between proximity and fear:X-2(2)=103.2 (P<. 001). Public attention and fear for self in the Netherlands showed peaks when Ebola became spatially closer by crossing the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. Fear for others was mostly predicted by the social distance to the affected parties.
   Conclusions: Spatial and social distance are important predictors of public attention to worldwide crisis such as epidemics. These factors need to be taken into account when communicating about human tragedies.

AB  - Objectives: As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is introduced, it is critical to recognize that public opinion on vaccines is largely influenced by health communications, with YouTube being a major source of information and misinformation. This analysis graded the accuracy, quality, and reliability of the most viewed YouTube videos depicting COVID-19 and vaccinations over a 6-mo period. Methods: We collected hyperlinks for the 150 most viewed YouTube videos discussing COVID-19 from January through June 2020. Closed captioning data were searched for the term "vaccine," yielding 32 videos. This sample was evaluated for quality, accuracy, and reliability using a rubric that incorporated existing instruments: Global Quality Scale (GQS), JAMA Benchmark Criteria, and DISCERN. Results: These 32 videos had 139,764,188 views at the time of data collection. The majority of videos received low scores, with network news sources receiving the lowest scores overall. Conclusions: The overall quality of COVID-19 YouTube videos related to vaccines may be low and raises a precautionary alert for the public consuming these videos and for health-care providers working to provide the best information to their patients. Existing scoring tools may not capture the complexities of social media. New tools could allow for a better understanding of the modern landscape of health communications.

AB  - In recent years, journalists, political elites, and the public have used Twitter as an indicator of political trends. Given this usage, what effect do campaign activities have on Twitter discourse? What effect does that discourse have on electoral outcomes? We posit that Twitter can be understood as a tool for and an object of political communication, especially during elections. This study positions Twitter volume as an outcome of other electoral antecedents and then assesses its relevance in election campaigns. Using a data set of more than 3 million tweets about 2014 U.S. Senate candidates from three distinct groups-news media, political actors, and the public-we find that competitiveness and money spent in the race were the main predictors of volume of Twitter discourse, and the impact of competitiveness of the race was stronger for tweets coming from the media when compared to the other groups. Twitter volume did not predict vote share for any of the 35 races studied. Our findings suggest that Twitter is better understood as a tool for political communication, and its usage may be predicted by money spent and race characteristics. As an object, Twitter use has limited power to predict electoral outcomes.

AB  - The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion (1992) provided both a powerful framework for analyzing public opinion and a highly influential account of the role of political elites in shaping public opinion. Zaller's subsequent work has focused less on the mechanics of opinion change than on the role of public opinion in the broader political process. This evolution has entailed sustained attention to V. O. Key, Jr.'s concept of latent opinionthe opinion politicians are likely to face in the next election, as distinct from what is currently measureable in surveys. It has also entailed a downgrading of the importance attached to Media Politicsthe attempt to govern on the basis of words and images that diffuse through the mass mediarelative to Party Politicsthe substance of party performance. In recent work, Zaller and his colleagues have emphasized the key role of interest groups and activists in shaping parties' policy choices, largely free of effective constraint by the mass public. This work provides a rather more pessimistic take on The Question of Elite Domination of Public Opinion than does the epilogue to The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion.

AB  - Background: Social networks such as Twitter offer the clinical research community a novel opportunity for engaging potential study participants based on user activity data. However, the availability of public social media data has led to new ethical challenges about respecting user privacy and the appropriateness of monitoring social media for clinical trial recruitment. Researchers have voiced the need for involving users' perspectives in the development of ethical norms and regulations.
   Objective: This study examined the attitudes and level of concern among Twitter users and nonusers about using Twitter for monitoring social media users and their conversations to recruit potential clinical trial participants.
   Methods: We used two online methods for recruiting study participants: the open survey was (1) advertised on Twitter between May 23 and June 8, 2017, and (2) deployed on TurkPrime, a crowdsourcing data acquisition platform, between May 23 and June 8, 2017. Eligible participants were adults, 18 years of age or older, who lived in the United States. People with and without Twitter accounts were included in the study.
   Results: While nearly half the respondents-on Twitter (94/603, 15.6%) and on TurkPrime (509/603, 84.4%)-indicated agreement that social media monitoring constitutes a form of eavesdropping that invades their privacy, over one-third disagreed and nearly 1 in 5 had no opinion. A chi-square test revealed a positive relationship between respondents' general privacy concern and their average concern about Internet research (P<.005). We found associations between respondents' Twitter literacy and their concerns about the ability for researchers to monitor their Twitter activity for clinical trial recruitment (P=.001) and whether they consider Twitter monitoring for clinical trial recruitment as eavesdropping (P<.001) and an invasion of privacy (P=.003). As Twitter literacy increased, so did people's concerns about researchers monitoring Twitter activity. Our data support the previously suggested use of the nonexceptionalist methodology for assessing social media in research, insofar as social media-based recruitment does not need to be considered exceptional and, for most, it is considered preferable to traditional in-person interventions at physical clinics. The expressed attitudes were highly contextual, depending on factors such as the type of disease or health topic (eg, HIV/AIDS vs obesity vs smoking), the entity or person monitoring users on Twitter, and the monitored information.
   Conclusions: The data and findings from this study contribute to the critical dialogue with the public about the use of social media in clinical research. The findings suggest that most users do not think that monitoring Twitter for clinical trial recruitment constitutes inappropriate surveillance or a violation of privacy. However, researchers should remain mindful that some participants might find social media monitoring problematic when connected with certain conditions or health topics. Further research should isolate factors that influence the level of concern among social media users across platforms and populations and inform the development of more clear and consistent guidelines.

AB  - Opinion polls form an important part of modern election coverage but might also shape amount and tone of other subsequent coverage about political parties. We propose to use and elaborate on Patterson's generic storylines to help account for different findings in prior research, by pointing to the importance of race context. A manual content analysis (N = 3755) of the 2013 German Bundestag election campaign is used to empirically test our framework, using a multilevel model that separates effects of 36 polls on coverage of five different parties in 11 different outlets. Results show that the amount of party coverage for the front runner party increased after drops in its ratings, and the challenger party received more negative coverage after increases in its poll ratings. Media coverage did not follow a bandwagon trend but played an independent and counteracting role within the election campaign.

AB  - Current research draws a distinction between stereotype activation and application. Building on this differentiation, we present an implicit social cognition model of media priming: Implicit stereotypes (i.e., automatically activated stereotypes) are the outcome of associative processes, whereas explicit stereotypes (i.e., overtly expressed judgments) represent the outcome of propositional processes. We tested some of the model's basic predictions in an experiment. We found that a Gaussian distribution function explained the explicit media priming effect (i.e., decay in effect size at very high dose levels). However, a monotonic function explained the implicit media priming effect. This indicates that stereotypic content may impact implicit stereotypes even if the mass-mediated content is perceived as invalid. We discuss this finding regarding possible media-based reduction strategies.

AB  - In recent years, the Front National, under the leadership of Marine Le Pen, has experienced a political revival. In elections, membership numbers and public opinion polls, the party has made impressive gains. We argue in this article that these gains stem, at least in part, from a strategic repositioning of the party based on a more populist discourse and communication style. Through a content analysis of posts (press releases) on the party's Facebook page from 2013 to 2015, we first highlight that, besides giving the Front National a more presentable image, Marine Le Pen has changed the Front National on two fronts: (1) she has rendered the party's discourse more populist and (2) she has managed to reframe the party's leitmotif of immigration. Second, through quantitative analysis of Likes' for each post, we find that this new discourse resonates well with Front National sympathizers.

In this article, I assess the viability of a new data sourceGoogle web search datafor use in social science research. Such data, when collected and applied appropriately, offer a unique lens through which information on patterns of information seeking can be drawn. I examine data on the final phase of the 2012 US presidential election and present findings along two lines. First, sensitivity tests demonstrate that web search information can proxy for public opinion. Second, testing of hypotheses finds that candidate presence on the campaign trail, although generally correlated with increased interest in political issue, is subject to media- and event-specific modifying effects. These findings underline this article's principal contention that web search data are a viable resource for scholars of political communication.

AB  - This paper combines corpus linguistics and critical discourse analysis methodologies in order to investigate the discourses and cyber activism of the British right-wing nationalist party, Britain First. A study of a corpus of texts produced by elite members of the group reveals a racist, xenophobic stance which constructs Islam and Muslims as the radical, dangerous 'Other'. This creates a discourse of fear that threatens the way of life of the indigenous in-group of the British people. An investigation of the cyber activity of the group demonstrates that Britain First is able to achieve a significant amount of following on social media by publishing populist material that veils their true nature or ideological stance.

AB  - In the UK Channel 4 documentary, My Week As a Muslim, an English, white woman named Katie donned a hijab, a prosthetic nose and copious amounts of brown foundation to disguise herself as a Pakistani Muslim so that she could spend a week experiencing Muslim culture and appreciate her position of white privilege. Although My Week as a Muslim was attempting to challenge many of the dominant stereotypes of Muslim women found in much of Western media, it was highly problematic in the way the entire experiment echoed the narrative conventions of cross-dressing comedy films. The documentary concluded with a final 'reveal' sequence where Katie removed her hijab, prosthetic nose and wiped off brown make-up to show her new Muslim friends that she merely had been performing Muslim-ness for the past week. Not only did this reinforce misconceptions that there are significant differences between British people and Islam (Katie could only pass as Muslim through the use of prosthetics and elaborate make-up) but the 'hilarious' reveal of the cross-dressing narrative also suggested the superiority of the Muslim-drag performer in comparison to the foolish people who were deceived by the act.

AB  - Shortly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December of 1941, the American government impressed upon the media industry and corporate advertising the cooperative need to boost morale and enlist nationalist support for the war effort. Public opinion was shaped through an active campaign of visual propaganda and media censorship in which the social trauma of war, in particular, representations of death and destructive disorder, was erased from official news reports. However, avant-garde art and writing in View magazine during the early 1940s can be analyzed as a radical form of counter-discourse that challenged the media's representation of the war. View had been founded in 1940 by the poet Charles Henri Ford, who vowed to create a magazine devoted to what he called the "new journalism", a form of international reporting by poets and visual artists that would provide visionary critical insight on the forthcoming political catastrophe in Europe. Lacking their own publishing forum, a number of Surrealist emigres and American adherents of Surrealism gravitated towards View. As this article will examine, Surrealist imagery and prose in View evoked a profound sense of the bodily trauma and physical destruction omitted from mass media, subverting the government's highly sanitized and ideologically manipulated representations of World War II.

AB  - In this article, we focus on a key strategic objective of scientific organizations: maintaining the trust of the public. Using data from a nationally representative survey of American adults (n = 1510), we assess the extent to which demographic factors and political ideology are associated with citizens' trust in general science and climate science research conducted by US federal agencies. Finally, we test whether priming individuals to first consider agencies' general science research influences trust in their climate science research, and vice versa. We found that federal agencies' general science research is more trusted than their climate science research-although a large minority of respondents did not have an opinion-and that political ideology has a strong influence on public trust in federal scientific research. We also found that priming participants to consider general scientific research does not increase trust in climate scientific research. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

AB  - This paper looks into the European Capital of Culture (ECoC) programme as a leading example of culture-led regeneration intervention aimed at renewing or diversifying the economic base and positioning of host cities. One of the key claims associated with the programme is that it can transform the image' of a city. These image transformation claims are often supported by evidence of heightened or more positive media coverage in the short term. However, little evidence has generally been gathered to determine long-term, sustained image change. The paper seeks to at least partly address this lacuna by presenting evidence on the media representation of Glasgow and Liverpool over three decades. These two cities are widely perceived to be paradigmatic not only of successful culture-led regeneration but also of the power of the ECoC title to transform city image. The paper looks at the importance of the media narrative arc surrounding major cultural events in solidifying image change' processes, regardless of the existence of evidence to suggest a change in perceptions by local communities at the time the event is taking place. The core argument is that if media coverage about a particular place shows a significant change in focus and attitude over time, is voluminous enough and cuts across geographical and journalistic variations, then it effectively becomes a key source of evidence of de facto image change. The key proposition in this paper is that evidenceable and sustained change in media representations of place can be taken as tantamount to image change. This is based on the assumption that widespread and longitudinal trends in media representation have the capacity to both reflect and influence public attitudes and perceptions.

AB  - Social media (SM) allow citizens to not only read news but also express their political opinions. Drawing from cognitive appraisal and affective intelligence theory, this study investigated the affective foundation of political opinion expression on social media (POESM) using two-wave panel data. The results indicate that enthusiasm and anger stimulated POESM but only for individuals with a minimum threshold motivation to use SM for political purposes. Among the politically motivated, anxiety increased POESM for individuals with low political knowledge but lessened POESM for ones with high political knowledge. Thus, emotional states can be powerful drivers of POESM. In contexts with low levels of POESM, emotions may stimulate online discussion as well as contribute to the further emotionalization of political debates.

AB  - Introduction. The information provided about organ donation and transplantation (ODT) affects whether it is viewed favorably or unfavorably.
   Objectives. The objective of this study was to determine the means by which each source of information about ODT influenced attitudes of children.
   Material and Methods. Ten secondary schools from the south-east of Spain were stratified geographically. We performed a random selection of pupils from the first 4 years of compulsory secondary range, education (age 11-15 years). A validated self-administered questionnaire about attitudes toward ODT was completed anonymously.
   Results. The adolescents had received information about ODT through several sources. The most frequent sources were television (86%), films (59%), and magazines (56%). Positive information from information sources was associated with more favorable attitudes toward ODT (P < .05); those who received negative information had more unfavorable attitudes (P < .05).
   Conclusions. Most information about ODT that reaches our children is through audiovisual means. Attitudes were more favorable among adolescents who have received positive information through the mass media, with more negative attitudes among those who received negative information.

AB  - There has recently been a call for the use of more diverse images by the media to promote body satisfaction. This experimental study evaluated the impact of body diversity images and whether these could act as a buffer against thin-ideal norms. Female participants (n = 106, aged 16-30 years) completed measures of body compassion, body and face satisfaction before and after random allocation to images reflecting one of three interventions: control, body diversity and thin-ideal. Attitudes towards thin-ideal images were also assessed. The results showed significant differences between groups for overall body compassion, the body compassion subtype of body kindness, body satisfaction and face satisfaction with those viewing the body diversity images reporting higher scores after exposure compared to the other two groups. Those in the body diversity group also displayed more negative attitudes towards thin-ideal images compared to controls. No between groups differences were found for body compassion subtypes relating to common humanity, motivated action and body criticism or positive attitudes to the thin-ideal images. In sum, exposure to body diversity images had a positive impact on body kindness and overall body compassion and body satisfaction providing experimental support for the use of diversity images as a buffer against thin-deals.

AB  - Stereotype threat theory argues that reminders of negative stereotypes about one's stigmatized identity can undermine performance, but few studies have examined this phenomenon among Black Americans. Drawing from the literature on the impact of mass media on stereotype activation, we examine whether exposure to rap music induces stereotype threat among Black men. In two studies, incidental exposure to violent/misogynistic rap, but not conscious hip-hop or pop music, impaired Black (but not White) men's cognitive performance (Experiments 1 and 2), but only when the artist was ostensibly Black (vs. White; Experiment 2). These effects were conditionally mediated by stereotype activation, such that listening to a Black (but not White) rapper activated negative stereotypes about Black people for both Black and White participants but only impaired performance among Black participants (Experiment 2). This suggests that exposure to some forms of artistic expression may activate culturally shared stereotypes and obstruct academic success among stigmatized groups.

AB  - The media, including popular media such as music and films, often generate conversations about different spectrums of society. Due to an overabundance of imagery and sounds from the media, including television, film, advertising, social media and the internet, audiences are constantly bombarded with stereotypes and ideologies about other races and identities. As an exponentially growing popular culture industry, Nollywood - the Nigerian movie industry - positions itself as a source of knowledge and popular discourse about issues emanating from the continent and other places. With this growth, Nollywood seems to have been given a spot in the political circle of identity politics, giving it the power to represent the 'Others'. This study interrogates the theme of identity construction in African films by focusing on the ways in which some select Nollywood films of the early and late 2000s and early 2010s frame and construct foreign races and foreign societies, using critical ideological analysis and the framework of critical race theory. Representations and portrayals of difference in the analysed movies could be serving some 'revenge' of sorts, transgressing age-long representations of Black people in Blaxploitation films. The multiplex representations as seen in the analyses serve the primary purpose of such stereotypes: to reproduce and to reaffirm prejudices that over time become naturalized and normalized. The study thematically specifies the significant use of labels, stereotypes and certain orthodoxies that aim to frame and characterize foreign societies in popular Nigerian films and suggests some broader implications of the findings.

AB  - Substantial differences exist in the cognitive styles of liberals and conservatives on psychological measures [1]. Variability in political attitudes reflects genetic influences and their interaction with environmental factors [2, 3]. Recent work has shown a correlation between liberalism and conflict-related activity measured by event-related potentials originating in the anterior cingulate cortex [4]. Here we show that this functional correlate of political attitudes has a counterpart in brain structure. In a large sample of young adults, we related self-reported political attitudes to gray matter volume using structural MRI. We found that greater liberalism was associated with increased gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex, whereas greater conservatism was associated with increased volume of the right amygdala. These results were replicated in an independent sample of additional participants. Our findings extend previous observations that political attitudes reflect differences in self-regulatory conflict monitoring [4] and recognition of emotional faces [5] by showing that such attitudes are reflected in human brain structure. Although our data do not determine whether these regions play a causal role in the formation of political attitudes, they converge with previous work [4,6] to suggest a possible link between brain structure and psychological mechanisms that mediate political attitudes.

S. citizen character, and positive effects were moderately, although nonsignificantly enhanced among those who viewed the illegal immigrant character as more typical of illegal immigrants in general. Liking of the illegal immigrant character was a significant mediator of the effects. The positive effects on attitudes toward illegal immigrants transferred to more positive attitudes toward other social groups as well. The study is framed in terms of a social cognitive theory approach to vicarious intergroup contact.

AB  - Self-tracking has attracted a lot of attention from researchers and public opinion makers owing to its potential for improving life conditions through preemptive action on health, and as a tool of user empowerment vis-a-vis health-care professionals and private and public institutions. Nevertheless, the 'stuff' that is typically tracked - exercise and diet being the dominant tracking activities - refers to cultural and social practices that, for the individual user, are utterly mundane and reside in an experiential realm of everyday life. Self-tracking has to be understood in relation to behavior that is predominantly about getting things done in ways that are possible, suitable and meaningful for the individual. To account for this, we propose to conceptualize self-tracking as a communicative phenomenon along three dimensions: communication with the system, the self and social networks of peers. We develop the theoretical framework, drawing upon empirical findings from a qualitative study on how self-tracking is practiced and experienced in the context of exercise by different categories of empirical users. We demonstrate that the meanings of self-tracking practices are, at once, shaped by the motivation of an individual user who is situated in a broader web of everyday activities, and stimulated and augmented by communicative features provided by the technology.

AB  - Even though the independence referendum held in 2017 in Catalonia was unsuccessful, the large role of the media together with easy, fast international broadcasting and the fear of a possible mimic effect in other regions made the entire world observe and discuss the event. The purpose of this article is to analyse the media coverage of the referendum in two benchmark British newspapers, The Guardian and The Telegraph. Based on hypotheses that the news coverage regarding the Catalonian referendum might be prone to the dissemination of information according to the editorial position of the newspapers, this research has analysed 188 news pieces by using framing analysis. The first hypothesis, that both newspapers adapted their versions of the story to readers according to the predisposition of the different editorial trends of each newspaper, was not confirmed. The results allow us to conclude that in the news of the benchmark British press regarding the illegal referendum in Catalonia, fair journalistic coverage prevailed.

AB  - Celebrity political endorsement is an internationally common phenomenon that has substantially increased over recent years. It refers to celebrities who publicly support political candidates or parties, often in election campaigns. Because most studies focus on the United States, little is known about the effects of celebrity political endorsement in Europe. Our study aims to contribute to the European perspective by testing the effectiveness of such endorsements in the context of the 2014 European parliamentary elections. We conducted online experiments in five European countries-Germany, Great Britain, Poland, Spain, and Sweden-to measure effects of celebrity endorsements on attitudes toward the EU and on vote intention. Endorser attributes (political expertise, trustworthiness, and likability) and characteristics of the respondents (political interest and gender) were included as moderating variables. Our results show only a few statistically significant effects, which are furthermore inconsistent with the theoretical assumptions. Given that celebrity political endorsement does not elicit the assumed effects in European countries, we discuss possible explanations for our results.

AB  - Much of what people learn about politics comes from the mass media. How media outlets construct their reports have direct consequences for what people think about politics. Scholars and pundits have long debated about the factors that shape media choices. Yet there have been few direct investigations into how three major determinants shape political news: world events, advocacy groups, and the government. This article examines the relative impact of these factors by focusing on the construction of news related to energy conservation in the United States. Specifically, it looks at how events, messages crafted by interest groups, and government-sponsored public service announcements (PSAs) affect news frames and attributions of responsibility for the extant energy situation. It finds that events are the most important factor driving news coverage; advocacy groups are second, followed by PSAs. This suggests that news about conservation is driven more by events than messages supplied by agents seeking to influence public discourse. Thus, groups with specific agendas such as government and advocacy organizations can, at least at times, be limited in terms of their capacity to shape news coverage-which has implications for theories of media choice.

AB  - Academics are increasingly expected to use social media to disseminate their work and knowledge to public audiences. Although this has various advantages, particularly for alternative forms of dissemination, the web can also be an unsafe space for typically oppressed or subordinated groups. This article presents two auto-ethnographic accounts of the abuse and hate academics researching oppressed groups, namely, women and people of Muslim faith, experienced online. In doing so, this article falls into four parts. The first section provides an overview of existing literature, particularly focusing on work which explores the violence and abuse of women and people of Muslim faith online. The second section considers the auto-ethnographic methodological approach adopted in this article. The third section provides the auto-ethnographic accounts of the author's experiences of hate and abuse online. The final section locates these experiences within broader theoretical concepts, such as silencing, and considers possible implications of such online hate in both an academic context and beyond.

TI  - BEYOND CUES AND POLITICAL ELITES: THE FORGOTTEN ZALLER
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - MOTIVATED SKEPTICISM
KW  - AGAIN
AB  - Zaller's Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion initially sets out an epistemic view of politics in which the ultimate determinants of political action are ideas about the society in which we act. These ideas are usually mediated to us by others, so Zaller begins the book by describing its topic as the influence of the media on public opinion, and he includes journalists among the political elites who exert this influence (along with politicians, public officials, and experts). But the book eventually reduces journalists to being messengers of politicians' cues to the public. This understanding of the media is built into the book's model of opinion formation, in which cued predispositions are pivotal to the acceptance or rejection of culturally mediated messagesbut are themselves insulated from cultural influence. A cueing model of message reception, however, ignores messages that are differentially persuasive not because of the predispositions they cue but the content they convey. Gauging the heterogeneous persuasiveness of messages requires qualitative content analysis and cultural contextualization, and if this research is to contribute to a general understanding of public opinion, it will have to extend beyond news-media messages to ideational influences carried in high culture, formal education, and the entertainment media. All of these sources of ideas, in turn, may contribute to the shaping of predispositions, as suggested in part by public opinion regarding the Vietnam War. Research of this kind would signal a new type of political science that focused on the actual thoughts of real people trying to understand a complex environment: exactly the type of political science suggested at the beginning of Zaller's book.

AB  - This work utilizes data from Twitter to mine association rules and extract knowledge about public attitudes regarding worldwide crises. It exploits the COVID-19 pandemic as a use case, and analyzes tweets gathered between February and August 2020. The proposed methodology comprises topic extraction and visualization techniques, such as WordClouds, to form clusters or themes of opinions. It then uses Association Rule Mining (ARM) to discover frequent wordsets and generate rules that infer to user attitudes. The goal is to utilize ARM as a postprocessing technique to enhance the output of any topic extraction method. Therefore, only strong wordsets are stored after discarding trivia ones. We also employ frequent wordset identification to reduce the number of extracted topics. Our findings showcase that 50 initially retrieved topics are narrowed down to just 4, when combining Latent Dirichlet Allocation with ARM. Our methodology facilitates producing more accurate and generalizable results, whilst exposing implications regarding social media user attitudes. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The influx of refugees to Europe is a topic that dominates the political and media agenda. Furthermore, the installation of asylum-seeker centres (ASCs) has made asylum seekers and refugees highly visible in the everyday life of many European citizens. Drawing on theories of ethnic threat and intergroup contact, we examine how geospatial proximity to ASCs translates into threat or contact in an everyday context and how this affects attitudes toward asylum seekers. By taking advantage of a natural experiment, where the ASCs are assigned to city districts as-if at random, as well as innovating measures of outgroup exposure and geospatial proximity, we find that, although higher numbers of asylum seekers in one's own neighbourhood are related to an increased perception of their local presence, the actual presence of asylum seekers does not lead to more negative attitudes or a greater threat perception, nor to more frequent contact. It is only when the number of asylum seekers in one's own direct neighbourhood suddenly increases that attitudes toward asylum seekers deteriorate.

AB  - Social media platforms such as Twitter provide opportunities for governments to connect to foreign publics and influence global public opinion. In the current study, we used social and semantic network analysis to investigate China's digital public diplomacy campaign during COVID-19. Our results show that Chinese state-affiliated media and diplomatic accounts created hashtag frames and targeted stakeholders to challenge the United States or to cooperate with other countries and international organizations, especially the World Health Organization. Telling China's stories was the central theme of the digital campaign. From the perspective of social media platform affordance, we addressed the lack of attention paid to hashtag framing and stakeholder targeting in the public diplomacy literature.

AB  - Forty per cent of Europeans refuse to have Roma as their neighbours, while 80 per cent of these do not even have direct contact with them. Using these statistics as a point of departure, this study analyzes how attitudes toward Roma are constructed. It proposes to investigate this process in two similar environments but where local integration policies directed toward Roma differ, resulting in disparate forms of intergroup contact. The analysis is premised on two theoretical assumptions: that the integration of migrants is a local public policy issue and that intergroup contact frames attitudes between majority and minority groups. From semi-structured interviews in the French municipalities of La Courneuve and Ivry-sur-Seine, four theories are empirically tested: the contact theory, the halo effect, the impact of local immigrant integration policies and media influence. This study demonstrates that the implementation of municipal policies in favour of Roma integration can improve their living conditions and thus deconstruct prejudices attributable to their precarious situation. In addition, it illustrates how the media activate, maintain or solidify the way Roma are perceived.

AB  - Stance Detection is the task of automatically determining whether the author of a text is in favor, against, or neutral towards a given target. In this paper we investigate the portability of tools performing this task across different languages, by analyzing the results achieved by a Stance Detection system (i.e. MultiTACOS) trained and tested in a multilingual setting.
   First of all, a set of resources on topics related to politics for English, French, Italian, Spanish and Catalan is provided which includes: novel corpora collected for the purpose of this study, and benchmark corpora exploited in Stance Detection tasks and evaluation exercises known in literature. We focus in particular on the novel corpora by describing their development and by comparing them with the benchmarks. Second, MultiTACOS is applied with different sets of features especially designed for Stance Detection, with a specific focus to exploring and combining both features based on the textual content of the tweet (e.g., style and affective load) and features based on contextual information that do not emerge directly from the text. Finally, for better highlighting the contribution of the features that most positively affect system performance in the multilingual setting, a features analysis is provided, together with a qualitative analysis of the misclassified tweets for each of the observed languages, devoted to reflect on the open challenges.

Charm offensives are strategic public relations campaigns that political leaders use to shift their countries' reputation swiftly and temporarily in the global arena. Based on visual and textual analysis of the journalistic coverage of Zarif's charm offensive in the American and the Israeli press, we show that in his interactions with the American team and announcements to the press, Zarif focused on the future in contrast to the confusing past; he aimed at a calm and narrowly focused process of negotiations and preferred closed-door discussions among experts and one-on-one conversations with Secretary of State Kerry over public press conferences. He warmly welcomed photographers with smiles and presented a persistent readiness for "friendly" interaction. Western journalists enthusiastically covered these "unexpected" features of the Iranian diplomacy, and ultimately helped Zarif achieve a favorable international media environment conducive to making the deal. Bringing together literatures in communication studies, sociology, political science and international relations, we argue that in the form of a "charm offensive" political leaders can thus utilize the press for momentary country image transformation internationally.

AB  - This research used a path analysis model to explore the degree to which reliance on off-line and online media, off-line and online discussion of political issues, as well as political attitudes predict whether an individual will engage in selective exposure to political websites. The study also looked at selective avoidance of contradictory information on websites. The results indicate that respondents did indeed practice selective exposure when accessing information on political websites, especially among those who are politically active online and those who rely heavily on websites and blogs for political information. However, the results showed that selective avoidance did not occur, with those exhibiting increased political interest and online participation significantly less likely to avoid information that challenges their views.

AB  - Human reasoning can be characterized by a continuum anchored by two extremes: fast, automatic, and emotional processing on the one side; versus slow, controlled and rational processing on the other. Despite theoretical linkages, no studies have empirically connected these types of information processing with the mechanisms of multimodal (visual and textual) media effects. We employ tools from dual processing theories in a framing effects paradigm to test whether the effects of news visuals and text take place via relatively more automatic and controlled information processing, respectively. To do so, we combine experimental manipulations and individual differences data collected across two experiments using different political issues. Results from experimental manipulations provide converging evidence for the distinct processing of visuals and text. Individual differences data paint a more nuanced picture, suggesting that the processing of multimodal news frames does not always conform to a simple automatic-controlled dichotomy.

AB  - We begin this article with a close look at some contemporary pictures of sexual life in the Muslim world that have been painted in certain sections of the Western media, asking how and why these pictures matter. Across a range of mainstream print media from the New York Times to the Daily Mail, and across reported events from several countries, can be found pictures of 'sexual misery'. These 'frame' Muslim men as tyrannical, Muslim women as downtrodden or exploited, and the wider world of Islam as culpable. Crucially, this is not the whole story. We then consider how these negative representations are being challenged and how they can be challenged further. In doing so, we will not simply set pictures of sexual misery against their binary opposites, namely pictures abounding in the promise of sexual happiness. Instead, we search for a more complex picture, one that unsettles stereotypes about the sexual lives of Muslims without simply idealising its subjects. This takes us to the journalism, life writing and creative non-fiction of Shelina Zahra Janmohamed and the fiction of Ayisha Malik and Amjeed Kabil. We read this long-form work critically, attending to manifest advances in depictions of the relationships of Muslim-identified individuals over the last decade or so, while also remaining alert to lacunae and limitations in the individual representations. More broadly, we hope to signal our intention to avoid both Islamophobia and Islamophilia in scrutinising literary texts.

AB  - Over the past 70 years, the history of acceptance of the lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) community within the United States has seen much change and fluctuation. One of the places that this dialogue has been preserved is through the syndicated advice columns of Dear Abby and Ann Landers, in which individuals in the United States were writing in for advice to deal with their anxiety over a newly emerging and highly visible new community of individuals once considered to be mentally ill and dangerous. Using discourse analysis, this article traces the evolution of public and scientific opinions about the LGBT community during the years leading up to the Stonewall riots all the way to right before the AIDs epidemic. This analysis sheds light on several moral panics that emerged regarding this newly visible population, especially in regard to disturbances within the domestic sphere and a stigmatization of bisexuality.

AB  - The interactive and real-time characteristics of gathering public opinion through the process of investigating big social data have gained more popularity and attention from the recent past. Moreover, massive social media data wide opened an immense opportunity for businesses for extracting potential insights. However, big data analytics applications pose a crucial challenge in distinguishing opinions from the factors. In this paper, an Integrated Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network-based Deep Neural Networks-based Sentiment Analysis Methodology (ICNN-LSTM-DNN) was proposed over the big social data for opinion mining. This proposed ICNN-LSTM-DNN-based sentiment analysis approach is an adaptable sentimental analysis mechanism that is capable of investigating social media posts and extracts user's facts and opinion in real-time. This proposed ICNN-LSTM-DNN-based sentiment analysis approach is mainly for facilitating automatic separation of facts from the opinions extracted from twitter messages posted online. This proposed ICNN-LSTM-DNN-based sentiment analysis approach was applied over the tweets associated with the 2019 Indian Election for opinion mining. This proposed ICNN-LSTM-DNN-based sentiment analysis approach outperformed different baseline techniques used for investigation in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-Measure.

TI  - Measuring vaccine confidence: analysis of data obtained by a media surveillance system used to analyse public concerns about vaccines

KW  - POLIO ERADICATION
KW  - AUTISM
AB  - Background The intensity, spread, and effects of public opinion about vaccines are growing as new modes of communication speed up information sharing, contributing to vaccine hesitancy, refusals, and disease outbreaks. We aimed to develop a new application of existing surveillance systems to detect and characterise early signs of vaccine issues. We also aimed to develop a typology of concerns and a way to assess the priority of each concern.
   Methods Following preliminary research by The Vaccine Confidence Project, media reports (eg, online artides, blogs, government reports) were obtained using the HealthMap automated data collection system, adapted to monitor online reports about vaccines, vaccination programmes, and vaccine-preventable diseases. Any reports that did not meet the inclusion criteria-any reference to a human vaccine or vaccination campaign or programme that was accessible online-were removed from analysis. Reports were manually analysed for content and categorised by concerns, vaccine, disease, location, and source of report, and overall positive or negative sentiment towards vaccines. They were then given a priority level depending on the seriousness of the reported event and time of event occurrence. We used descriptive statistics to analyse the data collected during a period of 1 year, after refinements to the search terms and processes had been made.
   Findings We analysed data from 10 380 reports (from 144 countries) obtained between May 1, 2011, and April 30, 2012. 7171 (69%) contained positive or neutral content and 3209 (31%) contained negative content. Of the negative reports, 1977 (24%) were associated with impacts on vaccine programmes and disease outbreaks; 1726 (21%) with beliefs, awareness, and perceptions; 1371 (16%) with vaccine safety; and 1336 (16%) with vaccine delivery programmes. We were able to disaggregate the data by country and vaccine type, and monitor evolution of events over time and location in specific regions where vaccine concerns were high.
   Interpretation Real-time monitoring and analysis of vaccine concerns over time and location could help immunisation programmes to tailor more effective and timely strategies to address specific public concerns.

AB  - The study examines the effect of female suicide attacks on foreign media framing of conflicts. Examining the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, 2,731 articles were sampled that covered terrorist events (American, British, and Indian press); 625 appeared in the week following a female's suicide attack, 97 reported an attack by a female perpetrator. The findings suggest that foreign media discourse around female suicide bombers promotes more messages about the society within which the terrorists are embedded. Since the coverage of female terrorists tends to provide more detailed information about the perpetrator, it focuses more on the terror organizations' side of the conflict's story.

AB  - Populations of large carnivores are declining globally, and analysis of public discourse about carnivores is useful for understanding public opinion and influences on management and policy. Portrayal of carnivores in the media affects public perceptions and support for their conservation. We conducted a content analysis of 513 articles about Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi) published from 2003 to 2006 in newspapers with local circulation in core panther habitat in southwest Florida and papers with statewide circulation to compare the differences in the amount of coverage and portrayals of panther risks to people and property on the basis of proximity of human communities to panthers. Local papers published significantly more news articles and significantly longer news articles primarily about panthers. Articles in local and statewide papers used both episodic frames, which focus on specific occurrences (e.g., a panther sighting or predation) and thematic frames, which focus on general trends (e.g., abundance of panthers over time). Local articles more often emphasized risks that panthers might harm people, pets, or livestock than statewide papers. Our results are consistent with theory that proximity to humancarnivore conflict influences perceptions and salience of risks posed by large carnivores. Most articles mentioned panthers as a secondary topic, which we believe was a result of the relevance an endangered carnivore has in discussions of public land management, development, and regulations in Florida. Claims made by sources quoted in each article had a neutral to positive depiction of panthers, and most quotations were from federal and state agency scientists. We suggest continued use by the media of agency sources provides the opportunity for clear, concordant messages about panther management. Content analysis provides a way to monitor media portrayal of carnivores for consistency with agency outreach goals.

AB  - Social network sites (SNS) facilitate the expression of users' opinions to a large audience. This research aimed to investigate whether the characteristics of this new media context strengthen the adaptation of opinions to the majority and lead to an internalization of the expressed views. Based on literature on public self-presentation and identity shifts, it was assumed that the publicness of and the identifiability within SNS elicit stronger expression effects than online forums or non-public settings. A between-subjects experiment (N = 302) varied the visible majority opinion on a news issue as well as the media context in which participants were asked to write down their opinion. Results showed significant adaptation effects to the majority (positive vs. negative comments) across media contexts. The internalization of attitudes was stronger in SNS groups with a more relevant audience but also occurred in other settings. Consequences for the formation of public opinion are discussed.

AB  - A novel Corona virus (SARS-CoV-2), started in Wuhan China, caused an outbreak of viral pneumonia to subsequently spread throughout the world. Italy has been one of the most affected countries in the world and the increasing number of cases and deaths has created strong emotional reactions in people. This study has aimed at evaluating public attention to this emerging disease through the use of Google Trends. Public attention, measured as the volume of internet search activity, was correlated with Health Communication Strategies and official COVID-19 data. At the moment of the study analysis, Italy was by far the first country in terms of search volume for "coronavirus" and the highest peak of searches was reached on February 23, 2020. We have found that there was a correlation between public attention to coronavirus disease and communications from Public Health policies: we observed spikes in search volumes on the days of Presidential Decree publications. Furthermore, this attention was also correlated with Case Fatality Rate (CFR). Even if CFR data are continuously updated and can be affected by patient histories, the correlation found suggests that the increase in mortality has generated growing interest in the disease and its risk perception. This study shows that tracking searches through Google Trends as a public focus indicator is a useful tool for decision-makers in guiding communication strategies and should as well stimulate a more transparent media and policy making reporting.

KW  - public opinion
AB  - This essay discusses how Scottish newspapers covered the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. It suggests that, in a move away from the positions they had held in the previous decade, indigenous Scottish newspapers openly suggested there was a desire for change in the form of increased devolution. As this option was not on the ballot paper, most of them proposed that increased devolution could still be achieved inside the Union. The mediated debate in the press was not about traditional notions of national identity, but about pragmatic considerations affecting everyday life, such as the future of the economy and public services. Although most of the press in its majority did not support independence, it did not wholeheartedly endorse the status quo either.

AB  - The concept of 'social cohesion' has become an orthodoxy in governmental and academic discourse, augmenting the complex of progressive and liberal politics that have formed around the modern, multicultural and globally engaged nation-state. The reinvigoration of far-right politics is challenging this orthodoxy, at least inasmuch as these politics appear to be gaining traction through the strategic manipulation of increasing insecurity within these democratic states. This article examines these challenges conceptually and through an empirical case study. The case study examines the appearance in 2016 of Senator Elect Pauline Hanson on the ABC's Q&A television programme. The article examines Twitter discourses that were generated around the far-right senator's appearance on the broadcast programme. The article concludes that 'social cohesion' and its role in electoral, participative and deliberative democratic processes is a largely inadequate discursive buttress to the complex of language wars within which the concept is besieged.

AB  - The red, yellow, and green three-colored health code apps (HCAs) have been credited as an effective tool for the COVID-19 response in China, with a golden color added indicating vaccination status in spring 2021. Although the success of HCA as a public health intervention might have legitimized government or corporate surveillance, the scope and contour of post-pandemic HCA use remain unclear. Both officials and tech firms have been promoting broader post-pandemic HCA use for purposes beyond pandemic control. This research draws on theories on privacy, trust, and media engagement to investigate factors affecting Chinese public opinion on HCA's post-pandemic use. Original survey data were collected in 2021 from adult HCA users in two major Chinese cities: Wuhan where COVID-19 cases were first identified and Hangzhou where the first HCA was deployed. Results point to a majority for moderate post-pandemic HCA use, while almost four out of ten users support expansive HCA use and the voice for restricted or terminated use is tiny. Greater acceptance of HCA data use by various institutional stakeholders, greater institutional trust, greater engagement with COVID-19 related social media content increased the support for expansive use.

AB  - Based on a sample of the news report of CCTV News 30 during Beijing Olympics, this article analyses the key issues and spokesperson on four levels: frequency, framework of Olympic sports events report, public opinion and agenda. The conclusion is that Chinese television's Olympic-related reports took all factors into account in their agenda-setting: a focus on Chinese visuals, involvement in all areas - from the sports events to the organization. While the perspectives focused mainly on the sports themselves, they gradually shifted towards the humanistic connotation of the Olympic spirit, with the report content changing from monotony to diversity and traits from simply the country's glories to a combination with the athletes' personal expressions.

The results suggest that both newspapers used three frames most frequently: military-conflict frame, prognostic frame, and human-interest frame. The findings also show that both newspapers published news stories with more neutral tones than with positive and negative tones. The New York Times and The Times (London) relied mostly on official sources as their primary sources.

AB  - How can authoritarian regimes effectively control information to maintain regime legitimacy in times of crisis? We argue that media framing constitutes a subtle and sophisticated information control strategy in authoritarian regimes and plays a critical role in steering public opinion and cultivating an image of competent government during a tremendous crisis. Using structural topic models (STM), we conduct a textual analysis of more than 4,600 news reports produced by seven Chinese media outlets during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that Chinese media, instructed by the propaganda authorities, used a heroism frame to feature frontline medics' sacrifices when saving others in need and resorted to a contrast frame to highlight the poor performance of the United States in the fight against COVID-19. We also show that both state and commercial media outlets used these two frames, though the tone of commercial media coverage was generally more moderate than the state media version.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
LA  - English
AB  - The history of public relations has recently attracted the interest of critical media scholars. Edward L. Bernays, the author of several pioneering PR books, has profoundly influenced how critical scholars have conceived of public relations. Bernays deceptively claimed that Walter Lippmann provided the theory and that he provided the practice, creating the false impression that Lippmann was an apologist for PR. Lippmann actually denounced government and corporate publicity agents as propagandists and censors. Yet critical PR scholarship has uncritically accepted and amplified Bernays' misrepresentation. This article seeks to correct this error by comparing the key texts: Lippmann's Public Opinion (1922) and Bernays' Crystallizing Public Opinion (1923).

AB  - Social capital - resources that are available as a result of social relationships and connections - has been shown to be an important component across the various stages of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane. Additionally, research has shown that the importance of the different types of social capital - bonding, bridging, and linking - can vary as the disaster progresses from preparation, to the immediate aftermath, to long-term recovery. Yet, findings are not consistent regarding the impact of social capital on taking protective action (e.g., evacuation, shelter in home or community) following a hurricane warning. In this paper, we leverage an original survey of 1450 residents living in coastal communities in the Southeast and Gulf Coast regions of the United States to examine the role of social capital in stated behaviors in response to a hurricane warning. Additionally, we examine the stated likelihood of evacuating if advised to by close contacts (friends, family, and co-workers) and elite sources (emergency management officials, elected officials, and the media). We find that bonding social capital is associated with an increased likelihood to evacuate and shelter in home as well as an increased likelihood to listen to close contacts that encourage evacuation. In addition, we find that linking social capital is associated with an increased likelihood of evacuation if encouraged to by elite sources.

AB  - Twitter is a valuable resource for research because of its potential to provide insight into public opinion as well as to identify the most influential sources of information. Mixed-methods exploratory analysis was used to evaluate the discourse on Twitter regarding gifted education. The results of the quantitative analysis of the matrix of connections using NodeXL Pro indicate that gifted education Twitter is a cohesive network and that the top influencers are organizations and educational consultants. Sentiment analysis using Linguistics Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC2015, Pennebaker et al., 2015) software indicates that tweets related to gifted education have a mix of positive and negative emotive tone. The qualitative analyses suggest that gifted education professionals and parents engage in Twitter in similar ways to what has been described in past research: to share interesting articles and videos, to discuss current issues, promote one's ideas, and seek opportunities.

AB  - This paper studies how public attitudes towards reduced immigration, the signature policy of the far right Sweden Democrats, respond once the party increases their political representation at the local level. To identify causal effects, we use panel data from 290 municipal election districts and compare otherwise similar elections where the Sweden Democrats either barely win or lose an additional seat. We estimate that a one seat increase for this far-right, anti-immigration party decreases negative attitudes towards immigration by 1.8 or 4.1 percentage points (depending on which national survey we use), contrary to the party's policy position. Consistent with these attitudinal changes, we find suggestive evidence the Sweden Democrats lose the incumbency advantage experienced by other small parties in Sweden. Exploring possible mechanisms, we find evidence for higher politician turnover and a rise in negative newspaper coverage. These findings demonstrate that political representation can cause an attitudinal backlash as a fringe party and their ideas are placed under closer scrutiny. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article argues that the conventional conceptualization in political science of politics is problematic, that it is overly narrow and constrained. This is because it excludes a range of actions like satire and humour which have come to play an increasing role in inspiring and provoking powerful political emotions and in informing the political agenda. Drawing on the work of critical scholars, it is argued that emotion, ethics and art can be deeply political. Moreover, new forms of media have encouraged new-old forms of political action often at the hands of young people who hitherto have been marginalized from the public sphere. Digital technology enables the production of user-generated content, opening new spaces for information, the exchange of ideas and mobilization. This article highlights the work of the young German satirist Jan Bohmermann to demonstrate how expressive art is playing a major role in shaping public opinion, in contesting power elites and informing political debate. In short, I use Bohmermann's 2015 satire depicting Greco-German relations in the midst of a financial crisis and fears of loan defaults to argue for a broader understanding of politics that is inclusive of activities conventionally deemed non-rational.

AB  - In the "We the Media" era, the rules for forming social users' following relationships are complex. Links generated between two social user nodes are influenced by not only the structural information of their social network nodes but also the users' occupational environments, interests in opinions, topics, social psychology, etc. In the existing studies of link prediction in complex networks, predicting the possibility of link generation between two nodes that have not yet generated edges in a complex network is calculated mainly from the known network nodes and structural information. Such studies, in which the main predictors are the structural similarities among social nodes or user location nodes, cannot fully explore and utilize the social network node users' public opinion characteristics. To quantitatively identify the influence of different dimensions of public opinion factors on predicting links between social user nodes, we present a study on the prediction of social network links in "We the Media" networks. Starting with the characteristics of the elements found in public opinions on "We the Media" networks, in which public opinions are multidimensional and multilayered and possess multiple attributes, we built a multidimensional network model oriented towards the topology of public opinions on "We the Media" networks. Combined with an analysis of the driving factors in the formation of user-node relationships in social networks, we designed a prediction algorithm that works on multidimensional network links. Furthermore, we conducted an empirical analysis of social relationship prediction, whose effectiveness has also been compared with baseline methods such as the Common-Neighbourhood-Driven model, the Jaccard index, and the SimRank method. We chose the area under the curve (AUC) as the indicator of link prediction and evaluation using "We the Media" public opinion data from Weibo.com. The research findings of this paper can be summarized as follows: (1) The effectiveness of the multidimensional network link prediction algorithm is significantly higher than those of the baseline methods. (2) The prediction algorithm presented in this paper works on multidimensional network links and can evaluate the effects of different dimensions of public opinion factors on the prediction of user-node links in social networks.

AB  - Despite the steady increase in environmental provisions being included in trade agreements to address potential environmental risks associated with increased trade, growing public concern about environmental issues has given rise to major public protests against various trade agreements. However, facing the widespread backlash against the liberal international economic order, pro-trade leaders have yet to respond adequately to the public's concern over the potential implications of trade on the environment. A review of European Union (EU) officials' public communication on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership shows that trade advocates narrowly focus on the economic benefits of trade in their trade-related communication while paying little attention to the environmental impacts of the trade deal. This ignores an important aspect of the public discontent with economic globalization. This article argues that the pro-trade camp's failure to engage the public in an inclusive and transparent debate about the environmental effects of trade presents a missed opportunity that has triggered widespread resistance to trade liberalization. By studying the communication channel, this essay highlights the important role of information and dialogue as a potential response to the current public backlash against economic globalization.

AB  - Since Donald Trump's political campaign, Americans have appeared increasingly divided over public opinion issues and U.S. policies with the media seemingly reflecting these divisions. One of Trump's early initiatives was the "Muslim ban," which restricted visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries. Focusing on the portrayal of Muslims in over 900 hand-coded articles, our study uses multilevel modeling techniques to examine how newspapers changed their frames and claimsmakers in discussions about Muslims before and after Trump was elected. After the election, newspapers were more likely to include government claimsmakers and an immigration frame and were less likely to mention a radical terrorist leader or portray Muslims as violent. Trump's election and the ban may have ushered in a more sympathetic view of Muslims with more articles focused on them as victims of violence and negative expressions. Across counties, states, and newspapers and between the national versus local presses, we find almost no significant differences in how Muslims were portrayed.

AB  - This paper is an attempt to understand the significant increase in terrorism worldwide following the 9/11 Al-Quaida bombings which triggered the Bush Administration's "war on terror", leading to two wars and ultimately to the emergence of Daesh. I explore the motivation for social violence as terrorism, which can be carried out by the state or by its citizens, and look at how one man's freedom fighter is another's terrorist. The paper looks at why seemingly ordinary people are converted into 'homegrown' jihadists and how alienation and shame are the driving forces of violence. I give a selected overview of psychoanalytical ideas that try to make sense of the unconscious roots of aggression, hatred and violence. As terrorism is a social activity group analysis has an important contribution to make in understanding the violence of large groupings. The media has a crucial role to play as sensationalist coverage of violence provides terrorists with a free media platform. Both the media and terrorists need an audience and feed off each other. This paper will explore these themes.

AB  - Jane Austen (1775-1817) is not only a paradigmatic example in adaptation studies but also one of the most complex cultural phenomena of our times. The countless adaptations in various media and a seemingly never-ending interest in everything Austen-related have led to a popular construction of both Austen and her work that is equally defined by the existing body of adaptations and subsequent new recreations. Although academics in the field are now exploring this and other related phenomena, scholarly attention is rarely bestowed on the role of the screenwriter in the process. This article explores the importance of such role by considering Andrew Davies, whose work on Austen and in other heritage adaptations is proof of how one screenwriter's vision has contributed to the contemporary image of Austen. In particular, I focus my attention on Emma/Emma, whom Jane Austen reportedly described as 'a heroine no one but myself will much like' (1871/2016: 241). My article aims at discussing the importance of the screenwriter in modelling Emma's character to modern audiences. Especially known for BBC's Pride and Prejudice (1995), his work on ITV's Emma (1996) is just as meaningful and even more challenging, if less recognized. By analysing Davies' Emma/Emma I will argue how his interpretation influenced subsequent adaptations of the 1816 novel and heroine, thus reshaping them for a twenty-first-century audience.

AB  - European migration and border control has occupied a prominent spot on the European political agenda. The news media present the topic in a polarized fashion and reports conflicting viewpoints on how the European Union (EU) and national governments should address the issue. We argue that this conflict in news messages can have a polarizing effect on public perceptions regarding the EU's performance on this topic, and that this effect can be moderated by the valence of news messages. A two-wave online panel survey experiment was conducted on a representative sample of the Dutch population (n = 376). The results indicate that conflict reinforces and thus polarizes policy attitudes, whereas a message's valence can change people's attitudes, which reduces the attitudinal gap. The implications of these findings concerning European border control and migration are discussed in the final section of this paper.

AB  - During recent party congresses in China and Vietnam, two highly anticipated candidates for promotion were sidelined. In China, Bo Xilai was arrested for corruption and stripped of his party membership. In Vietnam, Nguyen Ba Thanh remained a provincial leader with little opportunity for promotion to the Politburo. Existing arguments about promotions under authoritarian rule are unable to explain these outcomes. In particular, both candidates were competent and well connected. This cuts contrary to the expectations of both performance-based promotion and factional promotion theories. We argue that these candidates were sidelined due to a previously under theorized factor in promotion contests-their ability to mobilize personal followings. Amidst a literature that has focused almost exclusively on infra-elite conflict, we argue that elite-mass linkages are critical. In particular, the public profile of top leaders is important for regime legitimacy and mobilization. However, when individuals become exceptionally well known they become threats to the single-party system. We test this argument on promotions in China's 18th Party Congress in 2012 and Vietnam's 11th Party Congress in 2011, using original data on Internet search queries and media coverage among contenders for promotion. Our approach offers new insights into the strategies authoritarian politicians use to stay afloat as well as the mistakes that sink them when competing for power under one-party rule.

AB  - Background: The public typically believes psychotherapy to be more effective than pharmacotherapy for depression treatments.This is not consistent with current scientific evidence, which shows that both types of treatment are about equally effective.
   Objective: The study investigates whether this bias towards psychotherapy guides online information search and whether the bias can be reduced by explicitly providing expert information (in a blog entry) and by providing tag clouds that implicitly reveal experts' evaluations.
   Methods: A total of 174 participants completed a fully automated Web-based study after we invited them via mailing lists.First, participants read two blog posts by experts that either challenged or supported the bias towards psychotherapy.Subsequently, participants searched for information about depression treatment in an online environment that provided more experts' blog posts about the effectiveness of treatments based on alleged research findings.These blogs were organized in a tag cloud; both psychotherapy tags and pharmacotherapy tags were popular.We measured tag and blog post selection, efficacy ratings of the presented treatments, and participants' treatment recommendation after information search.
   Results: Participants demonstrated a clear bias towards psychotherapy (mean 4.53, SD 1.99) compared to pharmacotherapy (mean 2.73, SD 2.41; t(173)=7.67, P<.001, d=0.81) when rating treatment efficacy prior to the experiment.Accordingly, participants exhibited biased information search and evaluation.This bias was significantly reduced, however, when participants were exposed to tag clouds with challenging popular tags.Participants facing popular tags challenging their bias (n=61) showed significantly less biased tag selection (F-2,F-168=10.61, P<.001, partial eta squared=0.112), blog post selection (F-2,F-168=6.55, P=.002, partial eta squared=0.072), and treatment efficacy ratings (F-2,F-168=8.48, P<.001, partial eta squared=0.092), compared to bias- supporting tag clouds (n=56) and balanced tag clouds (n=57).Challenging (n=93) explicit expert information as presented in blog posts, compared to supporting expert information (n=81), decreased the bias in information search with regard to blog post selection (F-1,F-168=4.32, P=.04, partial eta squared=0.025).No significant effects were found for treatment recommendation (Ps>.33).
   Conclusions: We conclude that the psychotherapy bias is most effectively attenuated-and even eliminated-when popular tags implicitly point to blog posts that challenge the widespread view.Explicit expert information (in a blog entry) was less successful in reducing biased information search and evaluation.Since tag clouds have the potential to counter biased information processing, we recommend their insertion.

LA  - English
KW  - SCIENCE
AB  - The Institute for Propaganda Analysis (IPA) advocated for "propaganda literacy" against the backdrop of rising nationalism before and during World War II (1937-1942). Through a historical analysis of unpublished archival papers, notes, correspondence, newspaper articles, and the Institute's publications, this article shows how the IPA raised awareness and highlighted the need for information literacy during a time that precedes modern attempts to promote critical thinking and counter one-sided views. Supported by a network of public opinion scholars, educators, and editors, these anti-propaganda efforts gained momentum. Initially, the IPA's monthly newsletter Propaganda Analysis and its educational programs, specialized leaflets, and publicity campaigns were received favorably by the public. But critics in government and the press attacked the IPA's platform. By early 1942, the IPA could neither overcome its financial struggles nor thwart social and political pressures to cede its work, perceived as "un-American" in light of the US's war mobilization.

AB  - This study aimed to estimate the multilevel determinants of modern contraceptive use among reproductive-age women living in six cities in Nigeria (Abuja, Benin, Ibadan, Ilorin, Kaduna, and Zaria). Data from cross-sectional surveys conducted between 2010 and 2011 were linked to provide information on five hierarchical levels of the Socioecological Framework. Multilevel logit models estimated the odds of modern contraceptive use among 9,473 non-pregnant married/cohabiting women aged 15-49 years living in 488 clusters. About 25 percent of the women reported using modern contraceptive methods at the time of survey. Individual-level factors found to have a positive association with modern contraceptive use were parity, family planning self-efficacy, and partner discussion about fertility desires while perception of negative attitudes from community member about contraceptive use was negatively associated with modern contraceptive use (p < 0.05). At the community level, media exposure to family planning messages and city of residence were significantly associated with modern contraceptive use in the studied sample (p < 0.05). The positive association between parity and modern contraceptive use was modified by the community's ideal family size. The results of this study support the evidence for multilevel interventions as a way to improve the prevalence of modern contraceptive use in urban Nigeria.

AB  - Water scarcity has prompted an increasing number of cities to look for non-conventional sources of clean water. One of these sources is reused water, or highly treated reclaimed or recycled wastewater, a worthy addition to the portfolio of water-resource alternatives that increasing cities are considering in view of demographic and environmental changes. In this paper, we analyse communications from the media, policymakers and utility managers on the technology used to produce reused water for potable purposes. The focus of our analysis is technology as a means for producing safe and reliable water supply in the long-term. Three places were selected because of their differing experiences with social acceptance: Singapore, Orange County (California, United States), and Queensland (Australia). We found distinct differences in the communications used in the three places, which we believe have strongly influenced public opinion on the provision of clean water through potable water reuse. In communicating technological innovations to the public, it is essential to also discuss the broader framework affecting reliable water supplies. In this light, planning, legal and regulatory frameworks, institutional coordination, financial sustainability, and operational aspects should also be communicated.

AB  - Purpose Tobacco prevention media campaigns are an important tool to address youth tobacco use. We developed a theory-based perceived message effectiveness (PME) Scale to use when vetting messages for campaigns. Methods Participants were a national sample of N=623 US adolescents (ages 13-17 years) recruited from a national probability-based panel. In an online experiment, we randomised adolescents to view tobacco prevention ads. All participants viewed an ad on smoking or vaping from the US Food and Drug Administration's The Real Cost campaign and a control video, in a random order. After ad exposure, we assessed PME using nine candidate items and constructs for convergent and criterion validity analyses. We used confirmatory factor analysis and examined information curves to select the scale items. Results A brief PME scale with three items (alpha=0.95) worked equally well for demographically diverse adolescents with different patterns of tobacco use. The Real Cost ads generated higher PME scores than the control videos for both vaping and smoking (convergent validity; p<0.05). Higher PME scores were associated with greater attention, fear, cognitive elaboration and anticipated social interactions (convergent validity; r=0.31-0.66), as well as more negative attitudes toward and lower susceptibility to vaping and smoking (criterion validity; r=-0.14 to -0.37). A single-item PME measure performed similarly to the three-item version. Conclusions The University of North Carolina PME Scale for Youth is a reliable and valid measure of the potential effectiveness of vaping and smoking prevention ads. Employing PME scales during message development and selection may help youth tobacco prevention campaigns deploy more effective ads.

AB  - How do public opinion signals affect political representatives' opinion formation? To date, we have only limited knowledge about this essential representative process. In this article, we theorize and examine the signaling strength of one type of societal signal: protest. We do so by means of an innovative experiment conducted among Belgian national and regional politicians. Elected officials were exposed to manipulated television news items covering a protest demonstration. Following Tilly's previously untested WUNC claim, four features of the event were manipulated: the demonstrators' worthiness, unity, numerical strength, and commitment. We argue that these protest features present elected officials with useful cues about what (a segment of) the public wants. We find that these cues affect elected officials' beliefs. The salience they attach to the protest issue, the position they take, and their intended actions all change as a consequence of exposure. The size of a protest event (numbers) and whether the protesters agree among themselves (unity) are the most persuasive protest factors. The effects of the protest signals come on top of strong receiver effects. We find no evidence that elected officials' predispositions moderate the effects of the protest features.

AB  - In the early days of social media, social scientists speculated that it could support democracy because large media conglomerates could not dominate it. Regarding climate change, research documents the influence of the fossil fuel industry in climate denial discourses in the traditional media. Therefore, a similar hope emerged that a more democratized platform would see less polarization in belief about climate change's scientific basis. However, online public opinion about climate change continues to be extremely polarized, and the social forces behind it are not well understood. Here, we examine the role of one proposed mechanism for the systemic polarization and spread of disinformation in online discourses - the automated social media bot. This article pioneers the use of bot detection software on climate change discussion on Twitter, using automated monitoring of 6.8 million tweets. We examine the period around the time of U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on June 1, 2017. We find that the announcement generated an immediate online social movement response with very low suspected bot presence. Prior to and afterwards, however, suspected bots were responsible for approximately 25% of original tweets. Additionally, we find that suspected bots were more frequent in some topic areas than others, including denialist discourses focused on research questioning the reality or importance of climate change.
   Key policy insights
   On an average day during our study period, automated bots produced an estimated one-quarter of all original tweets referencing climate change and global warming.
   Bots were more active in some discussion areas than others - including climate denialist messages.
   President Trump's announcement of the U.S.'s planned withdrawal from the Paris Agreement generated an immediate online social movement response with very low suspected bot presence.
   For social media to deliver on its promise of a decentralized and democratic forum, automated accounts need to be identified, marginalized, and removed.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to document conventional wisdom regarding publicity and its purported superiority to advertising, determine whether consumer scepticism of advertising endures, and compare skepticism of media with that of advertising. Across six decades, the four long-running textbooks reviewed herein exhibit striking continuity in their treatment of publicity - within and across editions. They assert that content in media is perceived by consumers to be objective, truthful, and credible because it is interpreted as news or editorial content; consumers trust news and editorial content more than advertising; and publicity is many times more powerful than advertising. Evidence suggests that consumers remain sceptical of advertising, exhibit increasing scepticism with regard to media, and perceive advertising practitioners and journalists as essentially equivalent with respect to honesty. A careful assessment of the efficacy of publicity is warranted as is an ethical evaluation of publicity as a covert marketing activity. These results serve as a reminder that the conventional wisdom conveyed in textbooks is often wrong at worst and lacks refinement at best.

AB  - Scientific policy advice is usually perceived as a formalized advisory process within political institutions. Politics has benefited from this arrangement because the science-based rationalization of policy has contributed to its legitimacy. However, in Western democratic societies, scientific expertise that is routinely mobilized to legitimate political positions has increasingly lost its power due to controversial expertise in the public sphere in particular within the mass media. As a consequence of the medialization of science, political decision makers are increasingly confronted with mass-mediated expertise. Empirical results of a qualitative survey among decision makers in the German political and administrative system, presented in this article, support the hypothesis that mass-mediated expertise has a significant impact on policy processes. Five functions of media coverage on science-based issues for policy making were identified. Mass-mediated expertise has therefore altered the established relations between scientific policy advisors and political decision makers and can be seen as informal policy advice complementing institutionalized advisory arrangements.

AB  - Throughout the 2008 Democratic primary, Senator Hillary Clinton, her supporters and advocates, feminist groups, and commentators accused the media of sexist coverage. Was Hillary Clinton treated differently in the media because of her gender? The authors attempt to answer this question by examining the forms of address that television newspeople use to refer to the Democratic primary candidates. The authors find that newspeople referred to Clinton more informally than her male competitors. This treatment stemmed from the gender of the broadcaster; males show gender bias in how they reference presidential candidates. The authors conclude with suggestions for addressing gender bias in news coverage.

AB  - A succession of media scandals and policy arguments in the UK in recent years has been integral to the construction of a so-called Muslim Problem'. Media and political attention paid to Muslims in British public life, across a vast and varied range of issues, suggests a social preoccupation that exceeds the security framing the War on Terror' once imposed. In this article, we develop and apply Slavoj Ziek's Lacanian theory of ideology to produce an original conceptual and analytic framework centred on the social functions served by, as well as the co-constitution of, anxiety and fantasy. We then apply this framework to explore three scandals relating to child sexual exploitation, halal meat and education. We show that the representations of British Muslims that these scandals entail are best understood as ideological fantasies, mobilized to suture traumatic gaps and conceal contradictions in wider social practices around such issues. We argue that the unrelenting media and political focus on myriad aspects of British Muslims' imagined lives is symptomatic of what Ziek calls an unbearable anxiety': Islamophobic ideological fantasies conjure a conceptual Muslim' to sidestep confrontation with the Lacanian Real' - antagonistic and anxiety-inducing structures and practices underpinning British society, of which we do not speak.

AB  - Although casual sex is increasingly socially acceptable, negative stereotypes toward women who pursue casual sex remain pervasive. For example, a common trope in television, film, and other media is that women who engage in casual sex have low self-esteem. Despite robust work on prejudice against women who engage in casual sex, little empirical work has focused on the lay theories individuals hold about them. Across six experiments with U.S. adults (N = 1,469), we found that both men and women stereotype women (but not men) who engage in casual sex as having low self-esteem. This stereotype is held explicitly and semi-implicitly; is not driven by individual differences in religiosity, conservatism, or sexism; and is mediated by inferences that women who have casual sex are unsatisfied with their mating strategy-yet the stereotype persists when women are explicitly described as choosing to have casual sex. Finally, the stereotype appears to be unfounded; across experiments, the same participants' sexual behavior was not significantly correlated with their self-esteem.

AB  - When a rumor breaks out in online social network (OSN), it can lead to significant negative impact on human society, especially in the context of public emergencies, such as pandemic. Toward restraining rumor outbreak in OSN, one of the effective containment measures is to block influential users to minimize the spread of rumors. However, most of previous efforts ignore the imbalance between the cost and effect of rumor suppression. To fill this gap, from the perspective of public opinion crisis, a dynamic rumor spread model called PISIR model is established, which takes into account the overall popularity and individual tendency of rumors. Based on this model, two rumor blocking algorithms considering outbreak threshold and user experience, called 1-Hop and 2-Hop RBOTUE algorithms, are proposed, respectively. In the algorithms, a hyperbolic discount effect-based user experience mode is introduced as the constraint to ensure the user experience in OSN, then the blocking strategy is implemented on the selected subset of nodes to keep the rumor spread scale always below the outbreak warning line. The experimental results in two synthetic networks and four real OSNs indicate that both 1-Hop and 2-Hop RBOTUE algorithms have lower rumor infection rate and require less number of blocked nodes, which means that proposed algorithms can achieve better blocking performance with less restraining cost of rumors in mainstream social networks, and the two algorithms also have different adaptability for different OSNs.

KW  - AWARENESS
AB  - Rationale: Many people overestimate the amount of alcohol that increases their risk of harm and so may not perceive any need to change their drinking behaviour. Several countries have developed low-risk drinking guidelines, yet awareness of these guidelines remains low. Furthermore, mass media campaigns about alcohol-related harms may have limited impact if people do not perceive their current consumption as potentially harmful. Integrating drinking guidelines into media campaigns about alcohol's harms can concurrently provide drinkers with information about low-risk drinking levels and compelling reasons to comply.
   Objective: Our aim was to build understanding of the effectiveness of messages about the long-term harms of drinking and low-risk drinking guidelines, by testing the mediating effects of estimates of harmful drinking levels and attitudes towards drinking alcohol on subsequent intentions and behaviours.
   Method: In an online experiment conducted in 2016, n = 1156 Australian adult monthly drinkers were randomly assigned to view advertisements for non-alcohol products (NON-ALC; control), advertisements featuring long-term harms of alcohol (LTH), or LTH advertisements plus a guideline message (LTH + G). Immediately following exposure, we measured estimates of harmful drinking levels and attitudes towards drinking alcohol. One week later, we measured intentions to drink less and behavioural compliance with the guideline.
   Results: Compared to NON-ALC advertisements, exposure to LTH + G advertisements increased (i) the proportion of respondents who correctly estimated harmful drinking levels, which in turn, strengthened intentions to drink less (42% of the total effect was mediated), and (ii) negative attitudes, which in turn, also increased intentions to drink less (35% mediated) and behavioural compliance (24% mediated). Compared to NON-ALC, LTH advertisements increased negative attitudes, which in turn strengthened intentions to drink less (53% mediated).
   Conclusions: When paired with effective alcohol harm reduction television advertisements, messages promoting low-risk drinking guidelines can increase drinkers' intentions to reduce their alcohol consumption and compliance with low-risk drinking guidelines.

TI  - TWEETING THE TV EVENT, CREATING PUBLIC SPHERICULES': AD HOC ENGAGEMENT WITH SBS'S GO BACK TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM - SEASON 2
T2  - MEDIA INTERNATIONAL AUSTRALIA
LA  - English
AB  - This article uses the example of the mediatisation of Season 2 of the Australian documentary-cum-reality TV series Go Back to Where You Came From, and the associated #GoBackSBS Twitter feed, to investigate how public opinions are shaped, reshaped and expressed in new hybrid media ecologies. We explore how social media tools like Twitter can support the efforts of a TV production; provide spaces through which the public can engage ad hoc with a public event, be informed, shape their opinions and share them with others; and thus open up new possibilities for public discourse to occur We suggest that new online public sphericules are emerging that provide spaces within which publics can engage with the cultural social and political realities with which they are confronted In this way, we highlight the importance of mundane communication to the shaping and constant reshaping of public opinion.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in health service utilization patterns and a rapid rise in care being delivered remotely. However, there has been little published research examining patients' experiences of accessing remote consultations since COVID-19. Such research is important as remote methods for delivering some care may be maintained in the future.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to use content from Twitter to understand discourse around health and care delivery in the United Kingdom as a result of COVID-19, focusing on Twitter users' views on and attitudes toward care being delivered remotely.
   Methods: Tweets posted from the United Kingdom between January 2018 and October 2020 were extracted using the Twitter application programming interface. A total of 1408 tweets across three search terms were extracted into Excel; 161 tweets were removed following deduplication and 610 were identified as irrelevant to the research question. The remaining relevant tweets (N=637) were coded into categories using NVivo software, and assigned a positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. To examine views of remote care over time, the coded data were imported back into Excel so that each tweet was associated with both a theme and sentiment.
   Results: The volume of tweets on remote care delivery increased markedly following the COVID-19 outbreak. Five main themes were identified in the tweets: access to remote care (n=267), quality of remote care (n=130), anticipation of remote care (n=39), online booking and asynchronous communication (n=85), and publicizing changes to services or care delivery (n=160). Mixed public attitudes and experiences to the changes in service delivery were found. The proportion of positive tweets regarding access to, and quality of, remote care was higher in the immediate period following the COVID-19 outbreak (March-May 2020) when compared to the time before COVID-19 onset and the time when restrictions from the first lockdown eased (June-October 2020).
   Conclusions: Using Twitter data to address our research questions proved beneficial for providing rapid access to Twitter users' attitudes to remote care delivery at a time when it would have been difficult to conduct primary research due to COVID-19. This approach allowed us to examine the discourse on remote care over a relatively long period and to explore shifting attitudes of Twitter users at a time of rapid changes in care delivery. The mixed attitudes toward remote care highlight the importance for patients to have a choice over the type of consultation that best suits their needs, and to ensure that the increased use of technology for delivering care does not become a barrier for some. The finding that overall sentiment about remote care was more positive in the early stages of the pandemic but has since declined emphasizes the need for a continued examination of people's preference, particularly if remote appointments are likely to remain central to health care delivery.

Algorithmic and qualitative textual analysis techniques are combined to uncover the ideologies and interests that structure the discourse and shape its outcome. The analysis reveals that U.S. media, irrespective of their perceived liberal or conservative orientation, treat users' online privacy as subservient to the business interests of technology companiesin line with the country's lax legal approach. The coverage is more diverse in Britain, where the legal concept of privacy is also more stringent.

AB  - In the last two decades, populist radical right (PRR) parties have been electorally very successful in Western Europe. Various scholars have argued that these parties share an ideological core that consists of a specific form of nationalism (nativism), in combination with two other attitudes (authoritarianism and populism). The aim of this research note is to assess whether this ideological core also exists as a consistent attitude among citizens. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the attitudes of Dutch citizens indicate that we can indeed speak of a consistent PRR attitude among the public. I also show that this attitude is strongly related to the probability of voting for the PRR Freedom Party (Partij voor de Vrijheid) of Geert Wilders.

AB  - Disapproval of others' beliefs and practices is an inevitable consequence of living with diversity, and the ability to tolerate, or put up with, these differences is crucial to maintain a functional society. Considering reasons to condone what one disapproves of is considered a key aspect of tolerance. Across three national samples (N = 1,708), the current research examines how recognizing arguments to support practices that one disapproves of increases tolerance. Studies 1-2 demonstrate that when participants generate arguments to support Muslim minority practices (Study 1) and Orthodox Protestant minority practices (Study 2), they disapprove of, they show increased tolerance towards such practices in society. In Study 3, the importance of considerations is experimentally extended by demonstrating that perceiving objectionable behaviour as more reasonable increases tolerance. Collectively, these studies demonstrate the importance of engaging in and perceiving reasonable considerations to enhance tolerance of dissenting beliefs or practices.

AB  - Purpose This study integrates the spiral of silence (SoS) theory and theory of planned behavior (TPB) by examining Facebook users' opinion expression avoidance, the reactions to dissenting views without revealing one's true opinion, in the context of political discussions. The present integrative approach provides a more comprehensive framework that expands our understanding of online opinion expression and withdrawal. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional online survey was employed, which rendered 348 valid responses from US college students (61.5% female; average age 19.11) recruited from a northeastern university. Findings The results categorized two sets of opinion avoidance strategies from six Facebook features. The intention to adopt "proactive avoidance strategies" (filtering out unwanted information) is positively related to descriptive norms and perceived self-efficacy, but negatively related to fear of isolation and perceived control of the urge to debate. Regarding the intention to employ "reactive avoidance strategies" (less obtrusive articulations), fear of isolation and attitudes toward opinion expression avoidance are positive determinants, whereas perceived control of the urge to debate again exerts a negative influence. Originality/value This study examines the growing variety of features that users adopt to avoid expressing their true opinion in reacting to dissenting views, updating our understanding of opinion circumvention in social media environment. As one of the few theoretically driven empirical investigations of SoS theory and TPB, the findings not only elucidate the significance of perceived behavioral control as the common ground in association with user adoption intention but also identify distinct qualities of the two sets of strategies that affect the likelihood of adoption. That is, proactive avoidance is more susceptible to normative influences, while reactive avoidance reflects user attitude and belief. This theoretical integration also helps identify diverse levels of intentions to strategically avoid opinion expression influenced by fear of isolation.

AB  - Reason-centered discussion of politics is an important route toward improving the quality of public opinion. This study examined predictors of reason-centered online discussion, including the use of a debate format with two sides displayed as opposing columns, as well as various characteristics of the post that initiates the discussion. A content analysis was conducted to examine 6,360 reply posts in 291 threaded discussions on Sina Weibo, one of China's most popular venues for online discussion. Results showed that debate format is greatly associated with a higher reasoning level of the corresponding threaded discussion, with opinion presence and multiple viewpoints playing a role as well. Moreover, debate format can elicit differences in the effects of initiating posts on the overall reasoning level of a threaded discussion. Implications for online discussion in the virtual sphere are discussed.

AB  - The Brexit referendum to leave the EU and Trump's success in the US general election in 2016 sparked new waves of discussion on nativism, nationalism, and the far right. Within these analyses, however, very little attention has been devoted towards exploring the transnational ideological circulation of Islamophobia and anti-establishment sentiment, especially amongst diaspora and migrant networks. This article thus explores the role of the Indian diaspora as mediators in populist radical right discourse in the West. During the Brexit referendum and Trump's election and presidency, a number of Indian diaspora voices took to Twitter to express pro-Brexit and pro-Trump views. This article presents a year-long qualitative study of these users. It highlights how these diasporic Indians interact and engage on Twitter in order to signal belonging on multiple levels: as individuals, as an imaginary collective non-Muslim diaspora, and as members of (populist radical right) Twitter society. By analysing these users' social media performativity, we obtain insight into how social media spaces may help construct ethnic and (trans)national identities according to boundaries of inclusion/exclusion. This article demonstrates how some Indian diaspora individuals are embedded into exclusivist national political agendas of the populist radical right in Western societies.

AB  - With the development of 4G networks and the popularity of mobile terminals, the public's way of expressing emotions and expressing opinions has been transferred from traditional information media to multimedia Internet platforms, which has promoted the dissemination of public information on multimedia networks into public view. The public through the APP software, smart phones, various types of mobile terminals portable, and quickly participate in the network public opinion information carried by Weibo, WeChat, forum and other media. This trend can be represented by various attributes, and those with objectivity and irrefutability provide the strongest evidence of the reality of an event. At present, scholars at home and abroad mostly use the quantitative characteristics of online public opinion texts as the basis for calculation to judge the situation and emotions of online public opinion. In this paper, information theory is introduced to the field of public opinion analysis, and S-info is defined and extended to E-info; the sum of E-info of an event shows the event trend, representing the emotional intensity and tendency and their changes over time. Based on this, a Weibo situational perception model is constructed. The dictionary method is used to calculate the emotion of the text, and is then combined with the Weibo situational perception model to analyze the sentimental trend. The model is used on a dataset of 1,448,188 Weibos, and the events were separately statistically analyzed. The sum of the E-info are collected and compared with the number of Weibos. From the comparison, key time points and emotional burst points of the event can be picked up clearly, revealing the novel characteristics of this model. Duplications and advertisements can be filtered out and the reality can be revealed, uncovering the objective and irrefutable attributes.

AB  - While the media industry may consider credibility its most valuable asset, scholars suggest there is a potential "dark side" to credibility: Perceptions of credibility of a source lead to selective exposure and selective avoidance, and both lead to increased fragmentation and polarization of social and political views. The link between credibility and selective exposure and avoidance has not received much academic attention, therefore this study employed a survey of politically interested Internet users during the 2008 presidential campaign to test the influence of credibility and reliance on selective exposure and avoidance after controlling for demographic and political factors. This study found little evidence of a dark side to credibility. Respondents who judge blogs as credible search for information that supports their point of view, as well as challenges their opinions.

AB  - In 2017, the Minhang District of Shanghai introduced sex offender registration. This reform attracted positive reactions on social media. Local governments in Jiangsu, Guangdong and Chongqing quickly followed the precedent. In 2019, the central government announced that it will establish national sex offender registries by 2022, although it limited the scope of registration to paedophiles. This study explores how this bottom-up reform unfolded and what implications it has in theory and practice. Based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of 2261 posts on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, this study reveals two major players in the current reform: the Chinese feminists who are pursuing a punitive agenda online (a phenomenon known as 'carceral feminism'), and the local governments that are eager to win the public's trust, although such trust is mainly reserved for the central authority in the Chinese political culture (a culture known as 'populist authoritarianism'). Drawing on the findings, this study pushes the discussion about Chinese penal policy beyond the dichotomy of 'penal professionalism' and 'penal populism'. It argues that while the influence of professionalism is evident in central-level policy making, local penal policies can be easily led by populist punitiveness. The latter deserves more academic attention. This study also takes a non-partisan approach to the feminist movements on Chinese social media. It reveals the class conflicts and regional inequality underlying the gender schism. The polarisation effect in online discussion is also highlighted, which alerts policy makers to the reliability of 'public opinion' online. (246 words).

AB  - A group of Zimbabwean bloggers formed a voluntary association (the Zimbabwe Online Content Creators-ZOCC) aimed at protecting the credibility of their online content against fake news by producing factual content. Like the media elsewhere in the world, Zimbabwean media have been influenced by the phenomenon of "post-truth", a term relating to the rise of an era in which emotions rather than facts seem to sway public opinion, and where populism overshadows basic principles of reason and veracity. Qualitative interviews with members of this Association sought to understand the value of membership of this group in reducing the circulation of disinformation and misleading content. Firstly, results show that to some extent the Association inculcated a sense of identity and belonging which bind members' commitment to the group's core values such as being balanced, independent, truthful, accurate and responsible. Mainstream media organisations, bloggers, vloggers and animators can use the power of their professional identity to coalesce as a buffer against fake news. However, this study noted that as the group is voluntary-based, it lacks authority and disciplinary power to enforce compliance with group norms, thereby running the risk that some members can violate the same values with impunity. Secondly, in Zimbabwe, there are strong relationships between the type of falsified and misleading news and the sociopolitical and economic context. Information might be published for its "feel good" effect (at the expense of its credibility and accuracy) in a context where democracy and economic prosperity are illusory to many.

AB  - This project employs 2008 National Election Study (NES) data to explore whether parents are different than nonparents in terms of their political attitudes and candidate evaluations. We find that parenthood does have political consequences although often not in ways suggested by conventional wisdom. Rather than finding parents to be a conservative group, our results support the idea that raising children has liberalizing effects on the attitudes of women. Fatherhood shapes attitudes less than motherhood, but these fewer effects are in a conservative direction. We argue that the distinctive politics of mothers and fathers reflects the impact of parenting as a gendered socialization experience combined with the contrasting parenthood themes articulated by the Republican and Democratic parties. Finally, despite media coverage suggesting Sarah Palin's "Hockey Mom" image would attract parents, especially mothers, to her candidacy and the Republican ticket we find no support for this idea.

AB  - Throughout the world, cities seek to ease transport-related problems of congestion, air pollution, noise, and traffic injuries. Urban transport planners have welcomed e-scooters as an alternative to motorized individual transport, specifically the car. The public has met e-scooters with both enthusiasm and scepticism, as cities have struggled with unforeseen outcomes such as forms of irresponsible riding, cluttering, or vandalism. This paper investigates the challenges associated with the introduction of e-scooters in ten major cities, based on a content analysis of local media reports. News items (n = 173) were identified through Internet searches and include print media, TV and radio websites. Concerns prior to and after the introduction of e-scooters are assessed, analysed, and interpreted in the context of new policies for this transport mode. Results suggest that many cities have moved through trial and error stages in their search for appropriate legislation. The paper concludes that it is prudent for urban planners to introduce policies regarding maximum speeds, mandatory use of bicycle infrastructure, and dedicated parking, as well as to limit the number of licensed operators. Where negative public opinion can be averted, e-scooters stand a chance to become a disruptive niche innovation with the potential to transform urban transport systems.

AB  - In his 2004 presidential campaign, John Kerry, a Catholic, was threatened with being denied Holy Communion because of his pro-choice voting record. This article investigates the extent to which communion denial impacted Catholic elected officials and analyzes public attitudes regarding communion denial for Kerry. The results of our analysis suggest that, despite heavy media coverage, few bishops endorsed the communion denial and few pro-choice Catholic officials were threatened. While the data also indicate there are meaningful political implications for public attitudes on communion denial, the tactic does not command support from many Catholics.

TI  - Politics Versus Place? The Relative Influence of Partisanship, Ideology, and Connection With Israel on Support for the Iran Nuclear Agreement
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - Analyzing data from the LA Jewish Journal Survey conducted in July 2015 (N = 501), the study empirically examines the relative influence of politics versus place on support for the Iran Nuclear Agreement among members of the American-Jewish community. The results suggest that personal politics, or identifying as a Democrat and holding liberal political views, has the largest impact on support for the Iran Nuclear Agreement. Place, or having been to Israel, has the largest influence on opinion strength or supporting or opposing the deal rather than maintaining a position of ambivalence. The strategic implications of these findings for key stakeholders, including politicians, ethnic news media organizations, and lobbying groups, are discussed.

AB  - Background: Pharmaceutical firms are striving to find potential treatments to prevent and treat COVID-19. One of the gold standards to evaluate treatment is a clinical trial; however, the difficulty in patient recruitment could act as a determinant. It is evident from the registry data that very few studies have been conducted involving the population of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
   Aim: To document knowledge, perception, and attitude of the public from Two large countries in the MENA region (Egypt and Saudi Arabia) towards participation in clinical trials focused on evaluating potential COVID-19 treatments.
   Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted that used a snowball sampling strategy for recruitment. General population 18 years old or older, who lived in Saudi Arabia or Egypt were invited. The survey was adopted from literature and was approved by an ethics committee.
   Results: Out of 800 participants in the survey, 407 participants were from Egypt, and 393 were from Saudi Arabia. Most participants (48%) had moderate knowledge, i.e., >60% <80%. The results revealed poor attitude (88.5%) and poor perceptions (45.8%) regarding participation in COVID-19 clinical trials. Education and residence were identified as determinants of participants' knowledge, attitude, and perceptions. Participants' knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 trials did not impact their willingness to participate. This coupled with a poor attitude and perception among the masses drastically affects any potential for participation in future clinical trials.
   Conclusion: A relatively small proportion of participants were interested in enrolling in COVID-19 studies. Increased collective engagement through social media and healthcare professionals can help improve attitudes and perceptions toward trial participation. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction and Aims Since 2011, the Israeli Ministry of Health has been working towards increased regulation of its medical cannabis (MC) program by ensuring that MC licensing procedures adhere to the basic principles and practices of the medical profession. The aim of this study is to examine trends in MC licensing in Israel during this period of increasing MC regulation. Design and Methods Publicly available data on MC licences, collected by the Ministry of Health, were used to examine trends between 2013 and 2018. The number of MC licences, new MC licence requests and rate of MC licence requests accepted were plotted over time. Gender and age distributions and the medical indicators for which MC licences were approved were also examined. Results Absolute numbers of MC licences and MC licence requests increased during the study period while no parallel increase in the rate at which new MC licences were granted was observed. MC licences for post-traumatic stress disorder increased substantially during the study period. The majority of MC patients in Israel are male, over the age of 40, and used MC for chronic pain. Conclusions The observed increase in MC licences is likely driven by an increase in patient demand. This study suggests that social forces (e.g. positive media reporting and public attitudes towards MC), beyond MC regulation, are influencing trends in MC licensing in Israel. Studies that examine the skewed gender distribution of MC licences, and the efficacy of MC for post-traumatic stress disorder, are urgently needed.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare the public's contradictory views about public education. At the beginning of the pandemic, Maria Ferguson explains, they were lauded as heroes for keeping kids connected after school buildings closed. But when schools were slower to reopen than many parents wanted, they were excoriated for selfishly protecting their own interests. Much of the public's criticism was leveled at unions, which resisted reopening school buildings if their members could not be protected from the coronavirus. Blaming unions is not new, says Ferguson, but everyone involved in public education is responsible for its outcomes.

AB  - Background There is an ongoing debate about harm and benefit of e-cigarettes, usage of which has rapidly increased in recent years. By separating non-commercial (organic) tweets from commercial tweets, we seek to evaluate the general public's attitudes towards e-cigarettes.
   Methods We collected tweets containing the words 'e-cig', 'e-cigarette', 'e-liquid', 'vape', 'vaping', 'vapor' and 'vaporizer' from 23 July to 14 October 2015 (n=757 167). A multilabel Naive Bayes model was constructed to classify tweets into 5 polarities (against, support, neutral, commercial, irrelevant). We further analysed the prevalence of e-cigarette tweets, geographic variations in these tweets and the impact of socioeconomic factors on the public attitudes towards e-cigarettes.
   Results Opinions from organic tweets about e-cigarettes were mixed (against 17.7%, support 10.8% and neutral 19.4%). The organic-against tweets delivered strong educational information about the risks of e-cigarette use and advocated for the general public, especially youth, to stop vaping. However, the organic-against tweets were outnumbered by commercial tweets and organic-support tweets by a ratio of over 1 to 3. Higher prevalence of organic tweets was associated with states with higher education rates (r=0.60, p<0.0001), higher percentage of black and African-American population (r=0.34, p=0.01), and higher median household income (r=0.33, p=0.02). The support rates for e-cigarettes were associated with states with fewer persons under 18 years old (r=-0.33, p=0.02) and a higher percentage of female population (r=0.3, p=0.02).
   Conclusions The organic-against tweets raised public awareness of potential health risks and could aid in preventing non-smokers, adolescents and young adults from using e-cigarettes. Opinion polarities about e-cigarettes from social networks could be highly influential to the general public, especially youth. Further educational campaigns should include measuring their effectiveness.

AB  - This study investigates priming effects during the global financial crisis that erupted in September 2008. Using two longitudinal data sources on public opinion dynamics in Sweden between 2007 and 2010, we find no evidence of a basic priming hypothesis. Drawing upon the distinction between accessibility and applicability mechanisms, however, additional analysis indicates that priming of economic considerations was moderated by citizens' attributions of responsibility for current economic developments. These results support the notion of priming as a two-step process, whereby heavy news coverage of the financial crisis increases the accessibility of economic considerations among the audience, but whether these considerations are used in government approval assessments depends on their perceived applicability as well.

AB  - Many scholars argue that the media can influence parliamentarians though the extent of that influence is hotly debated. There is some evidence that the relationship is two way, with politicians taking note of salient media stories but using the media to communicate with their constituents. It is also apparent that, whilst the media may have a role in drawing attention to specific issues, politicians in Kenya do not entirely trust it and thus use a wide range of other sources including government agencies as well as third party sources such as interest groups. This article addresses two gaps in our knowledge-the extent to which parliamentarians in Kenya turn to unofficial sources for information and public opinion, especially interest groups, and the extent to which the media in particular influences parliamentarians in Kenya. The results suggest that parliamentarians in Kenya rely to some extent on both the media and interest groups and that the media is good at raising awareness and stimulating action but that it has only a modest effect on political actions.

AB  - Our study examines how a company's engagement in corporate social responsibility (CSR) influences word of mouth (WOM) about the company on Twitter, particularly during a service delay. We use the airline industry as the study context. On the popular social medium Twitter, people post tweets about airline services and raise concerns about service delays when flights are delayed, canceled, or diverted. Drawing on the literature on legitimacy and the halo effect, we argue that a company's CSR engagement enhances its corporate image, which in turn, influences WOM about the company on Twitter. We predict and find that airlines with better CSR engagement receive more positive word of mouth (PWOM) and less negative word of mouth (NWOM) on Twitter. We also find that service delays reduce PWOM and increase NWOM, with the additional finding that the positive relationship between service delays and NWOM is less strong for airlines with better CSR engagement. We conduct additional analyses to investigate the effects of environmental, social, and governance CSR on PWOM and NWOM. Our study has practical implications in informing companies about the benefits of CSR engagement in relation to public opinion during service delays.

AB  - This article first introduced the current technology of the privacy protection model, and analyzed their characteristics and deficiencies. Afterwards, from the point of view of revenue, the shortcomings of the traditional privacy protection model have analyzed through the group intelligent computing method. Based on this, this paper proposes a research and application of virtual user information of security strategy based on group intelligent computing, through the collection of visitor's private information historical access data, intelligent calculation of the strategy group between the visitor and the interviewee. The setting of the threshold of the visited person can protect the privacy information of the user more effectively. In this paper, the implementation flow, algorithm implementation process, and specific architecture design of the proposed virtual user of privacy protection model based on group intelligent computing are introduced respectively. The specific algorithms include PCA, BP neural network, and genetic algorithm. Finally, the proposed privacy has verified through experiments. Protection model can protect user privacy more effectively than traditional privacy protection model. In the future, we will further expand and improve the privacy protection model of virtual users based on group intelligent computing, including considering the dynamic and inconsistency of access to the privacy information, that is, accessing different private information will produce different overlay effects and parallelism. We will also study how to apply this model to actual systems such as shopping websites and social platforms, and use commercial data to evaluate the performance of the model and further improve it.

AB  - We conducted pooled time-series analyses to assess how number and size of demonstrations affect the political agenda in Belgium (1993-2000). Taking twenty-jive issues into account, this study finds that protest matters for the political agenda setting. This study also advances scholarly understanding of the agenda-setting power of protest by showing that the causal mechanisms of impact are complex and contingent. The parliamentary. governmental, and legislative attention for issues is significantly and differently affected by preceding protest activities. The media act as an intermediary variable: media coverage emerges in response to protest and, in turn, affects the political agenda afterwards. Protests on some issues have more effect than on others: in Belgium, new social movements protests are especially effective in causing parliament and government to focus attention on the issue.

AB  - Sentiment analysis has applications in diverse contexts such as in the gathering and analysis of opinions of individuals about various products, issues, social, and political events. Understanding public opinion can help improve decision making. Opinion mining is a way of retrieving information via search engines, blogs, microblogs and social networks. Individual opinions are unique to each person, and Twitter tweets are an invaluable source of this type of data. However, the huge volume and unstructured nature of text/opinion data pose a challenge to analyzing the data efficiently. Accordingly, proficient algorithms/computational strategies are required for mining and condensing tweets as well as finding sentiment bearing words. Most existing computational methods/models/algorithms in the literature for identifying sentiments from such unstructured data rely on machine learning techniques with the bag-of-word approach as their basis. In this work, we use both unsupervised and supervised approaches on various datasets. Unsupervised approach is being used for the automatic identification of sentiment for tweets acquired from Twitter public domain. Different machine learning algorithms such as Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Maximum Entropy and Support Vector Machines are applied for sentiment identification of tweets as well as to examine the effectiveness of various feature combinations. In our experiment on tweets, we achieve an accuracy of 80.68% using the proposed unsupervised approach, in comparison to the lexicon based approach (the latter gives an accuracy of 75.20%). In our experiments, the supervised approach where we combine unigram, bigram and Part-of-Speech as feature is efficient in finding emotion and sentiment of unstructured data. For short message services, using the unigram feature with MNB classifier allows us to achieve an accuracy of 67%.

AB  - Communication in social media is increasingly being found to reproduce or even reinforce ethnic prejudice and hostility toward migrants. In Russia of the 2010s, with its world's second largest immigrant population, polls have detected high levels of hostility of the Russian population toward migranty (migrants), a label attached to resettlers from Central Asia and the Caucasus. We tested the online hostility hypothesis by using the data of 363,000 posts from the Russian-language LiveJournal. We applied data mining, regression analysis, and selective interpretative reading to map bloggers' attitudes toward migranty, among other ethnicities and nations. Our findings significantly alter the picture drawn from the polls: Migranty neither provoke the biggest amount of discussion nor experience the worst treatment in Russian blogs, in which Americans take the lead. Furthermore, Central Asians and North Caucasians are treated very differently.

AB  - Social networks are nowadays an influential tool in the hands of the centres of political power because of their possibilities for direct and two-way communication with citizens in real time, dissemination of information, or a self-promotion and marketing. The use of social networks in the political context has become extremely important in the analysis and prediction of elections and generally in monitoring activities of politicians and public opinion. In this paper, we provide a content analysis of Facebook activities of leading European Union (EU) politicians to generate their extended individual profiles. Based on these profiles, a comparative analysis between the European Commissioners (i.e., EU ministers) and Croatian ministers is provided showing certain unexpected differences in their online behaviour. Summarizing these results, a model for prediction of online political behaviour is proposed.

AB  - Using low information rationality, citizens can compensate for their lack of political knowledge by turning to experts to help interpret and economize information. However, citizens must navigate a political media environment that is oversaturated with unqualified sources and competing cues, leading some scholars to question whether individuals are willing or able to utilize low-information rationality effectively. Much prior work focuses on partisan motivated reasoning, asserting that the influence of partisanship overwhelms that of other relevant informational cues. This is refuted by a relatively smaller subset of works, finding that the influence of partisanship is often diminished by contextual cues. I address this debate with two experimental designs that place source cues in a competing context by simultaneously manipulating expertise-related cues and partisan cues. I find that individuals do take source expertise and credibility into account, even when confronted with competing partisan source cues, helping to somewhat mitigate partisan biases.

AB  - Rumors are an important factor affecting social stability in some special times. Therefore, the dissemination and prevention and control mechanisms of rumors have always been issues of concern to the academic community and have long been highly valued and widely discussed by experts and scholars. However, in combination with the Internet as a new type of media, although people have begun to pay attention to online rumors, research on it is still relatively fragmented, especially in the cross-domain research specific to the social influence of online rumors, and there is no clear indication of online rumors. The specific definition also did not analyze in detail the internal connection between its influence and group behavior. Therefore, this article will combine actual cases to explore and analyze the spread and influence process of online rumors and show its social influence, hoping to enrich the research of online rumors. Nowadays, the Internet has become the most important carrier to reflect the public grievances. Internet users have expressed their opinions on hot issues such as enterprises, people's livelihood, and government management, which has formed a powerful public opinion pressure, which has far exceeded the traditional media. The hidden dangers of security cannot be ignored. Therefore, how to monitor network public opinion from a large amount of network data is a difficult problem that needs to be solved urgently. Firstly, this consists of four modules: information collection, web page preprocessing, public opinion analysis, and public information report. Secondly, text clustering, the core technology of network public opinion, is optimized, and single-pass algorithm based on double threshold is proposed. Then the dual-threshold single-pass algorithm is optimized based on the MapReduce parallel computing model, and finally a network public opinion collection technology is formed under the background of big data. Simulation results can greatly improve the performance of text clustering and can effectively optimize the design using the parallel computing model based on MapReduce. The average miss rate after optimization is 0.7569 times, the average false alarm rate is 0.5556 times, and Cdet is 0.5714 times. It proves that the collection technology based on machine learning under the background of big data is effective and has good performance.

AB  - Context: Misperceptions are a major problem in debates about health care reform and other controversial health issues.
   Methods: We conducted an experiment to determine if more aggressive media fact-checking could correct the false belief that the Affordable Care Act would create "death panels." Participants from an opt-in Internet panel were randomly assigned to either a control group in which they read an article on Sarah Palin's claims about "death panels" or an intervention group in which the article also contained corrective information refuting Palin.
   Findings: The correction reduced belief in death panels and strong opposition to the reform bill among those who view Palin un-favorably and those who view her favorably but have low political knowledge. However, it backfired among politically knowledgeable Palin supporters, who were more likely to believe in death panels and to strongly oppose reform if they received the correction.
   Conclusions: These results underscore the difficulty of reducing misperceptions about health care reform among individuals with the motivation and sophistication to reject corrective information.

AB  - Citizens' social policy opinions are strongly influenced by a simple heuristic: Are the recipients of social benefits deserving or not? Adding to this growing literature, we provide evidence that the deservingness heuristic does not treat all social benefits alike. Already at the level of preconscious processing, the heuristic displays a bias toward tagging the recipients of health carethat is, sick individualsas deserving. This powerful, implicit effect overrides other opinion factors and produces broad-based support among the public for health careacross levels of self-interest, media frames, ideological divides, and national cultures. In contrast, when the deservingness heuristic is utilized for reasoning about unemployment benefits, implicit psychological constraints are fewer and political conflict erupts depending on differences in interest and worldviews. Using a variety of methodologies, we track this fundamental difference between the politics of health care and unemployment benefits from the level of implicit processing to the level of political attitudes.

AB  - This study develops a model for analyzing the flow of frames and the multiple levels of framing effects in Chinese crisis communication both online and offline. To investigate the convergence and/or divergence of traditional media and social media in framing a crisis event in China, the study uses the sample of a celebrity scandal case that received extensive attention both online and offline. The empirical findings showed that crisis communicative strategies (CCSs), that is, the frames used in crisis communication, were correlated with those used in newspaper coverage (i.e. frames in representation) but were not correlated with the CCSs used by the online public (i.e. frames in thoughts). Specific and defensive CCSs, such as attacking the accusers and denial, led to fewer favorable responsibility-oriented frames than ambiguous strategies, such as excuses and justification. This finding supports the assumptions of classic situational crisis communication theory. However, none of the above-mentioned CCSs significantly predicted the relationship-oriented frames in thoughts. Relationship-oriented frames were found to be a predictor of the valence of online public opinion whereas no CCS was observed to be influential in the online public opinions expressed by social media users.

AB  - Academic research on the White Australia Policy has spanned the history of Asian migration and policy-making initiatives in Australia. However, the role of popular transnational media images and stories of the past that inform the socio-cultural understanding of Australia-India cross-cultural relations has been under evaluated. In this paper, using unexplored archival material from popular newspaper reports and columns, I will examine the 'goodwill visits' of two Indian journalists, K. K. Lalkaka and Sir R. Srinivasa Sarma, to Australia in 1927 and 1947. By assessing the role of these two journalists, this paper will highlight transnational issues such as migration, ethnicity, race, class and trade between the two countries. Borrowing from Vineet Thakur's research highlighting the role of first diplomats in the pre-independence era India, this article will contribute to the field of history in Indian diplomatic studies and historiography of Australian-Indian cross-cultural relations.

AB  - Social media is an increasingly prominent platform for sharing information about current social issues. In the recent case of the fatal shooting of unarmed Black teenager Michael Brown by a White police officer in 2014, social media was a major influence in the mobilization of social movements including Black Lives Matter (BLM). This study explores the relationship between the use of social networking (SN) websites for policing-related content, beliefs about inequality, and engagement in racial justice movements. Students at a large university (N = 539) completed an online survey that measured social attitudes focused on policing, inequality, and social movements. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses tested the effects of individuals' awareness of oppression and privilege, and SN site use on both (1) support and (2) participation in racial justice movements. Results found that SN website use for policing information was positively related to both support and participation in protests and BLM. Further, in predicting support for protests, this relationship was stronger for individuals who were higher in awareness of oppression and privilege, compared to those who were lower. This study highlights the importance of understanding how social beliefs interact with SN site use to impact social justice engagement.

AB  - Objective: Public attitudes and stigma toward epilepsy may limit patient motivation for treatment and participation in social activities. Stigma research requiring individuals to report personal beliefs is useful but is subject to social desirability bias. Self-reporting methods often do not capture implicit attitudes; therefore, in this study, implicit stigma was measured using the implicit association test (IAT), which is a word sorting task to minimize this bias. Recently, in Japan, several serious car accidents caused by people with epilepsy (PWE) resulted in pedestrian fatalities. Traffic accidents involving PWE have been reported extensively and repeatedly in the media since 2011. The present study aimed to examine differences in implicit stigma toward epilepsy among medical students in 2010, 2013, and 2016.
   Methods: We recruited 41 medical students in 2010, 44 medical students in 2013 and 42 medical students in 2016. We investigated the strength of conceptual associations between the words "Epilepsy" or "Hypertension", and "Safety" or "Danger" in the IAT.
   Results: The association between the words "Epilepsy" and "Danger" was stronger in 2013 compared with that in 2010; however, the association was weaker in 2016 compared with that in 2013. There was no significant difference between 2010 and 2016.
   Conclusion: The change in IAT results between 2010 and 2013 might be due to the traffic accident involving PWE in Japan. However, the result in 2016 might indicate that the implicit attitudes toward epilepsy were improved to the same level as those in 2010. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Communication strategies involving news media and environmental groups are well documented and research into protest politics and other forms of environmental communication has made considerable progress in the analysis of the strategies that various actors use to influence environmental policy. There is less scholarship, however, on the journalistic representation of the legal strategies employed by environmental non-government organizations, such as the mediatized debates about the use of law by these groups and the laws themselves. Further, while legal scholarship observes the role of public interest litigation in environmental matters, the role of news media as an influential force in public opinion formation and mobilization in the context of environmental litigation as an activist strategy remains less understood. Using the 2015 green lawfare debate in Australia that followed a successful Australian Federal Court challenge to a coalmine, this paper argues that the mediatized visibility inherent in public interest litigation is an important, but mostly overlooked, element of mediatized environmental conflict.

AB  - Misinformation has always existed and has been promoted by groups of individuals, who share the same interests, in order to reach ideological, political or financial goals. In recent years, the emergence of the Internet and social platforms has opened a new and larger dimension in the dissemination of false content and information. With the help of these new technological means, the process of manipulation has evolved and reached a new level which materialized in the concept of fake news. The negative effects associated with this phenomenon have aroused interest among specialists, who are striving to find efficient instruments in order to combat the dissemination of fake information.
   In this context, I have developed a scoring model for the detection of fake news, which aims to combat the spreading of false information regarding specialized economic sectors, such as the energy field. Moreover, the model could also be implemented as an important instrument in the fighting against this negative phenomenon that can affect the way public figures, institutions, companies or industries are being perceived by the public opinion.

AB  - Computational technologies have vastly replaced our prior modalities of information seeking. Social media platforms have become the first choice of many information seekers. Increasingly, these platforms are also becoming vehicles for coordinated, manipulative disinformation campaigns. These campaigns of computational propaganda have resulted in an information environment in which the assignment of authority and trust in information sources has become increasingly opaque. This epistemic process of information evaluation has increasingly become the purview of automated algorithmic systems that we as human beings tend to falsely implicitly trust to provide us with the most accurate information available. Propagandists have begun to exploit the algorithmic components of these systems as well as human cognitive deficits in order to manipulate public opinion, control the narrative of public discourse, and flood our information ecosystems in order to work towards the manufacture of false consensus on a wide range of political and cultural issues. This work aims to review and synthesize the literature on computational propaganda, how it manipulates our human cognitive deficits, and how information literacy can be utilized in order to correct for the resultant epistemic failure.

AB  - Given that public opinion about a company's performance during a crisis is highly influenced by the way news media cover crisis events, studies that look at news media's choice of crisis issues, tones and frames are extremely valuable. This paper presents the main findings of a study on how the Italian and international press framed the Italian national airline Alitalia and its crisis in 2008 before its privatization. This study is based on content analysis of news articles published in 2008 in two Italian and two international newspapers. Comparisons of crisis issues, tones and frames between the Italian and international press are made. Implications and recommendations for crisis managers are discussed as well as directions for further research. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Preserving a common public agenda positively affects social integration, minimizing social cleavages and polarization. Although social media are known for fragmenting the media environment, research has not devoted much attention to their effect on the public agenda. This article addresses whether consuming news through Facebook shapes individual agendas that diverge from the set of most important problems (MIPs) as perceived by the general public. Our research design combines survey and Web-tracking data to analyze how Facebook-referred news consumption influences individual consumers' agendas. We find that when Facebook is a relevant news referral, people are less likely to mention the top MIPs for a representative sample of the Spanish population. We discuss the implications of our findings for the public agenda.

AB  - Drawing on two experiments embedded in online surveys, this article examines the impact of news photos on support for military action. In 2011, respondents were asked about support for ongoing military involvement in Afghanistan while being randomly exposed to one of two photosone of a soldier with a child, the other of a soldier with a gun. The former photo increased expressed support for war; and the effect was greater for those who self-identify as being very interested in international affairs. Three years later, a follow-up experiment was fielded that looked both at the past intervention in Afghanistan and ongoing interventions in Syria; results were very similar. Both experiments speak to the potentially profound role of mass media in generating support (or not) for foreign military engagements, and the increased impact of frames on those who are more attentive to the issue domain.

KW  - Feminist Close Reading
AB  - While it may be thought that disinformation and 'fake news' are concepts related to contemporary mass media, they are, indeed, much older concerns that have always been part of our society, tracing a media craze path and noticeably blooming nowadays due to the power of the media. This is why it is essential to cultivate critical thinking when approaching journalistic discourses. In this contribution we will employ feminist close reading methods (Lukic and Sanchez, 2011) to examine examples of how newspapers and public opinion can influence and deform a story. We will take Margaret Atwood's Alias Grace (1996) as a case study in order to approach to what an extent its main character is influenced by conflictive opinions which finally determine the performance of her identity. Is being aware of public opinion enough to grant this character control over the self-construction of her image? The conclusions of this paper will include some considerations regarding the use of critical tools such as feminist close reading in the classroom. The case of Alias Grace exemplifies the negative effects of disinformation and ultimately illustrates the transformative potential of critical rewritings of official "HIStories(2)".

AB  - The aim of the authors is to respond to the growing demands on the intercultural competence of university teachers due to intensified internationalization pressures on higher education, especially due to the growing number of students and teachers' international exchanges. They report on an intercultural course design responding to this need, presenting a case study from Slovakia. First, they define the need of intercultural competence of university teachers, especially those teaching in English-medium study programmes. Then they share a) findings from a needs analysis preceding the design of a new curriculum for an intercultural competence course (ICC) at Matej Bel University (MBU) with three aims (development of linguistic, cultural and pedagogic competences); and b) results from action research during piloting the ICC course. A comparison of 2011 and 2018 surveys pointed to the growing dominance of the English language, including an increasing command of English by MBU teachers. The ICC curriculum, tailored to the pre-identified teachers' needs, proved to be a feasible way of facilitating their intercultural competence. Its implementation revealed persistent prejudices and difficulties associated with overcoming them. It also confirmed a significant deficit in preparing university teachers for their role as intercultural mediators in English-medium courses.

The paper argues the press has a dual role: On news pages, newspapers ought to inform citizens about the issue positions and frames of the pro and con camps in a balanced way. In editorials, newspapers act as political advocates that promote their own issue frames and try to shape public opinion through voting recommendations. Comparing the issue positions and frames in editorials and news reports in the run-up to the vote on the popular initiative Yes to Europe in Switzerland, this article shows that newspapers give similar visibility to the pro and con camps regardless of the papers own editorial position. However, some newspapers favor issue frames that are in line with their editorial perspectives. In conclusion, newspapers are more similar in news report content than in editorial views.

AB  - Identification with a superordinate entity, like Europe, reduces prejudice towards immigrants in general, but no research so far investigated if this differs between prejudice towards immigrants from inside and outside Europe. Using online survey data from four European countries, we determined whether national and European identification are (differently) related to attitudes towards immigrants from inside and outside Europe, and to which extent these relations can be explained by differences in refugee threat perceptions. We found that those who strongly identify with Europe hold more favorable views towards both European and non-European immigrants, while the reverse effect is found for strong national identifiers - an effect that can be explained by realistic and symbolic refugee threat perceptions. We did not find evidence for our expectation that the strength of the associations of national identification on attitudes and threat perceptions would depend on the level of European identification of participants. Overall, our findings provide mixed support for the Common In-group Identity Model because European identifiers, although more positive towards immigrants, did not make strong distinctions between European and non-European immigrants.

AB  - The article examines the nature of implicature realised in the election-prediction discourse in the Zimbabwean media. The focus is on how the print and electronic media, through its 'digestion' of news (Archakis & Tsakona, 2010), predicted the win or loss of political parties or candidates. The article shows how the media has been shaping public opinion in the run-up to the harmonised elections in Zimbabwe in 2008. In order to achieve this, the researcher employed the Gricean conceptualisation of implicature. It is argued that the cooperative principle and the suggested maxims are not observed during face-to-face conversation only. Taking into account the context of the newspaper, journalists are also expected to observe the cooperative principle and the maxims as they converse with the readers of their newspapers. Thus, the article examines how newspaper reporters try to be cooperative while at the same time aligning readers with a particular ideology and political party. The violation or flouting of the maxims has been observed in the newspaper reports as a strategy to shape public opinion, aligning the readers with a particular winning candidate.

AB  - By examining a news story and reader responses published in the Daily Mail Online (DMO), our study discursively argues that this daily newspaper promotes an Orientalist perception of Islam and Muslims. The religion and its adherents are both framed and perceived as a threat to British society and its Western values, thus reinforcing Islamophobia within society. This study also argues that the DMO espouses the perceived Orientalist threat posed by Islam through juxtaposition, exaggeration and manipulation of facts, through lexical choices and visual images that eventually establishes the perception of a cultural clash. In addition, by examining the readers' responses toward the news story, this study demonstrates that the vast majority of respondents perceive Islam and Muslims as a threat to the West. Their comments, as triggered by the text, also contribute to the discourse of Islamophobia and the perceived Orientalist view of an Islamic threat.

AB  - Purpose "Fake news" or misinformation sharing using social media sites into public discourse or politics has increased dramatically, over the last few years, especially in the current COVID-19 pandemic causing concern. However, this phenomenon is inadequately researched. This study examines fake news sharing with the lens of stimulus-organism-response (SOR) theory, uses and gratification theory (UGT) and big five personality traits (BFPT) theory to understand the motivations for sharing fake news and the personality traits that do so. The stimuli in the model comprise gratifications (pass time, entertainment, socialization, information sharing and information seeking) and personality traits (agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, openness and neuroticism). The feeling of authenticating or instantly sharing news is the organism leading to sharing fake news, which forms the response in the study. Design/methodology/approach The conceptual model was tested by the data collected from a sample of 221 social media users in India. The data were analyzed with partial least squares structural equation modeling to determine the effects of UGT and personality traits on fake news sharing. The moderating role of the platform WhatsApp or Facebook was studied. Findings The results suggest that pass time, information sharing and socialization gratifications lead to instant sharing news on social media platforms. Individuals who exhibit extraversion, neuroticism and openness share news on social media platforms instantly. In contrast, agreeableness and conscientiousness personality traits lead to authentication news before sharing on the social media platform. Originality/value This study contributes to social media literature by identifying the user gratifications and personality traits that lead to sharing fake news on social media platforms. Furthermore, the study also sheds light on the moderating influence of the choice of the social media platform for fake news sharing.

AB  - This article examines the factors that predict affective polarization and political engagement in the United States. Using an original survey dataset (N = 1,100) of a fairly representative national sample, this study explored some factors (e.g., age, gender, political ideology, and partisan news media and social media) to see how they predict affective polarization and political engagement. The results could be helpful to further study widening affective polarization, which is reportedly affecting democracy itself, in this current political and public opinion atmosphere "Trumpfied" in the last couple of years. The insights found in this research could also help devise political and social campaign strategies that minimize polarization gaps. The results might enable corporate entities to better classify their consumers based on relevant issues associated with polarization and political engagement. Future research is encouraged to combine survey data and social media data for a more refined outcome.

AB  - Using supervised learning techniques to code newspaper articles on the Minerals Resource Rent Tax (originally known as the Resources Super Profits Tax), this article analyses sources of partiality and emphasis in media coverage of the issue. It shows that opponents were more successful in airing their views in the opening stages of the debate, but the government's re-branding led to more favourable media coverage. There was a regional bias, however, with newspapers in states dominated by mining interests more critical than newspapers from other states. The only truly national newspaper (the Australian) was notable for having fewer 'neutral' articles, with a relatively high number of both negative and positive articles. The Australian Financial Review, meanwhile, had a greater number of neutral articles. Framing remained homogenous over time though variable across publications.

AB  - Mass vaccination campaigns have been implemented worldwide to counteract the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic, however their effectiveness could be challenged by vaccine hesitancy. The tremendous rise in the use of social media have made them acquire a leading role as an information source, thus representing a crucial factor at play that could contribute to increase or mitigate vaccine hesitancy, as information sources play a pivotal role in shaping public opinion and perceptions. The aims of the study were to investigate if information sources could affect the attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination and if they could act as a mediator in the relationship between individual characteristics and vaccine hesitancy. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted by a professional panellist on a representative sample of 1011 citizens from the Emilia-Romagna region in Italy in January 2021. A mediation analysis using structural equation modelling was performed. Our results show how social media directly or indirectly increases vaccine hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccination, while the opposite effect was observed for institutional websites. Given the global widespread use of social media, their use should be enhanced to disseminate scientifically sound information to a greater audience to counteract vaccine hesitancy, while at the same time continuing to promote and update institutional websites that have proven to be effective in reducing vaccine hesitancy.

AB  - Recent works have coined the term Online Political Efficacy (OPE) to assess the impact of Internet use on the perceived political empowerment of citizens. As the classic concept of political efficacy distinguishes between internal (IPE) and external (EPE) efficacies, we seek to confirm the usefulness of a new indicator of political efficacy for online engagement and assess the impact of the territory where people reside on OPE. Although OPE is mostly explained by the same determinants that account for IPE, the center-periphery divide influences OPE and IPE in opposite directions. Those who reside in the territorial-and political-periphery believe more strongly that they can use Internet to participate in public affairs (OPE), though they do not feel more competent in doing so (IPE). The democratizing power of Internet helps bridge the center-periphery social and political territorial divide.

AB  - BackgroundMedia representations of sexuality after childbirth depict vaginal birth as harmful and cesarean delivery as protective, although research does not support these depictions. The objective of the current study was to investigate perceptions of the effects of mode of delivery on sexuality.
   MethodsNulliparous participants who were able to and interested in giving birth (N=1428) completed an online survey about their preferences for mode of delivery and their perceptions of childbirth as they specifically relate to sexuality. Participants provided demographic information, rated how influential different sources of information about childbirth were, and completed the Attitudes Toward Women's Genitals Scale.
   ResultsUp to half (16-48%), the participants agreed with different statements about vaginal birth as harmful to, and cesarean delivery as protective of, future sexuality. Participant characteristics that were independently predictive of endorsing these beliefs were: self-identifying as heterosexual, holding negative attitudes toward women's genitals, and reporting that reality media, nonreality media, and online media sources are influential sources of childbirth information. Participants who rated health care professionals as an influential source of information were less likely to endorse these beliefs.
   ConclusionGiven that there is no clear evidence in the empirical literature to support the claim that vaginal births are harmful and cesarean delivery is protective to one's future sexual life, it is important to dispel the existing misconceptions. Various media sources likely play a role in the perpetuation of this misinformation.

AB  - The media plays an important role in how the American public understands controversial social and political issues, such as immigration. The purpose of this article is to examine how key features of the media, such as location (Arizona vs. National) and political ideology (Liberal vs. Conservative), affect the framing of arguments supporting and opposing the anti-immigration bill (Arizona SB 1070). A content analysis was conducted using 3 weeks of newspaper articles from two Arizona newspapers (one Conservative, one Liberal) and five national newspapers (three Conservative, two Liberal). Analyses revealed that both location and political ideology influenced the framing. Specifically, the national newspapers were more likely than Arizona newspapers to frame arguments supporting the bill in terms of threats (e.g., threats to economic and public safety) and to frame arguments against the bill in terms of civil rights issues (e.g., racial profiling). In terms of political ideology, Conservative newspapers were more likely than Liberal newspapers to frame the bill in terms of economic and public safety threats, but did not differ in mentions of civil rights issues. The implications for attitudes toward immigrants and legal ethnic minorities and for defining the boundaries of the American national identity are discussed.

AB  - Combining three telephone surveys during the 2006 Israeli elections and a content analysis of leading Israeli newspapers, this study extended the function of attribute agenda setting and priming. Analysis documented that throughout the course of a campaign, public opinion fluctuates in tandem with the saliency of candidate attributes emphasized in the news. We also found an important consequence of attribute agenda setting, affective priming of candidate attributes, by which the prominent tone of the media's candidate attributes functions as a criterion for evaluating a candidate's suitability. Finally, this public evaluative tone was linked with voting intentions for the candidate's political party.

AB  - Defined as a form of tagging that allows social media users to embed metadata in their posts, hashtags initially served to categorize topics and make them searchable online. Originating first on Twitter in 2007, hashtags have spread to other platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook, and Youtube. In addition to functioning as topic markers, hashtags have developed more complex linguistic functions. The ubiquity of this feature in the online medium, which now occupies a significant portion of our everyday communication is thus worthy of investigation. Although this topic has been researched in different disciplines, such as information diffusion, marketing, as well as sociology and public opinion, hashtags have not yet received enough attention from linguistic research. Using a sample of hashtags from a corpus of Instagram posts by Egyptian and Arab participants, this research thus aims to examine the characteristics of hashtags from a linguistic perspective, with particular focus on hashtags in the Arabic language. The study primarily seeks to determine the morpho-syntactic features of these recently emerging linguistic items according to the taxonomy proposed by Caleffi (2015). It also explores the pragmatic functions of hashtags based on Zappavigna's (2015) view of hashtags as technologically discursive tools. The analysis points out that most of the hashtags in the data serve the experiential function and come as suffixes. The findings reveal both similarities and differences between English and Arabic hashtags.

AB  - This article considers how contemporary representations of child molesters in scholarly, political, and popular culture participate in projects that revolve around the recuperation of heteronormativity. I argue that these multimodal obsessions with child molestation displace the resilience of entrenched homophobic fears, prejudices, and dispositions, giving the lie to the commonplace that the political advance of same-sex marriage in the United States signals the apotheosis of gay rights. My analysis focuses on two representative popular and scholarly texts: the long-running television series Law and Order: SVU and a scholarly article about the Jerry Sandusky case published in jac. The former capitalizes on a combination of stranger and familiar child molester figures, reflecting a mix of popular sex panic mythology and social reality. The latter reenacts this combination, so the discourse about the Sandusky case becomes imbricated in the convergences between mythology and social reality that characterize the television show.

AB  - Only few studies have investigated media coverage of one and the same election campaign in a cross-national, comparative perspective. This study takes the 2008 US Presidential election as a case and investigates the way it is covered in eight European countries. We explain differences in visibility, tone and framing by considering country characteristics, media features and temporal aspects. Results demonstrate that all three aspects determine campaign coverage to some extent, yet temporal aspects, and in particular the stage of the campaign and polling trends, are of considerable influence.

AB  - In the Indian context, women, especially Dalit women, have been subjected to scripturally and culturally sanctioned misogyny. These deep-rooted prejudices are manifested at both the societal and the institutional levels. In such a scenario, any assertion of justice by Dalit women is fraught with tensions. The sexual violence against them is routinized, normalized and invisibilized. For the victims, it is a lonely struggle as civil society scarcely registers such crimes; for the law and judiciary, it is another claim for meagre compensation. Their bodies are bereft of honour, and their sexuality is viewed with suspicion, easily accessible to any male of the dominant communities who can lay claim to it. This article explores two case studies-Khairlanji and Nirbhaya, geographically distinct spaces, where Dalit women were brutally raped and mutilated, and the perpetrators were let off lightly. The mainstream media largely ignored the developments. The article also focuses on the fissures within the feminist movement vis-a-vis caste and the politics of sexuality.

AB  - Despite concerns about the effects of pro-Russian disinformation on Western public opinion, evidence of its reach remains scarce. We hypothesize that conservative individuals will be more likely than liberals to be potentially exposed to pro-Russian disinformation in digital networks. We evaluate the hypothesis using a large data set of U.S.-based Twitter users, testing how ideology is associated with disinformation about the 2014 crash of the MH17 aircraft over eastern Ukraine. We find that potential exposure to disinformation is concentrated among the most conservative individuals. Moving from the most liberal to the most conservative individuals in the sample is associated with a change in the conditional probability of potential exposure to disinformation from 6.5% to 45.2%. We corroborate the finding using a second, validated data set on individual party registration. The results indicate that the reach of online, pro-Russian disinformation into U.S. audiences is distinctly ideologically asymmetric.

AB  - This paper explores how women stereotypes are discursively evaluated in the TV sitcom 3rd Rock from the Sun by paying attention to the societal, cultural and ideological values they convey. Following recent trends for the study of television series (Bednarek, 2010), the analysis is both qualitative and quantitative, adopting a Corpus-Assisted Discourse Analysis approach (Baker, 2006; Partington, 2004). The contextualised analysis of words that refer to women confirms that the sitcom writers of 3rd Rock from the Sun purposefully resort to stereotyping as a verbal strategy to create humour while conveying negative attitudes towards women.

AB  - The presentation of single cases as examples for larger phenomena has a long-standing tradition in journalism. However, their usage has been viewed rather critically within the scientific community, because they are employed in a highly selective manner. Consequently, over the course of the last three decades, communication scholars from different research traditions have concerned themselves with the question of how single-case information within media content affects audience judgments. Although most publications report exemplification effects of some sort, it remains unclear which types of exemplars are effective and whether they are capable of influencing both perceptual and personal judgments. Applying amulti-level meta-regression approach, we synthesize findings across different studies and investigate potential moderators. Our results suggest overall exemplification effects that seem to be most pronounced for first-level reality judgments, such as public opinion or frequency estimates, but that are limited in their robustness when controlling for interdependence of the measurements.

AB  - Previous research has extensively analyzed the existence and extent of rally effects following crisis initiation with respect to United States public opinion and presidential approval. Relatively less known is how crisis termination affects presidential approval. The theory presented in this article suggests that crisis terminations are prime for rally effects. They are salient, demonstrate competence, and thus activate a significant boost of executive approval akin to rally effects at crisis onset. Insofar as executives might use them as diversionary tools, crisis terminations overcome the strategic conflict avoidance argument and require less cynical assumptions about leaders' self-interest than the conventional domain of diversionary theory, crisis initiations. We test the claim that crisis terminations have significant ''halo effects'' using monthly US presidential approval data during forty-eight international crises between 1953 and 2016. Results demonstrate that crisis termination has consistently positive effects on presidential approval. In addition, these surges are conditioned by the degree and disposition of public attention. The findings indicate that US public opinion is quite sensitive to the whole trajectory of an international crisis.

The authors used an online panel to recruit participants with chronic dry eye (n = 504) and psoriasis (n = 490). The study found no effects of animation or rotoscoping on perceptions of drug risk or benefit, comprehension, or behavioral intentions. Animated advertisements, however, resulted in more negative attitudes than live-action or rotoscoped advertisements. Future research should explore whether animated advertisements are recalled better over time or have any lagged effects on perceptions.

AB  - The exceptional levels of political polarization, party system fragmentation, and electoral volatility that Spain is currently experiencing, all recommend analysing the origins of these patterns. We employ a unique combination of individual-level survey and Twitter activity data pertaining to a sample of users of the Voting Advice Application we launched during the transformative 2015 Spanish general elections campaign to investigate the ideological determinants of individuals' online network building. Our results demonstrate that, among those following online parties/candidates' profiles, political promiscuity is the most common behaviour, though this behaviour depends heavily on users' broader online and offline political attitudes.

AB  - Video games often contain sexist content that may be connected to negative consequences for female video game players, such as internalizing negative attitudes and beliefs about women. However, aspects of feminist identification may prevent such negative outcomes from occurring. The present study investigated the relationships among time spent playing video games, internalized misogyny, and the synthesis dimension of feminist identity, which is characterized by embracing the positive aspects of being a woman and incorporating feminine attributes into one's own unique personality. A total of 319 U.S. female video game players completed measures of media usage, internalized misogyny, and feminist identity. The authors tested a moderation model in which gaming predicted internalized misogyny and synthesis moderated this relationship. Gaming was positively associated with internalized misogyny at lower, but not higher, levels of synthesis. Thus, those who value the positive aspects of womanhood and have thoughtful and realistic perceptions of gender may be resistant to internalizing some harmful beliefs about women perpetuated in games. The present study provides evidence for the potential negative influence of cumulative video game exposure for some women and the protective effect of feminist identity synthesis. Counselors and activists should do work aimed at critically evaluating and challenging gendered messages in video games and affirming women's gender identities and feminine attributes. Game developers must consider the impact of their content on players and strive to create female characters that are agentic, complex, and competent. Conversely, gamers should avoid supporting games with depthless depictions of women.

AB  - During policy change, the role of the actors communicating the change to different audiences is accentuated. The media plays an increasing role, either as an actor or by providing a stage for other actors. In particular, specialised journals represent an influential, albeit understudied, sphere of policy studies. We use the narrative policy framework complemented with frame analysis to trace how specialised media can affect policy implementation through implicit suggestions for action. Using this combined approach, we analyse how specialised forest journals, which are the most important forest information source for Finnish forest owners, have conveyed the renewal of forest legislation in Finland. The core message of the journals is that forest owners should, despite their new freedom granted by the reform, rely on experts rather than experimenting when managing their forests. This suggests that the media contributes to a path-dependent continuation of a forest policy that is based on a rationalistic exploitation ethos. The innovative potential, which the policy change aimed at encouraging, is thereby partially undermined. However, the analysis of the narratives also reveals that forest expertise and professionalism are diversifying. This notion is important as diversity can eventually lead to narratives supporting more fundamental change in forests management.

Our results show that fear of isolation and saving face were negatively associated with individuals' willingness to express their opinion on the issue, whereas news attention and issue salience were positively associated. Also, fear of isolation was negatively associated with individuals' willingness to offer a rationale for their opinion, whereas news attention and issue salience were positively associated. Power distance had no effects on outspokenness. Notably, news attention moderated the influence of fear of isolation and saving face on public outspokenness.

AB  - Discussions of science and its relevance to public policy have recently taken center stage in political discourse, illustrating the values-based nature of scientific policy decisions. This article uses an original data set of media coverage to examine the ways in which salience and media portrayals of scientific uncertainty affect the agenda-setting process for scientific policy issues. We build upon two scholarly literatures by incorporating research on the use of science in the policy process into the study of policy diffusion among the American states. In doing so, we develop a framework for how media portrayals of scientific information can affect agenda setting. We test this framework on three scientific issues: Genetically modified food labeling, human papillomavirus vaccinations, and indoor tanning. Our results indicate that lawmakers introduce more legislation on salient issues, while higher reported levels of scientific uncertainty reduce the likelihood of bill introductions. This finding illustrates the potential impact of national media coverage as an information transmission mechanism and the necessity of treating policy characteristics as subject to change over time.

AB  - One of the overarching goals of international large-scale assessments (ILSA) is to inform public discourse about the quality of education in different countries. To fulfil this function, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), for example, raises awareness of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) results through different forms of traditional and social media (e.g. press releases and other activities under the slogan PISA Day). Scholars have responded to the rapid growth of ILSA by examining public discourse through newspaper articles, policy documents, and other outlets. However, we know very little about whether and to what extent the general public is actually affected by PISA results. In order to address this gap, this study uses data regarding public trust in education from the 2011 wave of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP). Drawing on survey data from 30 countries and Hierarchical Linear Models (HLM), the study shows that PISA rankings have a significant effect on public perceptions. We find that in high performing countries the general public expresses higher levels of confidence in the education system. We discuss these patterns in the context of growing politicisation of education policy making and the use of ILSA as evidence.

AB  - Few academics who become public intellectuals have the opportunity to use their research findings to influence and direct public opinion. Sherry Turkle is a public intellectual whose work as a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor of the social studies of science and technology is critically considered in this exploration of a single public presentation based on her 2015 book Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in the Digital Age. Drawing deeply on subjective observations, Turkle performs public ethnography, using her knowledge and practice as a psychologist to create what she has called "computer psychotherapy." This type of ethnographic practice operates within an agent-egoist model of performativity, which Turkle uses to establish her opposition to student use of laptops and social media in classrooms. Arguing in favor of and thereby privileging classroom conversation, Turkle misses the challenge of rendering creative pedagogical options for millennials in the context of their enriched, always-on digital lives. As a public intellectual, she fails to assist the public and educators explore collective and progressive options to technology within emerging forms of pedagogy.

AB  - Positive media depictions of Obama likely contribute to the so-called "Obama effect." However, like any attitude-object, effects of those depictions can depend on contextually positive or negative portrayals. We hypothesized that politically conservative news web sites (e.g., FoxNews.com) visually depict Obama more negatively than moderate sites (e.g., CNN. com), and that incidental exposure to such dissimilar depictions can differentially impact perceivers' attitudes toward Obama, particularly when pre-existing attitudes are weak. In Study 1 (n = 111), images of Obama from FoxNews.com were rated more negatively than images of him from CNN. com. In Study 2 (n = 215), participants with weaker attitudes exposed to FoxNews. com images (versus all other images) evinced the most negative SC-IAT bias toward Obama. Thus, incidental exposure to valenced media portrayals can impact attitudes toward public figures. Implications for the Obama effect are discussed.

AB  - Pakistan inherited administrative institutions from its predecessor colonial state. These institutions were highly centralized, developed over a time period of many centuries and bequeathed intact. Contrastingly, the political and representative institutions and traditions that Pakistan inherited were moribund because they could not experience smooth sailing and hence not evolved over a reasonable time span. Unfortunately political parties could not develop democratic culture which paved the way for civil and military bureaucracy to overcome established institutional structure. By holding very strong power, the institutions of civil and military bureaucracy continued to override what they found in the form of representative. The tide could not be turned and Pakistan went through more than three decades of dictatorships. Media also faced the same fate and could not play the role of healthy criticizer for government as was due on it being the fourth pillar of state. The media can play its constructive role in democracy only if there is encouraging environment that allow them to do so. Democracy and media both suffered not being in good and strong hands during this period. This research paper is an effort to explore, evaluate and analyze the role of Dawn newspaper in responding to the fourth military coup of Oct 12, 1999. The media outlet studied under this research paper is an English daily newspaper "Dawn". It is an analysis of the role of Dawn in public opinion making, developing political consciousness among Pakistani masses and playing the role of healthy and balanced opposition for military coup of Oct 12, 1999. The findings reveal that despite the friendly behavior of Musharraf government towards media, the response of Dawn to fourth martial law of country's history was very careful and reserve unlike other newspapers of Pakistan. Dawn not only remained stick to its policy of neutrality but also analyzed the events very critically. This research paper is a qualitative analysis of the response of Pakistan's relatively reliable and unbiased newspaper Dawn towards the fourth military coup and political developments mainly, Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO), judicial validation of the military coup and Legal Framework Order (LFO).

It is hypothesized that especially citizens with uncertain prior attitudes delay their voting decisions when they are exposed to cross-cutting news coverage. Two studies provide evidence for this hypothesis, using panel data that are combined with an extensive content analysis of news media. There is also some evidence that counterattitudinal coverage accelerates voting decisions when people hold their campaign attitudes with high attitude certainty.

KW  - EMOTION
AB  - This paper critically examines emergent research with sentiment analysis tools to assess their current status and relevance to applied opinion and behaviour measurement. The rapid spread of online news and online chatter in blogs, micro-blogs and social media sites has created a potentially rich source of public opinion. Waves of public feeling are vented spontaneously on a wide range of issues on a minute-by-minute basis in the online world. These online discourses are continually being refreshed, and businesses and advertisers, governments and policy makers have woken up to the fact that this universe of self-perpetuating human sentiment could represent a valuable resource to guide political and business decisions. The massive size of this repository of emotional content renders manual analysis of it feasible only for tiny portions of its totality, and even then can be labour intensive. Computer scientists have however produced software tools that can apply linguistic rules to provide electronic readings of meanings and emotions. These tools are now being utilised by applied social science and market researchers to yield sentiment profiles from online discourses created within specific platforms that purport to represent reliable substitutes for more traditional, offline measures of public opinion. This paper considers what these tools have demonstrated so far and where caution in their application is still called for.

AB  - This article examines coverage presented in a news campaign (on asylum and immigration) by the UK tabloid newspaper, the Sun, from January to March 2003. The analysis reveals how tabloid news conventions rather than government definitions or viewpoints frame the character and contours of campaign representations, an observation that throws into sharp relief existing explanations of elite influence or authority skew. This campaign includes portrayals of the asylum seeker as 'the other' or 'folk devil', a moral framework explaining their deviant intentions and actions, as well as expressions of irreverence at elite decision-making and government UK asylum policy. Yet it is striking how accompanying tabloid representations of public opinion, featuring consistently through the coverage, offer additional hostility to asylum policy and government officials. The article outlines how such representations and appeals garner the attention of the political elite and elite media on this occasion and develop new concerns over the newspaper's role in negatively shaping the asylum agenda.

TI  - Quantifying the effect of Wakefield et al. (1998) on skepticism about MMR vaccine safety in the US
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Background Efforts to trace the rise of childhood vaccine safety concerns in the US often suggest Andrew Wakefield and colleagues' retracted 1998 Lancet study (AW98)-which alleged that the MMR vaccine can cause children to develop autism-as a primary cause of US vaccine skepticism. However, a lack of public opinion data on MMR safety collected before/after AW98's publication obscures whether anecdotal accounts are indicative of a potentially-causal effect. Methods We address this problem using a regression discontinuity framework to study change in monthly MMR injury claims (N = 74,850; from 1990-2019) from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) to proxy concern about vaccine safety. Additionally, we suggest a potential mechanism for the effect of AW98 on vaccine skepticism, via automated sentiment analyses of MMR-related news stories (N = 674; from 1996-2000) in major television and newspaper outlets. Results AW98 led to an immediate increase of about 70 MMR injury claims cases per month, averaging across six estimation strategies (meta-analytic effect = 70.44 [52.19, 88.75], p < 0.01). Preliminary evidence suggests that the volume of negative media attention to MMR increased in the weeks following AW98's publication, across four estimation strategies (meta-analytic effect = 9.59% [3.66, 15.51], p < 0.01). Conclusions Vaccine skepticism increased following the publication of AW98, which was potentially made possible by increased negative media coverage of MMR. Significance Childhood vaccine skepticism presents an important challenge to widespread vaccine uptake, and undermines support for pro-vaccine health policies. In addition to advancing our understanding of the previously-obscured origins of US vaccine skepticism, our work cautions that high-profile media attention to inaccurate scientific studies can undermine public confidence in vaccines. We conclude by offering several recommendations that researchers and health communicators might consider to detect and address future threats to vaccine confidence.

AB  - Background: Beliefs about low back pain (LBP) have been widely studied. Research supports the importance of attitudes and beliefs in the development of disability. However, public opinions about LBP have been the subject of few studies to date and more research into public attitudes has been advocated to inform future public health initiatives.
   Objectives: To investigate public attitudes and beliefs about LBP, and the association of these with demographic variables. In addition, to determine whether certain group differences in demographic characteristics were useful in predicting individuals with negative attitudes about LBP.
   Methods: A stratified sample of 3400 households were invited to participate in the Jersey Annual Social Survey. One thousand five hundred and seventy-four (46.3%) responded and 1132 (71.9%) were identified as being of working age. Complete responses to the Back Beliefs Questionnaire were provided by 1023 (65.0%).
   Results: Respondents were grouped according to pain report: no current pain, current pain not LBP, and current LBP. Significant differences existed between subgroups for most demographic characteristics. Moreover, beliefs about LBP differed significantly between the 3 groups [F (2,1019) = 17.72, P < 0.001]. Further analyses were carried out for the subgroups separately. For the Current LBP group, beliefs differed significantly by educational level [F(2,186) = 14.65, P < 0.001], perceived general health [F (2,187) = 4.42, P < 0.05], acceptability of work absence [F (2,189) = 10.69, P < 0.001], LBP impact on activity [F (2,186) = 6.38, P < 0.01], and previous LBP absence [t (185) = 4.84, P < 0.001]. Multiple regression using these characteristics produced an adjusted R-2 of 0.25 [F (4,181) = 16.33, P < 0.001] for the prediction of back beliefs.
   Discussion: Implications for public health initiatives and future research are discussed.

AB  - Due to its rapid spread over social media and the societal threat of changing public opinion, fake news has gained massive attention. Users' role in disseminating fake news has become inevitable with the increase in popularity of social media for daily news diet. People in social media actively participate in the creation and propagation of news, favoring the proliferation of fake news intentionally or unintentionally. Thus, it is necessary to identify the users who tend to share fake news to mitigate the rampant dissemination of fake news over social media. In this article, we perform a comprehensive analysis on two different datasets collected from Twitter and investigate the patterns of user characteristics in social media in the presence of misinformation. Specifically, we study the correlation between the user characteristics and their likelihood of being fake news spreaders and demonstrate the potential of the proposed features in identifying fake news spreaders. Our proposed approach achieves an average precision ranging between 0.80 and 0.99 on the considered datasets, consistently outperforming baseline models. Furthermore, we also show that the user personality traits, emotions, and writing style are strong predictors of fake news spreaders.

AB  - Despite a decline in crime rates, the 1990s witnessed extensive media coverage of several high-profile stranger abductions and murders of children. State legislators' swift response to the public's growing fear of sex offenders with the adoption of sex offender registration and notification (SORN) laws raises questions about the role of politics. Punctuated equilibrium theory and the diffusion of innovation jointly provide a context to conduct an event history analysis to assess the extent to which politics enhanced legislative responsiveness to public opinion in SORN policymaking. Contrary to the commonly held belief that attributes legislative interest in SORN to salient crimes against children, the results suggest that factors such as the percentage of a conservative population, district-level competition, and state innovativeness accelerated the diffusion of innovation of the laws.

AB  - This paper examines 96 US and British Commonwealth articles on the 2014 Wisconsin Slender Man stabbing. Using critical textual analysis, this study examined how media took a horror-themed meme from the underbelly of the Internet and curated a moral panic, once the meme was thrust into the international limelight. Because memes are a particular intersection of images and technology, media made sense of this meme-inspired attack in three ways: (1) through an idolatrous tone that played on long-standing Western anxieties over images; (2) by hyper-sensationalizing women's so-called frivolous uses of technology; and (3) by removing blame from the assailants and, in turn, finding the Internet and the Slender Man meme guilty in the court of public opinion. Through this tripartite rhetoric, this study suggests that when media set out to curate a moral panic surrounding images and technology, together, the discourse that emerges is one that feminizes the Internet, turning it into technology-as-mother and image-as-child. This study also suggests this is the case because when women receive macro-level structure equality, micro-level inequities and attempts of control against them increase. Digital and image rhetoric are not exceptions.

AB  - A number of voices have emerged in U.S. political discourse questioning the legitimacy of American exceptionalism, suggesting we are in a "post-American world." Our research examines the effects that political messages that explicitly challenge American exceptionalism can have on U.S. public opinion. Drawing upon social identity theory, we find that explicit challenges to American exceptionalism significantly impact Americans' views toward their own nation, their willingness to denigrate foreign publics, and their broader foreign policy preferences.

AB  - Building from the third-person effect model of DRR policy adoption and mediated policy learning, this study provides an experimental examination of how specific elements of news media's localisation of distant events directly influence public opinion. Controlling for salience effects, the construction of affinities between the distant, stricken community and the newspaper's audience is argued to create a sense of shared vulnerability to the reported disasters. This is correlated within an increase in the respondent's intention to act directly and an increase in their willingness to punish elected officials who do not act accordingly. The construction of difference between the communities, even though it is not related to risks related to the disaster, is argued to create implicit reassurances that the observing community does not need to act. This leads to an increased intention to act directly in opposition to efforts to reduce risk, but a neutral response towards political actors who pursue risk reduction policy actions.

AB  - Scholarship on media and politics presumes a 'mediatization' of politics over time, which overlooks the evolution of a mediatized public sphere that shaped people's understandings of what actually constituted politics. This article investigates the public sphere to demonstrate how it created expectations for politicians and journalists within the process of the mediatization of politics. To understand how political behaviour changed as a result of mediatization, this article focuses on the turn of the twentieth century, when politics faced an emerging mass press. It analyses one of the most violent episodes of the 'press wars' between Germany and Britain before the First World War. In 1901, British Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain allegedly insulted the German Army, to which German Imperial Chancellor Bernhard von Bulow reacted aggressively, resulting in a media storm across Europe and the failing of the British-German alliance talks that paved the way for Britain's Entente Cordiale with France. Part of the reason why this situation escalated was that newspapers in Britain and Germany expressed expectations for politicians to represent the angry opinions of their publics as voiced in the press. However, many newspapers also demanded that Bulow and Chamberlain moderate public opinion by influencing and censoring the press. While Bulow and Chamberlain were ahead of their time in paying attention to press opinions, seeking publicity and managing the press, they failed to meet the contradictory expectations of catering to jingoism while appeasing a foreign public. Meanwhile, newspapers reflected on their political impact on this situation, and started expecting more press responsibility, which moderated the crisis. The case shows how media and politics were not separated spheres, but interacted within a transnational public sphere in which expectations for political and journalistic behaviour were continuously being (re)shaped.

KW  - MUSIC
AB  - You are what you hear, not what you say. This personal reflection explores how listening to music in the post 9/11 context enabled me to negotiate ideas of diasporic Muslim identity when speaking as Muslim proved much more difficult. Islamophobia and Islamophilia both apply pressures on the kind of Muslim one can be in public. Listening to electronic music genres, hip hop and punk from the US and UK opened up spaces to engage with war and terror, racism and media. Much of this music refers directly to Muslim peoples, places and structures of feeling. Yet music that isn't explicit about the Muslim is also conscripted for life during wartime in which some of us feel wary about articulating those Muslim parts of our garbled selves. Music genres have specific affordances that modulate Muslim affects and discourses, and shape new and indeterminate ways of being Muslim.

AB  - Objective To examine whether the consumption of Spanish-language news influences perceptions of issue salience among Latinos, the largest ethnoracial group in the United States.
   Methods This mixed-methods analysis incorporates conceptual content analyses of English and Spanish-language online newspapers from major Latino metropolitan areas, logistic regressions, and robustness checks to predict the salience of Latino issues.
   Results Spanish-language news media covers immigration to a much greater extent than mainstream media, even within the same geographical locations; as a result, Latinos who consume Spanish-language news are more likely to report immigration as a salient issue, even after accounting for important predispositions such as nativity and in-group linked fate.
   Conclusion This study highlights the importance of Spanish-language and ethnic media in a growingly diverse country, where ethnoracial groups will soon make up the majority of the country.

AB  - This research investigates how levels of citizen trust in government and compliance are affected by citizens' use of the Internet. Starting from the premise that information is a key determinant of public opinion and citizen behavior, this research explores the extent to which the time that citizens spend on the Internet affects their trust in government and compliance with government policies, compared with the influence of the traditional, off-line, mass media modalities, such as newspapers. In addition, we also assess the impact of citizens' use of e-government on levels of trust in government and compliance. The results of the analyses suggest that the more time individuals spend on the Internet, the lower their degree of trust in government and lower level of citizen compliance. However, our results also suggest that such negative effects of the Internet can be moderated through citizens' increased use of e-government.

AB  - Using digital text analysis methods, we analyze over 3800 newspaper articles covering U.S. Supreme Court judicial appointments between 1981 and 2009 to measure the level of (in)congruence between the Court's agenda and the issues emphasized by the media. We find that newspapers highlight "culture war" issues at the expense of other important issues addressed much more frequently by the Court. Moreover, abortion in particular receives attention in more articles and in much greater depth than any other issue. With a few minor deviations, these patterns are consistent across nominations. These findings raise normative concerns regarding the didactic function of the print media in American democracy and shed empirical light on positive theories of media behavior.

AB  - Despite decades of research, no scholarly consensus has been achieved regarding the potential impact of video games on youth aggression or other public health concerns. In recent years, hypotheses have been raised that scholarly opinions on video games may resemble past moral panics, with attitudes reflective of generational conflicts. These hypotheses are tested in a sample of 175 criminologists, psychologists, and media scholars, examining both overall negative attitudes about video games and perceived linkages with youth assaults specifically. Results reflected continued lack of scholarly consensus on the issue of video game influences with only 15.3% of scholars endorsing the view that violent video games contribute to youth assaults. As hypothesized, older scholars endorsed more negative views of video games generally, although this appeared to be related to experience with games rather than age per se. Scholars with more negative attitudes toward youth themselves were also more negative about games. Criminologists and media scholars were more skeptical of violent video games contributing to youth assaults than were psychologists. These results are discussed in relation to Moral Panic Theory.

AB  - The rise of populism and the polarization of traditional and new media pose threats to pluralistic democratic action and judgment. Citizens often vilify each other, deny each other the space to test and justify their perspectives publicly, either because they hold radically different political views, or because they ascribe an essentialist identity upon the other, one that they believe must be negated in accordance with the logic of their own ideology. This paper presents three vital resources in Hannah Arendt's thought for addressing these challenges to democracy. First, Arendt promotes physical - not merely virtual or digital - spaces of public deliberation in which actors disclose "who" they uniquely are and the "world" that contextualizes their action. Arendt proposes a principle of resistance to totalitarianism and a "responsibility for the world" as the appropriate limit to free action within these spaces. Second, Arendt presents a limit, or standard of intelligibility, to political action and speech permissible in public: the sensus communis of Kanes theory of aesthetic judgment. This standard of common sense, which binds the public sphere, demands that a speech act's intersubjective validity appeal to an objectivity that can be shared from different perspectives, but which allows for disagreement, and is not as restrictive as an Aristotelian ethos or an internally consistent ideology. Finally, Arendt asserts the imperative of factual truth telling and attention to the details of public phenomena, as necessary conditions for intelligible action and judgment in a pluralistic public sphere.

AB  - This study examined the role parasocial contact with a transgender character on an online TV show (Transparent) may play in reducing prejudice toward transgender people. An experiment was conducted with participants randomly assigned to view either a video depicting a transgender character, or a non-transgender character portrayed by the same actor. Results were consistent with predictions derived from the intergroup contact mediation model for explaining how intergroup contact reduces prejudice toward an outgroup. Critical to reduction of prejudice toward transgender people is the quality of the parasocial interaction with the transgender character. Poor quality of parasocial contact may have unintended negative effects on prejudice toward transgender people based on the data. Limitations and implications of the study for the use of entertainment media to reduce stigma toward transgender people are discussed.

AB  - Background: The media both creates and reflects public opinion. The way in which health professionals are depicted in the media is likely to influence views held by and about different health professions. The aim of this study was to examine how midwives and obstetricians are reported in English language web-based news reports from around the world. Methods: News alerts from the Internet search engine Google were created to search for the terms "midwife,'' "midwives,'' "midwifery,'' "obstetrics,'' and "obstetricians.'' These alerts were received over a 12-month period (May 1, 2006-April 31, 2007), downloaded, and analyzed using quantitative content analysis. Results: A total of 522 web-based news reports for midwifery and 564 for obstetrics (n = 1,086) were found. Dominant categories for midwives were: "mainstreaming midwives'' (models of care / rise of midwifery) (28%); "the Cinderella of the maternity care'' (workforce / industrial) (27%); "delivering the baby with your hands tied'' (funding, insurance, and legislation) (21%); "ask the expert'' (education, research, and health advice) (8%), "recognizing midwives'' (awards and announcements) (7%), "unsafe midwives'' (litigation) (6%); and "the art of birth'' (books, film, and photographs) (2%). Dominant categories for obstetricians were: "ask the expert'' (research and advice) (26%); "doctors are heroes amongst us'' (awards and announcements) (19%); "obstetric workforce woes'' (workforce / industrial) (19%); "new frontiers'' (trends in care and new technology) (17%); "the disappearing obstetrician'' (insurance and litigation) (10%); and "human-interest news reports'' (9%). Obstetricians were more likely to be recognized as experts on pregnancy and birth and receive public recognition compared with midwives. Midwives were more likely to be depicted as struggling to be a mainstream option while being hampered by lack of funding, insurance, and legislative barriers. Conclusions: Although midwives have rising acceptance, they still struggle with recognition. Obstetricians have both acceptance and recognition. Countries where midwifery is a mainstream option have more news reports related to midwifery than obstetrics. Different issues appear more dominant in some countries, such as work force in the United Kingdom and funding, insurance, and legislation in the United States. (BIRTH 39: 1 March 2012)

AB  - Partisan selective exposure, the phenomenon of selectively attending to information that is in line with one's political views, has received extensive research attention. Researchers have thus far largely neglected, however, to examine the tendency to avoid attitude-discrepant information, that is, selective avoidance. Selective avoidance can be considered a different phenomenon that is not necessarily implied by, nor only occurs simultaneously with, selective exposure. This study investigates these two separate phenomena, for the first time, using eye-tracking methodology. We exposed participants to political ads by liberal and conservative parties placed next to neutral political ads and tracked eye movements unobtrusively. Findings showed that individuals paid more visual attention to political ads that were consistent with their partisan ideology. Additionally, we found that individuals tended to avoid political ads that were inconsistent with their partisan ideology, which provides some evidence for selective avoidance processes. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - The proliferation of social media and digital technologies has made it necessary for governments to expand their focus beyond propaganda content in order to disseminate propaganda effectively. We identify a strategy of using clickbait to increase the visibility of political propaganda. We show that such a strategy is used across China by combining ethnography with a computational analysis of a novel dataset of the titles of 197,303 propaganda posts made by 213 Chinese city-level governments on WeChat. We find that Chinese propagandists face intense pressures to demonstrate their effectiveness on social media because their work is heavily quantified-measured, analyzed, and ranked-with metrics such as views and likes. Propagandists use both clickbait and non-propaganda content (e.g., lifestyle tips) to capture clicks, but rely more heavily on clickbait because it does not decrease space available for political propaganda. Government propagandists use clickbait at a rate commensurate with commercial and celebrity social media accounts. The use of clickbait is associated with more views and likes, as well as greater reach of government propaganda outlets and messages. These results reveal how the advertising-based business model and affordances of social media influence political propaganda and how government strategies to control information are moving beyond censorship, propaganda, and disinformation.

AB  - This tourism policy study focuses on the holiday system reform process in China. Employing Goffman's frame analysis as the research method, the study investigates China's unique Golden Week holiday system and the ongoing debate over its reform based on online news stories from 2005 to 2009. Six frames are identified in the debate: Welfare and Rights, Economic Effects, Tourism Development, Distribution of Power, Policy-Making, and Cultural Evolution. Among these frames, economic stability and ensuring human interests are the two most significant concerns in China's holiday policy reform debate. The subtle relationships among different interest groups and the overall control of the Central Government indicate that the political environment in China is experiencing changes toward accepting more public opinion.

KW  - Sentiment analysis
KW  - Text mining
AB  - Objective: The abundance of text available in social media and health related forums along with the rich expression of public opinion have recently attracted the interest of the public health community to use these sources for pharmacovigilance. Based on the intuition that patients post about Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) expressing negative sentiments, we investigate the effect of sentiment analysis features in locating ADR mentions.
   Methods: We enrich the feature space of a state-of-the-art ADR identification method with sentiment analysis features. Using a corpus of posts from the DailyStrength forum and tweets annotated for ADR and indication mentions, we evaluate the extent to which sentiment analysis features help in locating ADR mentions and distinguishing them from indication mentions.
   Results: Evaluation results show that sentiment analysis features marginally improve ADR identification in tweets and health related forum posts. Adding sentiment analysis features achieved a statistically significant F-measure increase from 72.14% to 73.22% in the Twitter part of an existing corpus using its original train/test split. Using stratified 10 x 10-fold cross-validation, statistically significant F-measure increases were shown in the DailyStrength part of the corpus, from 79.57% to 80.14%, and in the Twitter part of the corpus, from 66.91% to 69.16%. Moreover, sentiment analysis features are shown to reduce the number of ADRs being recognized as indications.
   Conclusion: This study shows that adding sentiment analysis features can marginally improve the performance of even a state-of-the-art ADR identification method. This improvement can be of use to pharmacovigilance practice, due to the rapidly increasing popularity of social media and health forums. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Telemedicine is rapidly growing to meet the increased needs for high-quality health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, telemedicine is still a sensitive issue as it is related to medical privatization. The use of telemedicine after the COVID-19 outbreak might be influenced by public opinion, and this may be an important key in implementing telemedicine. In this study, we aimed to assess if telemedicine-related newspaper articles and comments changed positively during the COVID-19 pandemic. From January 1, 2019, to March 1, 2020 (before COVID-19), a total of 1073 telemedicine-related articles were found in the Korean news network. Although the post-COVID-19 article collection period (from March 2, 2020, to September 30, 2020) was about half that of the pre-COVID-19, about twice the number (1934) of telemedicine-related articles were collected. And telemedicine-related news articles had a more positive tone post-COVID-19 than pre-COVID-19 (52.9% after vs 40.4% before). In conclusion, this study presented the association between the COVID-19 outbreak and changes in the media's perception of telemedicine in Korea. This study presented that, as telemedicine begins to be utilized due to COVID-19, news media and readers who embrace it are beginning to view telemedicine positively, suggesting that COVID-19 has a positive foundation for the spread of telemedicine.

AB  - The successful use of social media to manipulate public opinion via bots and hired individuals to spread (mis)information to unsuspecting users reached alarming levels due to the manipulations during the 2016 US elections and the Brexit deliberations in the UK. Fake interaction such as "liking" and "retweeting" are staged to foster trust in the posts of bots and individuals, which makes it difficult for individuals to detect the posts that are part of greater schemes. We propose an approach based on supervised learning to classify collections of tweets as "organized" when they inhabit premeditated intent and as "organic" otherwise. Features related to users and posting behavior are used to train the classifiers using 851 data sets totaling above 270 million tweets. Further classifiers are trained to assess the effectiveness of the selected features. The random forest algorithm persistently yielded the best results with scores greater than 95% for both accuracy and f-measure. For comparison purposes, unsupervised learning methods were used to cluster the same data sets. The Gaussian Mixture Model clustered [organized vs organic] data set with 99% agreement with the labels. The success of using only behavioral features to detect organized behavior is encouraging.

AB  - Using automated semantic network analysis, this study examines media framing of the population issue in the Philippines through the different labels used to refer to it in public discourse. The population issue has been relabeled and repackaged in legislation and other policy documents. This article examines how each relabeling of the issue was reflected in the media. Analysis of news articles published from 1987 to 2007 reveals that word clusters around each label reflect strategic framing of the terms population control, population management, family planning, reproductive health, responsible parenthood, and pro-life. Whereas population control and population management are associated with developmental and economic goals, reproductive health and family planning are more linked with women's and youth's health issues. The terms responsible parenthood and pro-life are mostly identified with the Catholic Church, with the latter more identified with positions on abortion and contraception.

AB  - This paper explores the theme of Love Jihad in "true sex crime" novels, French mass-market paperbacks where a journalist or author recounts the temoignage of women who suffered sexual violence at the hands of Muslim men. Semiotic analysis of visual and textual representations shows a melodramatic triangle of female victims, Muslim male perpetrators, and heroic readers. These stories reflect, dramatize, and sexualize broader social constructions of the monstrous Muslim; from Far-Right conspiracies of The Great Replacement to femonationalist debates about veils and republican values. In the final section, the paper explores how visual and verbal tropes from these popular discourses reappear in political speech and media from the National Rally.

AB  - ObjectiveIssues of refuge and asylum are often controversial in Australia, with misinformation, fear, and emotion often used to sway public opinion. The objective of this study was to understand individuals' willingness to advocate on asylum seeker issues.
   MethodUsing an online survey, this study investigated the attitudes, opinions, and activities of those who had signed up to a Facebook page or newsletter of an asylum seeker support organisation.
   ResultsIn total, 3,978 surveys were completed; 1,688 from people who were signed up to a regular newsletter, and 2,416 people who liked' the Facebook site. Most respondents were women, from Victoria, and were educated to at least the university level.
   ConclusionsThe findings of this study indicate that the engagement of those who had liked' the Facebook page were more Internet based, suggesting that when the cost of engaging action is low, people do little more than engage in token support, a number of interpretations for this finding are presented. Organisations need to consider how to engage this group in more meaningful support'.

AB  - Studies about Islamist-inspired terror attacks in the Western world have identified a recently declining impact on public opinion. What explains this development? I argue that the wider audience of terrorist attacks has become desensitized. Cognitive desensitization occurs when citizens increasingly expect an attack, reducing the likelihood of attitudinal change. Emotional desensitization occurs when audiences lose sensitivity to attacks, tempering emotional arousal. To assess the implications of desensitization, I analyze a survey conducted around the Berlin Christmas market attack in 2016 and account for baseline information of the surveyed individuals, an approach not used before due to data limitations. I find that attitudes like trust in government, national identification, and views of Islam remain unchanged. Sadness and anger are heightened in the immediate aftermath of the attack. The wider German audience may thus have expected an attack but still be emotionally sensitive to it in the short term. These findings are relevant as political leaders have justified important policy changes in fields like migration and even war making with reference to supposed shifts in public opinion after attacks.

AB  - Despite extensive research in product placement, little research has examined how different consumer groups respond to product placement. The present study aims to fill this gap, employing cluster analysis to segment U.S. consumers according to cognitive and attitudinal responses they have developed to advertising in general. Analyzing a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults (N = 21,944), this study identified five clusters. The clusters reflect varying responses to product placement on television and in movies, as well as distinct demographic and media usage profiles. These findings are discussed from the perspective of consumer socialization and marketplace social intelligence.

TI  - The social media response to twice-weekly mass asymptomatic testing in England

KW  - Asymptomatic testing
AB  - Background From 9th April 2021, everyone in England has been encouraged to take two COVID-19 tests per week. This is the first time that national mass asymptomatic testing has been introduced in the UK and the effectiveness of the policy depends on uptake with testing and willingness to self-isolate following a positive test result. This paper examines attitudes towards twice-weekly testing, as well as barriers and facilitators to engaging in testing. Methods Between 5th April and 28th May 2021 we searched Twitter, Facebook, and online news articles with publicly available comment sections to identify comments relating to twice-weekly testing. We identified 5783 comments which were then analysed using a framework analysis. Results We identified nine main themes. Five themes related to barriers to engaging in testing: low perceived risk from COVID-19; mistrust in the government; concern about taking a test; perceived ineffectiveness of twice-weekly testing policy; and perceived negative impact of twice-weekly testing policy. Four themes related to facilitators to engaging in testing: wanting to protect others; positive perceptions of tests; a desire to return to normal; and perceived efficacy for reducing asymptomatic transmission. Conclusions Overall, the comments identified indicated predominately negative attitudes towards the twice weekly testing policy. Several recommendations can be made to improve engagement with twice weekly testing, including: 1) communicate openly and honestly about the purpose of testing; 2) provide information about the accuracy of tests; 3) provide financial support for those required to self-isolate, and; 4) emphasise accessibility of testing.

AB  - Public opinion concerning marijuana legalization has varied greatly over time. While prior research suggests presidential drug rhetoric is related to public opinions on drugs, the relationship between the sitting president and attitudes specifically toward marijuana has not been explored. This study utilized data from the General Social Survey and the American Presidency Project to examine the relationship between the president and Americans' attitudes toward marijuana legalization from 1975 through 2016. Findings indicate that confidence in the executive branch, fear of crime, and presidential drug rhetoric predict attitudes toward legalization despite controls for other factors such as estimated levels of marijuana use and arrests. These findings are discussed in the context of prior research that suggests presidential rhetoric, drug enforcement, and fear of crime may be related to American attitudes toward marijuana legalization.

AB  - The September 2015 ousting and imprisonment of Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina and the subsequent election of television personality Jimmy Morales, who ran on an anticorruption platform, were interpreted as evidence of the salience of corruption as a popular concern in the country. Using the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) from 2006 to 2016, this article analyzes the evolution in the perception of corruption in Guatemala and its determinants to assess for changes after 2015. Perception of corruption remains a secondary concern for most Guatemalans and its determinants-age; education; rightwing ideology; and retrospective economic outlook-are stable overtime. The 2015 corruption scandal had a marginal impact on an already high perception of corruption. When perception of corruption is so widespread, the explanatory power of its determinants becomes less pronounced.

AB  - This article compares editorial and news agendas considering O Estado de S. Paulo, Folha de S. Paulo, and O Globo newspapers during the second round of the 2018 Brazilian presidential election. We study to what extent the convergence between both agendas discloses some of the political interests sponsored by news organizations. By using content analysis, we examined the thematic convergence between 144 editorials and news. The hypotheses are: H1) The news and opinion sections within each newspaper converge thematically, indicating a political instrumentalization of the journalistic practices; H2) Newspapers differ from each other when considering the topics covered in their editorials, which is not the case when their main cover stories are at stake. The results indicate that the newspapers do not present a strong convergence within their intern sections. However, there is similarity among the newspapers' opinionated agendas, which doesn't happen regarding the news coverage.

AB  - Objectives This study used thematic content analysis to examine submissions to a youth mental health website, www.itsoktotalk.in, in India.
   Setting We considered submissions made to the It's OK to Talk web platform during the first year of its operation (April 2017 March 2018), focusing specifically on website users based in India.
   Participants We analysed 37 submissions by 33 authors aged 19-31 years (mean age 22 years) from seven Indian cities (New Delhi, Lucknow, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad and Haryana). Eligible submissions were English-language first-person accounts of self-identified mental health problems, submitted in any media format for online publication by authors aged 18 years or older and who were based in India. Eight study participants were additionally involved in a focus group who contributed to the coding process and preparation of the final manuscript.
   Results Four themes were identified: (1) living through difficulties; (2) mental health in context; (3) managing one's mental health and (4) breaking stigma and sharing hope. Overall, the participants expressed significant feelings of distress and hopelessness as a result of their mental health problems; many described the context of their difficulties as resulting from personal histories or wider societal factors; a general lack of understanding about mental health; and widespread stigma and other negative attitudes. Most participants expressed a desire to overcome mental health prejudice and discrimination.
   Conclusions Personal narratives offer a window into young people's self-identified priorities and challenges related to mental health problems and recovery. Such insights can inform antistigma initiatives and other public awareness activities around youth mental health.

AB  - Increased access to information poses a threat to authoritarian rulers' hold on power. In this article, we assess the relationship between use of the Internet and foreign media on regime support in China using data from the Asian Barometer survey. Based on the O-S-O-R model, we examine whether use of the Internet and foreign media correlate with lower levels of regime support, and whether there are indirect effects of media use through trust in the Chinese government. We also examine whether these indirect effects vary by national pride. Results show indirect effects through trust for the Internet and some evidence of an indirect effect for foreign media. We also find that national pride moderates the indirect effects of Internet use.

AB  - Since the creation of the European Union, anti-immigration rhetoric has traditionally been directed at non-European citizens. However, in recent decades hostility towards migrants has been extended to the rejection of EU citizens, to whom the European treaties ostensibly guarantee freedom of movement. In particular, the migration of the largest European ethnic minority, the Roma, within the EU has been accompanied by inflamed media reports and populist discourse laden with explicitly racist sentiments. Whereas the dynamics of Romani migration in the original Member States has received substantial political and academic attention, the movement of Roma people across newer Member States continues to be overlooked. An intrinsic assumption that Romani migration is a solely westward phenomenon has led to a failure to examine the role of Central and Eastern European states in generating exclusionary policies. Despite urgent calls from human rights activists about the intensifying violation of the legal rights of Romani migrants the situation has yet to be acknowledged or scrutinized by international organizations and academics. To shed analytical light on this under-researched area, the article presents an analysis of the impact of Polish immigration regime on Romani migrants and long-time residents from Romania. Drawing on data from official documents, activist reports, and semi-structured interviews the article traces the neoliberalization of Polish migration regime: one that mobilizes aggressive attitudes and behaviors towards the poorest and most marginalized European citizens. In turn, it argues that the deterrent tactics employed against migrants by the Polish State has its roots in the increasingly restrictive EU immigration policies and economic determinism of the Freedom of Movement and Residency Directive.

AB  - This research explores migrant presentation in newspaper articles containing migrant crime. Thematic content analysis is employed to examine the narratives used in generalized negative discussion of migration in 100 randomly sampled articles from 6 newspapers in Canada, the UK, and the U.S. in 2018. We uncovered 13 themes, such as failure of the state, rapists and criminals, and terrorism. The findings highlight the type and variety of generalized negative narratives found in migrant crime reporting, and suggest the ongoing presentation of these stereotypes. Implications include the influence on public and political attitudes amidst an increasing need for media accountability.

AB  - When candidates engage in robust policy debate, it gives citizens clear choices on issues that matter. Previous studies of issue engagement have primarily used indicators of campaign strategy that are mediated by reporters (e. g., newspaper articles) or indicators that may exclude candidates in less competitive races (e. g., television advertisements). We study issue engagement with data from a unique source, congressional candidate Web sites, that are unmediated and representative of both House and Senate campaigns. We find that the saliency of issues in public opinion is a primary determinant of candidate engagement. And, despite the unique capacity of the Internet to allow candidates to explain their positions on a large number of issues, candidates continue to behave strategically, selecting a few issues on which to engage their adversaries.

AB  - Since the early 1960s, there has been a movement among activists, scholars, and policymakers to redefine racism as a psychopathological condition, identifiable and treatable through psychotherapeutic and pharmacological interventions. This development reflects, and is reflected by, the popular framing among mass media and ordinary social actors of racism and racist events as individual pathology rather than as a social problem. This shifting perspective on racism, from a social problem and a system to an individual pathology, has increasingly become a part of academic and psychiatric discourse since Jim Crow. In this article, we have two aims: first, to trace the emergence of "psychopathological racism"; second, to illustrate the relationship between "psychopathological racism" and "colorblind racism" in the post-Civil Rights era. We argue that the psychopathological view of racism compliments colorblindness in that larger structural issues are dismissed in favor of individual pathos. Furthermore, psychopathological explanations for racism dismiss socio-political contexts, eschewing the contributions of well over fifty years of social scientific research in the process.

AB  - A common European identity is an important part of the European political lexicon; however, at the institutional level, it was taken seriously only when the economic crisis, the legal challenges of EU integration, and the Brexit story encouraged a fresh look into the problem. Moreover, the European identity problem may be viewed differently from the Western and Eastern European perspectives, which helps to identify the roots of contemporary "official" and "sociological" perceptions of a common European identity. The Standard Eurobarometer (EB) questionaries were used as a proxy to analyze the interest of the EU in a common European identity. We analyzed the types of questions asked from 2004 to 2020 and took a look at the responses. The shifts in the composition of the Standard EB questionaries signal that the "official" understanding of identity is gaining ground against the "sociological" approach. The promotion by official bodies of the EU of a one-sided understanding of a common European identity, based on the Western approach, narrows the field and creates certain risks. In the face of a permanent EU-ropean unity crisis, it would not be wise to lose one of the important instruments that could be successfully used to identify the hidden challenges of the future.

AB  - How do modern individuals form a sense of the vast societies in which they live? Social cognition has evolved to make sense of small, intimate social groups, but in complex mass societies, comparable vivid social cues are scarcer. Extant research on political attitudes and behavior has emphasized media and interpersonal networks as key sources of cues. Extending a classical argument, we provide evidence for the importance of an alternative and internal source: imagination. With a focus on social welfare, we collected survey data from two very different democracies, the United States and Denmark, and conducted several studies using explicit, implicit, and behavioral measures. By analyzing the effects of individual differences in imagination, we demonstrate that political cognition relies on vivid, mental simulations that engage evolved social and emotional decision-making mechanisms. It is in the mind's eye that vividness and engagement are added to people's sense of mass politics.

AB  - Anonymous social media applications, such as Yik Yak, continue to rise in popularity, but little research has examined the individual differences and influence of online environment on different posting behaviors. 173 undergraduate students completed an anonymous online survey assessing the dark-triad, sadism, the five-factor model, online environmental factors, and different behaviors on Yik Yak (i.e., posting, trolling, confessing, lurking). Results suggested different personality and environmental factors were associated with the various posting behaviors. Trolls scored significantly higher on psychopathy, online acceptability of prejudiced comments, and lower on agreeableness; confessors scored significantly higher on neuroticism, Machiavellianism, feelings of reduced accountability online, and lower on social moral values. In contrast, lurkers scored significantly higher on conscientiousness and lower on Machiavellianism. By examining these different posting behaviors, it may be possible to identify and deter at-risk youth through education on being a good digital citizen.

AB  - Until recently, social media were seen to promote democratic discourse on social and political issues. However, this powerful communication ecosystem has come under scrutiny for allowing hostile actors to exploit online discussions in an attempt to manipulate public opinion. A case in point is the ongoing U.S. Congress investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election campaign, with Russia accused of, among other things, using trolls (malicious accounts created for the purpose of manipulation) and bots (automated accounts) to spread propaganda and politically biased information. In this study, we explore the effects of this manipulation campaign, taking a closer look at users who re-shared the posts produced on Twitter by the Russian troll accounts publicly disclosed by U.S. Congress investigation. We collected a dataset of 13 million election-related posts shared on Twitter in the year of 2016 by over a million distinct users. This dataset includes accounts associated with the identified Russian trolls as well as users sharing posts in the same time period on a variety of topics around the 2016 elections. We use label propagation to infer the users' ideology based on the news sources they share. We are able to classify a large number of the users as liberal or conservative with precision and recall above 84%. Conservative users who retweet Russian trolls produced significantly more tweets than liberal ones, about 8 times as many in terms of tweets. Additionally, trolls' position in the retweet network is stable overtime, unlike users who retweet them who form the core of the election-related retweet network by the end of 2016. Using state-of-the-art bot detection techniques, we estimate that about 5% and 11% of liberal and conservative users are bots, respectively. Text analysis on the content shared by trolls reveal that conservative trolls talk about refugees, terrorism, and Islam, while liberal trolls talk more about school shootings and the police. Although an ideologically broad swath of Twitter users were exposed to Russian trolls in the period leading up to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, it is mainly conservatives who help amplify their message.

AB  - Vaccine hesitancy is an obstacle to COVID-19 vaccination. This study aims to inform the vaccine hesitancy and analyze related factors toward COVID-19 vaccination among medical students in China, so as to provide suggestions for increasing vaccines uptake. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among medical students in a medical university and a health school. A total of 2,196 valid questionnaires were received. 41.2% vaccine hesitancy was reported among medical students in total. Female (OR = 1.336) and individuals with higher education (OR = 1.724) reported slightly higher vaccine hesitancy. Being in low-risk areas and no need to get vaccinated (OR = 2.285), fear of serious consequences of vaccination (OR = 1.929), being in good health and no need to be vaccinated (OR = 1.891), being concerned about short-term side effects (OR = 1.793) and being concerned that the vaccine was ineffective (OR = 1.694) had higher prevalence of vaccine hesitancy. Those who were believing the specialty of study or work environment made vaccination necessary (OR = 0.378), believing they were susceptible to COVID-19 (OR = 0.411) and the vaccine was free (OR = 0.519) were more willing to get vaccinated. Confidence in vaccines and perceptions of benefits and risk are associated with vaccine hesitancy. It is important to strengthen vaccine health literacy education for medical students and enhance vaccine confidence. Countries need to supervise the public opinions in social media, television broadcasting and other media, so as to ensure the correct orientation of public opinion. Open and transparent evidence-based information is also needed which can help improve the vaccination coverage rate of the public.

AB  - This study challenges the ruling orthodoxy that foreign news tends to be reported in divergent ways, reflecting the interests and identity of the home nation. Instead it concludes that the Greek and US elections in 2012 were reported in very similar ways in the leading news media of five countries located in different continents. In the case of the 2012 Chinese election, there were striking affinities in the news reporting of four out of five countries. Powerful forces that make for global conformity include the dominance of a small number of international news agencies, the emergence of a transnational journalistic culture, the hegemony of market liberal thought, the legacy of the Cold War, and the shared perspectives of allied states.

AB  - This paper reintroduces the theory of political alienation as a model for analysing and critiquing public sphere structures, arguing that commodified and professionalised media and organisational structures distance the general public from the production of public opinion and limit the public's capacity to use communication for democratic empowerment. These communication norms and practices act as a counter-force to more deliberative forms of communication and (re)create five conditions of alienation - commodification, social isolation, meaninglessness, normlessness, and powerlessness that influence what individuals know, how they interact, and who ultimately has power in the political process. Integrating literature on public opinion, deliberative democracy, mediated communication, and collective action, this paper offers an anti-normative lens for critiquing currently existing practices and understanding how contemporary communication structures operate systemically.

AB  - As U.S. news outlets grapple with the challenges of delivering news in a digital era, journalists cover elections with tighter deadlines and fewer resources. Consequently, we are seeing an explosion in coverage of polls, which require little original reporting and attract readers through their "horse race" appeal. As the number of polls increases, news professionals are culling data from a wider spectrum of sources that vary in methodology and credibility. What remains unclear is how effective the news media are in providing polling context in their online coverage that is less limited by the space and time constraints of more traditional mediums. Utilizing the 2016 U.S. primaries, this exploratory study examines online news articles focused on polls to evaluate the quality of digital coverage across national news outlets.

KW  - key opinion leaders
AB  - Background: Key opinion leaders (KOLs) are people who can influence public opinion on a certain subject matter. In the field of medical and health informatics, it is critical to identify KOLs on various disease conditions. However, there have been very few studies on this topic.
   Objective: We aimed to develop a recommender system for identifying KOLs for any specific disease with health care data mining.
   Methods: We exploited an unsupervised aggregation approach for integrating various ranking features to identify doctors who have the potential to be KOLs on a range of diseases. We introduce the design, implementation, and deployment details of the recommender system. This system collects the professional footprints of doctors, such as papers in scientific journals, presentation activities, patient advocacy, and media exposure, and uses them as ranking features to identify KOLs.
   Results: We collected the information of 2,381,750 doctors in China from 3,657,797 medical journal papers they published, together with their profiles, academic publications, and funding. The empirical results demonstrated that our system outperformed several benchmark systems by a significant margin. Moreover, we conducted a case study in a real-world system to verify the applicability of our proposed method.
   Conclusions: Our results show that doctors' profiles and their academic publications are key data sources for identifying KOLs in the field of medical and health informatics. Moreover, we deployed the recommender system and applied the data service to a recommender system of the China-based Internet technology company NetEase. Patients can obtain authority ranking lists of doctors with this system on any given disease.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of smartphone addiction in young adults, and to investigate the relationship between smartphone use, depression, anxiety, and social appearance anxiety.
   Materials and Methods: Sociodemographic data form, Smart phone Dependence Scale-Short Form, Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care-Short Form, Beck Anxiety Scale, and Social Appearance Anxiety Scale were applied face to face in this cross-descriptive study.
   Results: A total of 259 subjects, 128 (49.4%) female and 131 (50.6%) male, were included in the study. 25.9% of the participants were smartphone addicts. There was a high positive correlation between smartphone usage time and smartphone addiction score. The social appearance anxiety average scores of the social media users (30.8 +/- 13.9) were higher than those of subjects who do not use social media (28.8 +/- 11.3). Smartphone addiction scale had a positive correlation with anxiety and social appearance anxiety scores, while not with depression.
   Conclusion: Our results revealed that the purpose of smart phone usage affects people more than smartphone usage or smartphone addiction. The internet, and especially programs related to sharing one's appearance and lifestyle and applications that create an unrealistic appearance that conforms to virtual norms, can add hard-to-repair prejudices to the mind. This situation should be seen as a threat, especially for the younger generation, and is a new sociological problem worth investigating.

AB  - Premised on the argument that articulating, representing, and defending local interests is one of the normative roles for the news media, this study examines what we call the primacy of local interests to the Hong Kong media and how concern with local interests relates to the politics of press freedom in the city. More specifically, on issues involving conflict of interests between the local society and its sovereign country, most Hong Kong media have demonstrated their willingness to stand by the local society even though it could mean a need to directly confront China. This study further draws on a representative journalist survey to illustrate how, in terms of Hong Kong journalists' belief system, an orientation toward local interests is tied to liberal political attitudes, beliefs in the media's adversarial role, and perceptions of media self-censorship. The analysis suggests how various kinds of attitudes and beliefs may cluster together to serve as an important force counteracting the pressure to conform to the power center. Implications of the findings and the generality of the notion of the primacy of local interests are discussed.

TI  - Empires of Sentiment; Intimacies from Death: David Livingstone and African Slavery 'at the Heart of the Nation'
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMPERIAL AND COMMONWEALTH HISTORY
LA  - English
KW  - MEDIA
AB  - The article re-examines the death of David Livingstone. It highlights the importance of an outpouring of disinhibited emotion in 1874. Despite a shambolic funeral, a working-class underdog and an anti-slavery tradition were placed 'at the heart of the nation'. Media coverage generated the experience of intimacy from sentimentalised versions of Livingstone's death and interactions with Africans, unleashing mass empathy, moral feeling and humanitarian impulse. It was crucial to the development of Britain's soft-power empire liberalism, inspiring a powerful network, aware of public opinion, to later intervene in eastern Africa. Thus the role of emotion and emotion capital should be factored more into the history of empire.

AB  - Authoritarian regimes use censorship to prevent people from accessing unfavorable content. We argue that censorship, when detected by citizens, will have an adverse impact on their assessment of the government because censorship signals the government's inability to address the issue being censored. Using an online survey experiment conducted in China, we find that censorship awareness significantly decreases people's willingness to seek assistance from the government when needs arise. In addition, our survey respondents find a piece of news more credible when they believe that it is censored by the state. The findings suggest that censorship likely lowers people's evaluation of the government's problem-solving ability.

AB  - After several significant nuclear accidents, public attitudes toward nuclear energy technologies and facilities are considered to be one of the essential factors in the national energy and electricity policy-making process of several nations that employ nuclear energy as their key energy resource. However, it is difficult to explore and capture such an attitude, because the majority of prior studies analyzed public attitudes with a limited number of respondents and fragmentary opinion polls. In order to supplement this point, this study suggests a big data analyzing method with K-LIWC (Korean-Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count), sentiment and query analysis methods, and investigates public attitudes, positive and negative emotional statements about nuclear energy with the collected data sets of well-known social media and network services in Korea over time. Results show that several events and accidents related to nuclear energy have consistent or temporary effects on the attitude and ratios of the statements, depending on the kind of events and accidents. The presented methodology and the use of big data in relation to the energy industry is suggested as it can be helpful in addressing and exploring public attitudes. Based on the results, implications, limitations, and future research areas are presented. (C) 2018 Korean Nuclear Society, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.

AB  - Immigration policies and the treatment of immigrants and refugees are contentious issues involving uncertainty and unease. The media may take advantage of this uncertainty to create a crisis mentality in which immigrants and refugees are portrayed as enemies at the gate who are attempting to invade Western nations. Although it has been suggested that such depictions promote the dehumanization of immigrants and refugees, there has been little direct evidence for this claim. Our program of research addresses this gap by examining the effects of common media portrayals of immigrants and refugees on dehumanization and its consequences. These portrayals include depictions that suggest that immigrants spread infectious diseases, that refugee claimants are often bogus, and that terrorists may gain entry to western nations disguised as refugees. We conclude by discussing the implications of the findings for understanding how uncertainty may lead to dehumanization, and for establishing government policies and practices that counteract such effects.

TI  - 'That's What Being A Woman Is For': Opposition To Marital Rape Law Reform In Late Twentieth-Century Australia
T2  - GENDER AND HISTORY

KW  - MARRIAGE
KW  - HISTORY
AB  - From 1976 until 1994, Australian states and territories introduced a raft of reforms to sexual assault laws. Most of these were welcomed, and were seen to reflect women's changing status within a modernising society. One reform, however, was especially contentious. The British law had proclaimed that a woman could not be raped within marriage: the marital bond included a husband's right to sexual access to his wife. Following South Australia's lead, all Australian jurisdictions introduced changes to this law, making it a crime to rape a woman within marriage, either before or after separation. It was a fundamental challenge to the way familial authority was conceptualised, established and policed.
   In a period where feminism had infiltrated many layers of political and social life, we might expect that this change to the law would have been greeted with relief and even celebration. The response to changes to marital rape laws was, however, both muted and ambivalent. Even feminist groups did not offer unequivocal support, and in general public opinion was at best reserved. Further, many conservative groups understood the new laws as an assault on the sanctity of the family itself.
   Drawing on a wide range of sources in the mainstream and alternative media, as well as parliamentary debates, government enquiries, academic studies and legal reports, this paper will explore the multifarious responses to legislative change. It uncovers the complex ways sexual violence and female bodily autonomy were understood within and beyond the borders and boundaries of the home and family.

AB  - Communicators try to shape public opinion to their advantage by invoking social values. We examine a vivid example of this value framing in the debate over teaching evolution in the public schools. Supporters of intelligent design (ID) theory have pressed for greater acceptance in public schools by framing the issue as a question of fairness. A survey experiment revealed overwhelming agreement that including ID in science class is fairer than excluding it. This belief had a greater impact on tolerance for ID when the issue was framed with respect to fairness. A second study showed similar effects from a pro-ID documentary film. A final study showed that training in scientific reasoning counteracts the impact of the fairness value, thereby decreasing tolerance for ID. Combined, these studies show how political debate can be understood as a contest over which values deserve greatest consideration or emphasis.

AB  - Party identification provides citizens with an anchor from which they derive many of their political attitudes and issue preferences. But what happens when people encounter political debates that place their partisan identities and policy attitudes into conflict with one another? This article draws on an original experiment designed to study the effect of debates that cut across people's partisan identities and policy attitudes. The results show that cross-cutting debates make people less likely to engage in selective exposure, more likely to feel ambivalent toward their political party, and less likely to rely on party cues when rendering a judgment.

AB  - Antisemitism is a prototype of racially inspired hatred against minorities and a highly moral issue, particularly in Germany. Against this background, this qualitative study explored role conceptions and enactments among German journalists covering antisemitism. Interviews with 21 journalists indicated that their normally passive role conception became more interventionist when reporting on antisemitism. This more active role was enacted through a high frequency of reporting on antisemitic incidents, intensive research on the motivational backgrounds of antisemitic violence, and high levels of reflection on their word choices and the potential effects of media coverage on public opinion, the Jewish community, and potential imitators of violence. Our findings suggest conditions under which journalists may demonstrate interventionism in favor of minorities, which are as follows: (a) key events in history, (b) the national issue culture; (c) the degree to which issue characteristics make it ethically questionable for journalists to strictly follow a news media logic, (d) the concurrence of discrimination against minority members and attacks on journalists, and (e) journalists' conviction that the issue at stake indicates a dangerous transformation of a country's society.

AB  - This article is based on the premise that journalists play an important role as mediators of scientific information and their interpretations of climate change influence media debates and public opinion. The study maps the minds of climate journalists from five different countries (Germany, India, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and different types of leading media outlets. It identifies five cognitive frames that vary between attributing the responsibility for climate change to lobbying and national interests, blaming consumerist culture and the capitalist system, and expressing technological optimism. The study provides evidence for the emergence of a sustainability frame, indicates a blame game between industrialized countries and emerging economies, and shows the demand for a global ecological discourse. Finally, it explores how individual factors such as specialization, professional aims, and political alignment correlate with the cognitive frames of journalists.

AB  - Cultural globalization affects most people around the world in contemporary, modern societies. The resulting intercultural contact have been examined using the theory of globalization-based acculturation. However, little is known about possible differences and similarities in processes underlying the effects of direct (e.g., through contact with immigrants) and indirect (e.g., engagement with cultural elements through media) forms of new cultural exposure. Drawing on the contact hypothesis, social identity theory, and symbolic threat theory, we examined whether perceived intercultural threat and local and global identities would explain whether both forms of contact result in multicultural acquisition or in ethnic protection. In Study 1 (N = 402), indirect, but not direct, intercultural contact was positively associated with multicultural acquisition; and both types of intercultural contact were negatively linked with ethnic protection. Global identity significantly mediated the association of both direct and indirect intercultural contact with both multicultural acquisition and ethnic protection, whereas perceived cultural threat only significantly mediated the associations of direct intercultural contact with multicultural acquisition and ethnic protection. In Study 2 (N = 424), higher levels of ethnic protection, and lower levels of multicultural acquisition, emerged in the experimental group primed with indirect, versus direct, intercultural contact. Furthermore, intercultural threat was negatively, and global identity positively, associated with multicultural acquisition, while intercultural threat was positively, and global identity negatively, associated with ethnic protection. Results are discussed in relation to similarities and differences across direct and indirect intercultural contact, providing a nuanced understanding of contemporary intercultural contact and globalization-based acculturation among majority populations.

AB  - Coal power plant-based energy production has declined dramatically since 2011, leading to calls from some politicians for government subsidies to support unprofitable coal power plants. This study is the first to use a nationally representative sample to assess American public support for subsidizing coal power plants. We find moderate public opposition overall along with a partisan divide, with liberal opposition and conservative support. In addition, messages that frame coal subsidies as contributing to air pollution vs. climate change do not have a differential effect on policy support, nor is there moderation by political ideology on the message frame. Finally, the level of political polarization around subsidizing coal power plants is similar in magnitude to public polarization around whether climate change should be a national priority - one of the most polarizing issues today. Overall, results suggest that policy proposals to subsidize coal power production, regardless of how they are framed, are likely to be acceptable to conservatives but draw liberal opposition.

AB  - In line with Allport's contact hypothesis, previous research showed that direct intergroup contact can reduce prejudices. However, establishing face-to-face contact is not always feasible. We postulate that Facebook-groups are a setting where direct and observed intergroup contact can develop, reducing prejudices and increasing mutual acceptance. Analyzing the comments of nine Facebook-groups with the destructive and constructive conflict scale, our results indicated that the expression of prejudices decreased and that of mutual acceptance increased over time, both for in- and outgroup members of the Facebook-groups. Only the expression of less prejudices, but not that of more mutual acceptance was predicted by intergroup contact. The influence of group-based motivations on the engagement in intergroup contact is discussed, and the overall findings are integrated in Steele and Brown's process model of media practices.

AB  - What is the appeal of joining online communities obsessed with images of enemies and filled with threatening narratives? Doving and Emberland's article introduces the term 'conspiracy talk' as a useful analytical concept for answering this question. The activities of radical and populist right-wing groups in Europe have increased in recent years; in particular, they use the Internet to propagate, discuss and enhance their ideological message. On Facebook and in comments on 'alternative' news sites, individuals share narratives about how an invasion of Muslims will lead to the imminent downfall of European civilization unless it is not rescued by the introduction of authoritarian, ethnic nationalism. The ideology of the far right is a growing field for research but there are few studies on how the ideology is spread and rendered meaningful via discussions and comments among Internet-based communities. This article, based on analyses of the content of various websites and Facebook pages that are part of the far-right landscape of Norway, seeks to explore the role conspiracy claims play in conversations taking place within these virtual communities. It attempts to identify patterns of communication and ways of talking that make conspiratorial notions seem reasonable. Doving and Emberland argue that radical-right and right-wing populist ideas are made relevant and gain a sense of immediacy through conspiracy talk. Conspiracy talk renders conspiracy narratives meaningful by linking them to the local contexts of the participants.

AB  - Political trust is an important indicator of regime support. However, we have yet to fully understand the sources and consequence of varying levels of trust in specific political institutions. Difference in political trust at national and local levels is especially important for understanding authoritarian systems. Focusing on China, this article examines different levels of trust in the central and local governments. Building on existing research that consistently finds high central trust with lower local trust, this article investigates whether the trust sources differ and the consequence on regime support. Using survey data, it finds that national economic evaluation is positively associated with trust at both levels. Perceived corruption at respective levels is negatively correlated with trust. Citizens who use the Internet more tend to trust the central government less, while those who perceive high quality of public services tend to trust their local governments more. However, citizens who trust the central government but distrust their local governments tend to show less regime support. This suggests that instead of simply blaming local governments for incompetency or wrongdoing, citizens' local distrust weakens regime support.

AB  - In 2020, men in Turkey murdered 300 women, and 171 women were found suspiciously dead. The dominant narrative around suspicious death cases involves a faulty assumption that women are prone to committing suicide. Women's organisations and cause lawyers unite against all kinds of violence to challenge this dominant narrative, which grants impunity to perpetrators. Drawing on resource mobilisation theory, this article investigates how women's organisations become involved in femicide and suspicious death cases to articulate counter-narratives and advance women's access to justice. It focuses on Sule cet's case, which raised intense public reactions due to the lack of procedural fairness at the investigation stage. It relies on semi-structured interviews with Sule's lawyer and the members of the We Will Stop Femicide Platform (Kadin Cinayetlerini Durduracagiz Platformu) and the Gelincik Centre (Gelincik Merkezi) to illustrate how women's organisations made Sule's story visible and countered the dominant narrative surrounding suspicious death cases. The findings illustrate that women's organisations' ongoing struggle to encourage courts to hear women's stories demands co-operation between different social and legal mechanisms. It includes a combination of several strategies, such as following femicide cases and forming public opinion through social media. The article concludes by arguing that women's organisations' use of counter-narratives transforms femicide cases from being only a statistic to a public cause, contributing to women's struggle in accessing justice.

KW  - public opinion
AB  - Over the last twenty years, there has been a tremendous amount written on negativity in political campaigns. Yet, there is a conceptual disconnect between the definition of negativity used by researchers and how citizens define negativity. In this article, we show how large this disparity is and what its consequences are. Using a nationally representative online survey of 17,400 Americans and nearly 100 scholars of American politics who viewed presidential ads from the 2012 general election, we show that citizen perceptions of negativity are much stronger predictors of political participation than scholar codings of negativity. This means researchers need to give serious thought to how they operationalize negativity in their work. If we have any interest in understanding how voters are affected by campaign information that they perceive as being negative, then we must collect data consistent with the public's understanding of negativity. Otherwise, we risk the continuation of this conceptual disconnect.

AB  - Purpose The spread of fake news on social networking sites (SNS) poses a threat to the marketing landscape, yet little is known about how fake news affect consumers' perceptions, attitudes and behaviors. This study aims to explore when consumers believe fake news, whom they blame for it (e.g. negative attitudes toward brands or SNS) and when they choose to share it. Design/methodology/approach Data obtained from 80 open-ended, semistructured interviews, conducted with SNS consumers and experts, is analyzed following the principles of grounded theory and the Gioia methodology. Findings Factors affecting consumers' perceptions of fake news include skepticism, awareness, previous experience, appeal and message cues. Consumers' brand- and SNS-related attitudes are affected by consumers' blame, which is determined by consumers' perceptions of the vetting efforts, role and ethical obligation of SNS. Consumers' motives for sharing fake news include duty, retaliation, authentication and status-seeking. Theoretical and practical implications derived from the study's novel conceptual framework are discussed. Practical implications This study identifies communication strategies that marketing professionals can use to mitigate and counter the negative effects of fake news. Originality/value By simultaneously considering consumers' perceptions of the source, information and medium (i.e. SNS), this study presents a novel conceptual framework providing a marketing-centered, dynamic view on consumers' fake news experience and connecting consumers' perceptions, attitudes and behaviors in the context of fake news.

AB  - Low organ donation rates are a major obstacle to the expansion of transplant opportunities in the Middle East. Awareness and opinion about organ donation affect willingness to donate. This study aims to evaluate public attitudes and knowledge about deceased organ donation (DOD) in Jordan in support of larger efforts to increase donor rates. A mixed qualitative and quantitative approach was used. Qualitative, one-on-one interviews were used to create a quantitative survey, which was administered to randomly-selected individuals over a 5-month period. The questionnaire used series of statements to evaluate knowledge and attitude about DOD on a scaling system and converted to scores (0-4). A total of 15 qualitative interviews and 500 quantitative surveys (78.4% response rate) were completed. Only 78 (15.6%) knew they could donate their organs after death. Only 49 (9.8%) were registered as donors, although 373 (74.6%) knew about the registration process. Internet (52.2%) and social media (51.0%) were the most common sources of information. The overall knowledge score was moderately high at 68.8% (2.75 +/- 1.31). Misconceptions persisted about body disfigurement, diagnostic accuracy of brain-death, and waiting list equity. The total attitude score was moderately positive at 65.8% (2.63 +/- 0.02). Public awareness campaigns (85.3%, 3.42 +/- 0.95) and regulatory legislation (78.8%, 3.15 +/- 0.99) were considered especially positive, while negative attitudes about religious importance of educational campaigns and regulatory legislation and would likely benefit from information from health-care providers and religious leaders.

AB  - Exploring both debates about misrecognition and explorations of encounters, this article focuses on the experiences of ethnic and religious minority young people who are mistaken for being Muslim in Scotland. We explore experiences of encountering misrecognition, including young people's understandings of, and responses to, such encounters. Recognizing how racism and religious discrimination operate to marginalize peopleand how people manage and respond to thisis crucial in the struggle for social justice. Our focus is on young people from a diversity of ethnic and religious minority groups who are growing up in urban, suburban, and rural Scotland, 382 of whom participated in forty-five focus groups and 224 interviews. We found that young Sikhs, Hindus, and other south Asian young people as well as black and Caribbean young people were regularly mistaken for being Muslim. These encounters tended to take place at school, in taxis, at the airport, and in public spaces. Our analysis points to a dynamic set of interconnected issues shaping young people's experiences of misrecognition across a range of mediatized, geopoliticized, and educational spaces. Geopolitical events and their representation in the media, the homogenization of the south Asian community, and the lack of visibility offered to non-Muslim ethnic and religious minority groups all worked to construct our participants as Muslims. Young people demonstrated agency and creativity in handling and responding to these encounters, including using humor, clarifying their religious affiliation, social withdrawal, and ignoring the situation. Redressing misrecognition requires institutional change to ensure parity of participation in society.

AB  - In a global crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world are dependent on voluntary support of their citizens. Based on a four-wave panel survey conducted in the Netherlands between April and July 2020 (n = 1742), this study investigates the development of citizens' engagement in prosocial political activities and what motivates such acts of political participation. With previous research indicating strong relationships between news as well as social media use and political participation, we test whether these types of information consumption drive participation over time. The spread of misinformation during the COVID-19 crisis, however, was described as an "infodemic". The study therefore explores how holding misinformation beliefs directly and indirectly affects participation in COVID-19 related activities.

AB  - How can we explain the persuasiveness of populist messages, and who are most susceptible to their effects? These questions remain largely unanswered in extant research. This study argues that populist messages are characterized by assigning blame to elites in an emotionalized way. As previous research pointed at the guiding influence of blame attributions and emotions on political attitudes, these message characteristics may explain populism's persuasiveness. An experiment using a national sample (N = 721) was conducted to provide insights into the effects of and mechanisms underlying populist blame attribution with regard to the European and national levels of governance. The results show that emotionalized blame attributions influence both blame perceptions and populist attitudes. Identity attachment moderates these effects: Emotionalized blame attributions have the strongest effects for citizens with weaker identity attachments. These insights allow us to understand how populist messages affect which citizens.

AB  - The success of the extreme right in France in the past two decades has not been limited to its electoral rise. A more long-lasting victory has taken place in the ideological field, where the discourse of the extreme right now occupies a prominent place in the mainstream liberal democratic agenda. Increasingly, its ideas are seen in the media and in the platforms of mainstream parties as common sense' or at least acceptable. The growing acceptance of this common sense' is the result of very carefully crafted strategies put in place by extreme-right thinkers since the 1980s. For over three decades now, in order to change perceptions and renew extreme right-wing ideology, New Right think tanks such as the French GRECE believed it was necessary to borrow the tactics of the left and, more specifically, the Gramscian concept of hegemony: cultural power must precede political power. With the use of contemporary examples, Mondon's article demonstrates the continuing impact these ideas have had on the Front national and French politics and society, and how this change originated in the association of populist rhetoric with the neo-racist stigmatization of the Other.

AB  - This article demonstrates that public opinion on migration "at home" is systematically driven by terrorism in other countries. Although there is little substantive evidence linking refugees or migrants to most recent terror attacks in Europe, news about terrorist attacks can trigger more negative views of immigrants. However, the spatial dynamics of this process are neglected in existing research. We argue that feelings of imminent danger and a more salient perception of migration threats do not stop at national borders. The empirical results based on spatial econometrics and data on all terrorist attacks in Europe for the post-9/11 period support these claims. The effect of terrorism on migration concern is strongly present within a country but also diffuses across states in Europe. This finding improves our understanding of public opinion on migration, as well as the spillover effects of terrorism, and it highlights crucial lessons for scholars interested in the security implications of population movements.

AB  - Heart transplant providers often focus on post-transplant outcomes when making donor decisions, potentially at the expense of higher waitlist mortality. This study aimed to assess public opinion regarding the selection of donor hearts and the balance between pre- and post-transplant risk. The authors generated a survey to investigate public opinion regarding donor acceptance. The survey was shared freely online across social media platforms in April-May 2019. A total of 718 individuals responded to the survey, with an equal distribution between patients and family members. Respondents consistently favored post-transplant outcomes over waitlist outcomes. About 83.9% of respondents favored a hospital with longer waitlist times, worse waitlist outcomes, but excellent post-transplant survival over a hospital with short waitlist times, a high waitlist survival, and inferior post-transplant survival. This preference was no different between pediatric and adult populations (P = .7), patient and family members (P = .935), or those with a pre- vs post-transplant perspective (P = .985). Patients and their family members consistently favor improved post-transplant survival over waitlist survival when considering the risks of accepting a donor organ. These findings suggest that current practice patterns of donor selection align with the opinions of patients and family members with heart failure or who have undergone heart transplantation.

AB  - Current research suggests a link between negative attitudes toward women and violence against women, and it also suggests that media may condition such negative attitudes. When considering the tremendous and continued growth of video game sales, and the resulting proliferation of sexual objectification and violence against women in some video games, it is lamentable that there is a dearth of research exploring the effect of such imagery on attitudes toward women. This study is the first study to use actual video game playing and control for causal order, when exploring the effect of sexual exploitation and violence against women in video games on attitudes toward women. By employing a Solomon Four-Group experimental research design, this exploratory study found that a video game depicting sexual objectification of women and violence against women resulted in statistically significant increased rape myths acceptance (rape-supportive attitudes) for male study participants but not for female participants.

AB  - A growing body of research documents the crucial role played by moral concerns in the formation of attitudes and a wide range of political behaviors. Yet extant models of moral judgment portray a direct linkage between moral intuitions and policy attitudes, leaving little room for the influence of political context. In this article, we argue that political rhetoric plays an important role in facilitating the connection between moral intuitions and political attitudes. Using a unique combination of media content analysis of the stem cell debate and individual-level measures of the public's moral foundations, we examine the role of rhetoric in linking a person's moral foundations to his or her attitudes. Our results show that individuals who are the most likely to have been exposed to political rhetoric have the strongest connection between their moral foundations and their attitudes on the issue. We also find that rhetoric was persuasive on this moralized issue and present suggestive evidence that it was most persuasive among those who endorsed the relevant moral foundation.

Findings indicated that both deliberate reasoning and information shortcuts were in play; but the process was moderated by a person's education level. The well educated were more likely than the less educated to engage in deliberate reasoning when shaping their support for GM foods. Implications of the findings are discussed in detail.

AB  - The Internet brings new opportunities and challenges to scientific development and science communication. Previous studies overwhelmingly focused on individual-level Internet factors but overlooked the potential explanatory strength of Internet context. This study addresses the existing gap by examining how the Internet influences Chinese people's scientific optimism from a comprehensive perspective (Internet as a medium and Internet as a context). Multilevel models were built based on individual-provincial merged data. The results indicate that (1) the Internet context impairs scientific optimism while Internet exposure has no significant effect. (2) The relationship between individual Internet exposure and scientific optimism varies by province. As a quantitative indicator of Internet context, Internet penetration mitigates the weakening effect of individual Internet exposure on scientific optimism. This research provides empirical evidence on scientific attitude formation in the non-Western environment and expands the analytic approach of public attitudes toward science.

Vector autoregression models and Granger causality tests reveal that (1) news tone (NT) relates to real-world indicators; (2) PEs for the general economy and unemployment are partly set by the tone of news on the general economy, especially during recession times; and (3) PEs can forecast the future real-world economy.

AB  - This comparative content analysis of Belgian and Swedish newspaper coverage of the 'refugee situation' in 2015 (N=898) revolves around responsibility indicators, news actor characteristics, and thematic emphasis. As they are a potential influential factor in the public-opinion formation process, the studying of media portrayals is an essential first step in investigating the dynamic interplay between media discourse and societal reactions. Belgium and Sweden differ with respect to migration policy, integration indicators, and the number of incoming refugees. They also differ in terms of journalistic cultural values. As a result, they make for an excellent case study of intercultural differences and similarities in how refugees are reported on. Our analysis made clear that Belgian news coverage shows regional diversity, with Francophone Belgian journalists showing more tolerance towards migrants and thus tending to be more in line with their Swedish counterparts. Still, refugees are seldom allowed to speak for themselves. This warrants attention and action by news professionals.

AB  - By analyzing variability in credibility assessments of news outlets CNN and FOX, this study extends prior research focusing on perceptions of credibility for a single media source. Using national survey data from 2006 and 2008, we find that demographic and political characteristics help to explain different patterns of perceived credibility. Those detecting larger differences between CNN and FOX are more politically knowledgeable and hold more polarized political attitudes. Some findings coincide with research on overall news media trust. Yet other findings demonstrate the importance of considering different patterns. Liberal Democrats were more likely than conservative Republicans to find neither network particularly credible, for example. We also examine the connection between selective exposure and credibility. We find evidence that credibility perceptions for both networks mediate the relationship between political predispositions and cable news use.

AB  - The ideologically objectionable premise model posits that biased political judgments can emerge across the political spectrum. Previous tests of ideological differences in political judgment biases have utilized between-subjects designs (i.e., separate comparisons). In this study (N = 410), we examined whether these biases also emerge in within-subjects designs (i.e., joint comparisons) and compared the strengths of judgment biases in between-subjects and within-subjects designs. Across designs, both liberals and conservatives favored sympathetic over unsympathetic targets in scenario judgments, but biases were attenuated in the within-subjects design. No ideological differences in bias strength emerged, although liberals reported a stronger internal motivation to respond without prejudice toward ideologically dissimilar others. Further, consistent with the ideological conflict hypothesis, both liberals and conservatives were prejudiced toward ideologically dissimilar targets, although biases in prejudice ratings were stronger among liberals than conservatives. Together, results support the ideological symmetry perspective on political bias and prejudice.

AB  - There is a growing interest in journalism studies in metajournalistic discourse-that is, sites where journalists construct the boundaries and norms of their field. This study highlights a hitherto unstudied site of such discourse: the briefs of amicus curiae that news organizations file in U.S. appellate courts. While other forms of metajournalistic discourse seek to influence journalistic or public opinion, amicus briefs represent an attempt by journalists to influence judicial opinion and, consequently, the laws affecting U.S. journalism. Our analysis of 168 briefs finds that journalism amici employed a strategy that relied most heavily on several different variations of a discourse of inclusion, while a discourse of exclusion was used sparingly as an auxiliary to discourses of inclusion.

AB  - Purpose - Attempting to explore the role of direct experience in influencing disaster consciousness and public opinion, the purpose of this paper is to carry out comparative analyses of Japanese people's knowledge, risk perception, and policy preference about large-scale earthquake disaster before and after the Great East Japan Earthquake. More importantly, aiming to provide implications regarding the application of past experience, the predictive power of direct experience on disaster consciousness is also examined.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study analyzed parts of the data collected from two nationwide public opinion surveys among Japanese conducted by the Japanese Government. Analyses of variance were performed to examine changes in disaster consciousness. A path model was developed to examine the predicted effects of direct experience. chi(2) tests were performed to examine changes in strategy preference.
   Findings - This study found significant changes in Japanese people's knowledge of natural hazards and perception of mega disaster risk. Tests of the path model suggested significant positive effect of societal level impact on disaster consciousness and strong predictive power of knowledge on risk perception. Significant changes in strategy preference were also found.
   Practical implications - Results supported the predictive power of direct experience, highlighting the significance of recalling past experience as well as creating indirect experience to raise public consciousness and motivate appropriate actions.
   Originality/value - This is one of the few studies that investigate changes in public opinion among Japanese before and after the Great East Japan Earthquake.

AB  - This research agenda starts from the observation that, in most political science research, the salience which citizens, interest groups, policymakers and the media attach to policymaking processes on specific policies is usually measured for just one actor type. As a consequence, it is difficult to assess the extent to which the salience attributions of citizens, interest groups, the media and/or policymakers are interrelated. We thus undertake an explorative analysis of the salience attributions of these actors for a sample of 125 European Union legislative policies. We find considerable differences but also some interdependencies across actor types in the salience that they attach to specific policies. Based on these findings, we suggest a research agenda that investigates different actor types' salience attributions synchronically and dynamically. Research along these routes has the potential to shed light on varying levels of European Union-level political mobilization and the conditions that lead to unequal policy influence.

AB  - Public evaluations of EU performance are not only critical indicators of the EU's output legitimacy, but also shape future support for European integration. For citizens to monitor the political performance of the EU they need relevant facts, yet it is anything but clear that gains in information about EU performance cause change in judgements about such performance. Drawing on two-wave panel data, this article examines whether acquiring information following a real-world EU decision-making event alters citizens' judgements about the utilitarian and democratic performance of the EU. It also examines how this effect differs for people with different levels of general political information. It is found that citizens who acquired performance-relevant information became more approving of the EU's utilitarian performance but did not change their judgements about its democratic performance. Also, individuals with moderate levels of general political information were affected most strongly by new facts about performance. The implications of these findings for EU-level representative democracy are considered.

AB  - This exploratory study investigates the opinions of mothers who have at least one child between the ages of 7 and 12 in terms of the impact of TV food advertising on their children. This research also examines whether there is any third person effect active in mothers' opinions of TV food advertising aimed at children by asking them about both the impact on their own children, and the children of strangers. The results reveal that most mothers in the study have generally negative attitudes toward TV food advertising aimed at children, but they believe that the children of strangers are more negatively impacted by exposure to the ads than their own children.

AB  - This article explores racial exclusion, bias, and prejudice in the context of same-sex mobile dating, focusing on the experiences of a group of Australian-based Chinese queer women. Semi-structured in-depth interviews and participant observation were used to examine participants' racialized experiences. The findings indicate that Western dating apps, such as Tinder, Bumble, and HER, served as crucial channels of these women's interracial and intercultural encounters while living in Australia. However, they largely perceived these apps, and HER in particular, as White-dominated and ill-suited to their dating practices, thus reinforcing their sense of exclusion and ostracism. Although the participants frequently encountered subtle prejudice on dating apps, they experienced more blatant and aggressive forms of racism triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple factors, including their language capability, the COVID-19 pandemic, and their racial, ethnic, and diasporic identities, played an intersectional role in these women's racialized experiences. Correspondingly, the participants developed diverse interpretations of and responses to their racialized experiences. This study reveals how the anti-Asian racism in the global West permeates the realm of queer women in the context of mobile dating. It contributes to understanding the digital dating practices and racialized experiences of queer women and the broader Chinese diaspora.

AB  - This article provides an overview of the role think tanks play in shaping public opinion and policies favoring economic and social inequalities. Despite increasing interest in think tanks as media and public opinion setters, the research so far has been mostly policy oriented and the communications perspective underresearched. This article addresses this communication research gap by conducting a literature review on the role played by discourse coalitions of think tanks in three main areas: climate change contrarianism, financial austerity, and speciesism. The article also provides a short overview of the critical theoretical perspectives behind the review and suggests ways for critical communication scholars to contribute. Research conducted to date reveals that conservative and industry-linked think tanks have a greater ability to build network coalitions and have been very successful in global discourse creation processes favoring elites.

AB  - Journalists tend to serialize political scandals and publish scandalous information bit by bit instead of all at once in a single news article. Disseminating scandalous information in a serialized way may affect readers' perceptions of the scandal and the politicians involved in it independently of the information that is conveyed. To test this assumption, an experiment was conducted. All participants were exposed to identical scandalous information. However, the form of presentation-exposure to one, two, three, four, or five article(s)-was systematically manipulated. Serialization indeed indirectly increased participants' negative attitudes about the politician via the perceived scandal's importance, participants' reading duration, cognitive elaboration, and intensity of negative emotions.

AB  - This article explores how computers and the Internet are represented among young, educated people in Niger and the social expectations that are attached to their use. It argues that pre-existing social and economic conditions play an important role in shaping the meanings associated with these devices. Thus, in a context of poverty and unemployment, the Internet and computers are perceived as technologies that may help young people and their country integrate into a modern world of economic opportunities and well-being via the transnational and transcultural interactions that take place in cyberspace. The Internet is associated with the ideas of modernity and 'leapfrogging' development. However, because of the lack of computer equipment and adequate infrastructure, these expectations are largely exaggerated, and they divert attention from the actual possibilities for change that reside in people and not in technological devices. The research is based on fieldwork conducted among young, educated computer and Internet users during the summers of 2003 and 2004 in Niamey, the capital city of Niger and further complemented by data collected in 2008. Semistructured interviews were used to explore the reception of the Internet and the representations associated with them. Although the term 'educated' may sometimes refer to traditional or Arabic/Islamic education in Niger, we restricted the use of the word to refer to modern western-style education (without prejudice or pejorative label to those who are not in that category).

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare Americans' fear of terrorism to fear of violent crimes (i.e., murder, mass shooting, and gang violence). Previous research suggested that similarities exist between terrorism and violent crimes, yet no study has compared the fear aspects of terrorism and violence in the United States. Using nationally representative data from the 2018 Americans' Fears Survey (N = 1,190), we compared fear of terrorism to fear of violent crimes with a main focus on the effects of exposure to the media, political views, and religiosity of the adult Americans. The results of the analyses showed the roles of online media, religiosity, and politics differed significantly in shaping the sampled Americans' fear of terrorism when compared to their fear of violent crimes. Despite the resemblance of terrorism and violence, the fear arising from the political nature of terrorism as a crime distinguishes the nature of fear from violent crimes.

AB  - One important strategy human rights organizations (HROs) employ to draw attention to human rights abuses is "naming and shaming." By calling attention to government human rights violations, HROs hope to galvanize world public opinion and increase pressure on repressive regimes to halt abuses. While some HROs, like Amnesty International, communicate directly with their large membership bases, the vast majority of HROs rely on the media to transmit their message to the international community. Issuing reports and press releases are a major part of their efforts to make the international community aware of abuses. the more media coverage an HRO's reports and press releases receive, the more their message is "amplified." This article first develops a theory about how certain characteristics of the HRO and its targets matter for the organization's ability to amplify its message. The article then develops a new measure of "amplification" and uses this new measure to evaluate the factors that contribute to the amplification of HRO messages in the international media.

AB  - The current increase in government spending, caused by COVID epidemics and the increasing visibility of leftist political groups in public media, emphasizes the short-term need for sustainable income taxation. In the long run, rising inequality worldwide makes taxation of high-incomes indispensable for sustainable economic development. This paper empirically studies public attitudes on taxation related to income, preferences for solidarity vs. individual performance, and reliance on the state in the Czech Republic. In this Eastern European country, the dichotomies above bear even more importance due to the communist past. We apply the hierarchical regression analysis with smoothing spline transformations to a representative sample of public opinion data (N = 1104, aged 15-95 years, M +/- SD: 47.74 +/- 17.39; 51.2% women, 18.50% with higher education). The results suggest that income was associated with the perception that taxes for the rich are inadequately high but was unrelated to perceptions of tax adequacy for average and poor groups of respondents. Higher solidarity and reliance on the state were associated with the desire to increase taxation of high-incomes and decrease taxation of poor income groups. Surprisingly, the reliance on the state was associated with a desire to decrease taxation of average-incomes and total taxation while increasing tax progressivity. Preferences for solidarity were associated with higher preferred overall taxation and more tax progressivity. The explanatory powers of preferences for solidarity and reliance on the state in explaining the variation in tax preferences are at least equivalent and, in some cases, twice as large as the explanatory power of the age, gender, education, and income altogether. The results above present new mechanisms that can contribute to sustainable endogenous economic development.

AB  - Most studies of the news discourse surrounding territorial disputes focus on the domestic newspapers of the conflicting countries from the perspective of us and them. This study examines how the newspapers of foreign countries discursively construct a territorial dispute within the framework of an intergroup conflict schema. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of articles on the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands dispute published online in five newspapers of record (the New York Times, the Guardian, the Sydney Morning Herald, Le Monde, and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung) reveals two main points: First, the articles published by these newspapers share a similar intergroup conflict schema that is based on competition and the pursuit of national interests as interpreted in conformance with the national interests of the respective countries (USA, UK, Australia, France, and Germany). Second, in terms of how news discourse is framed, there are noticeable differences between the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and the other four which may reflect the influence of Germany's socio-historical context on domestic public opinion.

TI  - A critical appraisal of heterosexism in Zambia
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
LA  - English
AB  - On 24 February 2012, then United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Zambia for three days. His call to respect human rights and give protection to all people regardless of sexual orientation was received mostly with hostility by the Zambian public. The media was inundated with opposing press statements from both government and civil society persons and entities. Politicians, church leaders, and the public widely condemned Ban's advocacy for gay rights. Although the debate on homosexuality is not new in Zambia, there is a dearth of research on the subject. This paper seeks, modestly, to re-examine popular rationale for heterosexism to contribute to the resolution of one of the perennial problems colouring African political, social, and cultural discourse. By deconstructing the popular views and systematising the debate, the paper aims at providing a baseline and guideline for addressing the problem of heterosexism in Zambia. Without suggesting that Africa is homogenous, what happened in Zambia following Ban's visit could have predictably happened in many African countries, notably Uganda and Nigeria. This paper, however, uses Zambia as a point of reference. The paper relies on views indicating negative attitudes and beliefs that legislators, and policy makers, church leaders and ordinary citizens have toward homosexuality. These positions have been thematised into six major grounds for the sexual prejudices against homosexuality. These are subjected to logical and epistemic scrutiny. Ultimately, the arguments in support of heterosexism are shown to be untenable.

AB  - Background Mental illnesses pose a significant burden worldwide. Furthermore, the treatment gap for mental disorders is large. A contributor to this treatment gap is the perceived stigma towards mental illness. Besides impeding one's help-seeking intentions, stigma also impairs persons with mental illness (PMI) in other aspects of their life. Studies have found that stigma may manifest differentially under different cultural contexts. Thus, this study seeks to elucidate the determinants of stigma towards PMI among lay public in Singapore using a qualitative approach. Methods A total of 9 focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted with 63 participants consisting of lay public Singaporeans who were neither students or professionals in the mental health field, nor had they ever been diagnosed with a mental illness. Topics discussed during the FGD were related to the stigma of mental illness. Data collected were analyzed with inductive thematic analysis method. A codebook was derived through an iterative process, and data was coded by 4 different coders. Both coding and inter-rater analysis were performed with NVivo V.11. Results In total, 11 themes for the determinants of stigma were identified and conceptualized into a socioecological model. The socioecological model comprised 4 levels of themes: 1) Individual level beliefs (fear towards PMI, perceiving PMI to be burdensome, dismissing mental illness as not a real condition), 2) Interpersonal influences (upbringing that instills stigma, intergroup bias, perceived inability to handle interactions with PMI), 3) Local cultural values (elitist mindset among Singaporeans, Chinese culture of "face", Islamic beliefs about spiritual possession and reaction towards PMI), and 4) Shared societal culture (negative portrayal by media, Asian values). Conclusions The findings of this study improved our understanding of the various reasons why stigma exists in Singapore. The themes identified in this study concur with that of studies conducted overseas, as some determinants of stigma such as fear towards PMI are quite ubiquitous. Specifically, the themes elitist mindset among Singaporeans and perceived inability to handle interactions with PMI were unique to this study. It is highly recommended that future anti-stigma campaigns in Singapore should incorporate the findings of this study to ensure cultural misgivings and beliefs are addressed adequately.

AB  - More and more people make opinions on air quality on social media, as science develops and the seriousness of air quality issues. Studies on sentiment analysis keyed to this kind of public opinions will do help in the introduction and perfection of policy of air quality. The evaluation of opinions sentiment is still a hard point in at this stage. There are only a few researches about the factors of the value of opinions sentiment. This article uses opinions related to air quality from Sina Weibo (Chinese Twitter) users, by online questionnaire surveys, and studies the results of opinions sentiment value about air quality in different groups, aiming at doing a research on the evaluation influence factors of opinions sentiment value on air quality. Furthermore, we came up with a solution synthesizing the influential level to calculate opinions sentiment value. We found amounts of respondents had a negative attitude to the opinions. We can now say with some confidence that education is the most significant influence factor on the public to tell the degree of sentiment level of air quality opinions. The sentiment calculation method where we come up could reduce the one-sidedness of different individuals' evaluations of the same opinion to some extent. The research could be reference for air quality management from the perspective of public opinion sentiment analysis.

AB  - Anti-EU sentiment has been sweeping the continent recently. Since the beginning of the 1990s, Euroscepticism has been rising in national and European party politics, the European public opinion, national referendums as well as in the European media coverage sceptically criticising the European integration and its achievements. Under those conditions, when the EU is also suffering from an existential crisis, Euroscepticism has become much more mainstream in European politics. In this framework, this study discusses mainstreaming Euroscepticism at the levels of political parties, public and the media. It starts with the puzzle of contested meanings of Euroscepticism. Then, it unravels the complexity and diversity of opposition towards Europe by focusing on the typologies of Euroscepticism.Finally, it shows how Euroscepticism occupies a prominent space in European politics, society and media. Overall, the paper argues that Euroscepticism has become increasingly embedded in the mainstream political debates throughout Europe.

LA  - English
AB  - This study offers a critical analysis of ways women were represented during the peak of protests associated with the Tunisian civil resistance campaign in North Africa from late 2010 through early 2011 among newspapers, wire services, and blogs-launch of the Arab Spring (or Arab Awakening). Theoretical underpinning includes norm theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1982) and gender role congruity theory (Eagly & Karau, 2002), as well as Gans's (1979) concept of social order as an enduring news value. Enjoined, these frameworks facilitate interrogation of print and visual texts to reveal characterizations of women and how the outcomes may have shaped public opinion on the global stage. Seven themes describe media representations of women among written and photographic reportage: Female Victims, Comparatively Lucky Women, Frivolous Girls, Female Culprits, Invisible Women, Women as Agentic Leaders, and Female Patriotic Citizens. Results underscore how print and wire media consistently clung to traditional female gender stereotypes, representing women as emotional, communal, and nurturing mothers and wives, whereas blog content represented women as fully engaged agentic leaders and citizens.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, when individuals were confronted with social distancing, social media served as a significant platform for expressing feelings and seeking emotional support. However, a group of automated actors known as social bots have been found to coexist with human users in discussions regarding the coronavirus crisis, which may pose threats to public health. To figure out how these actors distorted public opinion and sentiment expressions in the outbreak, this study selected three critical timepoints in the development of the pandemic and conducted a topic-based sentiment analysis for bot-generated and human-generated tweets. The findings show that suspected social bots contributed to as much as 9.27% of COVID-19 discussions on Twitter. Social bots and humans shared a similar trend on sentiment polarity-positive or negative-for almost all topics. For the most negative topics, social bots were even more negative than humans. Their sentiment expressions were weaker than those of humans for most topics, except for COVID-19 in the US and the healthcare system. In most cases, social bots were more likely to actively amplify humans' emotions, rather than to trigger humans' amplification. In discussions of COVID-19 in the US, social bots managed to trigger bot-to-human anger transmission. Although these automated accounts expressed more sadness towards health risks, they failed to pass sadness to humans.

AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are controversially discussed worldwide. Germany is no exception. Here, CO2 storage is banned, although successful pilot plants were installed in the late 2000s. However, the recent burgeoning political interest in this technology prompts us to investigate why and how the (public) image of CCS technologies has changed over time and with regard to different CCS applications. For this purpose, we examine the coverage of CCS in German newspapers over the last 20 years on the basis of a quantitative analysis of about 4000 newspaper articles. A sample of 571 articles with different political orientations was studied qualitatively to analyse reporting on different CCS frames and actors. We find evidence that the media debate is shifting towards the application of CCS for negative emissions technologies and carbon removal. However, the negative image of CCS connected to coal fired power plants persists, suggesting that public and political support remain a problem for a technology fixed in binary negotiations for or against it.

AB  - Focusing on the milestone 2008 U. S. Presidential Election, this study explores how perceived impact of polls is influenced by one's social comparison groups and perception of media hostility. Results, using survey data of 541 respondents, show that respondents perceived others as more vulnerable than themselves to the influence of election polls. Even though all of the published polls consistently indicated Obama's lead, some supporters of Obama and opponents of McCain reported that the polls were in favor of McCain. Most importantly, the third-person perception and the perceived poll bias were found to be associated with voters' attitudes toward restrictions on election polls and their intention to engage in campaign discourse.

AB  - This article analyses how geopolitics was used to create moral panic during Salvador Allende's government in Chile (1970-1973) and examines the type of recursive devices-such as geopolitical strategic narratives-that were employed by El Mercurio to advance specific discourses that intended to undermine the legitimacy of Allende while mobilising the public agenda towards the political right. Our thesis is that this was done by selective and framed use of international news in ways that somehow created moral panics by bringing geopolitics into the realm of the general public. In so doing, El Mercurio invisibilised important elements and effects of US Foreign Policy while highlighting similar elements and effects of the Soviet Foreign Policy. Our thesis is that in doing so, Allende's government became associated with the 'Red Scare' and subsequently associated with the communist threat. This theme, we argue, remains relevant in times in which there continues to be a prevalent strategic narrative of enemies and foes in international news that continues to be used to create fear and mobilise public opinion towards the right of the political spectrum.

AB  - China's island building in the South China Sea has received considerable attention from scholars, the media and policy-related officials in recent years. In this article, we conduct a survey to assess the opinions of Chinese university students as it regards their views of any moves by the Chinese government to retreat from its island building and the South China Sea claims due to international pressure. Since China has laid claim to much of the South China Sea via its 'nine-dash line', if it were to reverse course and retreat from its man-made islands or remove military installations, how would that play out domestically? Would the Chinese government incur audience costs for doing so? We hypothesise that it would. More specifically, we find it likely that Chinese university students would seek to hold their government accountable for claims to the South China Sea that it has made recently, making it more difficult for the government to retreat from or otherwise adopt a more flexible policy on the South China Sea if it chose to do so. The findings are significant for the audience costs literature, Chinese foreign policy, and South China Sea territoriality studies, in addition to having important policy implications.

TI  - The impact of immigration news on anti-immigrant party support: unpacking agenda-setting and issue ownership effects over time
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTIONS PUBLIC OPINION AND PARTIES
LA  - English
AB  - This study focuses on immigration news as driver of anti-immigrant party support. Predicting the poll results of the Dutch Freedom Party (PW), we distinguish between (a) general immigration news, news in which immigration is linked to (b) crime, (c) terrorism, or (d) the economy, and (e) immigration news in which the Freedom Party is mentioned explicitly. Focusing on the period 2004-2017, an extensive dataset has been generated using computer-assisted content analyses of media coverage (n =1,697,976), public opinion data, and real-world indicators. Time-series analyses demonstrate a positive impact of general immigration news on anti-immigrant party support - and not on the support for other parties. No media effects are found for the immigration sub-issues or the visibility of the Freedom Party in the news. However, the main competitor on the right side of the political spectrum - the Liberal Party (WD) - may also benefit from immigration news but only when it manages to be linked to the issue in the media coverage. Our results raise relevant questions about the preconditions of issue ownership effects, and show how issue ownership is a highly contested political asset in a fragmented and competitive multiparty system.

AB  - Background: For the last decade, doctor-patient contradiction in China has remained prominent, and workplace violence toward medical staff still occurs frequently. However, little is known about the types and laws of propagation of violence against medical staff online.
   Objective: By using a self-organizing map (SOM), we aimed to explore the microblog propagation law for violent incidents in China that involve medical staff, to classify the types of incidents and provide a basis for rapidly and accurately predicting trends in public opinion and developing corresponding measures to improve the relationship between doctors and patients.
   Methods: For this study, we selected 60 cases of violent incidents in China involving medical staff that led to heated discussions on the Sina microblog from 2011 to 2018, searched the web data of the microblog using crawler software, recorded the amount of new tweets every 2 hours, and used the SOM neural network to cluster the number of tweets. Polynomial and exponential functions in MATLAB software were applied to predict and analyze the data.
   Results: Trends in the propagation of online public opinion regarding the violent incidents were categorized into 8 types: bluff, waterfall, zigzag, steep, abrupt, wave, steep slope, and long slope. The communications exhibited different characteristics. The prediction effect of 4 types of incidents (ie, bluff, waterfall, zigzag, and steep slope) was good and accorded with actual spreading trends.
   Conclusions: Our study found that the more serious the consequences of a violent incident, such as a serious injury or death, the more attention it drew on the microblog, the faster was its propagation speed, and the longer was its duration. In these cases, the propagation types were mostly steep slope, long slope, and zigzag. In addition, the more serious the consequences of a violent incident, the higher popularity it exhibited on the microblog. The popularity within a week was significantly higher for acts resulting from patients' dissatisfaction with treatments than for acts resulting from nontherapeutic incidents.

AB  - This study was conducted to test the relationships between WeChat (a popular Chinese mobile SNS) and a number of variables including the structural features of users' networks, the use of political information on WeChat, political discussions, and political attitudes. The results of this study showed that the use of political information by WeChat users on this platform affected their political discussions and political attitudes. Furthermore, both positive and negative WeChat political discussions mediated the effects of the use of political information on political attitudes. Additionally, the connectedness of networks significantly lowered the likelihood of individual users to comment negatively on politics. These findings indicate that WeChat users with diverse social networks are more likely to engage in positive political discussions than in negative political discussions. The theoretical and practical implications of this study are discussed.

AB  - In the present project we assessed whether partisan news affects consumers' views on polarizing issues. In Study 1 nationally representative cross-sectional data (N = 4249) reveals that right-leaning news consumption is associated with more right-leaning attitudes, and left-leaning news consumption is associated with more left-leaning attitudes. Additional three-wave longitudinal data (N = 484) in Study 2 reveals that right-leaning news is positively (and left-leaning news is negatively) associated with right-leaning issue stances three months later, even after controlling for prior issue stances. In a third (supplemental) study (N = 305), random assignment to right-leaning (but not left-leaning) news (vs. control) experimentally fostered more right-leaning stances, regardless of participants' previously held political ideology. These findings suggest that partisan news, and particularly right-leaning news, can polarize consumers in their sociopolitical positions, sharpen political divides, and shape public policy.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the whole world since the beginning of 2020. In Brazil, over 70% of the population rely on the Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS). Knowing public opinion related to SUS is very important for the improvement of services and assistance provided by such an entity. Sentiment analysis has been used in several applications including social networks and blogs to extract public opinion. Despite the fact that other papers have already worked with sentiment analysis, none of them have focused on SUS. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to analyse the sentiments shown by Brazillian Twitter users about SUS before and during COVID-19 pandemic. To reach this goal, a database of portuguese tweets regarding SUS posted between december 2019 and october 2020 was created. The tweets were pre-processed, classified and then analysed. The results show that, in most cases, users are in favor of SUS.

AB  - Given the ethical questions that surround emerging science, this study is interested in studying public trust in scientific and religious authorities for information about the risks and benefits of science. Using data from a nationally representative survey of American adults, we employ regression analysis to better understand the relationships between several variablesincluding values, knowledge, and media attentionand trust in religious organizations and scientific institutions. We found that Evangelical Christians are generally more trusting of religious authority figures to tell the truth about the risks and benefits of science and technology, and only slightly less likely than non-Evangelicals to trust scientific authorities for the same information. We also found that many Evangelicals use mediated information and science knowledge differently than non-Evangelicals, with both increased knowledge and attention to scientific media having positive impacts on trust in scientific authorities among the latter, but not the former group.

AB  - The meanings of social problems like poverty develop within the public sphere. This paper uses the theory of social representations to examine how poverty is represented in British newspapers. Poverty has been discussed and interpreted in numerous ways, and newspapers not only provide a platform for these elaborations but also contribute to shaping public understanding on the issue. The study sampled news coverage on poverty in four British newspapers during two randomly chosen one-month periods in the years 2001 and 2011. The data set of news reports (n=274) was thematically analysed to examine representations of poverty. The study found that in the domestic context, media represents poverty as a problem limited to vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly. With a lack of discussion on the wider socio-economic causes and contributing factors, poverty within the UK appears as an orphan phenomenon' with an unknown genesis. In contrast, the representations of poverty outside the UK are vivid and elaborate, and the news reports hold the socio-political inefficiency of countries responsible for poverty. The study also found that the media uses poverty to make sense of catastrophic events in society: the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States and the London riots of 2011 were both anchored using poverty. This paper discusses the representational dynamics of these findings and argues that the media representations distance general society from poverty, representing it as a problem of the other.

AB  - Cultured meat can be produced from growing animal cells in-vitro rather than as part of a living animal. This technology has the potential to address several of the major ethical, environmental, and public health concerns associated with conventional meat production. However, research has highlighted some consumer uncertainty regarding the concept. Although several studies have examined the media coverage of this new food technology, research linking different frames to differences in consumer attitudes is lacking. In an experimental study, we expose U.S. adults (n = 480) to one of three different frames on cultured meat: "societal benefits," "high tech," and "same meat." We demonstrate that those who encounter cultured meat through the "high tech" frame have significantly more negative attitudes toward the concept, and are significantly less likely to consume it. Worryingly, this has been a very dominant frame in early media coverage of cultured meat. Whilst this is arguably inevitable, since its technologically advanced nature is what makes it newsworthy, we argue that this high tech framing may be causing consumers to develop more negative attitudes toward cultured meat than they otherwise might. Implications for producers and researchers are discussed.

AB  - Objective: Meta-analyze the literature on posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms in youths post-disaster. Method: Meta-analytic synthesis of the literature (k = 96 studies; N-total = 74,154) summarizing the magnitude of associations between disasters and youth PTS, and key factors associated with variations in the magnitude of these associations. We included peer-reviewed studies published prior to 1/1/2009 that quantitatively examined youth PTS (<= 18 years at event) after a distinct and identifiable disaster. Results: Despite variability across studies, disasters had a significant effect on youth PTS (small-to-medium magnitude; r(pooled) = .19, SEr = .03; d = 0.4). Female gender (r(pooled) = .14), higher death toll (disasters of death toll <= 25: r(pooled) = .09; vs. disasters with >= 1,000 deaths: r(pooled) = .22), child proximity (r(pooled) = .33), personal loss (r(pooled) = .16), perceived threat (r(pooled) = .34), and distress (r(pooled) = .38) at time of event were each associated with increased PTS. Studies conducted within 1 year post-disaster, studies that used established measures, and studies that relied on child-report data identified a significant effect. Conclusion: Youths are vulnerable to appreciable PTS after disaster, with preexisting child characteristics, aspects of the disaster experience, and study methodology each associated with variations in the effect magnitude. Findings underscore the importance of measurement considerations in post-disaster research. Areas in need of research include the long-term impact of disasters, disaster-related media exposure, prior trauma and psychopathology, social support, ethnicity/race, prejudice, parental psychopathology, and the effects of disasters in developing regions of the world. Policy and clinical implications are discussed.

AB  - This study examines the formation and continuity of public support for military interventions as a function of political information levels and intervention stages using a panel experiment. The results demonstrate that politically informed individuals express less support for a military intervention at the beginning of that intervention compared to uninformed ones. However, as the intervention proceeds and casualties are incurred, the support of politically uninformed people decreases at a higher rate than does the support of the politically informed. As such, politically informed individuals demonstrate more stable levels of support across intervention stages. In addition, success or failure of an intervention at a certain stage interacts with the level of political information. Most notably, a decrease in support is significantly more pronounced among politically uninformed individuals compared to informed ones under deteriorating intervention conditions. Nevertheless, as the duration of the intervention gets longer, the level of support drops even with improving prospects while the impact of political information disappears. I also find that policy-specific information has a greater effect on public support for military interventions compared to general political information.

AB  - How do organizations react to stakeholder disapproval of a category to which they belong? In this paper, we draw on the categorization, stigma, and identity literatures in building a theory to predict whether firms that are involved in stigmatized activities will choose to reduce or terminate their involvement in them, as opposed to resorting to less drastic measures such as defensive practice adoption or impression management techniques. Conceptualizing groups of organizations involved in such contentious practices as stigmatized categories in the eyes of an audience, we argue that organizational responses rest on three elements: (1) the intensity of stigma targeting the category, (2) the media exposure of the category, and (3) the extent to which an organization is a member of the category. A quantitative study of proposed new nuclear reactor units in the United States between 1970 and 2000, in the face of mounting opposition to atomic power, provides empirical support for our claims.

AB  - The article provides a comparative analysis of ancient and modern technologies for the legitimation of political power, using the example of the Roman Republic and the currently existing democracies. The focus is on the electoral procedure that unites to the utmost the direct (in ancient times) and representative (in modern times) democratic systems. In ancient Rome, in legitimating the electoral procedure the predominant role was played by religious acts, viz. two divination procedures to reveal the will of the gods (auspicia). One was held right before an election and the other during its course, ending with the annunciation of the voting result (renuntiatio). This was the key act in the procedure of electing new magistrates, without which an election was considered invalid regardless of its actual result. The procedure of announcing the voting results actually retains the ritual function of legitimation in modern democracies as well. This mission is assigned, as a rule, to representatives of the election commissions. In the modern world, the ancient Roman religious rituals have an analogy in the form of public opinion polls and political forecasts on the eve of elections which have acquired a ritual legitimizing character in modern democracies. During elections in ancient Rome, a decisive influence on the voting results was exerted by drawing of lots which determined the sequence for casting votes. Modern states, too, try to enhance their legitimation by introducing the aleatory (by lot) form of democratic procedures. Thus, the methods of legitimation of ancient and modern democracies have a certain similarity in the ritual support of the electoral process and in the preservation of the practice of choosing by lot in the electoral procedure. But the legitimating practices of modern democracy have been supplemented with the foreign policy factor, which did not exist in ancient Rome. Also, there was no powerful information pressure in the Roman Republic as there was no media. Today's democracy is increasingly metamorphosing into mediacracy - a form of government where the interests of political actors are closely intertwined with the interests of media conglomerates.

AB  - This article aims to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on homonationalism by exploring a European region that has not been discussed so far, Flanders (Belgium), focusing on media discourses. Homonationalism refers to the way LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender) rights are increasingly incorporated in (mostly Western) conceptions of nationhood, at the expense of ethnic and religious "Others" (most prominently Muslims) who are considered inimical to the LGBT-friendly nation. Using discourse analysis to analyze three months of Flemish newspaper reporting on homosexuality in relation to Muslims, this article inquires into which nations LGBT rights are incorporated and by whom, and how homonationalist discourses relate to broader discourses on Muslims and homosexuality. The analysis finds examples of explicit homonationalist discourse, originating with nationalist politicians, but also implicit homonationalist discourse that only refers to Muslims, as well as counterdiscourses. Implicit and partial discourses are particularly insidious in spreading homonationalist arguments contributing to wider Islamophobic discourses.

AB  - Recent police shootings of African Americans have led citizens to question police officers' use of force. Thus, it is important to determine whether mock jurors can distinguish between justifiable and unjustifiable police shootings-and whether their judgements depend on victim race. Media attention could lead jurors to be more punitive in cases in which an officer shoots an African American (compared to Caucasian) victim. A punitive verdict would reflect society's opposition to such shootings, as suggested by the bandwagon effect. In a 2 (Shooting: Justified/Unjustified) x 2 (Victim's race: African American/Caucasian) experiment, mock jurors read a trial summary involving a fatal police shooting and indicated verdicts. Unjustifiable shootings resulted in less positive perceptions of the officer and perceptions that the shooting was less justified. When the victim was African American, participants had more positive perceptions of the victim, were more certain in a guilty verdict, and perceived the shooting as less justified. The interaction indicated that victim race affected verdicts, but only when the shooting was unjustified. Results suggest there is bias against officers who unjustifiably shoot African Americans, supporting the bandwagon effect. Implications for the role of media effects, psychology, and the legal system are discussed.

AB  - Sredanovic discusses the killing of a father and daughter of Chinese origin in Rome in January 2012, and the portrayal of the case in Italian print journalism. He uses a qualitative analysis of a corpus of 193 articles from seven Italian newspapers with different political, market and geographic profiles. The frequency of generally negative and stereotypical portraits of migrants in crime news is well known; however, this specific case offers a number of less familiar insights. Sredanovic shows the multiple and changing frames and themes, both positive and negative, deployed to portray the event across the two-week period in which it was featured on the front pages of newspapers. He demonstrates in particular the ways in which stereotypes that are often used against migrants in crime news find place even in a case in which the migrants were the victims of the crime. He further illustrate how the representation of the perpetrators shifted from describing them as an exception (when it was thought they were autochthonous) to generalizing about their deviance when it was discovered that they were of Moroccan origin. Sredanovic locates this discussion in an anti-groupist theoretical frame, arguing that the stereotypes used cannot be adequately explained by majority-minority group interactions, and that the delimitation and definition of groups should be understood as ideological from the start. He also argues that aspects of the production routines of crime journalism can be added to the factors that explain the portrayal of the event. He concludes by arguing that Sinophobia is a form of prejudice that varies geographically and in time, and calling for non-reifying, practice-informed analyses that mix discriminating and non-discriminating discourses.

AB  - This research examines the extent to which partisan agenda fragmentation is occurring within the American public. Though numerous scholars of public opinion and political communication have warned of the deleterious effects of agenda fragmentation, to this point such fragmentation has been demonstrated only across a small number of issues over short periods of time. This research is the first to utilize both a large set of issues and a long time frame to assess the state of partisan agendas from 1959 to 2015 through the use of individual-level Gallup's "Most Important Problem" polls. Findings show that the public agenda has fragmented on a large number of issues, in terms of both the level of and shifts in attention that partisans accord to issues of the day. Additionally, this research highlights the importance of recent increases in agenda diversity and carrying capacity to fragmentation, demonstrating that while the presence of large, obtrusive issues tends to be associated with correspondence in partisan agendas, the ordering of partisan issue agendas has decoupled substantially in recent decades.

AB  - This work uses a qualitative approach coupled with a quantitative software-based methodology to examine the Italian news media coverage of radiation in the early decades of the twentieth century. We analyze 80 news stories from two of the most influential Italian newspapers from that time: La Stampa (a daily newspaper) and La Domenica del Corriere (an Italian Sunday supplement). While much of previous research on media coverage of scientific topics was generally focused on present-day news, our work revolves around the ground-breaking discovery of X-rays and radioactivity at the dawn of the last century. Our analysis aims to identify journalistic frames in the news coverage of radiation that journalists might have used to emphasize the benefits (or the risks) of the new discoveries. We also hypothesize how this kind of news coverage might have influenced public perception of technological, commercial, and public health applications of the new scientific advancements.

AB  - Using in-depth interview data from 30 young Black men of West Indian background, we examine their experiences with and perceptions of the American criminal justice system. Their experiences lead these men to contend that the system, especially police authorities, do not differentiate between Blacks based on ethnicity and subsequently treat West Indians and African Americans in a similar manner, that is, race trumps ethnicity. These men discuss their concerns about stereotypes of minorities, especially as they are reflected in the media, as the primary reasons for their treatment. However, these men also provide nuanced accounts in which not all system actors engage in discriminatory behavior. These accounts rest on an immigrant lens regarding criminal justice, which may indicate a more favorable outlook compared to their native-born Black counterparts. Overall, though, the interview data suggest that a Black-White divide regarding such perceptions will persist in an era of substantial sociodemographic change.

AB  - The 2020 US Presidential election was historic in that it featured the first woman of color, Kamala Harris, on a major-party ticket. Although Harris identifies as Black, her racial identity was widely scrutinized throughout the election, due to her mixed-race ancestry. Moreover, media coverage of Harris's racial identity appeared to vary based on that news outlet's political leaning and sometimes had prejudicial undertones. The current research investigated racial categorization of Harris and the role that political orientation and anti-Black prejudice might play in shaping these categorizations. Studies 1 and 2 tested the possibility that conservatives and liberals might mentally represent Harris differently, which we hypothesized would lead the two groups to differ in how they categorized her race. Contrary to our prediction, conservatives, and liberals mentally represented Harris similarly. Also surprising were the explicit racial categorization data. Conservatives labeled Harris as White more than liberals, who tended to categorize Harris as multiracial. This pattern was explained by anti-Black prejudice. Study 3 examined a potential political motivation that might explain this finding. We found that conservatives, more than liberals, judge having a non-White candidate on a Democratic ballot as an asset, which may lead conservatives to deny non-White candidates these identities.

AB  - The form and functions of political discourse have considerably taken a new orientation with the evolving ways of communication. Twitter is a platform that is increasingly preferred by the political elites for the purpose of gaining public acclaim and propagating political ideologies. The political discourse on Twitter requires a critical attention toward linguistic structures and strategies to uncover the relationship between language and social practices. For this purpose, tweets of two eminent Pakistani political figures are chosen for unmasking a variety of discourse strategies at work from the perspective of critical discourse analysis (CDA) through the socio-cognitive model of ideological square. The analysis uncovers the hidden ideological structures and strategies realized through a number of rhetorical moves in the selected tweets. The cognitive binary of positive self-presentation and negative other-presentation help achieving political domination and legitimization of political actions by controlling the public opinion. The underlying motives vary and are context bound such as the aims to topple a government or to restore public faith in the governance. This research is significant for political discourse analysts as well as the general public, as a means for analytical activism propagated by any CDA inquiry, and paves way for further research in the use of social media platforms for political purposes.

AB  - This study explores Black British women's motivations for divulging racial and ethnic identity in the blogosphere (sometimes referred to as blogging while Black) and their use of blogs for discursive activism. It builds on previous research that gives voice to Black womens marginalized experiences through powerful counter narratives. The blogosphere is often perceived as a racially neutral space where shared interests across geographical and temporal boundaries limit the significance of racial and ethnic identity. However, the constructed narratives of Black British women in this study highlight their experiences of subtle forms of prejudice and discrimination perpetuated through dominant discourses in the mainstream media. The findings demonstrate how they use blogs as a medium for discursive activism to challenge stereotypical raced and gendered representation in the mainstream media. Much of the research on the blogosphere in Britain reflects its use by the White majority population. This study therefore extends understanding of the blogosphere and highlights alternative modes of political communication.

AB  - This study examines the articulation of public opinion about so-called fake news using a national survey (N = 510) of U.S. adults conducted in 2018. We coded respondents' open-ended answers about what is "fake news" and found that while some respondents adopted a politically neutral, descriptive definition, others provided a partisan, accusatory answer. Specifically, the weaponization of fake news was evident in the way respondents used the term to blame adversarial political and media targets. Perceptions of fake news prevalence, partisanship strength, and political interest were associated with a higher likelihood of providing a politicized and accusatory response about fake news. Accusations were polarized as a function of partisan identity and positively correlated with affective polarization. Results are discussed in light of the linguistic distinction of the term and what it means in the context of news media distrust and polarization.

The intervention, Tal Como Somos/Just as We Are, is based on stigma and attribution theories, extensive formative research, and community input. Evaluation findings among educators and school youth suggest the film has the potential to effectively influence attitudes toward gay and bisexual men, transgender women, and people living with HIV/AIDS. The film and intervention are being disseminated using diffusion of innovations theory through community-based organizations, schools, television broadcasting, and film festivals.

TI  - Questioning More: RT, Outward-Facing Propaganda, and the Post-West World Order
T2  - SECURITY STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - Can propaganda produced by foreign adversaries shape public opinion in a target country? We develop a theoretical framework to understand outward-facing propaganda, which many autocrats employ to shape public opinion abroad. We argue that beliefs about foreign affairs are more susceptible to outward-facing propaganda than beliefs about domestic conditions. Empirically, we focus on RT (formerly Russia Today), a media platform the Russian government founded in 2005. After characterizing its content, we ask whether exposure to RT influences the beliefs of American consumers. Exposure to RT, we find, induces respondents to support America withdrawing from its role as a cooperative global leader by 10-20 percentage points. This effect is robust across measures, obtains across party lines, and persists even when we disclose that RT is financed by the Russian government. RT has no effect on Americans' views of domestic politics or the Russian government.

AB  - Turkey hosts the largest Syrian refugee population in the world. As an attempt to understand antecedents of residents attitudes towards Syrian refugees, the present study aimed to investigate the relationships between contact experience, perception of threat, and the attitudes. Specifically, we hypothesized that perception of threat would mediate the relationship between contact experience and the attitudes. Frequency of different contact types, threats associated with economic, cultural, and criminal risks, and attitudes towards male or female targets based on preferred social distance were subjected to analyses in an adult sample of 170 women and 183 men. Results revealed a full mediation effect both for female and male Syrian refugee targets. We discussed the findings referring the observed nature of contact as mostly being casual, threat level being high, and attitudes being relatively negative within a specific media-effects framework.

AB  - The prioritizing of human demands in human-dominated landscapes shapes human-wildlife conflicts. Damage to crops is the main cause of conflict with herbivores. In Lithuania, according to the Plan for the Protection of the European Bison (Bison bonasus L.), the translocation of animals from a free-ranging herd in central Lithuania is planned and has been widely announced in local media. We aimed to examine if the publication of such plans changed species acceptance and if the translocation was supported by local inhabitants. In 2014, after the translocation plan was announced, we interviewed 663 respondents living in the area with the free-ranging bison herd. We found that bison damage was considered more serious than had been expressed in a previous survey in 2008-2009, while overall species acceptance and tolerated distance between the bison and respondents' living places had not changed, with fear of the animals becoming less expressed. Lethal means and reduction of animal numbers were not favoured, though the numbers of respondents that did favour this was higher in 2014 than in 2008-2009. Among the possible measures of population management that did not harm bison or leave them in captivity, translocation was least popular. Three factors explained 64.2% of bison acceptance, namely (1) respondent concerns about income sources, (2) sustainability of agricultural practices due to bison presence and (3) attractiveness of the locality with respect to child safety and price of real estate.

LA  - English
AB  - Integrating trend data from ANES, GSS, Gallup, Pew, and media surveys from 1992 to 2012, this article updates and extends previous Poll Trends analyses of public opinion about immigration levels, the impacts of recent immigrants, and immigration policies. The combined data demonstrate continued negativity and ambivalence, consistent with earlier reviews, and reveal a pattern of rapid, steep increases in anti-immigrant sentiment in response to events such as the 1994 election and 9/11, followed by declines over several years that stabilize at lower levels. Since 2001, opinions about most aspects of immigration have become less volatile, and consistent differentiation in opinion has emerged. Concerns about job competition and border enforcement are high, whereas fears about other immigration impacts have declined or stabilized and support for deporting illegal immigrants already in the United States is low. To improve understanding of trends in immigration opinion, survey questions about immigration must be asked more often and more consistently.

AB  - Background: Analysing public opinions on HPV vaccines on social media using machine learning based approaches will help us understand the reasons behind the low vaccine coverage and come up with corresponding strategies to improve vaccine uptake.
   Objective: To propose a machine learning system that is able to extract comprehensive public sentiment on HPV vaccines on Twitter with satisfying performance.
   Method: We collected and manually annotated 6,000 HPV vaccines related tweets as a gold standard. SVM model was chosen and a hierarchical classification method was proposed and evaluated. Additional feature sets evaluation and model parameters optimization was done to maximize the machine learning model performance.
   Results: A hierarchical classification scheme that contains 10 categories was built to access public opinions toward HPV vaccines comprehensively. A 6,000 annotated tweets gold corpus with Kappa annotation agreement at 0.851 was created and made public available. The hierarchical classification model with optimized feature sets and model parameters has increased the micro-averaging and macro-averaging F score from 0.6732 and 0.3967 to 0.7442 and 0.5883 respectively, compared with baseline model.
   Conclusions: Our work provides a systematical way to improve the machine learning model performance on the highly unbalanced HPV vaccines related tweets corpus. Our system can be further applied on a large tweets corpus to extract large-scale public opinion towards HPV vaccines.

AB  - Drawing theoretically both from cultural studies and cultural criminology, this exploratory project suggests that negative public perceptions associated with rap music are in large part informed through both formal and informal censorship agendas and campaigns, what the author terms the censorship frame. The censorship frame consists of mass media reports that proclaim the cultural association between music and collectively shared and culturally agreed-upon perceptions of deviance. The focus of this project concerns rap music and the term bitch, a relatively recent common feature of everyday language use. This article (a) investigates the increased use and acceptance of "bitch" in popular culture; (b) examines this process in relation to the demonization of rap music; and (c) demonstrates the role of both mass media and claims-makers in shaping public opinion of rap music as deviant, even while other similar messages continue to remain virtually unchallenged throughout the popular cultural milieu. Implications for future research are discussed.

AB  - The paper is a critical discourse analysis of political discourse. It relies on van Dijk's socio- cognitive approach which employs miscellaneous linguistic methodologies as input to support the interdisciplinarity of the socio-cognitive base. The paper adopts an eclectic model that combines pragmatic and semantic concepts as a methodology for the socio- cognitive approach. The pragma- semantic interface has always produced better holistic, integrated, and objective linguistic inference. The eclectic model combines Sabet & Zhang's (2015) pragmatic functions of vague expressions (on the pragmatic level) and the semantic macrostructures and the semantic microstructures (on the semantic level). Wodak (2007) emphasises the vitality of the pragmatics in any critical discussion that analyses indirect and inferred linguistic techniques and biased utterances in order to identify and evaluate political discourse. Since vague expressions overlap sometimes in performing pragmatic functions, the pragmatic component of the eclectic model is further supported by the semantic concepts of semantic macrostructure and semantic microstructure. The data is collected from the White House Press Releases (issued in 2014 when ISIS took hold of major Iraqi cities) on Iraq. Such discourse is globally interesting and can shape public opinion about the critical events and realities in Iraq at that time. The analysis has proved the workability of the pragmatic- semantic integration and the paper has come up with a set of concluding remarks.

AB  - Background Contact tracing remains a critical part of controlling COVID-19 spread. Many countries have developed novel software applications (Apps) in an effort to augment traditional contact tracing methods. Aim Conduct a national survey of the Irish population to examine barriers and levers to the use of a contact tracing App. Methods Adult participants were invited to respond via an online survey weblink sent via e-mail and messaging Apps and posted on our university website and on popular social media platforms, prior to launch of the national App solution. Results A total of 8088 responses were received, with all 26 counties of the Republic of Ireland represented. Fifty-four percent of respondents said they would definitely download a contact-tracing App, while 30% said they would probably download a contact tracing App. Ninety-five percent of respondents identified at least one reason for them to download such an App, with the most common reasons being the potential for the App to help family members and friends and a sense of responsibility to the wider community. Fifty-nine percent identified at least one reason not to download the App, with the most common reasons being fear that technology companies or the government might use the App technology for greater surveillance after the pandemic. Conclusion The Irish citizens surveyed expressed high levels of willingness to download a public health-backed App to augment contact tracing. Concerns raised regarding privacy and data security will be critical if the App is to achieve the large-scale adoption and ongoing use required for its effective operation.

AB  - No research in the colonial system issues during the Cold War would be complete without studying the press of the participating parties. In order to give a detailed analysis of the international relationships in terms of the global transformations from an American point of view, the article explores relevant newspaper articles published after the World War II. It shows changes concerning priority schemes as viewed in American social discourse during 1945. Roosevelt's plan for the dismantling of the colonial empires was gradually replaced with less radical plans, which presupposed using the colonial experience for foreign policy of the USA. The materials of the American press of 1945 dedicated to the search for the most effective strategy of building relations with both colonial empires and dependent territories demonstrate, among other things, a steady interest of American mass media in negative and positive experience of colonial policy. Thus, in the American public discourse of late 1945 emerged several new approaches towards evaluation of the prospects of the colonial system. The first approach: retention of all colonial empires, especially in the key points of the after-war world (Middle East, Indochina, Northern Africa). The second approach: retention of the British colonial empire capable of controlling (with the aid from the USA) the Mediterranean area, the Middle East, and the South-Eastern Asia; which would address two tasks, namely provision of valuable raw materials for the American economy, and control over rebels and national liberation forces. The third approach: replacement of colonial empires with American military presence in order to solve the same problems.

AB  - Social networks have become increasingly popular lately, being a complementary method of expression and communication. With the adoption of quarantine and social distancing imposed by the authorities as measures to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, society has used the opportunity offered by digital technology to continue its concern related to the protection and conservation of the environment, especially the forest. The purpose of this study was to highlight the public interest regarding the forests in the context of COVID-19, especially the extent to which public opinion expressed on social networks has determined public forest management policies. The results revealed a major interest in preserving biodiversity and forestry, in reducing legal logging and stopping illegal logging, and monitoring of timber shipments as measures to combat illegal logging. During the analyzed period (i.e., 1 February 2020 to 31 July 2020), several legislative acts were adopted that overlap with the requests and needs identified by environmental organizations, acts that address the issue of illegal logging, conservation, and protection of the forest, monitoring the traceability of wood. The legislation adopted in the analyzed timeframe and shortly after responded to several major topics related to the licensing and withdrawal of the logging license for illegal logging, amending the legislation for the conservation of biodiversity and the classification of areas with virgin forests as strictly protected forests. An IT system has also been implemented by the government environmental authority that allows the supervision of timber transport, offering the possibility of active involvement of civil society.

AB  - This article examines how Marvel Comics' Ms Marvel, in her newest iteration as a Pakistani Muslim young woman, challenges the conventions of race and American citizenship in the post-9/11 United States. I place Ms Marvel in conversation with the webcomic Qahera the Superhero, which was created by an Egyptian artist, in order to demonstrate the ways in which both texts have an ability to reach readers on a global scale and powerfully reimagine visual representations of Muslim women and female superheroes. My investigation includes an analysis of the comics and the epitexts that surround these works, such as author and editor interviews and various forms of public response in order to demonstrate how these media engage with a specific racial, ethnic, and (inter)national community in a meaningful way; one which complicates the definition of 'fans,' 'comic book readers,' and 'heroes.' When juxtaposed Ms Marvel and Qahera emerge as artifacts of visual, digital culture whose significance is particularly salient when read in our current political era, as a means of uncovering and combating racism, xenophobia, and Islamophobia.

AB  - Prior research shows that public opinion on climate politics sorts along partisan lines. However, they leave open the question of whether climate politics and other politically salient issues exhibit tendencies for issue alignment, which the political polarization literature identifies as among the most deleterious aspects of polarization. Using a network approach and social media data from the Twitter platform, we study polarization of public opinion toward climate politics and ten other politically salient topics during the 2019 Finnish elections as the emergence of opposing groups in a public forum. We find that while climate politics is not particularly polarized compared to the other topics, it is subject to partisan sorting and issue alignment within the universalist-communitarian dimension of European politics that arose following the growth of right-wing populism. Notably, climate politics is consistently aligned with the immigration issue, and temporal trends indicate that this phenomenon will likely persist.

AB  - This special issue focuses on the consequences of the heightened conflict between member states and increased politicization of European affairs for electoral politics in the European Union. In this introduction we begin by outlining three important developments that fuelled the politicization: (a) the common currency; (b) the increased pushback on the EU's open border policies; and (c) the inability of the EU to prevent democratic backsliding in some countries. We then discuss their consequences for EU elections, particularly campaigns, public opinion on Europe and voter behaviour, which are investigated against the backdrop of the 2019 European Parliament elections in the individual articles in this special issue. This introduction provides a contextual framework for these contributions and reflects upon some of its main findings.

AB  - Several theoretical perspectives suggest that when individuals are exposed to counter-attitudinal evidence or arguments, their pre-existing opinions and beliefs are reinforced, resulting in a phenomenon sometimes known as 'backlash'. This article formalizes the concept of backlash and specifies how it can be measured. It then presents the results from three survey experiments - two on Mechanical Turk and one on a nationally representative sample - that find no evidence of backlash, even under theoretically favorable conditions. While a casual reading of the literature on information processing suggests that backlash is rampant, these results indicate that it is much rarer than commonly supposed.

AB  - This study investigates networked framing of terrorism news in Twitter by distinguishing three proximity effects (geographic, social, and temporal proximity) on audience and media institutional frames (i.e., episodic/thematic and space frames), based on construal-level theory. An analysis of tweets during the Boston Marathon bombing and the Brussels Airport attack finds that institutional and audience frames show similarity but do not always converge on Twitter. Similarities in the audience and institutional frames are attributed to a universal human tendency for social categorization, inherent in the minds of not only ordinary citizens but also journalists. Proximity effects, however, were more salient on audience frames than on institutional frames.

AB  - Celebrity endorsements, though popular as a means of communicating about products, carry high risks and may lead to negative consequences for the organizations that solicit them, especially when endorsers find themselves embroiled in scandals or crises unrelated to the products they promote. This study investigates how Liu Xiang's withdrawal from the 2012 London Olympics and Sun Yang's unlicensed driving crisis affected their sponsorships of Nike and Beijing Hyundai, respectively. Attribution theory and the concept of in-group/out-group orientation provide a framework for examining both primary and secondary public reactions to these public relations crises on Sina Weibo. As a comparative study, this paper adopts both qualitative (thematic analysis of two official announcements) and quantitative methods (content analysis of 738 Weibo postings). Within a Chinese cultural context, evidence indicates that celebrity-endorsement crises are internally attributed and perceived to be controllable. Where primary public attitudes are concerned, integrity violations lead to more negative reactions; however, inclusion strategies find a better reception than distancing, regardless of the public's crisis-responsibility attributions. For secondary online reactions, Weibo posters' perceptions of external locus, controllability, and integrity violations generate more "likes" than organizational strategies, thereby proving themselves more influential online. This study ultimately provides a more comprehensive refinement of attribution theory by both conceptualizing crisis-response strategies with a discussion of Chinese cultural sensitivities and offering empirical data on the ways in which primary and secondary crisis communication affects stakeholders via social media.

AB  - In this article, we present and test a market-based model of news content about state courts of last resort. We test our theory by examining newspaper coverage of decisions in death penalty cases. Our empirical results indicate that news elements of drama, novelty, and sensationalism influence coverage of state high courts' death penalty cases rather than traditional indicators of legal salience. News content either anywhere in a newspaper or on its front page is influenced by similar factors, but front-page coverage is more sensitive to dramatic conviction reversals and the rarity of executions in a given state. Our results suggest that traditional explanations of the relationship between crime and newsworthiness have limited impact on media attention given to state supreme courts. Media coverage of state high courts is instead associated primarily with the behavior of the court and its justices.

KW  - MEDIATED PUBLIC DIPLOMACY
KW  - US
AB  - Powerful countries use foreign media broadcasts to enhance their soft power, yet there is scant empirical evidence as to whether such efforts actually sway public opinion abroad. Moreover, researchers have not specified conditions that may shape variations in the influence of foreign broadcasts and internet. We propose a theory that predicts, respectively, opinion-formation and issue-framing effects of foreign broadcasts as functions of the pervasiveness and familiarity of the issues they cover. We test our hypotheses by examining the potential effects of exposure to Russia-sourced broadcasts on views of Russia and other foreign policy issues in Kyrgyzstan, a most likely case of foreign media effects. Using an original, nationally representative survey conducted in Kyrgyzstan in 2015, we find that the influence of Russian media on Kyrgyzstani opinions varies according to the pervasiveness and familiarity of the issues at stake and is more limited than traditionally believed. The modest and conditional effects of foreign media in this particularly favorable environment cast doubt on the assumption that media are a soft-power tool "par excellence" and call for further research on how media can be used effectively for public diplomacy.

AB  - In this paper we propose that the concept of mediatization should be used not only in the narrow sense to analyze the impact of media on the operational modes of the political system, but also in more general terms to capture the transformation of the public sphere and the changing conditions for the generation of political legitimacy. More specifically and with regard to the role of political communication on the internet, we focus on the transformative potential of online media in terms of a) publicity: the capacity of the online media to focus public attention on the political process of the EU; b) participation: the capacity of the online media to include plural voices and activate the audience; and c) public opinion formation: the capacity of the online media to enable informed opinions. We test our mediatization model on the online debates that took place during the 2009 EU elections (May - June 2009) in 12 member-states and at the trans-European level. The findings confirm the mediatizing impact of online political communication on the generation of the political legitimacy of the EU. Online media constitute a virtually shared forum for political communication that political actors and users increasingly occupy developing homogenous patterns of evaluating European integration. Furthermore, the stronghold of offline media in the EU e-sphere and the tendency to discuss the EP elections within the frame of domestic (national) politics reaffirm the key role of national political and media cultures.

AB  - Social sensing is an analytical method to study the interaction between human and space through extracting reliable information from massive volunteered information data. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there are a large number of Internet social sensing data. However, most of them lack geographic attribute. In order to resolve this problem, this paper proposes a convolutional neural network geographic classification model based on keyword extraction and synonym substitution (KE-CNN) which could determine the geographic attribute by extracting the semantic features from text data. Besides, we realizes the non-contact pandemic social sensing and construct the co-word complex network by capturing the spatiotemporal behaviour of a large number of people. Our research found that (1) mining co-word network can obtain most public opinion information of pandemic events, (2) KE-CNN model improves the accuracy by 5%-15% compared with the traditional machine learning method. Through this method, we could effectively establish medical, catering, railway station, education and other types of text feature set, supplement the missing spatial data tags, and achieve a good geographical seamless social sensing.

AB  - The rise of smart cities has emerged as a key policy thread that unites various government agencies in pursuit of a common objective: to become a digital city. However, these smart initiatives generate tradeoffs between economic growth and privacy concerns, with emphasis placed on data sharing for innovation, and surveillance for cybersecurity purposes. This study examines media framing in Singapore's Smart Nation initiatives. A between-subject experiment investigated the effect of news frames (gain versus loss) and regulatory focus (prevention versus promotion) on respondents' (N = 157) opinions toward the Smart Nation. Gain frames were more effective when coupled with a promotion focus, and loss frames had a more impact when combined with a prevention focus. A moderated mediation analysis demonstrated support, attitudes, and perceived vulnerability mediated an interaction effect between gain/loss frames and regulatory focus, on the intention to participate in Smart Nation initiatives.

AB  - In late 2014, a series of highly publicized police killings of unarmed Black male civilians in the United States prompted large-scale social turmoil. In the current review, we dissect the psychological antecedents of these killings and explain how the nature of police work may attract officers with distinct characteristics that may make them especially well-primed for negative interactions with Black male civilians. We use media reports to contextualize the precipitating events of the social unrest as we ground our explanations in theory and empirical research from social psychology and industrial and organizational (I/O) psychology. To isolate some of the key mechanisms at play, we disentangle racial bias (e.g., stereotyping processes) from common characteristics of law enforcement agents (e.g., social dominance orientation), while also addressing the interaction between racial bias and policing. By separating the moving parts of the phenomenon, we provide a more fine-grained analysis of the factors that may have contributed to the killings. In doing so, we endeavor to more effectively identify and develop solutions to eradicate excessive use of force during interactions between "Black" (unarmed Black male civilians) and "Blue" (law enforcement).

AB  - Stigma is a common and pervasive problem for many people with psychosis. Much of the research examining internalised stigma has utilised quantitative methodology; however, it has been argued that to conceptualise experiences of psychosis, research should also attend to subjective experience. This study explores accounts of stigma from nine people with psychosis through semi-structured interviews that were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Three super-ordinate themes of judgement, disclosure and psychological distress were identified. Analysis of the data found that stigma was experienced directly and indirectly through social judgements. In particular, it was considered that negative messages and the absence of positive images of psychosis in the media perpetuated social judgements. Difficulties were reported in relation to disclosure, including avoidance from others following disclosure and coping strategies to conceal experiences of psychosis. Ultimately, judgement and issues of disclosure had a negative impact on psychological well-being, either contributing to, or resulting in, psychological distress, including increased paranoia, anxiety and lowered self-esteem. Potential exits from the negative effects of stigma, including peer support, were identified in the data. Implications for future research and clinical practice, including interventions to reduce internalised stigma, are suggested.

AB  - While ample research has scrutinised the causes and consequences of support for the European Union, a pressing question remains: what do people actually mean when they express support for, or opposition to, their country's membership of the institution? We use Correlational Class Analysis to assess this. Our analysis of high-quality representative Dutch survey data (n = 2053), including novel items informed by in-depth qualitative research, reveals that European Union support comes in three guises: federalist, non-federalist and instrumental-pragmatist Strikingly, many Europhiles are not federalists. In addition, we reveal that the social bases of the three types of support especially differ regarding political competence, political orientation, and media consumption. The implications for ongoing debates on European Union atttidues are discussed.

AB  - This article analyses public debate on Twitter via network representations of retweets and replies. We argue that tweets observable on Twitter have both a direct and mediated effect on the perception of public opinion. Through the interplay of the two networks, it is possible to identify potentially misleading representations of public opinion on the platform. The method is employed to observe public debate about two events: The Saxon state elections and violent riots in the city of Leipzig in 2019. We show that in both cases, (i) different opinion groups exhibit different propensities to get involved in debate, and therefore have unequal impact on public opinion. Users retweeting far-right parties and politicians are significantly more active, hence their positions are disproportionately visible. (ii) Said users act significantly more confrontational in the sense that they reply mostly to users from different groups, while the contrary is not the case.

AB  - During the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital learning has reshaped mathematics education in different ways. In particular, different social media platforms have acquired an unforeseen prominence as a way to enhance mathematics learning and to model somehow the face-to-face classroom interactions abruptly interrupted. How primary and secondary students have reacted or responded to these changes in the initial learning conditions is the main aim of this study. With this purpose in mind data was collected from 3179 students from the Gaza Strip by means of a validated rating scale and then a cluster analysis approach was applied that revealed the existence of three clusters. K-means cluster analysis was applied to analyze data as an exploratory approach to identify structures within the data. Also, chi-square was applied to identify differences between the clusters with regard to demographic characteristics. Regarding the grouping of participants in clusters the analysis performed lead to the identification of three clusters: Cluster 1, 2 and 3 had 2001, 824 and 354 cases, respectively. These clusters were grouped depending on employ social media platforms used by the students to reinforcement their mathematics learning. Participants in Cluster 3 exhibited the highest proficiency in the usage of social media for mathematics learning as compared to those in Cluster 1 and Cluster 2. This means that students in cluster 1 are more likely to exhibit negative attitudes and low levels in the skills related to using digital technology and the employment of social media in mathematics learning. The results showed that there were no significant differences between cluster-groups with regard to gender, age, and type of school. In contrast, significant differences were found among the three clusters with regards to the educational level of parents and the economic status of the family. However, the overall results show that digital learning is considered a positive response to the school closure in the time of the COVID-19 outbreak.

AB  - According to poll results and media reports, Britain has a significant and growing number of creationists. However, little scholarly research has been carried out to explore this phenomenon. We present results from a national survey of 6020 individuals to give a comprehensive picture of contemporary public attitudes to evolution in Britain. Furthermore, we explore the effects of religion and education on attitudes to evolution. Unique to this study, we analyse the effects of attending a religiously affiliated school (faith school') on acceptance of evolutionary theory. We examine these effects in the general population, and additionally, across different Christian, Muslim and Non-Religious subpopulations. Results give strong evidence that the number of creationists has been overstated previously. We find the effect of education is complex and varies between different religious groups, but that faith school attendance is associated with more acceptance of evolution for people belonging to groups that tend to reject it.

AB  - Drawing on the constructionist framing approach, this quantitative content analysis compares online news coverage of schizophrenia in China and the United States in 2015. Incorporating the concept of individualism-collectivism, this study seeks to unveil the effects of culture on the framing of causes, solutions, responsibility attribution, and discourse types. The findings reveal that the link between cultural orientation and the media's framing of schizophrenia is not simple, as both cross-cultural consistency and differences were observed. In addition, compared to U.S. online media, Chinese online news outlets were more likely to cover schizophrenia episodically, while placing more problem-solving responsibility on society. Moreover, examining stigma and challenge cues, this study also found that schizophrenia was more severely stigmatized in Chinese than in U.S. online news platforms. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - The proximity between newspapers and political parties is strongly subjective and difficult to measure. Yet, political tendencies of newspapers can have a significant impact on voters' opinion-forming and ought to be known by the public in a transparent and timely manner. This article introduces the Sentiment Political Compass (SPC), a data-driven framework for analyzing political bias of newspapers toward political parties. Using the SPC, newspapers are embedded in a two-dimensional space (left-leaning vs. right-leaning, libertarian vs. autocratic). To assess the informative value of our framework, we crawled a data set consisting of 180,000 newspaper articles from twenty-five newspapers during the German Federal Elections over a time period of 18 months and extracted 740,000 political entities enriched with their contextual sentiment. We analyze this dataset on the party- and politician-level as well as considering the temporal dimension and draw insights about the relationship between newspapers and political parties. We provide the data set and our code open-source at to encourage the application of the SPC to other political landscapes.

AB  - Recent analyses of Internet search behaviour conclude that the public's interest in environmental issues is falling (McCallum and Bury, Biodiv Conserv 22:1355-1367, 2013). Ficetola (Biodiv Conserv 22:2983-2988, 2013) argued that the nature of the underpinning data processing may create an artificially declining trend, even when the absolute number of searches increases and public interest is growing. These findings are highly relevant for applied conservation strategies and the public media have quickly picked the message of the alarming fading interest worldwide, the possibility of devastating repercussions and calls for rapid responses in conservation communication. We challenge both analysis by evaluating Internet searches of English and non-English speaking users. The inclusion of information on the linguistic background reveals a much more differentiated picture, with some cultures displaying an increasing interest and others a decreasing interest. These analyses allow a better understanding of the importance of global-local viewpoints, cultural knowledge and cultural differences on the interpretation of underpinning human interest from Internet search patterns. Despite methodological problems limiting the utility of summary data provided by search engines, they can offer powerful information when applied spatially and temporally restricted and analysed alongside suitable benchmark indicators. We discuss that due consideration of methodological caveats is essential to inform the general public about the relevance for conservation without triggering sensationalist or over-generalizing conclusions. Conservation communication needs considering that Internet search engines do not necessarily mirror the interest of many people who are essential for the conservation of biodiversity.

AB  - In the last decade, opinion mining and sentiment analysis have been the subject of fascinating interdisciplinary research. Alongside the evolution of social media networks, the sheer volume of social media text available for sentiment analysis has increased multi-fold, leading to a formidable corpus. Sentiment analysis of tweets have been carried out to gauge public opinion on breaking news, various policies, legislations, personalities and social movements. Fuzzy logic has been used in the sentiment analysis of twitter data, whereas neutrosophy which factors in the concept of indeterminacy has not been used to analyse tweets. In this paper, the concept of multi refined neutrosophic set (MRNS) with two positive, three indeterminate and two negative memberships is proposed. Single valued neutrosophic set (SVNS), triple refined indeterminate neutrosophic set (TRINS) and MRNS have been used in the sentiment analysis of tweets on ten different topics. Eight of these topics chosen for sentiment analysis are related to Indian scenario and two topics to international scenario. A comparative analysis of the methods show that the approach with MRNS provides better refinement to the indeterminacy present in the data. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article on ecotheatre with a focus on Vietnam pursues two goals. Firstly, it discusses how theatre can address ecological concerns, utilising ancient cultural sources. Secondly, it focuses on how these concerns are dramatised in the satirical comedy Gap nhau cuoi nam (Year-End Gathering), first broadcast on Vietnamese television in 2003. The main theoretical question is how and whether theatre, and specifically television theatre, can raise awareness of the climate crisis and generate a cultural shift. While addressing the crisis, theatre does not necessarily aim at breaking conventions. It can play with rhetorical strategies to convey the complexity of the interactions between humans and nature. It can stimulate inter alist factors and intrinsic motivations leading to individual or collective social and political action. Gap nhau cuoi nam is a rewriting of the legend of the three Kitchen Gods who supervise every household and present their report to the Jade Emperor, the ruler of the world. Using satire and parody to convey praise and critique, the play stimulates reflection on the social and environmental crisis and occasional indifference of the Gods. Considering the impact that the TV has on public opinion in Vietnam and the popularity reached by Gap nhau cuoi nam, it becomes clear that theatre encapsulating entertainment and critique can respond to environmental concerns, stimulate ecological thought and generate change.

AB  - This study investigates the causal relationship between an under-studied emotion-hope-and online action. We ask whether some emotions are more effective than others in driving a semi-behavioral outcome-clicking a hyperlink. Using an experimental design, we find that a recorded speech that has been "emotionally charged" with hope increases respondents' willingness to seek information about a contentious social issue, immigrant rights. We argue that the hope charge is uniquely powerful, in part because it energizes both beneficiary constituents (BCs) and conscience constituents (CCs) of social movements, as well as those of broader publics. We suggest that hope is a quintessential bridging charge, linking beneficiary constituents to these other groups. Our study builds on important methodological trends in the developing field of survey experimentation: it uses audio recordings to convey emotional charges and embeds a semi-behavioral measure at the conclusion of an internet-based survey experiment. We argue that hope has been empirically submerged in the discipline, and, when used to charge social movement frames, has under-acknowledged mobilizing power.

AB  - This article examines the discourse practices of Greek journalism on mainstream commercial prime-time news. The article draws on data from Greek prime-time news and political current affair programmes over a 15-year period (from the early 2000s to date). By focusing on discourse and conversation analysis of journalistic talk in the studio, it will be shown that shifting discursive practices already in place long before the onset of the financial crisis that has afflicted Greece since 2010 have endowed Greek journalism with the discursive entitlements (or frame space') to challenge and hold politicians to account, in principle, allowing for more democratic journalistic gatekeeping. In reality, however, these same practices have created the conditions for an epistemological upgrading of opinion to the status of factual news reporting, in fact proposing conversation as news'. These conversational practices have facilitated the Greek media's role in shaping public opinion while allowing for the ideological manipulation of audiences.

AB  - Public expenditure on mental health education has grown exponentially in the past two decades. A qualitative study using focus groups was used to explore whether the experience of stigma among 22 mental health service users improved over time. We identified five major themes on changes in social stigma, perceived stigma, and stigma coping. Stigmatizing and discriminatory experiences were still common in workplace, healthcare system, and relational aspects but some participants perceived that there were reductions in social stigma. Participants believed that media portrayal and celebrity effect were important in fostering greater acceptance toward people with mental illness and the importance of family support and stigma resistance for minimizing the harmful impacts of stigma. The findings are important in the future design of public educational and stigma reduction programs.

AB  - This paper explores perceptions of the killings of African-Americans by police officers. We show how characteristics of the victim, officer and surrounding environment, as well as political cues, shape such perceptions. In the first study, we employ a conjoint survey experiment, wherein subjects are exposed to descriptions of hypothetical police killings. Focusing on subjects who score high on the Symbolic Racism Scale (SRS), we identify what leads such subjects to view shootings as more justified. We replicate and extend these effects in a second study in which subjects read fictitious newspaper articles. We find that exposing high SRS subjects to primes related to Black Lives Matter can decrease their belief in shootings' justifiability.

AB  - This paper evaluates the two most common methods of measuring voter time-of-decision-the recall method and the panel method-and asks whether the two methods are consistent with each other. Using data from the National Annenberg Election Survey collected during the 2008 U.S. presidential election, the findings suggest that these two methods measure different concepts, and thus cannot be used interchangeably. Furthermore, discrepancies between the two methods suggest that the accepted model of early, campaign, and late decision-making should be adjusted to account for a fourth group of voters that never changes their vote intention, but does not truly commit to that intention until later in the campaign. The concept of uncommitted early deciders is offered to describe this group, created by combining the two methods.

AB  - I conduct an experiment which examines the impact of group norm promotion and social sanctioning on racist online harassment. Racist online harassment de-mobilizes the minorities it targets, and the open, unopposed expression of racism in a public forum can legitimize racist viewpoints and prime ethnocentrism. I employ an intervention designed to reduce the use of anti-black racist slurs by white men on Twitter. I collect a sample of Twitter users who have harassed other users and use accounts I control ("bots") to sanction the harassers. By varying the identity of the bots between in-group (white man) and out-group (black man) and by varying the number of Twitter followers each bot has, I find that subjects who were sanctioned by a high-follower white male significantly reduced their use of a racist slur. This paper extends findings from lab experiments to a naturalistic setting using an objective, behavioral outcome measure and a continuous 2-month data collection period. This represents an advance in the study of prejudiced behavior.

AB  - "Rough sex" can be considered an act of sexual violence that is consensual or non-consensual, often resulting in bodily harm and in rare cases, fatalities. The rough sex defense is typically advanced by male perpetrators in an effort to portray a sexual encounter as consensual, to avoid criminal sanctions for causing injury or death. Public attitudes toward this defense are often reflected on social media following high profile cases and appear to echo dominant discourses that reinforce widely held sexual violence stereotypes. Therefore, this study aims to deconstruct public attitudes surrounding the rough sex defense. Namely, how female victims/survivors and male perpetrators of sexual violence are constructed online, whilst exploring the wider implications upon society. NVivo12 NCapture software was used to collect a sample of 1000 tweets mentioning the terms "rough sex" or "rough sex defense." Data were examined using Feminist Critical Discourse Analysis (FCDA), underpinned by a social constructionist perspective, to elicit emergent discourses. Findings indicate that Twitter allowed women to resist harmful victim-blaming discourses and constrained binary identities. Opposingly, men were constructed as sexually entitled predators, yet resisted these subject positions by advocating support for male victims/survivors. Additional analyses examine account holders' constructions of British Parliamentarians (MP's) and their campaigns against the rough sex defense. These constructions demonstrated a cultural, heteronormative and victim-blaming understanding of sexual violence, which calls for legislative clarity.

AB  - It has been contended that a link exists between films and the creation of tourist locations. A film can have an unintended consequence that leads to community actions and subsequent policy initiatives that are supportive of conservation of potential tourism cultural assets. This article analyses the processes by which one such film created a heightened awareness of the heritage values of a location setting in Hong Kong that led to changes in public policy. This case study highlights media's role in shaping and changing public opinion. It examines through framing analysis the way in which public debate changed, thereby highlighting the way in which conservation activists and other stakeholders played out competing roles and the manner in which they sought to influence media coverage of the site. The article also points out the need to establish a set of consistent standards of conserving heritage sites rather than relying on a film to be the "savior.".

AB  - The Internet certainly disrupted our understanding of what communication can be, who does it, how, and to what effect. What constitutes the Internet has always been an evolving suite of technologies and a dynamic set of social norms, rules, and patterns of use. But the shape and character of digital communications are shifting again-the browser is no longer the primary means by which most people encounter information infrastructure. The bulk of digital communications are no longer between people but between devices, about people, over the Internet of things. Political actors make use of technological proxies in the form of proprietary algorithms and semiautomated social actors-political bots-in subtle attempts to manipulate public opinion. These tools are scaffolding for human control, but the way they work to afford such control over interaction and organization can be unpredictable, even to those who build them. So to understand contemporary political communication-and modern communication broadly-we must now investigate the politics of algorithms and automation.

AB  - This study addresses Douglas Pratt's 2010 claim that New Zealand's non-Muslim majority experience "angst" in relation to a growing Muslim population. Based on interviews with non-Muslim New Zealanders we identified two key discourses. Firstly, participants constructed New Zealand as a safe haven and as tolerant and accepting of different religions and cultures. However, this tolerance and acceptance was conditional on Muslim assimilation and on participants' sense of security and safety. Secondly, in constructing Muslims, gender-based oppression was created as problematic. Further, Muslims were constructed as not all terrorists, suggesting a default link between Islam and terrorism. Media was constructed as deliberately overplaying this link. Overall, angst about the increasing numbers of Muslims in New Zealand society was not identified. However, the core underlying stance was that, to be accepted, those with different social norms should assimilate and not threaten current cultural norms. Covert racism was highlighted in this study.

AB  - The author describes how the interactive study of social media's effect on the Common Core debate was designed and executed. Important findings from the study were: 1) We live in an increasingly interconnected social world. 2) Media has evolved over the last half century from a passive system dominated by a few central opinion makers to the present -- a more active phase of social media in which we are the media. 3) A new activist public of social media entrepreneurs are now jockeying with more traditional advocacy groups for attention in the political space in which policy ideas incubate and public opinion emerges. All three of these are new phenomena that continue to rapidly change as new technologies influence the ways in which we learn, communicate, and interact.

AB  - This article offers a study of the cartoon coverage of King Juan Carlos I of Spain's accident during an elephant-hunting safari in Botswana, which enjoyed major coverage in the media. Using both quantitative and qualitative techniques, the article addresses two questions. First, did the cartoons about the king's safari articulate and help to spread a conservationist message or did they redirect public opinion towards other issues considered to be more important for Spanish society? Second, is it possible to detect a change in cartoonists' attitudes towards the Spanish monarchy from the analysis of these cartoons? The article demonstrates that cartoons can illustrate-better than other narrative texts-changing attitudes towards the monarchy in Spanish society.

AB  - Research indicates that when mainstream news media report about demonstrations, protesters often face delegitimizing coverage. This phenomenon, known as the "(journalistic) protest paradigm," is thought to be a default mindset that leads journalists to emphasize the method of protesters over their message. However, empirical work has so far limited itself to specific protest movements or events and only covers brief periods. This study first identifies and then codes the main frames in all reports about domestic protest in the United Kingdom. Analysing data that covers eight national newspapers during a 26 year period (N = 27,496), I provide a more systematic understanding of how the mainstream news media in liberal democracies report about protests. The analysis shows that a stable majority of articles uses frames linked to the protest paradigm throughout the time period. However, a substantial and growing number of articles employ legitimizing frames-either on their own or co-existing with delegitimizing framing.

AB  - The arrest and subsequent death of George Floyd are often cited as pivotal events in the evolution of police-citizen relationships. They were also the pinnacle of the "new visibility of policing" in that they were filmed by multiple cameras, and video recordings of the arrest of George Floyd played a central role in the trial of the police officer who killed Floyd. Although empirical work in other fields has repeatedly shown that how information is conveyed (the container) influences our perceptions and opinions sometimes as much as the information itself (the content), criminologists have largely neglected the effect of cognitive biases on perceptions of the police. The present study investigates both camera perspective and audio biases by reporting the results of three related viewings of controversial police interventions involving the use of force, filmed from the perspectives of a body-worn camera, a surveillance camera, and a cellphone. Results inconsistently support the existence of both biases but still point toward a concerning conclusion: technical features of the videos presented are associated with significantly different opinions. Implications for the public release of video footage are discussed.

AB  - Objective: In politically contested health debates, stakeholders on both sides present arguments and evidence to influence public opinion and the political agenda. The present study aimed to examine whether stakeholders in the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) debate sought to establish or undermine the acceptability of this policy through the news media and how this compared with similar policy debates in relation to tobacco and alcohol industries. Design: Quantitative and qualitative content analysis of newspaper articles discussing sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxation published in eleven UK newspapers between 1 April 2015 and 30 November 2016, identified through the Nexis database. Direct stakeholder citations were entered in NVivo to allow inductive thematic analysis and comparison with an established typology of industry stakeholder arguments used by the alcohol and tobacco industries. Setting: UK newspapers. Participants: Proponents and opponents of SSB tax/SDIL cited in UK newspapers. Results: Four hundred and ninety-one newspaper articles cited stakeholders' (n 287) arguments in relation to SSB taxation (n 1761: 65 % supportive and 35 % opposing). Stakeholders' positions broadly reflected their vested interests. Inconsistencies arose from: changes in ideological position; insufficient clarity on the nature of the problem to be solved; policy priorities; and consistency with academic rigour. Both opposing and supportive themes were comparable with the alcohol and tobacco industry typology. Conclusions: Public health advocates were particularly prominent in the UK newspaper debate surrounding the SDIL. Advocates in future policy debates might benefit from seeking a similar level of prominence and avoiding inconsistencies by being clearer about the policy objective and mechanisms.

AB  - Responding to disruptions and crises are challenges public leaders face as they strive to lead responsibly for the good of the community. The last two years have been especially challenging for public leaders and institutions. In Australia, the federal government battled natural disasters (bushfires) and COVID-19 within the span of only a few months, beginning in late 2019. These events provided the opportunity for a natural experiment to explore public perceptions of leadership in times of crises, with both a natural disaster and health crisis in quick succession. In this study, we develop, validate, and test a scale of perceptions of leadership for the greater good, the Australian Leadership Index, throughout different crisis contexts. We hypothesize and find support for the drivers of perceptions of public leadership and shifts in these perceptions as a function of the bushfire disaster response, a negative shift, and the initial COVID-19 response, a positive shift. Comparisons of the crisis periods against a period of relative stability are made. We discuss the implications of differential media coverage, how the crises were managed, and the resulting public perceptions of leadership for the greater good.

AB  - Word embeddings provide quantitative representations of word semantics and the associations between word meanings in text data, including in large repositories in media and social media archives. This article introduces social psychologists to word embedding research via a consideration of bias analysis, a topic of central concern in the discipline. We explain how word embeddings are constructed and how they can be used to measure bias along bipolar dimensions that are comparable to semantic differential scales. We review recent studies that show how familiar social biases can be detected in embeddings and how these change over time and in conjunction with real-world discriminatory practices. The evidence suggests that embeddings yield valid and reliable estimates of bias and that they can identify subtle biases that may not be communicated explicitly. We argue that word embedding research can extend scholarship on prejudice and stereotyping, providing measures of the bias environment of human thought and action.

AB  - Though India is no stranger to either epidemics or hate speech, the COVID-19 crisis brought to the surface many of the pre-existing schisms and prejudices that subsequently led to both the Muslim minority community and the Dalit community being cast as miasmic and constant agitators against the central government. In the case of hate speech against the Muslim community, it has led to a peculiar situation wherein the invisible but pervasive Islamophobia that has been plaguing the country from the colonial times has risen it ugly head particularly across regional news channels and social media networks, making the phenomena hyper-visible. The Hindutva(1) politicians from the extreme right parties have been indulging in spreading anti-Muslim propaganda, moulding the image of the Muslim community as not only disease-bearers and super-spreaders of COVID-19 virus but also as being anti-national, as the central government has proclaimed 'a war against the COVID virus' (The Print, 2020, 26 April).
   During the initial spread of the virus throughout the country, there was an increasing tendency to show the Muslim community as intentionally spreading the disease or as being ignorant of current medical practices, with multiple TV channels airing the views that the Tablighi jamaat event (a religious congregation held in March 2020) was marked as a super-spreader event, and with multiple politicians engaging in rumour-mongering and hate-speech against the Muslims, framing the community as a miasmic community that needs to be cleared from India.
   On the other hand, the hate speech against Dalits in India is much more nuanced, indirect and layered. It began as WhatsApp and Facebook messages extolling the caste system and justifying the discriminatory practice of untouchability(2 )using the logic of social distancing and progressed to painting Dalits and Dalit spaces as unhygienic disease-scapes. This consequently led to the denial of livelihoods to thousands of domestic workers and unskilled workers who belonged to lower caste groups as they found themselves without jobs as most middle caste upper caste families and business owners fired their employees without notice. The study involves a hermeneutical analysis of news reports of the spread of COVID from newspapers and electronic media in English as well as interviews with at least 100 members of groups on social media (WhatsApp and Facebook) that propagate extremely communal and casteist material.

AB  - In recent years, palm oil has become one of the most discussed food ingredients, with health and sustainability issues raising in relation to its use. The aim of this study is to explore Italian consumers' perception of the presence of palm oil in food products to assess if and how the recent media campaign has influenced public opinion. An online questionnaire was drafted, with 239 valid responses analysed. The results show that the respondents, well aware of the media debate regarding palm oil, perceive that a demonization campaign against the ingredient is in progress, leading public opinion towards an unfavourable attitude about it. The most relevant purchase motivations for a product without palm oil are linked to the environmental scope of sustainability, followed by those related to health concerns. Moreover, the use of the semantic differential methodology in the analysis has allowed for the exploration of the attitudes towards products with and without palm oil, highlighting how a product not containing palm oil is mainly perceived as trendy, expensive and healthy. The results of motivation and semantic differential analysis are polarised according to a split in the sample between subjects who give and do not give importance to the absence of palm oil in food products.

AB  - Research has shown that the form and content of science communications can influence individuals' responses. This study examines whether individuals' perceptions of scientific research are influenced by the discipline to which the research is attributed. Two vignette experiments find that neither the perceived scientific-ness nor trustworthiness of a study originating from sociology is affected by attributing the study to a different social science or to a natural or medical science. These null findings contrast with surveys showing sizable disciplinary differences in public attitudes. It is possible that disciplinary attribution is a less salient cognitive shortcut when presented in longer communications as compared to survey questions that only provide the name of a discipline. We conclude with suggestions for further research on the role of disciplinary attribution on public perceptions of science.

AB  - This article explores why President Clinton sanctioned the release of the Puerto Rican political prisoners in 1999 given that nineteen years earlier, the U.S. government, media, public opinion, and even some of the pro-independence Left had excoriated them as terrorists. To explain Clinton's decision and the shift in much of public opinion, this article traces the political contours and development of the campaign to release the prisoners. It divides the campaign into two phases. From 1980 to 1990, the campaign argued that a state of war existed between Puerto Rico and the United States, defined the prisoners as prisoners of war, and linked support for the prisoners to the FALN and armed struggle. From 1990 to 1999, it framed the prisoners' release as a fundamental human rights issue and called on Puerto Ricans to embrace the prisoners as part of the Puerto Rican family and nation. This change allowed the campaign to become broader, more inclusive, and successful.

AB  - Several high-profile negative events involving Muslim perpetrators have recently been covered by the media. We investigated whether the same negative actions are more likely to be labeled "terrorism" when they are committed by Muslims than when they are committed by White non-Muslims. In Experiment I (n = 60), using a real article about a Muslim perpetrator and a modified version about a non-Muslim perpetrator, we found that participants were more likely to identify a crime as terrorism when it was perpetrated by a Muslim. The label "terrorism" also mediated the effect of Muslim identity on negative judgments of the behavior. In Experiment II (n = 60), we replicated the results of Experiment I and clarified that the effects persisted when we used a real article about a non-Muslim perpetrator and a modified version about a Muslim perpetrator. We discuss implications for cross-group communication and representations of Muslims in the media.

TI  - How Socialization Shapes Chinese Views of America and the World
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Urban Chinese today do not appear to trust foreign countries. Why are they so suspicious? Over the past quarter century, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has utilized its educational and propaganda systems to produce historical narratives of imperial China's beneficence towards its East Asian neighbors, and of an early modern 'Century of Humiliation' at the hands of 'imperialist' foreign powers. Qualitative analysis of Chinese social media today suggests that these narratives are tied to widespread popular distrust of China's 'ungrateful' East Asian neighbors and the 'hegemonic' West today. Interrogating a 2012 survey of urban Chinese, this paper explores the sources of international attitudes quantitatively. It first examines whether Chinese today do indeed distrust foreign countries. It then tests two hypotheses about the drivers of Chinese distrust towards the world today. A 'top-down' socialization hypothesis holds that political (e.g. party propaganda via education and the media) and/or social (e.g. peer groups, social conformity) pressures shape the international attitudes of the Chinese people. A 'bottom-up' psychological hypothesis, by contrast, holds that individual differences like age and gender shape Chinese attitudes. We find substantial support for the former: more years of education are associated with levels of dis/trust in foreign countries in the socially or politically appropriate ways. However, we also find that 'bottom-up' individual differences in subjective interest in international affairs interact with 'top-down' socialization processes like education and media exposure in shaping the international attitudes of urban Chinese today. The prevalence of public discourses of distrust towards foreign countries does not bode well for Chinese foreign policy in the twenty-first century.
   Following the Tiananmen Square Massacre of 1989, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) launched a 'Patriotic Education Campaign' to bolster its nationalist legitimacy (see Zhao, 2004; Callahan, 2010). The educational system, then CCP General Secretary Jiang Zemin (1991) declared in The People's Daily, should teach the Chinese people, and especially its youth, to 'guard against worshiping the West and fawning over the foreign'. Only then, Jiang argued, could 'national self-respect and national self-confidence' be enhanced.
   Have Chinese today ceased 'fawning over the foreign'? If so, is it because 25 years of 'Patriotic Education' have successfully socialized the Chinese people into a view of the rest of the world as being threatening?
   Much Western scholarship suggests that it has. Despite its embrace of the free market under 'reform and opening', Anne-Marie Brady (2008) argues that the CCP has intensified its propaganda and ideological work. Interpreting a wide variety of texts, Bill Callahan (2010: 194) has argued that patriotic education in China today teaches the Chinese people both how to view foreigners - 'as barbarians: the United States as the Evil hegemon, Japanese as devils' - and 'what to feel' about them: 'humiliation, hatred, and revenge'. Kirk Denton (2014: 4) has similarly explored the role of Chinesemuseums in shaping Chinese views of their past encounters with foreigners. He concludes that '[t] he CCP exerts a profound influence over the memoryscape and mediascape of China'.
   This article supplements such qualitative analyses with a quantitative one, exploring what recent surveys of Chinese public opinion can teach us about both what urban Chinese think about foreign countries, and why - the sources of their attitudes. Specifically, it assesses two competing hypotheses about the macro-drivers of international attitudes in China today. A 'top-down' socialization hypothesis holds that either social conformity (e.g. peer pressure) or the state-run educational and media systems (e.g. party propaganda) most shape the international attitudes of the Chinese people. A 'bottom-up' psychological hypothesis, by contrast, holds that individual differences like demographics (e.g. age and income) and personality (e.g. openness) are the primary drivers of international attitudes.
   To preview, we find substantial evidence for the 'top-down' socialization hypothesis: exposure to education - but not media exposure - appears to overwhelm 'bottom-up' individual differences in accounting for Chinese survey responses to evaluative questions such as those asking how much China should trust foreign countries. But not all Chinese are alike, and their differences do matter. Specifically, the 'bottom-up' variable of personal interest in foreign affairs interacts with 'top-down' variables such as education and media exposure, leading some Chinese to toe the socially or politically correct line, while others do not.

AB  - This article is a comment on Fikkan and Rothblum's (2011) article "Is Fat a Feminist Issue? Exploring the Gendered Nature of Weight Bias." They argued that fat women in North America experience significantly more prejudice and discrimination than fat men do, marshaled evidence to support their argument in several domains (e.g., employment, education, romantic relationships, health care, the media), and wondered why feminist scholars have not paid much attention to the oppression of fat women. Here I suggest several reasons why fat women experience more prejudice and discrimination than fat men do: the objectification of women, gender-related aspects of health behavior and knowledge about health and illness, and the importance of self-control to the performance of femininity. I also suggest that there is some overlap in negative stereotypes of both feminists and fat women, which might lead to a desire to distance oneself from both. However, feminists should recognize the intersectionality of fat oppression and the way it colludes with the sexualization and objectification of women in popular culture. Thus, fat should be a feminist issue.

AB  - We describe the evolution of a stereotype as it emerged in tweets about the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack in Paris in early 2015. Our focus is on terms associated with the Muslim community and the Islamic world. The data (400k tweets) were collected via Twitter streaming API and consisted of tweets that contained at least one of 16 hashtags associated with the Charlie Hebdo attack (e.g., #JeSuisCharlie, #IAmCharlie, #ParisAttacks), collected between January 14th and February 9th. From these data, we generated pairwise co-occurrence frequencies between key words such as "Islam", "Muslim(s)", "Arab(s)", and "The Prophet" and possible associates such as: "terrorism", "terror", "terrorist(s)", "kill(ed)", "free", "freedom" and "love". We use changes in frequency of co-occurring words to define ways in which acute negative and positive stereotypes towards Muslims and Islam arise and evolve in three phases during the period of interest. We identify a positively-valenced backlash in a subset of tweets associated with the "origins of Islam". Results depict the emergence and transformation of implicit online stereotypes related to Islam from naturally occurring social media data and how pro-as well as anti-Islam online small-world networks evolve in response to a terrorist attack.

AB  - Why did a Conservative UK government decide to cut back road building during a time of austerity in the 1990s, whereas a Conservative-led Coalition government decided to substantially increase road building during a time of austerity after 2010? This study aims to answer that question drawing on 32 interviews with ministers, advisors and others, and secondary analysis of media coverage and public opinion. It uses Critical Realist methods in a more specific way than previous studies, representing the key actors, causal mechanisms and changes in underlying social structures in diagrammatic form. It concludes that three mechanisms: a rational response to changing transport circumstances, changing economic ideology prompted by the recession of 2007-9 and public opinion, influenced by the protest movement in the 1990s, explain the contrasting decisions. It identifies key actors who influenced government decisions and explains how a Critical Realist analysis questions the traditional concept in transport studies of causal factors and their relative importance.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented public health crisis worldwide. Its intense politicization constantly made headlines, especially regarding the use of face masks as a safety precaution. However, the extent to which public opinion is polarized on wearing masks has remained anecdotal and the verbal representation of this polarization has not been explored. This study examined the types, themes, temporal trends, and exchange patterns of hashtags about mask wearing posted from March 1 to August 1, 2020 by Twitter users based in the United States. On the one hand, we found a stark rhetorical polarization in terms of semantic antagonism between pro- and anti-mask hashtags, exponential frequency increases of both types of hashtags during the period under study, in parallel to growing COVID-19 case counts, state mask mandates, and media coverage. On the other hand, the results showed an asymmetric participatory polarization in terms of a predominance of pro-mask hashtags along with an "echo chamber" effect in the dominant pro-mask group, which ignored the subversive rhetoric of the anti-mask minority. Notwithstanding the limitations of the research, this study provides a nuanced account of the digital polarization of public opinion on mask wearing. It draws attention to political polarization both as a rhetorical phenomenon and as a participatory process.

AB  - Campaign priming is generally assumed to function through the activation of memory content. By focusing on specific issues or issue aspects, campaigns render corresponding cognitive concepts more accessible and hence influence which concepts are likely to be used in subsequent evaluation processes. Thus, priming is mainly understood as a cognitive process. In the present study we investigate the impact of campaign-induced emotions on opinion formation. We argue that emotions may activate cognitive content which may in turn influence political judgments. Our analyses support the hypothesis that political campaigns may influence public opinion not only through cognitive priming but also through affective priming.

AB  - A large literature expects that as protests unfold in electoral autocracies, voters who supported the ruling regime in the past will withdraw support and shift to supporting its opponents. Yet there are only a few empirical tests of how opposition protests influence voter defections in these regimes. To gain empirical traction on this question, I draw on evidence from Russia. Tying together evidence from a protest-event dataset and a panel survey of voters conducted prior to and during the 2011-2012 protest wave, I examine how voters who supported the ruling regime in the past respond to anti-regime mobilization. Results reveal differentiation in defections. While opposition protests dampen support for the ruling regime and depress engagement, they do not necessarily translate into greater support for the regime's challengers. Findings, which have implications for debates on defection cascades in autocracies, speak to the literatures on authoritarian endurance and the legacies of (attempted) revolutions.

AB  - 54% of U.S. teens say they spend too much time on their cellphones and two-thirds of parents express concern over their teen's screen time. However parents face their own challenges of device-related distraction. Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping America and the world. It does not take policy positions. It conducts public opinion polling, demographic research, content analysis and other data-driven social science research. The Center studies U.S. politics and policy; journalism and media; internet, science and technology; religion and public life; Hispanic trends; global attitudes and trends; and U.S. social and demographic trends. Amid rolling debates about the impact of screen time on teenagers, roughly half of those ages 13 to 17 are themselves worried they spend too much time on their cellphones. Some 52% of U.S. teens report taking steps to cut back on their mobile phone use, and a similar percentage have tried to limit their use of social media (57%) or video games (58%), a new Pew Research Center survey finds.

AB  - Millimetre wave (mmWave) signal is promising for the challenge of bandwidth shortage and can motivate the research on large-scale antenna arrays. In this paper, the authors investigate the hybrid precoding design that combines with a radio frequency (RF) precoder and a digital precoder for multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems with large-scale antenna arrays. In practical large-scale antenna array systems, the small antenna spacing and the properties of a scattering environment can create a correlation between channel coefficients for separated receive units. Such correlation prejudices the performance of multi-user systems. This study proposes two approaches to reduce the channel correlation by the hybrid precoding structure. The first approach selects some vectors with the smallest influence with each other from all array response vectors to design an angular-based RF precoder. The second approach optimises the singular values characteristic of the virtual channel matrix before digital processing for the RF precoder. Then, the MU-MISO baseband precoding is implemented by reduced RF chains. Numerical results show that they have different performance depending on the environment. The first can achieve better performance when the channel correlation is not too high, while the second is more effective when the channel realisation is terribly ill-conditioned, especially for higher signal-noise ratio (SNR).

AB  - Background: Ocular gene transfer clinical trials are raising hopes for blindness treatments and attracting media attention. News media provide an accessible health information source for patients and the public, but are often criticized for overemphasizing benefits and underplaying risks of novel biomedical interventions. Overly optimistic portrayals of unproven interventions may influence public and patient expectations; the latter may cause patients to downplay risks and over-emphasize benefits, with implications for informed consent for clinical trials. We analyze the news media communications landscape about ocular gene transfer and make recommendations for improving communications between clinicians and potential trial participants in light of media coverage.
   Methods: We analyzed leading newspaper articles about ocular gene transfer (1990-2012) from United States (n = 55), Canada (n = 26), and United Kingdom (n = 77) from Factiva and Canadian Newsstand databases using pre-defined coding categories. We evaluated the content of newspaper articles about ocular gene transfer for hereditary retinopathies, exploring representations of framing techniques, research design, risks/benefits, and translational timelines.
   Results: The dominant frame in 61% of stories was a celebration of progress, followed by human-interest in 30% of stories. Missing from the positive frames were explanations of research design; articles conflated clinical research with treatment. Conflicts-of-interest and funding sources were similarly omitted. Attention was directed to the benefits of gene transfer, while risks were only reported in 43% of articles. A range of visual outcomes was described from slowing vision loss to cure, but the latter was the most frequently represented even though it is clinically infeasible. Despite the prominence of visual benefit portrayals, 87% of the articles failed to provide timelines for the commencement of clinical trials or for clinical implementation.
   Conclusions: Our analysis confirms that despite many initiatives to improve media communications about experimental biotechnologies, media coverage remains overly optimistic and omits important information. In light of these findings, our recommendations focus on the need for clinicians account for media coverage in their communications with patients, especially in the context of clinical trial enrolment. The development of evidence-based communication strategies will facilitate informed consent and promote the ethical translation of this biotechnology.

AB  - Information pollution in a digitally connected and increasingly polarized world, the spread of disinformation campaigns aimed at shaping public opinion, trends of foreign electoral interference and manipulation, as well as abusive behaviour and the intensification of hate speech on the internet and social media are the phenomenon which concern international public opinion. These all represent a challenge for democracy, and in particular for the electoral processes affecting the right to freedom of expression, including the right to receive information, and the right to free elections. It is a growing international effort to deal with these problems. Among international organizations engaged to seek solutions is the Council of Europe (CoE). The author analyses CoE's instruments, legally binding (as European Convention on Human Rights), as well of the character of "soft law", especially resolution of the CoE's Parliamentary Assembly 2326 (2020) Democracy hacked? How to respond? She exposes the need for better cooperation of international organizations and states' authorities in this matter.

AB  - Under strict scrutiny of public governance primed by international relation tensions, geopolitics, and the rise of social movements and public activism in the globalized economy, public sentiment is exerting increasing pressure on multinational corporations (MNCs). Utilizing the context of inward acquisition, a sensitive cross-border action that often triggers sentiment of host-country nationals, we theorize from the public sentiment perspective and the public thermostat analogy that foreign acquirers will adjust their ownership levels in target firms according to how they perceive to be acceptable and legitimate as expressed by host-country nationals' public sentiment toward their home country. Using a sample of 410 acquisition deals from 22 foreign countries/economies into China during 2010-2017 and a sentiment analysis of 100,902 blog posts, we find that a host country's public sentiment toward the acquiring firm's home country is positively related to acquisition ownership levels, and has a mutualistic symbiotic interaction with the host region's marketization level. Our study contributes to the study of informal institutions by proposing public sentiment as a new form of informal institution that is normative-cognitive whilst affective, and can be mobilized and communicated broadly and timely via a public sphere to confer social, political, and cognitive legitimacy to MNCs.

AB  - Recent worldwide growing awareness of the global climate changes stressed the importance of developing and supporting the renewable energy sources (RES). However, the public support for RES varies across various countries and regions, especially those abundant in traditional fossil fuels. This paper presents the analysis of the public views of the economics of the renewable energy using the results of the online survey (N = 750) conducted in several regions of the Russian Federa-tion, a country abundant in natural gas and oil. Our results indicate that there is a mixed opinion on trust in RES as opposed to the traditional energy sources. Even though we found some sup-port for the renewable energy technologies, it appears that it is correlated with the respondents ' concerns about the environmental protection and sustainable development as well as with some demographic variables. The outcomes of the regression analysis confirmed that positive attitudes towards climate protection predetermined the support for various types of RES, while the financial or political gains did not come through as significant. The results indicate that public views on the renewable energy sources could and should be shaped by the information campaigns and presen-tations in mass media conducted by relevant policymakers and public authorities.

AB  - The last 15 years have seen a remarkable shift in the educational representation of British-born Muslim young men. In the media-led reclassification of them, from South Asian to Muslim, they have moved from ideal student to potential jihadist. This article draws upon a three-year ethnographic study with young Muslim men located within the West Midlands. A shared emphasis on structural issues across critical theoretical frameworks on neoliberalism, government discourses, such as Prevent, and counter narratives on Islamophobia serves to underplay young Muslim men's subjectivity, and in so doing limits their self-authorization. We argue that at a time of intense state/institutional surveillance as a suspect community' and the criminalization of ethnic and religious difference, Muslim young men are in the process of negotiating late-modern urban masculine identities. Simultaneously, deploying a methodological reflexivity indicates that a re-reading of their narratives provides insights into recent political changes and national belonging.

TI  - Use of Exact Matching to Examine Media's Effect on Intended Behavior the Case of the Addition of the 2020 Census Citizenship Question
T2  - PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY
LA  - English
AB  - Researchers have argued that events and surrounding media coverage shape attitudes and intended behaviors on topics related to the events (; ). Such research relies on analyzing attitudinal trends using rolling cross-section designs or across data collections, but little published research measures whether an event covered by the media could shape a behavioral intention salient to that event within one data collection period. In 2018 the Census Bureau conducted the Census Barriers, Attitudes, and Motivators Study (CBAMS) survey. Five weeks into the survey's field period, the Secretary of Commerce directed the Census Bureau to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, resulting in media coverage. The CBAMS survey asked likelihood to respond to the decennial census, which may have been affected by the external news environment. Treating this as a "natural experiment," we match pre- and post-citizenship question-announcement respondents and report the results of a multivariate model predicting intent to respond to the census. We also examine differences between subgroups and their complements pre- and post-announcement. Although the citizenship question was not included on the 2020 Census, the odds that those responding after the citizenship question announcement were "extremely" or "very likely" to respond to the census were 20 percent lower than the odds of those responding before. Future research should examine the permanency of changes on intended behaviors, especially in cases where news coverage focused on an outcome-such as the addition of the citizenship question-that did not occur.

AB  - Background: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use has increased in the United States, leading to active debate in the public health sphere regarding e-cigarette use and regulation. To better understand trends in e-cigarette attitudes and behaviors, public health and communication professionals can turn to the dialogue taking place on popular social media platforms such as Twitter.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to conduct a content analysis to identify key conversation trends and patterns over time using historical Twitter data.
   Methods: A 5-category content analysis was conducted on a random sample of tweets chosen from all publicly available tweets sent between May 1, 2013, and April 30, 2014, that matched strategic keywords related to e-cigarettes. Relevant tweets were isolated from the random sample of approximately 10,000 tweets and classified according to sentiment, user description, genre, and theme. Descriptive analyses including univariate and bivariate associations, as well as correlation analyses were performed on all categories in order to identify patterns and trends.
   Results: The analysis revealed an increase in e-cigarette-related tweets from May 2013 through April 2014, with tweets generally being positive; 71% of the sample tweets were classified as having a positive sentiment. The top two user categories were everyday people (65%) and individuals who are part of the e-cigarette community movement (16%). These two user groups were responsible for a majority of informational (79%) and news tweets (75%), compared to reputable news sources and foundations or organizations, which combined provided 5% of informational tweets and 12% of news tweets. Personal opinion (28%), marketing (21%), and first person e-cigarette use or intent (20%) were the three most common genres of tweets, which tended to have a positive sentiment. Marketing was the most common theme (26%), and policy and government was the second most common theme (20%), with 86% of these tweets coming from everyday people and the e-cigarette community movement combined, compared to 5% of policy and government tweets coming from government, reputable news sources, and foundations or organizations combined.
   Conclusions: Everyday people and the e-cigarette community are dominant forces across several genres and themes, warranting continued monitoring to understand trends and their implications regarding public opinion, e-cigarette use, and smoking cessation. Analyzing social media trends is a meaningful way to inform public health practitioners of current sentiments regarding e-cigarettes, and this study contributes a replicable methodology.

AB  - The following study explores the effect of social media visibility on public discussion and, possibly, on the results of the 2015 presidential elections in Poland, unexpectedly won by Andrzej Duda. Instead of newspaper analyses and polls, Facebook interactions proved more accurate in predicting the final results. In the study, focus is laid on two key sources of visibility of opinion that emerged during the campaign: major daily newspapers, which provide space for opinion only to selected writers; and presidential candidates' Facebook fan pages, which offer broad visibility to Facebook users' opinions. The proposed interpretation of this discrepancy is that of a major shift in making public opinion more self-expressive and personal: public discussion is formed in between' rationality and emotion, publicness and privacy. The 2015 presidential elections in Poland reveal that this in-between' emerged in people's Facebook activity, and it uncovered a public affect which translated into election results.

AB  - The media is an important source of health information, especially critical in rural communities with geographically-dispersed populations that are harder to reach through other channels. Yet health information is unequally distributed; these information disparities are compounded in rural areas, which may contribute to health disparities. We identify and describe health-related news in a culturally-diverse rural California county characterized by high levels of poverty, unemployment, low educational attainment, and over half of Mexican-origin. We conducted a census of all available print news sources and then used content analysis to identify and characterize all health information printed in a 6-month study period. A total of 570 health-related articles were published. Five newspapers accounted for more than 80% of published health-related articles (n = 466); only one targeted the majority Latino population. The most common topic was access to health care/insurance/policy (33%), followed by diet/nutrition (13%), infectious disease (10%), and general prevention (9%). Just over one-quarter of health-related articles included useful information. Differences across newspaper types existed: independent newspapers reported more on health-related events compared with chain newspapers, and both ethnic-targeted newspapers and independently-published papers were more likely to include useful information compared with chain newspapers. While this region suffers from high rates of obesity and diabetes, there were relatively few articles on obesity and diabetes themselves, or linking behavioral risk factors with these conditions. One area we found absent from coverage pertained to the numerous environmental health threats prevalent in this heavily polluted, agricultural area (just 40 articles discussed environmental health threats). We also discovered that coverage of social determinants of health was lacking (just 24 of the 570 health articles), which was notable in a region that suffers extreme economic, educational, and health disparities. This analysis of a rural region's local news coverage of health issues demonstrates significant opportunity to engage with rural local media, particularly ethnic media, to disseminate health information. Such a strategy holds considerable promise to advance public health goals using a multilevel approach: From an individual perspective, improving the amount and utility of the information can inform and educate publics in areas with otherwise low levels of health information access. From a policy perspective, improving coverage of the social determinants of health could shape public opinion to support policies that improve health.

Coupled with the identification of dominant news frames, this study draws on in-depth interviews with foreign correspondents in Seoul to explore journalistic practices in covering conflicts in the Korean Peninsula. The findings show that a conflict frame and a human interest frame were prominent in national and international news, respectively. This article further discusses the role of the international news media in reporting on international conflicts from sociological and geopolitical perspectives.

AB  - This article explains how the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) partnered with African American minister Elder Lightfoot Solomon Michaux to discredit and neutralize Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. The Elder, the nation's first minister (black or white) to have his own weekly television show, colluded with the Bureau to shape public opinion against King and cast doubt upon King's religious commitments and activities. Michaux was, what I call, a Bureau Clergyman: a minister who was an FBI "Special Service Contact" or on the Bureau's "Special Correspondents Lists." Far from secret informants, black and white male clergy in these official Bureau programs enjoyed very public and cooperative relationships with the FBI and were occasionally "called into service" to work in concert with the FBI. The FBI called upon Michaux and he willingly used his status, popular media ministry, and cold war spirituality to publically scandalize King as a communist and defend the Bureau against King's criticisms. In the end, the Elder demonized King, contested calls for black equality under the law, and lionized the FBI as the keeper of Christian America. The story moves the field beyond the very well known narratives of the FBI's hostility towards religion and reveals how the Bureau publicly embraced religion and commissioned their clergymen to help maintain prevailing social arrangements. Michaux's relationship with the FBI also offers a window into the overlooked religious dimensions of the FBI's opposition to King, even as it highlights how black clergy articulated and followed competing ideologies of black liberation during the civil rights movement.

Models' level of muscularity varied significantly by race: Black models had the highest levels of muscularity, Asian models had the lowest levels of muscularity, and White and Latino models had moderate levels of muscularity. Drawing on existing research about race and body image, implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Cybersecurity represents a unique national security challenge for states: data breaches with the potential for national, macro-level consequences are most likely to occur at the micro-level, originating through the security errors of individual computer users. Thus, aspects of national cybersecurity can often critically depend on the personal attitudes and behavior of average citizens connecting online. However, to date, theories of state cybersecurity have almost exclusively focused on the macro-level, and very little is known about how the mass public reacts to-and protects themselves from-cybersecurity threats. This study addresses this gap, drawing on psychological theories of risk perception to explain why the public simultaneously reports great concern about cybersecurity, yet does little to protect their personal safety online. Using a novel survey experiment, we examine how exposure to different types of data breaches impacts citizens' cyber risk assessments, personal online behavior, and support for various national cybersecurity policies. We find that baseline concerns about cybersecurity and knowledge about safe online practices are very low. However, exposure to a personally relevant data breach heightens risk perception and increases willingness to engage in safer online practices. But these effects are circumscribed-actual online behavior is more resistant to change. These results have important implications for the design of effective state cybersecurity policy.

AB  - Increasing discussion over the safety of natural resource extraction and transportation to facilitate international energy needs has given rise to controversy over the prospect of large quantities of bitumen and crude oil flowing through trans-national pipelines. This debate, incorporating the voices of industry, government and advocacy groups, has gained traction in the news media, alternately framed as an environmental, economic, trade, human rights or public safety concern. It is possible, however, that such coverage may vary substantially with regional interests and perceptions of costs and benefits, locally or nationally. To uncover how the framing of energy transportation varies with proximity considerations, regional and national media coverage in Canada and the United States of the Keystone XL pipeline from 2010 to 2014 is analyzed. National and local papers frame the pipeline according to different considerations, as do cities near to and distant from the pipeline route.

AB  - Turkey's bid to join the European Union (EU) is more contentious than any previous enlargement of the EU. With the prospect of a predominantly Muslim country joining the Union, religious differences are often argued to be at the heart of public opposition to Turkish membership, whereas economic reasoning seems to dominate arguments in favour. Yet, public opinion on this issue is also highly volatile. This raises the question of the extent to which elite framing of the debate on Turkish accession can shape public opinion. Using a survey-embedded experimental study, we examine the differences in support between people exposed to positive and negative cultural and economic arguments. Our results show that the economic frames are persuasive across the board, whereas cultural (religious) frames are strongly conditioned by individual predispositions on religious diversity.

AB  - The relationship between political rhetoric and hate crime has been a topic of growing concern in recent years, with the narratives promoted by politicians widely seen as legitimating and inspiring hate crime as well as soothing or inflaming the tensions that result from antecedent hate crime events such as terrorist attacks. The potential return of so-called 'IS bride' Shamima Begum from a Syrian refugee camp in 2019, following her high-profile departure four years earlier, led to intense debate within the UK, particularly over the controversial removal of her citizenship by Home Secretary Sajid Javid. As an Islamist terrorism case with clear gendered dimensions, the Begum case was well-positioned to function as a hate crime trigger event. The divisiveness of this case was reflected in partisan political argument within the UK, and accompanied by high volumes of toxic and Islamophobic social media discussion alongside input from a variety of UK politicians. This paper offers a qualitative analysis of the political rhetoric promoted in the Twitter accounts of leading UK politicians in response to the citizenship decision, and subsequent developments between February and April 2019, such as the death of Begum's child and the granting of legal aid to support her ongoing legal challenge. Through a Critical Discourse Analysis of politicians' online rhetoric, this study aims to establish the contribution of UK political rhetoric to the hate speech discourses that emerged online in response to this case.

TI  - The Reception of Immigrants and Refugees in Western Countries: The Challenges of Our Time
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES
LA  - English
AB  - In a rapidly changing world, the challenges of migration, as well as its potential benefits, are hotly debated. Recent years have seen new challenges as a result of unprecedented levels of migration, instability following the Global Financial Crisis, economic and security concerns surrounding immigration, and negative portrayals of immigrants by some Western leaders. These developments make it all the more important to understand the psychological processes underpinning attitudes toward immigrants and refugees, support for particular immigration policies and responses to changing policies, the role of portrayals of immigrants in the media, and the consequences of immigration attitudes and policies. This special issue brings together researchers interested in the topic of immigration from a psychological perspective, with a focus on understanding the reception of immigrants and refugees in Western countries. In this introductory article, we outline the background to this special issue and briefly describe each article included.

AB  - When do anti-base movements manage to influence policy, and when do they fail to do so? Base scholars have largely overlooked what I argue is a significant factor that can shape public and government response to anti-base movements: political opportunities associate with framing efforts by key actors involved. Based on two cases of anti-base movements in South Korea, I show how framing battles between activists and media shape political opportunities afforded to anti-base movements and can ultimately influence movement success.

AB  - This article explores an emerging strategy by sections of the British radical right towards the LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) community, who the radical right claim are existentially threatened by the alleged violent homophobia of Islam and their ostensible betrayal by 'the left'. Consequently, parts of the radical right present themselves as the 'true' protectors of LGBTQ+ individuals through what we term alter-progressivism. By analysing recorded speeches, discussions and interviews by and with key British radical right figures, we demonstrate three themes: (1) the broad radical right discourse of a 'Great Replacement' specifically tailored towards LGBTQ+ anxieties, (2) a narrative in which the radical right portray themselves as the defenders of (some) minorities and (3) an emerging distinction between the far-right and radical right concerning LGBTQ+ rights. We conclude that these themes represent a significant rhetorical shift and reveal the flexibility of radical right narratives in an attempt to appeal to diverse communities. This represents a serious challenge, which compels social scientists to adapt their understandings of radical right ideologies, objectives and strategies.

AB  - Recent literature is increasingly highlighting the role of individual behaviours for tackling societal challenges like Climate Change. Indeed, the largest source of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is related to electricity and heat production, with residential and commercial buildings being responsible for 60% of global electricity demand. At the same time, the agri-food system is also very energy and carbon intensive and it is responsible for a considerate amount of GHG emissions. Individual behaviours related to electricity, heat, and food consumption may have strong impacts on GHG emissions opening interesting opportunities for climate change mitigation among end-users. In this direction, this paper aims at investigating the impact (if any) of two important 2015 events on consumer behaviour and awareness about the climate and environmental impacts of their everyday choices. Indeed, in current society, media coverage of events has shown to be relevant in affecting consumer perceptions and behaviour. The events analysed are: the release of Pope Francis' encyclical 'Laudato si' - On Care For Our Common Home' about environmental issues and climate change; and the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) with the signature of the Paris Agreement. Data were collected via interviews with a sample of consumers in the context of Milan, a large European city. Data were analysed by means of descriptive statistics and ordinal regression models. Results indicate that such events have had an effect, mostly on people that have a positive attitude towards such events but were not so much aware about the related discussions beforehand. Policy implications highlight the role of opinion leaders in engaging the segments of population that are not already proactive on the matter, which is indeed the target of well-aimed policies.

AB  - This article provides the first comprehensive analysis of how parties across 28 countries use digital political marketing on Facebook by drawing on the example of the 2019 European Parliament election. We introduce a theoretical model of political Facebook marketing and compare the paid media activity (sponsored posts, ads) of 186 parties to their owned media (posts) and earned media (user reactions, comments, shares). Our results concerning cross-country patterns indicate that differences in European parties' paid media activity exist and only a few parties leverage sophisticated targeting strategies. Regarding temporal dynamics, we find that paid media is used to supplement owned media during similar campaign phases. In terms of engagement-triggering effects, we show that sponsoring posts is a suitable tool to increase earned media. Overall, paid media activity on Facebook is largely embedded into parties' overall marketing strategy and national countries' regulatory settings. Our results have implications for the understanding of public opinion, voting behaviour and the regulations of elections in modern European democracies.

AB  - This article explores how racial prejudice in the West forms at least part of the ideational foundation in how the rise of China has been perceived, and how such racial prejudices to some extent inflate people's threat perception and hinders acceptance of any future Chinese hegemony. The article focuses on the leading European power, Germany, and provide a discourse analysis of the contemporary German popular media's portrayal of China, China's rise and how the vestiges of racial prejudice continue to define the German public's view of China. It focuses on an analysis of a small yet representative sample of mainstream media and expert literature in Germany, so as to discern how "the rise of China" is discussed in the German public sphere and the persistence of the "Yellow Peril" trope. This article contests that all the elements that make up the perception of the "Yellow Peril" have persisted, albeit in subtler ways. It argues that the more the literature adheres to the idea of a "Yellow Peril," the more it tends to perceive the international order in terms of a quasi-natural competition between nations. The article argues that as a non-Western non-White nation, China's rise has been heavily racialized.

AB  - Studies that investigate how the mass media cover risk issues often assume that certain characteristics of content are related to specific risk perceptions and behavioral intentions. However, these relationships have seldom been empirically assessed. This study tests the influence of three message-level media variablesrisk precision information, sensational information, and self-efficacy informationon perceptions of risk, individual worry, and behavioral intentions toward a pervasive health risk. Results suggest that more precise risk information leads to increased risk perceptions and that the effect of sensational information is moderated by risk precision information. Greater self-efficacy information is associated with greater intention to change behavior, but none of the variables influence individual worry. The results provide a quantitative understanding of how specific characteristics of informational media content can influence individuals responses to health threats of a global and uncertain nature.

AB  - The U.S. is now the global leader in natural gas production. The federal government is changing policies and priorities to expand natural gas export to foreign energy markets. Such an expansion requires increased pipeline capacity and the development of export terminals for shipping. While natural gas export is a burgeoning energy and environmental issue, we know little about what influences public support/opposition for the practice. Such information is vital to all levels of government and stakeholders. Using a national online survey sample (n = 1042), we examine what factors influence public support/opposition. Results of regression analysis indicate that supporters tend to be male, hold a bachelor's degree or higher, wealthier, politically conservative, and reference affective images of the economy, energy, and trade. In contrast, opponents tend to be women, politically liberal, and reference affective images related to keeping natural gas in the U.S., the environment, and hydraulic fracturing. Based on these findings, we discuss implications for energy policy, public communication about this issue, and future research.

AB  - The vernacular school system in Malaysia has long been controversial, with national integration a focal point. Oftentimes, the range of voices over issue definition and interpretation is linked to a process of inter-ethnic negotiation and contestation with media becoming an important platform for public debate. Building on the notion that media framing has important implications for public discussion and government policy through content selection and emphasis, the present study analyses the framing of the vernacular school system in the news coverage of Malaysia's multi-lingual newspapers. A total of 555 news stories published throughout 2015 were content analyzed. It was found that both Chinese and Malay language newspapers have somewhat different focus in that they were primarily concerned with reporting education issues from a specific ethnic perspective. Interestingly, the English newspaper with its mostly English-educated, ethnically more diverse readership inclined to provide a big-picture understanding of the issue under study. Results of the study suggest that the ethnic focus of Chinese and Malay newspapers posed an obstacle to reporting on diversity and thus limiting the experience of their readers in a culturally homogenous setting despite their popularity. One strength of the English newspaper lay in the inclusiveness of its coverage where the readers could receive news from every nook and corner of the multi-ethnic society. This study will contribute to the literature on news framing of education issues by providing a better understanding of the opportunities and challenges facing vernacular schools, which could serve as a consideration of the government policy-making process towards equitable development of public education at all levels.

AB  - Purpose A novel asynchronous network-based model is proposed in this paper for the sentiment analysis of online public opinions. This new model provides a new approach to analyze the evolution characteristics of online public opinion sentiments in complex environment. Design/methodology/approach Firstly, a new sentiment analysis model is proposed based on the asynchronous network theory. Then the graphical evaluation and review technique is employed and extended to design the model-based sentiment analysis algorithms. Finally, simulations and real-world case studies are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed model. Findings The dynamics of online public opinion sentiments are determined by both personal preferences to certain topics and the complex interactive influences of environmental factors. The application of appropriate quantitative models can improve the prediction of public opinion sentiment. Practical implications The proposed model-based algorithms provide simple but effective ways to explore the complex dynamics of online public opinions. Case studies highlight the role of government agencies in shaping sentiments of public opinions on social topics. Originality/value This paper proposes a new asynchronous network model for the dynamic sentiment analysis of online public opinions. It extends the previous static models and provides a new way to extract opinion evolution patterns in complex environment. Applications of the proposed model provide some new insights into the online public opinion management.

AB  - U.S. public opinion regarding climate change has become increasingly polarized in recent years, as partisan think tanks and others worked to recast an originally scientific topic into a political wedge issue. Nominally "scientific" arguments against taking anthropogenic climate change seriously have been publicized to reach informed but ideologically receptive audiences. Reflecting the success of such arguments, polls have noted that concern about climate change increased with education among Democrats, but decreased with education among Republicans. These observations lead to the hypothesis that there exist interaction (non-additive) effects between education or knowledge and political orientation, net of other background factors, in predicting public concern about climate change. Two regional telephone surveys, conducted in New Hampshire (n = 541) and Michigan (n = 1, 008) in 2008, included identical climate-change questions that provide opportunities to test this hypothesis. Multivariate analysis of both surveys finds significant interactions. These empirical results fit with theoretical interpretations and several other recent studies. They suggest that the classically identified social bases of concern about the environment in general, and climate in particular, have shifted in recent years. Narrowcast media, including the many Web sites devoted to discrediting climate-change concerns, provide ideal conduits for channeling contrarian arguments to an audience predisposed to believe and electronically spread them further. Active-response Web sites by climate scientists could prove critical to counterbalancing contrarian arguments.

AB  - Social networks have grown exponentially in use and impact on the society as a whole. In particular, microblogging platforms such as Twitter have become important tools to assess public opinion on different issues. Recently, some approaches for assessing Twitter messages have been developed, identifying sentiments associated with relevant keywords or hashtags. However, such approaches have an important limitation, as they do not take into account contradictory and potentially inconsistent information which might emerge from relevant messages. We contend that the information made available in Twitter can be useful to extract a particular version of arguments (called "opinions" in our formalization) which emerge bottom-up from the social interaction associated with such messages. In this paper we present a novel framework which allows to mine opinions from Twitter based on incrementally generated queries. As a result, we will be able to obtain an "opinion tree", rooted in the first original query. Distinguished, conflicting elements in an opinion tree lead to so-called "conflict trees", which resemble dialectical trees as those used traditionally in defeasible argumentation.

AB  - Research on the determinants of the U.S. Supreme Court's institutional support among the public focuses on three factors at the level of the individual, including satisfaction with its performance, knowledge of the judiciary, and support for democratic values. Evidence from the group level has revealed that the relative importance of these factors can vary, despite the predictions of positivity theory that the effects of all factors should be similar across all subsets of the U.S. population. We seek to explain this inconsistency between theory and evidence through an analysis of evangelical Protestants, a politically powerful and theoretically compelling group. Drawing on group-based studies, we develop a principled account of when group members will base their institutional support more strongly than others do on their satisfaction with the Court's recent performance, and identify defining features of the information environment of evangelical Protestants that satisfy the model's components. We report evidence from a national survey that the effects of all three major factors differ systematically for evangelical Protestants. We discuss implications of our analysis for an ongoing debate over positivity theory and for identifying other groups for whom institutional and specific support will be strongly linked.

KW  - REFUGEE CRISIS
AB  - The importance of the portrayal of reality in the press is well recognised, especially with respect to its capacity to affect public opinion. Articles on migration found in the Italian press with respect to four periods - the 2014 European Parliament elections; the end of the Mare Nostrum operation in the Mediterranean in 2014; the EU-Turkey Statement of March 2016; and an eventless week in 2016 - revealed five main narratives: solidarity, responsibility, state-centred (Westphalian), instrumental and humanitarian. Each of them had its own specificities, while all were informed by Italy's condition as a frontline state with regard to migration - the EU's gatekeeper - and its paradoxical state of living in a 'permanent/potential emergency', constantly torn by its inability to reconcile security and humanitarian needs. An understanding of justice as non-domination was the main result of the analysis carried out, while there was little reference to migrants' human rights.

AB  - This study investigates a postulated 30% supportive-comment threshold as a "tipping point" for minority expression on social networking sites (SNSs) in the context of online incivility. By doing so, perceived hostility is introduced as an interactional factor explaining minority's expression (un)likelihood. Results from a 2 (comment civility: civil vs uncivil) x 3 (supportive-comment proportion: 15% vs 30% vs 45%) (N = 807) revealed that perceived hostility from uncivil comments is lowered at the 30% supportive threshold, which then leads to greater likelihood of public expression by minority opinion holders (i.e. moderated mediation). Supportive-comment proportions were, however, not found to directly affect perceived hostility in civilized discussions. Overall, minority opinion holders are more likely to react via emojis (Like, Love, Haha, Wow, Sad, Angry) in SNSs than to post comments. The implications of findings for the spiral of silence in online settings are discussed.

AB  - This study investigates how well the main science and technology focused variables included in the General Social Survey (2006-2014) by the National Science Foundation do in predicting support for science funding. These questions form the primary basis of part of a biannual report to federal lawmakers. It is therefore important to consider whether the most useful variables are included in the survey. The results suggest some bivariate relationships between funding support and demographics, use of science communication channels, science knowledge, and attitudes about science and scientists. However, the overall predictive ability of the available variables appears to be modest when included together as part of multivariate analyses. The results suggest a need for additional discussions aimed at considering revisions to the core survey questions used to track views about science and technology in the United States.

AB  - Social media interactions invariably include trolling, where disruptive or annoying comments are made online, and gender trolling is one aspect of trolling. Gender trolling in India has turned ugly, with mischievous and offensive tweets transforming into threats. However, far too little research has examined the perceptions of such trolling among women. What do Indian women on Twitter feel about trolling? Are they encountering prejudice on the platform as well? How do they cope with vitriolic trolls and online threats? This study employs a feminist narrative approach to evaluate perceptions of gender trolling among women on Twitter in India. The study aims to understand the impact of online trolling among Indian women Twitter influencers. Insights into their online trolling experiences from twenty-five selected women social media influencers on Twitter were gathered through detailed interviews. This study unravelled some critical observations and responses towards gender trolling among women Twitter influencers in India. The research also explored if the regularization of misogynistic laced gender trolling within the Indian online space alters the way women social media influencers respond to trolling.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To comprehend the perception of body image in adolescence.
   METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted with eight focus groups with 96 students of both sexes attending four public elementary school institutions in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Brazil, in 2013. An interview guide with questions about the adolescents' feelings in relation to: their bodies, standards of idealized beauty, practice of physical exercise and sociocultural influences on self-image. In the data analysis we sought to understand and interpret the meanings and contradictions of narratives, understanding the subjects' context and reasons and the internal logic of the group.
   RESULTS: Three thematic categories were identified. The influence of media on body image showed the difficulty of achieving the perfect body and is viewed with suspicion in face of standards of beauty broadcast; the importance of a healthy body was observed as standards of beauty and good looks were closely linked to good physical condition and result from having a healthy body; the relationship between the standard of beauty and prejudice, as people who are not considered attractive, having small physical imperfections, are discriminated against and can be rejected or even excluded from society.
   CONCLUSIONS: The standard of perfect body propagated by media influences adolescents' self-image and, consequently, self-esteem and is considered an unattainable goal, corresponding to a standard of beauty described as artificial and unreal. However, it causes great suffering and discrimination against those who do not feel they are attractive, which can lead to health problems resulting from low self-esteem.

AB  - This study examined seven historically Black newspapers' coverage of the landmark Supreme Court case Loving v. Virginia (1967), which overturned anti-miscegenation laws that prevented non-White individuals from marrying White individuals. A content analysis of frames and source usage within 31 news stories about the case indicated that about half of the stories (N = 14) advocated for the Lovings and a small number (N = 1) advocated for the State of Virginia; the remaining stories were either informational (N = 7) or objectivist (N = 9). Because the media is said to be a cultural mirror of public opinion, the results of this study may indicate the public's views on the issue of intermarriage laws. This study's findings also showed that historically Black newspapers agreed with their mainstream counterparts more than they disagreed.

AB  - Affective polarization (i.e., differences in evaluations of the in-party and out-party) has important implications for political outcomes including civic engagement and partisan-motivated attitudes and behaviours. In this study, we add to the burgeoning literature on affective polarization by examining moderators of the effect of in-party support on out-party opposition across the three main political parties in New Zealand. Using a large national probability sample of adults (N = 19,078), we assessed the effects of social demographics, Big-Five personality traits, liberal-conservative ideology, political identity centrality, and weekly news exposure on the relationship between in-party and out-party support. Results show political identity centrality is the strongest and most consistent moderator. The effects of some other moderators (e.g., personality, news exposure) are party-specific.

AB  - This article explores the linguistic repertoires and conceptual categories that are discursive workhorses in the task of informing U.S. public opinion and shaping policy on Palestine. It situates language commodification in a modern settler colonial context as it intersects with corporate public relations. The article probes two sites of knowledge production and circulation: the media and the academy. It argues that, ultimately, the media's discursive strategies are handmaidens of violence, enabling and legitimizing colonial relations of displacement and domination. Shifting to academic discourse, particularly anthropology, the article engages with a few selected terms to explore emerging and alternative ways of conceptually framing Palestine.

AB  - While the Internet was created without much governmental oversight, states have gradually drawn territorial borders via Internet governance. China stands out as a promoter of such a territorial-based approach. China's separate Web infrastructure shapes data when information technologies capture traces of human behavior. As a result, area expertise can contribute to the substantive, methodological, and ethical debates surrounding big data. This article discusses how a number of critical questions that have been raised about big data more generally apply to the Chinese context: How does big data change our understanding of China? What are the limitations of big data from China? What is the context in which big data is generated in China? Who has access to big data and who knows the tools? How can big data from China be used in an ethical way? These questions are intended to spark conversations about best practices for collaboration between data scientists and China experts.

AB  - Introduction
   Generating a nationally representative sample in low and middle income countries typically requires resource-intensive household level sampling with door-to-door data collection. High mobile phone penetration rates in developing countries provide new opportunities for alternative sampling and data collection methods, but there is limited information about response rates and sample biases in coverage and nonresponse using these methods. We utilized data from an interactive voice response, random-digit dial, national mobile phone survey in Ghana to calculate standardized response rates and assess representativeness of the obtained sample.
   Materials and methods
   The survey methodology was piloted in two rounds of data collection. The final survey included 18 demographic, media exposure, and health behavior questions. Call outcomes and response rates were calculated according to the American Association of Public Opinion Research guidelines. Sample characteristics, productivity, and costs per interview were calculated. Representativeness was assessed by comparing data to the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey and the National Population and Housing Census.
   Results
   The survey was fielded during a 27-day period in February-March 2017. There were 9,469 completed interviews and 3,547 partial interviews. Response, cooperation, refusal, and contact rates were 31%, 81%, 7%, and 39% respectively. Twenty-three calls were dialed to produce an eligible contact: nonresponse was substantial due to the automated calling system and dialing of many unassigned or non-working numbers. Younger, urban, better educated, and male respondents were overrepresented in the sample.
   Conclusions
   The innovative mobile phone data collection methodology yielded a large sample in a relatively short period. Response rates were comparable to other surveys, although substantial coverage bias resulted from fewer women, rural, and older residents completing the mobile phone survey in comparison to household surveys. Random digit dialing of mobile phones offers promise for future data collection in Ghana and may be suitable for other developing countries.

AB  - This study is concerned with the role of persistent online incivility in the dynamics of public opinion polarization. It examines how cyberbalkanization, contentiousness of the political context, online incivility, and opinion polarization at the collective level relate to each other. Focusing on Hong Kong and drawing upon data from different sources, the analysis shows that online incivility-operationalized as the use of foul language-grew as volume of political discussions and levels of cyberbalkanization increased. Incivility led to higher levels of opinion polarization. Online incivility, therefore, can be a mediating mechanism through which the political context and the phenomenon of cyberbalkanization exert influence on polarization.

AB  - Based on role congruity theory, we investigated how gender bias may influence public attitudes toward the vaccine in Turkey. Using a between-subjects design, we tested whether an emphasis on the female versus the male scientist as the vaccine's inventor in a news story influenced attitudes about the BioNTech vaccine and vaccination intentions. Partly confirming role congruity theory, three-way interaction results from 665 participants demonstrated that among male participants with a stronger belief in traditional gender roles (compared to males with lower belief), the presence of the female inventor, either by herself or together with the male inventor, decreased the perceived efficacy and safety of the vaccine and reduced intentions to be vaccinated by the BioNTech vaccine. We did not observe such differences for women. These findings highlight how gender bias may influence individuals' information processing and decision making in a way that may have negative consequences for public health.

AB  - Since 2014, In an area between Lombardy and Emilia Romagna, participatory action research about music and migration is being conducted. Music is a significant medium not only for shaping a new understanding of a transnational cultural identity, but also for intervening creatively to shape public opinion about cultural, ethnic, and religious diversity in contemporary Italy. Collecting data on musical practices and cultural exchanges, we are also organizing occasions of dissemination and intend to realize a database online.

AB  - ObjectiveThe study investigates sources of asymmetry between individual attitudes toward nationalist inclusion and exclusionfocusing on why public support in Russia for deporting all migrants remained about the same from 2005 to 2013, while support for admitting all migrants significantly declined.
   MethodsData from surveys based on multistage random sampling of the adult population of the Russian Federation in 2005 (N = 579) and 2013 (N = 805) are subjected to multiple (OLS) regression analysis, in which support for deportation and admission of migrants are dependent variables and survey measures (with different specifications) of intergroup threat, competition, bias, contact, and the immigration security dilemma, as well as education and media exposure are the independent variables.
   ResultsOnly two predictors consistently explained support for both inclusion and exclusion of migrants in Russia in both 2005 and 2013perceived state strength and economic vulnerability. In every test, support for exclusion nonrandomly related to more predictors in the same model than support for inclusion.
   ConclusionIn changing political and socioeconomic contexts exclusionist views are more persistent than inclusive views. Both measures need to be used in research on intergroup relations and nationalism. Otherwise, one is more likely to accept false positives while underestimating some significant enduring predictors.

AB  - Since the late 1990s public opinion about cannabis legalization has become drastically more liberal, and some states have begun to legalize cannabis for recreational use. Why have attitudes changed so much? Prior research has considered a few of the reasons for this change, but this is the first comprehensive and empirically-based study to consider the wide range of potential causes for how and why this happened. We use data from the General Social Survey, National Study of Drug Use and Health, and word searches from the New York Times. We find that attitudes largely liberalized via intracohort changes. Most Americans developed more liberal views, regardless of their race and ethnicity, gender, education, religious or political affiliation, or religious engagement. Changes in cannabis use have had minimal effects on attitudes, and legalization of cannabis has not prompted attitude change in neighboring states. As to root causes, evidence suggests that a decrease in religious affiliation, a decline in punitiveness, and a shift in media framing all contributed to changing attitudes.

AB  - Public perceptions of terrorism are out of line with reality. How can perceptions be changed? Using a 4 x 2 experimental design with a national sample of U.S. adults, we examine how source of information and details provided impact views of terrorism. Sources, details, and individual-level factors-Islamophobia, trust in media, and trust in science-impact perceived accuracy of terrorism data. Many people updated their views on terrorism after reading factual information, yet only trust in science was related with this change. In short, people can be persuaded by factual information on terrorism, but it is less clear why they change beliefs.

AB  - This article aims to analyse the process of emergence of China-related stereotypes in Angola, which have started to appear with an increasing number of Angolans establishing direct and non-direct contacts with the Chinese. The article investigates this issue based on the content of China-related articles and netizens' opinions published online from 2010 to 2015 in Angolan media (altogether 5005 cases) supplemented with coded results of 61 in-depth interviews. The results of qualitative and quantitative analysis suggest that the general image of the Chinese held by Angolans is rather positive. However, the influx of Chinese migrants into this country and a relatively high number of problematic situations involving members of the Chinese diaspora have resulted in gradual worsening of the image of this specific group. Such problematic issues include the low quality of engineering projects, maltreatment of Angolan workers and a possibility of Chinese neo-colonization of Angola.

AB  - Critics claim that journalists spread a cynical view of politics, as their relation with politicians is characterized by mistrust and hyper-adversarialism. To gain an insight into how cynical journalists themselves are about politics and how this can be explained, this article investigates the role relationship between politicians and journalists in four European countries with different political communication systems. The empirical basis for the study is a survey of over 400 political reporters from the UK, Denmark, Germany and Spain. Compared to their colleagues in Northern Europe, Spanish journalists have the most cynical view of politicians, which can partly be explained by feelings of political pressure. Journalists are cynical when they have a negative view of the role of spin doctors and believe that politicians use the media as a podium where they can be in the spotlight. The possible influence of journalists' political attitudes on news content is discussed.

AB  - This article presents and discusses the results of an experiment, which gathered audience responses to television news coded as war journalism and peace journalism respectively, in two countries, Australia and the Philippines. From the peace journalism model, evaluative criteria were first derived as a set of headings for content analysis of existing television news as broadcast in each country. The test material was then coded to fall within the upper and lower peace journalism quintiles of the 'idiom and range' of local television journalism in each case. Distinctions under the headings were particularized for individual stories by critical discourse analysis, to disclose potential sources of influence transmitted into audience frames. Data about emotional responses, gathered from self-reporting questionnaires, were combined with a textual artefact, with participants completing a 'thought-listing protocol' as they watched. Focus groups also viewed the material and provided more in-depth narrative responses. Watching peace journalism left people less angry and fearful, and more hopeful and empathic. Peace journalism viewers were also less inclined to apportion 'blame' to one 'side', and more likely to think about cooperative solutions to the problems presented.

AB  - The goal of this study is to theorize the relationship between the news and political polarization through a lens of group dynamics. Consistent with the salience hypothesis of the category fit and category accessibility interaction, we first articulate when and how news exposure makes news consumers think of themselves as Democrats or Republicans instead of unique individuals. Drawing on group polarization literature, we further hypothesize partisan self-stereotyping-an automatic reaction to partisan identity salience-as a mechanism behind the polarizing effect of partisan conflict-framed news. Two experimental studies provide a consistent pattern of support for our hypotheses. The implications of these findings were discussed in comparison with extant studies testing similar news effects under a different theoretical framework-namely, motivated reasoning.

AB  - Much has been written about the depiction of refugees in newspapers and television news, yet far less is known about how refugees are portrayed in Internet news. In this era of increasing Internet use, it is important to also study how refugees are depicted by Internet news websites. We used a quantitative coding sheet to investigate how Dutch news websites covered refugees. Our research found, first, that Dutch Internet news reports rather positively about refugees. This finding is directly linked to a conceptual decision, however, as we categorized references to victimization as positive coverage of refugees. Second, we found no significant difference between commercial and public Internet news sources in their depiction of refugees. Finally, we found a tendency towards depersonalization of refugees across all of the Dutch Internet news sources examined, which is reflected in the more frequent use of thematic over episodic frames.

AB  - In an online Qualtrics panel survey experiment (N = 1620), we found that scientists posting self-portraits ("selfies") to Instagram from the science lab/field were perceived as significantly warmer and more trustworthy, and no less competent, than scientists posting photos of only their work. Participants who viewed scientist selfies, especially posts containing the face of a female scientist, perceived scientists as significantly warmer than did participants who saw science-only images or control images. Participants who viewed selfies also perceived less symbolic threat from scientists. Most encouragingly, participants viewing selfies, either of male or female scientists, did not perceive scientists as any less competent than did participants viewing science-only or control images. Subjects who viewed female scientist selfies also perceived science as less exclusively male. Our findings suggest that self-portraiture by STEM professionals on social media can mitigate negative attitudes toward scientists.

AB  - U.S. President Barack Obama's much-anticipated address in Egypt in 2009 promised a new beginning between the U.S. government and the Arab world but only a few years later there were many criticisms that the U.S. President did not live up to his promises, driving Arab attitudes toward the United States to their lowest point in years. Five years later, we analyzed Arabic-language twitter messages involving President Obama to examine cognitive and affective attributes. Results show that tweets by members of the media differed greatly from tweets by members of the public. The public tweets held more negative attitudes towards the U.S. President than tweets by news organizations. Members of the public also were more likely to link the President to a wider range of countries, suggesting a greater diversity of attributes, while primarily fixating on the Palestinian issue.

AB  - Facebook users are exposed to diverse news and political content; this means that Facebook is a significant tool for the enhancement of civic participation and engagement in politics. However, it has been argued that Facebook, through its algorithmic curation reinforces the pre-existing attitudes of individuals, rather than challenging or potentially altering them. The objective of this study is to elucidate the emotional and behavioural impact of the personalization of Facebook users' News Feeds results, and thereby to uncover a possible link between their online and offline civic attitudes. Firstly, we investigate the extent to which users' Facebook News Feeds results are personalized and customized to fit users' pre-existing civic attitudes and political interests. Secondly, we explore whether users embody new roles as a result of their emotional and behavioural interaction with political content on Facebook. Our methodology is based on a quantitative survey involving 108 participants. Our findings indicate that, while Facebook can potentially expose users to varying political views and beliefs, it tends to reinforce existing civic attitudes and validate what users already hold to be true. Furthermore, we find that users themselves often assume a proactive stance towards Facebook News Feed results, acquiring roles in which they filter and even censor the content to which they are exposed and thus trying to obfuscate algorithmic curation.

AB  - Cultural theory (CT) has been widely used to explain variations in risk perception but has rarely been tested in Canada. This contribution represents the most thorough attempt to adapt CT to the Canadian context. Study results suggest that respondents' commitment to egalitarianism was strongly correlated with risks from technology, while respondents' commitment to hierarchism was strongly correlated with risks from criminal or unsafe behaviours. Respondents' commitment to individualism was also correlated with risks from criminal and unsafe behaviours but differed from hierarchism in that individualism was not correlated with risk perceptions from prostitution and marijuana use. Respondents' commitments to fatalism were strongly correlated with risk perception of vaccines. These conclusions are reinforced by results from a survey question that tests the extent to which such cultural predispositions map onto the myths of nature hypothesized by CT and by a survey experiment that tests how cultural commitments predict perceived risks from a controversial pipeline.

T2  - RHETORIC SOCIETY QUARTERLY

KW  - RHETORICAL THEORY
KW  - TOPICS
AB  - Since the 1960s, invention theory has reinvented itself. This essay aims to map and advance that process. It provides a window into the recent intellectual history of rhetorical studies and advocates continued development of sociologically informed rhetorical theories open to culture, materiality, and post-humanist understandings. I argue that invention theory has productively organized itself around two sets of dialectical tensions but remains constrained by two longstanding prejudices. The productive tensions revolve around (a) breaking with and affirming inherited rhetorical traditions and (b) conceiving invention as emplaced or dispersed. The prejudices consist of a continued logophilia and normative privileging of creativity and newness. I map the dialectics and prejudices across modern, premodern, and postmodern orientations. I then provide a revised definition and heuristic framework revolving around a concept, inventional media, which aims to capture invention's simultaneous emplacement and dispersal across processes of discovery, creativity, and rhetorical reproduction.

AB  - Simple Summary The widespread dissemination of information related to wildlife utilization in new online media and traditional media undoubtedly impacts societal conservation concepts and attitudes, thus triggering public discussions on the relationship between conservation and utilization. In this study, questionnaires were distributed in seven major geographic regions of Chinese mainland to investigate the public's awareness and agreement with information related to the utilization of wildlife in order to measure the impact of information on various issues relating wildlife conservation and utilization. The Chinese public had the greatest awareness and agreement with information that prevents unsustainable and illegal utilization, and the least awareness and agreement with information that promotes unsustainable utilization. It is also noteworthy that the Chinese public have higher levels of awareness and agreement with information that does not support utilization than with information that supports sustainable utilization. From our research, we can conclude that overall the public tends to support and be informed by a purist view of conservation, and there is significantly less support for conservation based on sustainable utilization. On this basis, we suggest that in the future, conservation education should seek to balance the public's respect and love for nature which is often inspired by social media, with more scientific information about scientific understandings that influence conservation policy and practice. The widespread dissemination of information related to wildlife utilization in new online media and traditional media undoubtedly impacts societal conservation concepts and attitudes, thus triggering public discussions on the relationship between conservation and utilization. A study on how public attitudes and concepts are affected by the related information on wildlife utilization is helpful to implement the scientific wildlife conservation and management strategies, and to propose targeted measures to optimize the information environment. We designed the questionnaire to investigate the public's awareness and agreement with related information on wildlife utilization so as to measure how information with different dissemination channels, source types, and content orientation influenced the public's concept of wildlife conservation and utilization. The questionnaire was distributed in seven major geographical regions throughout China. Out of a total of 1645 questionnaires that were collected, 1294 questionnaires were valid, with an effective rate of 78.7%. Results show that respondents had the greatest awareness of information on preventing unsustainable and illegal utilization, and the lowest awareness of information on promoting unsustainable utilization, and that awareness of information that against utilization was higher than that of information which supported sustainable utilization. At the same time, respondents showed the greatest agreement for information on preventing unsustainable utilization and the lowest agreement for information on promoting unsustainable utilization; also, their agreement with information that against utilization was higher than that for information which supported sustainable use. Respondents had a high level of awareness of information on wildlife related to COVID-19 provided by experts.
   Gender, age, the level of development of the city in which they live, education, vegetarianism, and religious beliefs all affected respondents' agreement with related information on wildlife utilization.
   This research suggests that the publicity and education of scientific conservation methods should be emphasized in the future conservation education. In addition, scholars in the field of wildlife research should assume the role of 'influencer' and give full play to the scientific guidance of public opinion.

AB  - This explanatory concurrent mixed-methods study aimed to explore vicarious trauma (VT) among American Muslims; whether they are experiencing it, what factors may be contributing, and how they are experiencing VT. VT and religious identity were the main variables of interest for the quantitative data; qualitative questions provided greater insight into participants' personal experiences. Religious identity and ethnicity were found to be significant in the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) model and collectively explained 21% of the variance in VT scores. Phenomenological qualitative analysis of the qualitative responses revealed 9 themes, including humanity (being seen as less than human) and exposure (to trauma material). This study suggests that American Muslims are experiencing VT; in combination with qualitative responses, important policy changes can be recommended: policies addressing hate crimes should be strengthened, individuals in key professions need to be trained in Islam and Muslims, and further media guidelines and training must be conducted.

AB  - Gun violence is a critical public health problem in the United States, but it is rarely at the top of the public policy agenda. The 2012 mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, opened a rare window of opportunity to strengthen firearm policies in the United States. In this study, we examine the American public's exposure to competing arguments for and against federal- and state-level universal background check laws, which would require a background check prior to every firearm sale, in a large sample of national and regional news stories (n = 486) published in the year following the Newtown shooting. Competing messages about background check laws could influence the outcome of policy debates by shifting support and political engagement among key constituencies such as gun owners and conservatives. We found that news media messages in support of universal background checks were fact-based and used rational arguments, and opposing messages often used rights-based frames designed to activate the core values of politically engaged gun owners. Reframing supportive messages about background check policies to align with gun owners' and conservatives' core values could be a promising strategy to increase these groups' willingness to vocalize their support for expanding background checks for firearm sales.

AB  - While video games unquestionably became more diverse and inclusive in the past decade, there is still a striking underrepresentation of characters whose bodies do not conform to the heterosexist concept of normativity, including those perceived as fat. My article begins with the introduction of fat studies as the interdisciplinary field concerned with the ways media construct fat people as unattractive, undesirable, and asexual. Next, it discusses how these prejudices are reflected in a medium in which fat has been historically coded as villainous and monstrous. The last part includes two case studies of positive fat representation: Ellie from the mainstream game Borderlands 2 (Gearbox Software 2012) and the eponymous character from the independent title Felix the Reaper (Kong Orange 2019). Their gender performances are coded equally as non-normative.

AB  - Recent studies have shown evidence of increasing levels of attitude polarization in the United States. This study adds to this line of inquiry by examining whether important structural changes to the media system in 1996, which included the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the introduction of Fox News, affected TV news' contribution to affective polarization. Using the American National Election Studies (ANES) cumulative data file, we test the media's contribution to affective polarization before and after 1996 using spline regression. Our results show an increase in affective polarization over time, with greater increases after 1996. In addition, we show that after 1996, TV news use contributes to increasing levels of affective polarization in the United States.

AB  - Background Children at earlier stages tend to be more susceptible towards different types of tobacco messages. These are able to influence attitudes and behaviours around smoking. This study examined how these messages are able to influence 5- and 6-year olds' attitudes about smokers and their smoking intentions.
   Methods Researchers worked one-on-one with 5- and 6-year olds (n = 398) in Brazil. Children could attribute positive and negative characteristics to two different persons in photos as smoker/ non-smoker. Children could indicate the attribute as of a smoker, a non-smoker, both or none. Children were asked also about their smoking intentions. Analysis considered parental smoking, sex, age, cigarette and alcohol brand logos, children's location and media characters from cartoons. We conducted a path analysis for a multivariate model of children's attitudes and intentions about smoking.
   Results Overall, children had negative attitudes about smokers (M = 4.58, SD = 4.08) and a total of 32 (8.0%) of them reported intentions to smoke. The resulting multivariate model indicates that parental smoking is a source for a positive image of smokers, while being 6 years old, living in rural areas, being aware of alcohol brands and recognizing educational cartoons tended to be negatively correlated to children's attitudes. Further, 6 year olds were found to be less likely to have smoking intentions, while attitude about smokers was positively related with intentions, One's attitudes served as a mediator for all of the variables in the model towards smoking intentions. The path models differed for each sex.
   Conclusion Shaped by social and environmental influences, very young children have opinions about smokers. In turn, these attitudes significantly predict children's smoking intentions. To corroborate this research, we recommend that longitudinal designs be employed to help model why Brazilian children become smokers.

AB  - If residents' perceptions, concerns and attitudes towards waste management facilities are either not well understood or underestimated, people can produce strong opposition that may include protest demonstrations and violent conflicts such as those experienced in the Campania Region of Italy. The aim of this study was to verify the effects of the closure of solid waste treatment and disposal facilities (two landfills and one RDF production plant) on public perception of odour and environmental pollution. The study took place in four villages in Southern Italy. Identical questionnaires were administered to residents during 2003 and after the closure of the facilities occurred in 2008. The residents' perception of odour nuisance considerably diminished between 2003 and 2009 for the nearest villages, with odour perception showing an association with distance from the facilities. Post closure, residents had difficulty in identifying the type of smell due to the decrease in odour level. During both surveys, older residents reported most concern about the potentially adverse health impacts of long-term exposure to odours from MSW facilities. However, although awareness of MSW facilities and concern about potentially adverse health impacts varied according to the characteristics of residents in 2003, substantial media coverage produced an equalisation effect and increased knowledge about the type of facilities and how they operated. It is possible that residents of the village nearest to the facilities reported lower awareness of and concern about odour and environmental pollution because the municipality received economic compensation for their presence.

AB  - Prior work has reported mixed evidence for the gender gap in crime concern and crime responses, yet very few studies have considered the importance of the framing of a crime in explaining this gap. Crime frames are important because they can raise deep levels of concern that activate a criminal justice system response to the crime. This study draws on the literature on problem framing to examine gender differences in crime concern and crime responses in relation to human trafficking. Human trafficking is a type of crime that has raised public alarm in the U.S and is being framed by the government and the media as a crime to which women are at increased risk. Using data from a national probability sample of approximately 2000 Americans, the findings show that beliefs about the causes of human trafficking, specifically gender discrimination and transnational crime, are associated with gender differences in concern and activation of the criminal justice system. These findings can guide future research on gender differences in crime concern and crime responses and call for research and policies that are sensitive to gendered effects of framing on public opinion about crime and criminal justice issues.

AB  - A large portion of the global population generates various multimedia data such as texts, images, videos, etc. One of the most common categories which influences the public at large is visual multimedia content. Due to the different social media platforms (e.g., Whatsapp, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube), these materials are passed without censorship and national boundaries. Multimedia data containing any violent or vulgar objects could trigger public unrest, and thus, it is a serious threat to the law and order of the land. Children and teenagers use social media like never before in previous generations and create lots of multimedia data. It is important to assess the quality of multimedia content without any bias and prejudices. Although the mainstream social media platforms use different filters and moderation using human experts, it is impossible to verify the terabytes of uploaded images and videos. Thus, it is inevitable to automate the content assessment phase without incurring an increase in upload time. This study aims to prevent uploading or to tag an image/video with a reasonable percentage of a gun as content. In this paper, object detection architectures such as Faster RCNN, EfficientDet, and YOLOv5 have been used to demonstrate how these techniques can efficiently detect human faces and different types of guns in given multimedia data (images/videos). The models are tested on various test images and video clips. A comparative analysis has also been discussed based on mean average precision and frames per second metric. The YOLOv5 provides the best-performing results as high as 80.39% and 35.22% at mAP(0.5) and mAP([0.50:0.95]), respectively. A face recognition task requires thousands of samples and the usual deep learning models are data-driven. On the contrary, a few- shot learning approach has been implemented to recognize the detected faces categorizing the content as real or reel.

AB  - Purpose: This study investigates the portrayal of Angelina Jo lie's preventive bilateral mastectomy in the news media. Content analysis of print news was conducted to identify major frames used in press coverage, the overall tone of discussions, how journalists report broader questiorth about BRCA1/2 testing and hereditary breast/ovarian cancer, and whether they raise concerns about the impact of celebrities on patients' choices and public opinion.
   Methods: The Factiva database was used to collect publications on Jo lie's preventive mastectomy in elite newspapers in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The data set consisted of 103 newspaper articles published in the first month of media coverage.
   Results: The results show that although the press discussed key issues surrounding predictive genetic testing and preventive options for women at high risk of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer, important medical information about the rarity of jolie's condition was not communicated to the public.
   Conclusion: The results highlight the media's overwhelmingly positive slant toward Jolie's mastectomy, while overlooking the relative rarity of her situation, the challenges of "celebrity medicine and how celebrities influence people's medical decisions. Future research is required to investigate whether the media hype has influenced demand and use of BRCA1/2 testing and preventive mastectomies.

AB  - The process of interaction between the political regimes of Belarus and Russia in the critically important conditions of the presidential election and subsequent protests in 2020 calls into question the prospects for Belarusian democracy and national sovereignty. This report analyzes the role of state propaganda in this process by examining its most important components, including its mechanisms, evolution, and influence. Using qualitative framing and content analysis of media news stories in both countries before and after the election, as well as a focus group and surveys conducted after the election, the authors examine how Russian and Belarusian state-sponsored propaganda framed each other, how these post-election events affected propaganda in general, and how propaganda affected public opinion. They have identified changes in all three areas prior to and after the election as significant and ultimately determined by the geopolitical fight for influence in post-Soviet space.

TI  - Stealing an Education: On the Precariousness of Justice
T2  - TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA  - English

KW  - SEGREGATION
KW  - RACISM
AB  - Background/Context: This article examines a 2011 court case in which an Ohio state court convicted and jailed a pool; single, Black mother of two school-aged children for "stealing an education." Using a false address, the mother, Kelley Williams-Bolar, enrolled her daughters in a public school district that was more privileged and amply resourced than their home district in order to provide her children a "better education." The court's ruling and public opinion on this case (as illustrated through media) serve as the context of this article's analysis.
   Purpose: Employing Judith Butler's concept of precarity, Jacques Derrida's theory of justice to come, and Hannah Arendt's and Walter Benjamin's ideas about state violence, the article offers a conceptual framework of the precariousness of justice to analyze the implications of this case. Through the precariousness of justice framework, the article examines the ways that racial and class societal inequities manifest themselves through the judge's juridical determination and journalistic expressions of public opinion. The purpose of this article is to explicate the intimate and structural connections between racism, classism, educational policy, and the U.S. court system.
   Research Design: As a conceptual analysis, the article theoretically examines the Williams-Bolar court case as a demonstration of the ways in which the juridical apparatus of the state (the court system) and mainstream media (public opinion) divide people by race and class within inequitable societal structures. The article uses the theoretical framework of the precariousness of justice to examine the political implications of the court's ruling on educational policy regarding school districting.
   Conclusions: Findings include that school district enrollment boundaries create borders around people by race and class, and that these educational enrollment borders can lead to people "border-hopping" in an effort to equalize educational access. The court system plays a role in reifying race- and class-based educational boundaries and borders. The concluding analysis situates this case within the context of both state violence and hope.

AB  - Recent years have seen an upsurge in the digital environment and the reliance placed upon it by society. This case study reports on a project which sought to examine how the digital environment can be utilized for science communication, exploring the role of social media and particularly short online videos, as an effective means through which to engage the public with science, environment and conservation messages. Using as its focus a 300-mile trek around the coast of Cornwall (Sophie's Wild Cornwall) we examine how science was communicated real-time using online videos and social media over a 5-week period, as well as data from an online public opinion survey (n = 129). The observations gleaned identify a number of key themes for others wishing to adopt digital approaches within their science communication activities, including the role of web-based presenter-led narratives, the value of accessibility and interaction on social media platforms, and online videos potential for stimulating proactive, participatory engagement, and interest in an environmental context. Effective online video use requires a balance between crafting an informative yet entertaining narrative without compromising scientific accuracy; yet ultimately, social media platforms may represent a potential "stepping-stone" for practitioners to consider implementing in a journey toward "upstream engagement".

AB  - Considerable evidence exists that Americans possess not only low levels of political knowledge but also relatively uninformed-and sometimes misinformed-opinions on policy matters. Many recent studies focus on whether informational treatments have immediate effects on citizens' factual beliefs and opinions about policy, but less is known about whether such treatments have enduring effects. Using a three-wave panel experiment, we assess the immediate and enduring effects of factual information provision on factual beliefs and opinion of the Affordable Care Act. We find a relatively persistent effect of information provision on accuracy of factual beliefs, but only an ephemeral shift in opinion, which typically drifts back to its pretreatment state within a few weeks. Our findings have implications for the understanding of citizen learning and opinion change, as well as ongoing scholarly debates about how long-lasting the effects of (experimental) interventions are.

Specifically, the fluctuation of the corpus ranking is studied, and a sample of the ten best-positioned pages in each country is taken to analyze their content (the authorship of the website, the stance of the effectiveness of homeopathy, the presence of controversy and the type of content). The results show that the ranking is stable; that the stance of homeopathy is linked to the state of public opinion in the country; and that the majority of websites that appear better-positioned are from media.

AB  - Italy was the first European country to be affected by COVID-19, facing an unprecedented situation. The reaction required drastic solutions and highly restrictive measures, which severely tested the trust of the Italian people. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the introduced measures was not only linked to political decisions, but also to the choice of the Italian people to trust and rely on institutions, accepting such necessary measures. In this context, the role of information sources was fundamental, since they strongly influence public opinion. The central focus of this research was to assess the information seeking behavior (ISB) of the Italian citizens, to understand how they related to information and how their specific use of information influenced public opinion. By making use of a survey addressed to 4260 Italian citizens, we identified extraordinarily virtuous behavior in the population: people strongly modified their ISB in order to address the most reliable sources. In particular, we found a very high reliance on scientists, which is particularly striking, if compared to the past. Moreover, starting from the survey results, we used social simulation to estimate the evolution of public opinion. Comparing the ISB during and before COVID-19, we discovered that the shift in the ISB, during the pandemic, may have actually positively influenced public opinion, facilitating the acceptance of the costly restrictions introduced.

KW  - HOMOPHOBIA
AB  - This article is a rhetorical corpus study of the use of -phobia in online alternative media. The term phobia is used in the psychiatric domain to refer to a range of anxiety disorders, but is now also commonly used to identify social tensions. Terms such as transphobia and Isla-mophobia have within a few decades become central to contemporary political debate. The article examines in what way such coinages are used in a variety of online publications, and thus seeks to contribute to a better understanding of the entanglement of political and medical vocabulary. The study is based on data from the Genealogies of Knowledge Internet corpus, which are analysed in terms of collocation and other forms of linguistic patterning. The analysis reveals that online articles situated on the left of the political spectrum contain a large number of formulaic but open-ended lists of socio-political phobias, supplemented with other other undesirable attitudes such as sexism and racism. The article further reflects on the connections between the rhetoric of listing and intersectional analysis, on cultural conceptions of pathology, and on the polarised alignment of attitudes towards scientific and political issues in today's public debate.

AB  - Background: China is at the forefront of global efforts to develop COVID-19 vaccines and has five fast-tracked candidates at the final-stage, large-scale human clinical trials testing phase. Vaccine-promoting policymaking for public engagement is a prerequisite for social mobilization. However, making an informed and judicious choice is a dilemma for the Chinese government in the vaccine promotion context.
   Objective: In this study, public opinions in China were analyzed via dialogues on Chinese social media, based on which Chinese netizens' views on COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination were investigated. We also aimed to develop strategies for promoting vaccination programs in China based on an in-depth understanding of the challenges in risk communication and social mobilization.
   Methods: We proposed a novel behavioral dynamics model, SRS/I (susceptible-reading-susceptible/immune), to analyze opinion transmission paradigms on Chinese social media. Coupled with a meta-analysis and natural language processing techniques, the emotion polarity of individual opinions was examined in their given context.
   Results: We collected more than 1.75 million Weibo messages about COVID-19 vaccines from January to October 2020. According to the public opinion reproduction ratio (R-0), the dynamic propagation of those messages can be classified into three periods: the ferment period (R-01=1.1360), the revolution period (R-02=2.8278), and the transmission period (R-03=3.0729). Topics on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in China include price and side effects. From September to October, Weibo users claimed that the vaccine was overpriced, making up 18.3% (n=899) of messages; 38.1% (n=81,909) of relevant topics on Weibo received likes. On the contrary, the number of messages that considered the vaccine to be reasonably priced was twice as high but received fewer likes, accounting for 25.0% (n=53,693). In addition, we obtained 441 (47.7%) positive and 295 (31.9%) negative Weibo messages about side effects. Interestingly, inactivated vaccines instigated more heated discussions than any other vaccine type. The discussions, forwards, comments, and likes associated with topics related to inactivated vaccines accounted for 53% (n=588), 42% (n=3072), 56% (n=3671), and 49% (n=17,940), respectively, of the total activity associated with the five types of vaccines in China.
   Conclusions: Most Chinese netizens believe that the vaccine is less expensive than previously thought, while some claim they cannot afford it for their entire family. The findings demonstrate that Chinese individuals are inclined to be positive about side effects over time and are proud of China's involvement with vaccine development. Nevertheless, they have a collective misunderstanding about inactivated vaccines, insisting that inactivated vaccines are safer than other vaccines. Reflecting on netizens' collective responses, the unfolding determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance provide illuminating benchmarks for vaccine-promoting policies.

AB  - In their public messages, United States politicians often invoke America in an attempt to unite citizens and build electoral coalitions. Such an emphasis is particularly common in presidential debates, which are climactic "media events" late in campaigns for the White House, when candidates take questions from journalists and citizens while addressing millions of voters. We analyzed the connection between (a) candidates' highlighting of national identity in presidential debates and (b) mass public opinion since 1960. We expected and found that (a) candidates increased their emphasis on the nation during times of heightened national uncertainty, (b) Democratic presidential candidates invoked the nation more often than Republican candidates, and (c) comparisons across elections among incumbents suggest that national uncertainty was more important than partisan identity in eliciting invocations of the nation.

AB  - This article considers the beginnings of the British actor Roddy McDowall's career as a child star in Hollywood. Following his relocation to the United States in October 1940 and signing a contract with Twentieth Century-Fox, McDowall quickly became one of Hollywood's most popular juvenile actors. For the duration of the Second World War, McDowall's star image was indissoluble from his status as a war guest: he was 'a British evacuee star'. McDowall thus became an unofficial ambassador for the British nation, much like his fellow evacuees, who were widely recognised for their work improving Anglo-American relations. In the management of McDowall's image, and in his screen performances, there is a discernible effort to substantiate certain attitudes about the character and attributes of the British nation but also to challenge certain prejudices about English sissy boys. McDowall's star text was carefully managed so that the image of the actor presented by the media and the fictional characters he played on screen congealed in a productive way to inspire among American audiences specific sentiments about the British and America's relationship with the British nation during wartime. Analysing the representation of McDowall in American film magazines during the early 1940s, as well as his performances in three war-themed productions - Confirm or Deny (1941), On the Sunny Side (1942) and The White Cliffs of Dover (1944) - I explore the ways McDowall's star text functioned in its geopolitical and bio-political contexts.

AB  - Background: Social media have been increasingly adopted by health agencies to disseminate information, interact with the public, and understand public opinion. Among them, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is one of the first US government health agencies to adopt social media during health emergencies and crisis. It had been active on Twitter during the 2016 Zika epidemic that caused 5168 domestic noncongenital cases in the United States.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to quantify the temporal variabilities in CDC's tweeting activities throughout the Zika epidemic, public engagement defined as retweeting and replying, and Zika case counts. It then compares the patterns of these 3 datasets to identify possible discrepancy among domestic Zika case counts, CDC's response on Twitter, and public engagement in this topic.
   Methods: All of the CDC-initiated tweets published in 2016 with corresponding retweets and replies were collected from 67 CDC-associated Twitter accounts. Both univariate and multivariate time series analyses were performed in each quarter of 2016 for domestic Zika case counts, CDC tweeting activities, and public engagement in the CDC-initiated tweets.
   Results: CDC sent out >84.0% (5130/6104) of its Zika tweets in the first quarter of 2016 when Zika case counts were low in the 50 US states and territories (only 560/5168, 10.8% cases and 662/38,885, 1.70% cases, respectively). While Zika case counts increased dramatically in the second and third quarters, CDC efforts on Twitter substantially decreased. The time series of public engagement in the CDC-initiated tweets generally differed among quarters and from that of original CDC tweets based on autoregressive integrated moving average model results. Both original CDC tweets and public engagement had the highest mutual information with Zika case counts in the second quarter. Furthermore, public engagement in the original CDC tweets was substantially correlated with and preceded actual Zika case counts.
   Conclusions: Considerable discrepancies existed among CDC's original tweets regarding Zika, public engagement in these tweets, and actual Zika epidemic. The patterns of these discrepancies also varied between different quarters in 2016. CDC was much more active in the early warning of Zika, especially in the first quarter of 2016. Public engagement in CDC's original tweets served as a more prominent predictor of actual Zika epidemic than the number of CDC's original tweets later in the year.

AB  - A broad spectrum of public opinion has long portrayed the Internet as a harbinger of liberal-democratic ethos-renewal. Recent empirical evidence, however, points to opposite, ethos-reversing effects. This paper theorizes how liberal polities condition ethos-renewing and ethos-reversing cycles of digital transformation. I advance a number of ideal-typical propositions on Internet-enabled ethos-renewal and ethos-reversal, illustrating my propositions with examples from two liberal polities with leading digital transformation ambitions: Finland and the UK. Ethos-renewal requires paradigm-shifting public investment by representative and direct democracy bodies in five complementary spheres of digital transformation: i) politics: enhance the representativeness of and participation in political decision-making through Internet-enabled direct democracy methods of deliberation, ii) media: invest private (social) media with a public journalism ethos to counter-balance profit-oriented amplification of post-truth phenomena, iii) identity: pro-actively renew emotional belonging to a moral digital community in face of globalization and individualization pressures, iv) education: create Netizens resilient to post-truth phenomena on (social) media, and v) markets: place digital transformation at service of an algorithmic and data commons rather than techno-feudal digital enclosures.

AB  - Narratives of the mid-18th-century state as drifting towards oligarchy and closure have long been superseded by accounts stressing its responsiveness to outside interests and opinion. Participatory election rituals, crowd activity and the expansion of print media demonstrate that political activism was not limited to a narrow circle of elites, even after the passage of the 1716 Septennial Act. Additionally, as an institution after 1688 the Westminster parliament rendered itself useful to propertied society through its passage of greater amounts of legislation. However, while the strength of party and trajectory of electoral participation is well mapped, as are addresses to the crown, the petitioning of interest groups has had few systematic quantitative surveys. This article first sets out the chronology of petitioning to both houses of parliament from 1660 to 1788, demonstrating that petitioning was at its height before 1722, rather than rising to its greatest levels with the reform movements in the 1780s. Second, the article demonstrates the role of petitioning in expanding the political nation beyond the boundaries of parliamentary boroughs, and why, on occasion, petitioning involved women and illiterate men. Third, in order to emphasize the continuity in petitioning and its contribution to the formation of public opinion, the article compares the different roles that concurrent subscription practices envisaged for the public. Finally, the article argues that despite the rising tendency to cite numerical strength to arbitrate political divisions, petitioners continued to legitimise their voices on the basis of representing collections of reasons and interests rather than opinion.

AB  - Parties face a dilemma when confronted with shifting public opinion or changing rival parties' issue positions: while ignoring ongoing changes could lead to electoral losses, position shifts on a salient issue might be perceived as flip-flopping and alienate supporters. This paper proposes a model combining positional and framing approaches in order to understand how parties can shift their position on a specific issue without losing face. The empirical analysis of rhetoric-based estimates of party strategies draws upon a corpus of 8790 press releases issued by Swiss parties between 2007 and 2016 on the issue of migration. The results show that parties, rather than bluntly shifting their opinion on the issue, prefer to draw the public's attention toward another set of frames that allows for a different position. These results have important implications for our understanding of parties' competition on issues, as well as for the literature on mass-elite linkages.

AB  - Studies that have engaged parasport broadcasting, particularly through a narrative lens, have almost exclusively relied on textual and/or content analysis of the Paralympic Games as the source of cultural critique. We know far less about the decisions taken inside Paralympic broadcasters that have led to such representations. In this study - based on interviews with senior production and promotion staff at the United Kingdom's Paralympic broadcaster, Channel 4 - we provide the first detailed examination of mediated parasport from this vantage point. We explore the use of promotional devices such as athletes' backstories - the 'Hollywood treatment' - to both hook audiences and serve as a vehicle for achieving its social enterprise mandate to change public attitudes towards disability. In so doing, we reveal myriad tensions that coalesce around representing the Paralympics, with respect to the efforts made to balance the competing goals of key stakeholders and a stated desire to make the Paralympics both a commercial and socially progressive success.

AB  - This paper explores how cyber threats are represented in Swedish newspapers. The sample comprises 1269 articles from three newspapers (Aftonbladet, Gateborgs-Posten, and Svenska Dagbladet) covering 25 years (1995-2019). The study provides a text-near and detailed analysis of the threats covered. The study analyzes these threats along several dimensions: their modality (e.g. unauthorized access or manipulation); to what extent ambiguous themes (e.g. attack, crime, and warfare) are specified in context; how cyber-threat coverage has changed over time; and the event orientation of the coverage, i.e. whether articles address topical events and, if so, which ones. There are five main findings. First, the Swedish newspaper cybersecurity discourse covers multiple threats; in total, 34 themes (present in at least 4% of articles) have been identified. Second, the representation of cyber threats varies in specificity. While generic themes such as attack and warfare are mostly specified in terms of their modality, they sometimes are not, leaving the representation vague. Third, this study, given its general approach, provides insights into media representations of particular cyber threats. For example, this study finds the meaning of "hacking" in the media to be more diversified and nuanced than previously assumed (e.g. as simply meaning "computer breakin"). Fourth, newspaper coverage of cyber threats has changed over time, in both quantity (i.e. the amount of coverage has increased) and quality, as three general trends have been observed: the state-ification and militarization of threats (i.e. increased attention to, e.g. nations and warfare as threats), the organization-ification of threats (i.e. increased attention to, e.g. government agencies and companies as threats), and the diversification and hyping of threats (i.e. cumulatively more threats are added to the cybersecurity discourse, although attention to particular threats is sometimes restricted in time). Finally, parallel to coverage of particular topical events (e.g. the "I love you" virus), newspaper representations of cyber threats largely exemplify "amplification without the event," i.e. threats are covered without linking them to topical events, as is otherwise typical of news reports. The findings in relation to previous studies of cybersecurity discourse and the implications for informal learning and threat perception are discussed.

AB  - A growing body of research has given attention to issues surrounding genetic testing, including expanded carrier screening (ECS), an elective medical test that allows planning or expecting parents to consider the potential occurrence of genetic diseases and disorders in their children. These studies have noted the role of the mass media in driving public perceptions about such testing, giving particular attention to ways in which coverage of genetics and genetic testing broadly may drive public attitudes and choices concerning the morality, legality, ethics, and parental well-being involved in genetic technologies. However, few studies have explored how mass media are covering the newer test, ECS. Drawing on health-related framing studies that have shown in varying degrees the impact particular frames such as gain/loss and thematic/episodic can have on the public, this study examines the frame selection employed by online media in its coverage of ECS. This analysiscombined with an analysis of the sources and topics used in such coverage and how they relate to selected frameshelps to clarify how mass media are covering an increasingly important medical test and offers considerations of how such coverage may inform mass media scholarship as well as health-related practices.

KW  - Internet
AB  - Controversies around genetically modified (GM) food have become particularly prevalent in China. To understand the situation, 257 GM cartoons were collected from various Chinese online sources. We found that China's GM cartoons peaked during controversial social events from the end of 2012 to 2016, which is consistent with the Baidu Media Index on GM headline news. About 85% of the cartoons involve GM food and more than half of cartoons share scary information. The mainstream media is more neutral and not only presents the dilemma in choice but also promotes genetically modified organisms (GMOs). However, social media inclines toward a more pessimistic view, providing scary information and focusing on health risks and conspiracy theories. Controversial topics have fueled the spread of political conspiracy theories. Generally, scientists supporting GMOs have been criticized under suspicion of betraying their country, and the issue of GM food in China reflects strong political views.

AB  - In this article we analyze data from high-quality surveys conducted in the United States and the United Kingdom that included multiple symbolic and operational measures of political ideology and psychological orientations. Our overarching goal is to elucidate the nature of conceptual and empirical connections between neoliberalism and social conservatism. In so doing, we revisit three major questions about public opinion in neoliberal societies: (1) Are ordinary citizens "innocent" of ideology? (2) Are social and economic dimensions of ideology structurally and functionally independent? (3) Are support for laissez-faire capitalism and opposition to welfare-hallmarks of neoliberal ideology-unrelated or negatively related to authoritarianism? In contrast to previous investigations relying upon fewer and poorer measures, we found that ordinary citizens do indeed hold coherent political attitudes, and their attitudes about social and economic issues are closely aligned. For instance, we observed that for five previously published ideological instruments, social and economic attitudes were robustly correlated in two large U.S. samples (with rs ranging from .40 to .69)-for respondents who were relatively low (.31 <= r <= .60) as well as high in political sophistication (.50 <= r <= .77). Contradicting prior claims, we found no evidence that support for the free market was negatively associated with authoritarianism for any group of respondents or any measure of authoritarianism. On the contrary, economic conservatism and the endorsement of neoliberal attitudes were strongly associated with right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, economic system justification, and gender-specific system justification (with rs ranging from .53 to .76). We conclude that the political belief systems of ordinary citizens are coherently organized around support for versus opposition to both social and economic forms of inequality in contemporary capitalist societies.

AB  - Research on public perceptions of voter fraud often relies on items that gauge the frequency of noncitizen voting, double voting, and posing as someone else. Few studies explore the underlying sentiments that structure the concept of voter fraud and its meaning to people. Further, no study has examined whether these dominant survey items fully capture the ways in which people understand and articulate their views about voter fraud. We use original surveys with open-ended questions to explore public perceptions of voter fraud. With a combination of in-depth content analysis and text analysis, we find that individuals think of voter fraud as consisting of a wide array of actions being undertaken by a diverse set of actors. We also find substantial differences in the ways that Democrats and Republicans think about this issue. Our study provides important contributions to a growing literature on election administration and public opinion toward voter fraud.

AB  - Traditional service-learning pedagogy assumes that learning occurs when contact between relatively advantaged students and a relatively disadvantaged service population reduces prejudice. However, little is known about how students whose backgrounds are similar to the populations they serve process this learning experience. This study explores the connections between socioeconomic status and learning trajectories within service-learning. Students provided written reflections on a service-learning experience focused on food insecurity as part of course requirements. Analysis reveals that students with low socioeconomic status (SES) demonstrate different learning processes than medium- and high-SES students. Namely, low-SES students were less likely than high-SES students to hold prejudiced attitudes prior to service, and low-SES students emphasized a systemic understanding of food insecurity and poverty, while medium- and high-SES students were much more likely to emphasize an individualist understanding. We discuss the implications of these findings for future research to improve service-learning pedagogy for students of diverse socioeconomic backgrounds.

AB  - Background: Anecdotal reports suggest a rise in anti-Asian racial attitudes and discrimination in response to COVID-19. Racism can have significant social, economic, and health impacts, but there has been little systematic investigation of increases in anti-Asian prejudice. Methods: We utilized Twitter's Streaming Application Programming Interface (API) to collect 3,377,295 U.S. race-related tweets from November 2019-June 2020. Sentiment analysis was performed using support vector machine (SVM), a supervised machine learning model. Accuracy for identifying negative sentiments, comparing the machine learning model to manually labeled tweets was 91%. We investigated changes in racial sentiment before and following the emergence of COVID-19. Results: The proportion of negative tweets referencing Asians increased by 68.4% (from 9.79% in November to 16.49% in March). In contrast, the proportion of negative tweets referencing other racial/ethnic minorities (Blacks and Latinx) remained relatively stable during this time period, declining less than 1% for tweets referencing Blacks and increasing by 2% for tweets referencing Latinx. Common themes that emerged during the content analysis of a random subsample of 3300 tweets included: racism and blame (20%), anti-racism (20%), and daily life impact (27%). Conclusion: Social media data can be used to provide timely information to investigate shifts in area-level racial sentiment.

AB  - Perceptual bias occurs when beliefs deviate from reality. Democrats and Republicans are thought to be especially susceptible to this type of biased-information processing. And yet we know little about the pervasiveness of perceptual bias outside the domain of "performance issues" (e. g., unemployment, inflation) or how individual-level partisan motivation interacts with the information environment. We investigate these issues in two studies that examine perceptual bias on a wide range of political topics spanning two decades. Using survey data as well as an experiment with diverse subjects, we demonstrate that people perceive the world in a manner consistent with their political views. The result is a selective pattern of learning in which partisans have higher levels of knowledge for facts that confirm their world view and lower levels of knowledge for facts that challenge them. This basic relationship is exaggerated on topics receiving high levels of media coverage.

AB  - Online posts have gradually become a major carrier of network public opinion in social media, and the social network hotspots are the important basis for the study of network public opinion. Therefore, it is significant to extract hotspots for monitoring Internet public opinion from online posts textual big data. However, the current hotspot extraction methods are focused on the users' features that are based on textual big data with spam and low-quality content. Meanwhile, these methods seldomly consider the time span of posts and the popularity of users. Accordingly, this article presents a hotspots information extraction hybrid solution of online posts' textual data. Firstly, a filtering strategy to obtain more high-quality textual data is designed. Secondly, the topic hot degree is presented by considering the average number of replies and the popularity of the participant. Thirdly, an improved co-word analysis technology is used to search the same topic posts and Bisecting k-means clustering algorithm using repliers' popularity and key posts are designed for studying and monitoring the hotspots of online posts in a valid big data environment. Finally, the proposed algorithms are verified in experiments by extracting the hotspots of online posts from the dataset. The results show that the data filtering strategy can help to obtain more valuable information and decrease the computing time. The results also demonstrate that the proposed solution can help to obtain hotspots comparing the traditional methods, and the hot degree can reflect the trend of the online post by comparing the traditional methods.

AB  - Voters tend to be richer, more conservative, and more educated than non-voters. While many electoral reforms promise to increase political participation, these policy instruments may have multidimensional and differential effects that can increase or decrease the representativeness of turnout. We develop an approach that allows us to estimate these effects and assess the impact of postal voting on representational inequality in Swiss referendums using individual-level (N = 79, 000) and aggregate-level data from 1981 to 2009. We find that postal voting mobilizes equally across a wide range of political and sociodemographic groups but more strongly activates high earners, those with medium education levels, and less politically interested individuals. Yet, those who vote are not less politically knowledgeable and the effects on the composition of turnout remain limited. Our results inform research on the consequences of electoral reforms meant to increase political participation in large electorates.

AB  - Objective: Risk assessment and response is important for understanding human behavior. The divisive context surrounding the coronavirus pandemic inspires our exploration of risk perceptions and the polarization of mitigation practices (i.e., the degree to which the behaviors of people on the political "Left" diverge from those on the "Right"). Specifically, we investigate the extent to which the political polarization of willingness to comply with mitigation behaviors changes with risk perceptions. Method: Analyses use data from two sources: an original dataset of Twitter posts and a nationally-representative survey. In the Twitter data, negative binomial regression models are used to predict mitigation intent measured using tweet counts. In the survey data, logit models predict self-reported mitigation behavior (vaccination, masking, and social distancing). Results: Findings converged across both datasets, supporting the idea that the links between political orientation and willingness to follow mitigation guidelines depend on perceived risk. People on the Left are more inclined than their Right-oriented colleagues to follow guidelines, but this polarization tends to decrease as the perceived risk of COVID-19 intensifies. Additionally, we find evidence that exposure to COVID-19 infections sends ambiguous signals about the risk of the virus while COVID-19 related deaths have a more consistent impact on mitigation behaviors. Conclusions: Pandemic-related risks can create opportunities for perceived "common ground," between the political "Right" and "Left." Risk perceptions and politics interact in their links to intended COVID-19 mitigation behavior (as measured both on Twitter and in a national survey). Our results invite a more complex interpretation of political polarization than those stemming from simplistic analyses of partisanship and ideology.

AB  - This study compares two frequently used operationalizations of understanding: factual knowledge and perceived familiarity. The authors argue that these measurements-which have been used interchangeably in past research-are conceptually distinct and should be treated as such. Using hierarchical linear ordinary least squares regression, this study provides evidence that factual knowledge and perceived familiarity are only slightly correlated and are influenced differently by predicting variables, such as media use and cognitive processing variables. As a result, the use of these measures may result in different assessments of the levels of public understanding, which has important implications for future policy decisions.

AB  - Although the coexistence of conflicting opinions in society is the very core of democracy, people's tendency to avoid conflict could keep them away from political discussion and participation. On the other hand, being exposed to diverse political views could motivate citizens to participate. We conducted secondary analyses on two 2013 ITANES (Italian National Election Studies) probability samples in order to test the hypotheses that perceived network disagreement (between an individual and her/his discussion partners) and heterogeneity (among discussants holding different political opinions) exert independent and opposite effects on political participation through motivation and knowledge. Results converged in showing that disagreement dampened, while heterogeneity encouraged, political participation (voting, propensity to abstain in future, offline and online activism, and timing of vote decision) by decreasing or increasing, respectively, political interest and, in turn, knowledge.

AB  - A community of agents is subject to a stream of messages, which are represented as points on a plane of issues. Messages are sent by media and by agents themselves. Messages from media shape the public opinion. They are unbiased, i.e. positive and negative opinions on a given issue appear with equal frequencies. In our previous work, the only criterion to receive a message by an agent is if the distance between this message and the ones received earlier does not exceed the given value of the tolerance parameter. Here we introduce a possibility to address a message to a given neighbour. We show that this option reduces the unanimity effect, what improves the collective performance.

AB  - Since World War II, government-sponsored international propaganda and public diplomacy have become more visible and sophisticated in countries around the world. China is no exception. It is not immune to the compulsion and communication imperative to reach and woo the public, both at home and abroad, for its vested interests. From propaganda to public diplomacy, the practices and activities have taken different forms and scopes, mainly including government-owned media outlets aimed at foreign audiences, state-subsidized media organizations as quasi-governmental instruments, overseas advertising and public relations campaigns designed to sway public opinion to win general support for the nation involved or to repair international relations damaged by terrorist attacks and other man-made crises, and recruiting and bribing journalists as clandestine operatives. Whether such practices have been effective in changing hearts and minds among international audiences, however, is open to debate and remains to be further explored. Within the perspective of sociology of knowledge, the main purpose of this study is to look at how China comes to be viewed as an object in international communication research over the past decades that cast the country through the prism of either propaganda or public diplomacy.

AB  - Adolfo Martin-Gamero, director of the Office of Diplomatic Information, managed the interviews that Franco gave to international media journalists between 1958 and 1968. Based on previously unpublished documentation filed at the Real Academia de la Historia, this study analyses the context and the contents of those journalistic meetings, which were part of the propaganda strategy of the dictatorship, and in which the diplomat was involved as an interpreter. The conclusions emphasize the importance given by Francoism to the US media (especially The New York Times) due to the influence of their international ally over the public opinion, and Le Figaro, which helped establishing closer trade relations with France and so facilitating the Spanish accession to the Common Market.

AB  - Presently, many states in the Middle East are experiencing instability and mass displacement due to political violence. In the wake of these upheavals, and particularly post 9/11, a spotlight has fallen on art from the region, and more specifically on art with violence and political conflict as theme. This article investigates the ways in which three artists in diaspora from the Middle East, namely Wafaa Bilal, Tammam Azzam, and Reza Aramesh, portray violence in their art, reflecting on the meaning of violence and opening up possibilities for reconsidering the representation of violence from this region. The conceptual sleight of hand in the work of the artists chosen for this thematic and contextual analysis offers insight into the experience and depiction of violence in their respective countries of origin in order to, arguably, dispel the often distorted and simplistic perception of the region and its troubles. This investigation includes a discussion of reductive depictions of violence in the Middle East by Western media, focusing on the historical, political, socioeconomic, and emotional factors that lead to such representations. Against the backdrop of the global proliferation of Islamophobic and xenophobic social relations, anti- immigration politics, and ongoing conflict, the work of the artists selected for discussion in this article foregrounds the emancipatory potential of art to challenge perceptions, negotiate identities, encourage collective memory, and reconcile trauma.

AB  - Social media offers scholars new and innovative ways of understanding public opinion, including citizens' prospective votes in elections and referenda. We classify social media users' preferences over the two U.S. presidential candidates in the 2016 election using Twitter data and explore the topics of conversation among proClinton and proTrump supporters. We take advantage of hashtags that signaled users' vote preferences to train our machine learning model which employs a novel classifier-a Topic-Based Naive Bayes model-that we demonstrate improves on existing classifiers. Our findings demonstrate that we are able to classify users with a high degree of accuracy and precision. We further explore the similarities and divergences among what proClinton and proTrump users discussed on Twitter.

AB  - Public opinion is a valuable source for evaluating the performance of transportation services, which can guide management and policy adjustment. In contrast to traditional surveying methods, which are often inefficient and high-cost, social media has become a popular channel to collect public opinion due to its large data volume and accessibility characteristics. However, existing research lack efficient methods to extract and interpret Twitter data for transportation services evaluation. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive framework that enables high-efficient extraction and analysis of public opinions on transportation services from Twitter. The transportation system of Miami-Dade County is chosen as the case study to describe the framework development and validation process. First, Twitter data in a defined area over a certain period are collected and preprocessed to clean erroneous and redundant information. Then, the Twitter data that relate to personal opinions on transportation services (POTS) are filtered hieratically using text classification models trained by manually labeled dataset. Next, timeline analysis using Post Intensity (PI) and Average Sentiment Value (ASV) is implemented on the selected Twitter data to explore the public perceptions towards the transportation-related events. Topic modeling and tokenization techniques are also adopted to extract relevant semantic content needed for data analysis. Significantly, the developed framework can improve the efficiency of Twitter data extraction and analysis. Many manual steps are involved in the development process of the framework while can be avoided when generalized to other applications. The framework can be used as a tool for stakeholders to enable a holistic understanding of public opinions on transportation services and increase the degree of public participation in transportation management.

AB  - Medium-sized wealthy states - middle powers - and global civil society networks are increasingly joining forces to influence the global policy agenda on issues of international law, justice, humanitarianism and development. These middle power-NGO coalitions use the comparative advantages of both state and nonstate actors in synergistic partnerships. States represent the coalitions' interests in international negotiations and conferences, provide donor funding and offer diplomatic support. For their part, NGOs gather on-the-ground research, provide technical expertise, lobby governments, mobilise public opinion and generate media publicity. This article uses the case of the campaign to ban cluster munitions, culminating in the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions, to examine the organisation, efforts and impact of such middle power-NGO coalitions.

AB  - Several prominent theories predict that argument strength plays an important role in message processing and effects. Traditional strategies to measure perceived argument strength have limitations in responsivity to emerging arguments in public discourse. This article examines the utility of a survey-embedded wiki platform (wiki survey) to identify strong and weak arguments in dynamic information environments. Participants completed two wiki surveys, embedded within a larger survey of U. S. adults (N = 1,506), asking them to choose between randomly selected pairs of arguments related to marijuana legalization or to add new arguments to the item pools. The method identified 32 novel, user-generated arguments, over and above an original set of 26 arguments identified by study authors through a review of the literature and a content analysis of news media coverage on the topic. The wiki survey also produced variation in perceived strength of arguments among relevant demographic and social groups.

AB  - Following the refugee crisis, European countries have tried to stimulate the integration of migrants into local society. However, the public, influenced by negative framing of migrants by media and political actors, may feel that not all migrants are equally deserving of settlement. In this study, we obtain greater insight into the public's attitudes towards migrants by applying the deservingness framework to migrant settlement in four European countries: Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Sweden, using the CARIN typology (control, attitude, reciprocity, identity, need). We use data from the European Social Survey Round 1 (2002) and Round 7 (2014), and online survey data from 2017. We can draw four main conclusions: 1) (at least) three out of five CARIN-criteria (attitude, reciprocity, and identity) apply to settlement deservingness, 2) the identity criterion is considered the 'least' important criterion, while attitude is considered most important, but 3) identity has become increasingly important over time, and 4) there is significant variation in deservingness preferences between countries and over time. Findings indicate that older respondents, men, and Christians are more restrictive towards accepting migrants than younger respondents, women, and Muslims. The role of education is twofold: lower educated individuals value identity more, highly educated individuals value attitude and (future) reciprocity.

AB  - The present study aims to understand the public opinion on the Chinese Public Weather Service and evaluate its benefits. Statistics based on a nationwide survey conducted in China in 2006 show that the receipt and perception of weather information vary across different ages and groups. People obtain weather information from various sources (television ranks first); younger generations favour new media. There is a high demand for information services related to severe weather and short-range weather, which have the largest impact on daily lives and professional needs. The respondents' satisfaction with the current weather service and forecast accuracy are very high, although the accuracy of weather forecasts requires improvements. The benefits of the Chinese Public Weather Service and cost-benefit ratios are evaluated via direct, indirect and reverse willingness-to-pay evaluation models. For the entire country, the benefit of the Chinese Public Weather Service is estimated to be at least 46.482 billion Chinese Yuan (CNY), which accounted for 0.22% of the Chinese gross domestic product (GDP) in 2006; the national cost-benefit ratio is 1:26. The regional cost-benefit ratios of the Chinese Public Weather Service exhibit a wide range from 1:2 to 1:81 over different provincial-level regions. The cost-benefit ratios are much higher in economically developed areas (Central and East China) than in economically underdeveloped areas (Northwest China). The social development level, especially certain aspects of primary industry and transportation, is closely related to the cost-benefit ratio of the Chinese Public Weather Service. These findings can assist the China Meteorological Administration and its supervised meteorological bureaus in providing a weather service that meets the public needs effectively.

AB  - When cities host mega-events, such as the Olympic Games, these events change the context in which conventionally local political decisions are considered and made. This article follows Islamic movement Tablighi Jamaat's proposed plans to build the large Abbey Mills Mosque in Newham, East London, and the controversy that followed. The analysis builds from media accounts, interviews with a leading mosque opponent, and ethnographic observation from religious gatherings at the Abbey Mills site. Taking a scalar politics approach, we investigate how the 'mega' scale of the mosque was framed and debated in media and opposition campaign accounts, and how Tablighi Jamaat belatedly responded with counterframes of its own. The 'Olympics mega-mosque' controversy would grow to encompass an increasingly broad public sphere and larger anxieties about national identity, government competence, and the integration of Muslims in Britain. We conclude with implications of the case for studying contentious politics, Islamophobia, and contemporary governance.

AB  - Today, there is no doubt that the media has cast its deep imprints upon human life. Media touches every aspect of life in shaping the views of people. Still, the media should be responsible for their coverage, and their accountability is intensified where ethnicity, race, and religion are concerned. The French magazine Charlie Hebdo issued offensive caricatures of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Pease Be Upon Him), replicated under the pretext of freedom of speech. The debate on freedom of expression, self-censorship, and democratic values has been broad and lively in the aftermath of Charlie Hebdo's reprinting of offensive caricatures. The iconoclastic French publication attempted a loud and defiant declaration in defense of free speech and expression. Some others have said that Charlie Hebdo is needlessly reopening old wounds through its aggressive actions. In this study, the researcher examines an article and blogs of Anadolu Agency related to the issue. The finding shows that the reprinting of caricatures by Charlie Hebdo participates in the racial promotion. And offensive campaigns have hurt the feelings of more than 1.5 billion Muslims across the globe. Freedom of speech is of "great significance" and must be included in a "constructive manner" following the principle for peaceful coexistence and comprehension between religions.

AB  - Environmental communication researchers have focused on the role of media frames in the formation of public opinion. Yet, little is known about how citizens incorporate such frames into everyday conversations. We address this issue by examining the stream of Twitter conversations about climate change over two years. We demonstrate that hoax frames that question the reality of climate change prevail in the US, particularly in "red states" compared to the UK, Canada, and Australia or "blue states" in the US. We also investigate the use of terms, "global warming" and "climate change." We find that red states prefer "global warming" to "climate change" compared to blue states and "global warming" is particularly associated with hoax frames. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigates the significance of Xu Baohuang's 1919 textbook Xin wen xue on the articulation of an objectivity norm in the early Republican era in China. It addresses issues raised by cross-cultural or comparative analysis of journalistic norms. It also considers the need to maintain awareness of differences in the political and journalistic field in Republican-era China. Following Michael Schudson's essay, "The Objectivity Norm in American Journalism", our analysis focuses on the articulation of the objectivity norm and looks for unique aspects of norm formation arising out of the Chinese context. As such, we see Xu's role as more than importing an American norm into China. Rather he codifies and legitimizes a norm that has a distinct relationship to local issues and media practice. We argue that while Xu's text articulates what can only be considered a nascent ideal, and not a fully matured objectivity norm, his work nevertheless codifies a new sense of news, and also a journalistic commitment to the cultivation of healthy public opinion.

TI  - Strategic Othering: Framing Lebanese Migration and Fraser's "Mistake"
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND HISTORY
LA  - English
AB  - Australian Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Peter Dutton, has framed the mid-1970s immigration of Lebanese affected by civil war as Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser's "mistake". His remarks sparked controversy in the parliament and the media. The issue became a contest of frames between the Murdoch media, which supported the Minister's "mistake" frame and argued his right to "tell the truth", and the Fairfax media, which viewed the Minister as being "racist" for "scapegoating" the Lebanese community. Along with archival documents, this article examines the context and coverage of the Minister's remarks, noting that the frames presented in the media "indexed" those adopted amongst political elites, while failing to re-examine the historical record. This case study demonstrates the power of framing and the media's tendency to accept rather than challenge frames used by those in the political contest, with the result that errors in the representation of history were never corrected. This article draws on framing theory and indexing theory and concludes that the "mistake" frame for the Lebanese feeds into narratives that serve to "other" Muslim and Arab groups, fanning fears and mobilising a discourse of Islamophobia around the exclusion of "undesirable" immigrants on the basis of "cultural fit".

This work fills this gap, and illustrates the potential of using a simple outbreak model in conjunction with the historical data about the cumulative forwarding users for nearcasting the propagation trend.

The aim is to discuss how journalists perceive the loss of control when technologies and users interact with the debate agenda online. Actor-network theory is used to explore the interaction amongst editorial staff, new technologies, professional norms and the participation of audiences. The findings reveal that digital technology becomes a powerful actor in the network of public media, as it directly affects the forms of journalistic presentation and public debates. In addition, new technologies contribute to the empowerment of audiences, who gain better access to both the newsroom and the wider public.

AB  - This article critically examines responses to the 2017 Quebec City Mosque massacre as expressed in a letter written to the public by the killer's parents in January 2018, and various forms of media coverage related to the letter. While the letter attempts to communicate the parents' grief and to express solidarity with Muslims affected by the attack, this article argues that Islamophobic logic is evident throughout, maintained precisely through the emotionality of the letter and media responses, and through the apparently well-intentioned gestures of empathy and solidarity they represent. This analysis draws on theoretical literature that contextualizes the roles of emotion and civility in constructing and reinforcing racialized boundaries, and in shaping the lived experiences of Muslims in Quebec and Canada. By further considering statements and responses from the Quebec Muslim community, this analysis also briefly discusses the ways in which the emotionality displayed by the victims' families and community seeks to refocus the conversation back onto the ongoing problem of anti-Muslim racism in Quebec and Canada, calling for a deeper accountability around this pervasive issue.

AB  - Migration was one of the most important issues in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. While Hillary Clinton promised an immigration reform that would create a path to citizenship, Donald Trump said he would deport illegal aliens, build a wall between the United States and Mexico, and suspend immigration from countries with a history of terrorism, capitalizing on some of the public's fears through his rhetoric. We examine the ways mainstream national and regional press covered this issue from the Republican National Convention through Election Day. This content analysis of 12 news outlets finds that political themes drove the coverage more than anything else, with Donald Trump or a member of his team most often serving as theme sponsor. Though about half of the stories were neutral or balanced in tone, negative stories were sponsored either by the Trump team or other actors.

AB  - Women tend to be portrayed in a sexualized or domestic manner in mainstream advertising; importantly this trend holds not only for ads targeting men but also for those targeting women themselves. Such a focus on sexualized portrayals in particular may not seem strategic given a wealth of evidence suggesting that women evaluate these portrayals quite negatively. Consumer attitudes toward domestic portrayals are more mixed but, unsurprisingly, vary according to how much a woman identifies as traditional. If female consumers do not evaluate these common portrayals positively, why might they persist? Past work suggests a disconnect between reported attitudes toward general visual sexual stimuli and physiological and neural responses; therefore, it is plausible that neural responses to stereotypical female portrayals in advertising may be at odds with reported attitudes and may have a bigger impact on consumer behavior. The current study exposed women to sexualized, domestic, and control images in a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner as an initial test of this idea. We found that participants reported liking both domestic and control images more than sexualized images. In contrast, they showed more activity in regions associated with reward and arousal (ventral striatum and amygdala, respectively) while viewing sexualized images relative to both control and domestic images. Surprisingly, ventral striatum response to sexualized ads was stronger for women who endorsed traditional attitudes than those who reported less traditional attitudes.

AB  - This article argues that the mainstream public sphere needs to provide a more accurate portrayal of public opinion on race and immigration. British newspapers are often accused of racism: that they might be representing the views of many of their readers is dismissed. The free circulation of ideas, however unpalatable some might be to 'enlightened' thought, is essential. The press can play a key role in a more inclusive public debate by allowing readers' views greater prominence and by opening their news and comment pages to a wider range of opinion. Concerns that readers will be seduced by extremism say more about elite perceptions of the malleability of the masses than about concern for democratic debate.

AB  - While in vitro animal meat (IVM) is not yet commercially available, the public has already begun to form opinions of IVM as a result of news stories and events drawing attention to its development. As such, we can discern public perceptions of the ethics of IVM before its commercial release. This affords advocates of environmentally sustainable, healthy, and just diets with a unique opportunity to reflect on the social desirability of the development of IVM. This work draws upon an analysis of ethical perceptions of IVM in 814 US news blog comments related to the August 2013 tasting of the world's first IVM hamburger. Specifically, I address three primary questions: (1) How does the public perceive the ethics of IVM development? (2) How acceptable is IVM to the public relative to alternative approaches to reducing animal meat consumption? and (3) What should all of this mean for the ongoing development and promotion of IVM? Ultimately, it is argued that there is a strong need for facilitation of public dialogue around IVM, as well as further research comparing the acceptability of IVM to other alternatives.

AB  - Policies to reduce meat consumption are needed to help achieve climate change targets, and could also improve population health. Public acceptability can affect the likelihood of policy implementation. This study estimated the acceptability of policies to reduce red and processed meat consumption, and whether acceptability differed when policies were framed as benefitting health or the environment. In an online experiment, 2215 UK adults rated the acceptability of six policies, presented in a randomised order. Prior to rating policies, participants were randomised to one of two framing conditions, with policy outcomes described either as benefitting health or the environment. Regression models examined differences in the primary outcome - policy acceptability (rated on a 7-point scale) - by framing. Labels were the most accepted policy (48% support), followed by a media campaign (45%), reduced availability (40%) and providing incentives (38%). Increasing price (27%) and banning advertising (26%) were the least accepted. A substantial proportion of participants neither supported nor opposed most policies (26-33%), although this fell to 16% for increasing price. There was no evidence that framing policy benefits from a health or environment perspective influenced acceptability (-0.06, 95%CIs: 0.18,0.07). Fewer than half of the UK sample expressed support for any of six policies to reduce meat consumption, regardless of framing measures as benefitting health or the environment. Conversely, fewer than half expressed opposition, with the exception of price, suggesting considerable scope to influence public opinion in support of meat reduction measures to meet environmental and health goals.

AB  - Benjamin Percy's novel Red Moon (2013) navigates the problem of the 'monster' in the context of post-9/11 representations of Islamist terrorism. Structured around a series of terrorist atrocities carried out by lycan extremists, Percy's novel employs the werewolf as a figure of monstrous otherness in order to deconstruct the very processes of othering by which the monster is produced culturally and politically. Focusing on the distorted ethical justifications of the terrorists and on the roles of political opportunism and media manipulation in shaping US responses, the narrative allows both lycan terrorists and their political antagonists to emerge as more clown than monster. This article draws upon Hannah Arendt's account of the banality of evil, and its development by more recent privation theorists, to situate Red Moon within contemporary popular and theoretical discourses of evil and to read the novel as an interrogation of the processes by which our modern political 'monsters' are created.

AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak has fueled tension between the U.S. and China. Existing literature in international relations rarely focuses on virus outbreaks as factors affecting international relations between superpower countries, nor does research examine an outbreak's potential influence on the public's opinion about their country's foreign policy. To bridge this research gap, this study explores the extent to which the American public may be prone to favor policies that "punish" China via existing U.S.-China disputes, such as the South China Sea dispute and the U.S.-China trade war. I conducted an online survey using Amazon's Mechanical Turk and ran multinomial and ordered logit models to estimate the association between an individual's preferred policies and the country or government an individual blame for the impact of the pandemic. After controlling several essential confounding factors, such as one's levels of nationalism and hawkishness, I found strong evidence that there is a positive association between people's attribution of blame to the Chinese government and the likelihood of supporting aggressive policy options in the two disputes with China. That is to say, U.S. citizens who believe that the Chinese government is solely culpable for the outbreak in the U.S., compared to those who think otherwise, are more likely to support hawkish policy options, such as confrontational military actions, economic sanctions, or higher tariff rates. The research provides a glimpse into where Americans may stand in these disputes with China and the potential development of U.S.-China relations in the post-pandemic era.

AB  - Background: Mental illness (MI), and particularly, bipolar disorder (BD), are highly stigmatized. However, it is unknown if this stigma is also represented on social media. Aims: Characterize Twitter-based stigma and social support messaging ("tweets") about mental health/illness (MH)/MI and BD and determine which tweets garnered retweets. Methods: We collected tweets about MH/MI and BD during a three-month period and analyzed tweets from dates with the most tweets ("spikes"), an indicator of topic interest. A sample was manually content analyzed, and the remainder were classified using machine learning (logistic regression) by topic, stigma, and social support messaging. We compared stigma and support toward MH/MI versus BD and used logistic regression to quantify tweet features associated with retweets, to assess tweet reach. Results: Of the 1,270,902 tweets analyzed, 94.7% discussed MH/MI and 5.3% discussed BD. Spikes coincided with a celebrity's death and a MH awareness campaign. Although the sample contained more support than stigma messaging, BD tweets contained more stigma and less support than MH/MI tweets. However, stigma messaging was infrequently retweeted, and users often retweeted personal MH experiences. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate opportunities for social media advocacy to reduce stigma and increase displays of social support towards people living with BD.

AB  - Understanding the drivers of party issue emphasis and the specific role of public opinion is important to shed light on the mechanisms of contemporary party competition and to assess the quality of representation in liberal democracies. Previous research has produced conflicting results between issue ownership and issue dialogue perspectives and has ignored the role of time in party communication strategy. We present a theory focused on the economy in which proximity to election day increases the incumbent's cost of not responding to opponent attacks and subsequently decreases the incumbent's attention to public opinion. We validate the main empirical implications of the model via content analysis of party discourse in Spanish parliamentary speeches (1996-2011) and time series analyses. Our results have pessimistic implications for an ideal conception of bottom-up representation. As electoral accountability pressures increase over the electoral cycle, endogenous party competition overshadows public opinion as a driver of representatives' agenda.

AB  - The rally-around-the-flag effect describes the tendency of public opinion to become more favourable toward political leaders in times of crises. Political leaders rarely can exchange this initial rally-around-effect into long-term support, however. The central question addressed in this paper is, why political leaders cannot maintain this increase in support over time. Based on three-wave panel data collected during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden (N = 1716), this paper investigates why political leaders cannot maintain initial popular support in the long run. Empirically, we find that perceptions of how Sweden is affected by the crisis and political ideology are both important drivers to understand the declining government approval following a rally-around-the-flag effect.

AB  - Contrary to the optimistic view that the Internet would promote democracy in authoritarian countries like China, the pervasive political apathy among younger generations calls for a closer examination of micro-level individual political participation. This study contributes to the nascent body of empirical literature probing Chinese Internet users' political participation online by examining related behavioral and attitudinal factors. We argue that Chinese netizens' online participatory behaviors are determined by their political attitudes, trust in the media, and, chiefly, trust in the social system. Importantly, the current political and social environment in China seems to truncate any liberalizing potential of the Internet, as evidenced by the limited online political discussion and strong presence of government regulation. This dynamic implies that any utopian predictions concerning political participation online need to be reformulated in light of these external contextual factors.

AB  - Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) is a growing problem that arouses interest from scientists, media and recipients. Therefore, finding a universal way to calculate the scale of the phenomenon can not only become a common tool for estimating the extent of FOMO occurrence in any country, but also can be considered for managing this phenomenon. The article presents the results of measuring the FOMO scale in Poland in 2018. The project applied a Computer Assisted Web Interview survey of the representative sample (N=1060) of Poland's internet users aged 15 years plus. Three groups of 'FOMO level' characteristics were determined (age was the most influential variable). The original method of recalculation of the FOMO scale results from figures to percentage data was developed in order to present the FOMO scale index. The FOMO items showed good internal consistency and reliability Cronbach's alpha = .89, thus complementing previous international studies.

AB  - Policies to reduce meat consumption are needed to help achieve climate change targets, and could also improve population health. Public acceptability can affect the likelihood of policy implementation. This study estimated the acceptability of policies to reduce red and processed meat consumption, and whether acceptability differed when policies were framed as benefitting health or the environment. In an online experiment, 2215 UK adults rated the acceptability of six policies, presented in a randomised order. Prior to rating policies, participants were randomised to one of two framing conditions, with policy outcomes described either as benefitting health or the environment. Regression models examined differences in the primary outcome - policy acceptability (rated on a 7-point scale) - by framing. Labels were the most accepted policy (48% support), followed by a media campaign (45%), reduced availability (40%) and providing incentives (38%). Increasing price (27%) and banning advertising (26%) were the least accepted. A substantial proportion of participants neither supported nor opposed most policies (26-33%), although this fell to 16% for increasing price. There was no evidence that framing policy benefits from a health or environment perspective influenced acceptability ( 0.06, 95%CIs: 0.18,0.07). Fewer than half of the UK sample expressed support for any of six policies to reduce meat consumption, regardless of framing measures as benefitting health or the environment. Conversely, fewer than half expressed opposition, with the exception of price, suggesting considerable scope to influence public opinion in support of meat reduction measures to meet environmental and health goals.

AB  - This article focuses on the ITV series Lost in Austen (Mammoth Screen Production, 2008). This series is an adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, which is as self-consciously about adaptation as it is about Jane Austen. For example, at one point in the series, the contemporary character Amanda Price requests Darcy to enact a scene not from the novel Pride and Prejudice but from the BBC's adaptation of it. Thus, this adaptation offers a reading of its own processes of adaptation as it enacts them. The untold story of the film's central plot device-contemporary Amanda Price swapping places with Elizabeth Bennet-is, of course, that of Elizabeth's experiences in contemporary London. This story remains hidden below the surface of the television series but is just visible enough to trouble Amanda's assumptions that any woman would prefer to live in Austen's world rather than contemporary England. I ask whether this adaptation of Austen plays out a post-feminist nostalgia for pre-feminism or offers a critique of our current post-feminist moment by juxtaposing it with a pre-feminist (or, indeed, an emergent feminist) historical period. Through a close reading of this series, my article will attempt to explore the contradictory politics of what it is that the contemporary female viewer finds by getting 'lost in Austen' and interrogates the feminist politics of nostalgia.

AB  - This study contributes to recent discussions about the role of satire in public communication. We conducted qualitative expert interviews with 13 satirists in Germany to explore their understanding of satire, their motivations and role orientations as well as their perceptions of satire in relation to journalism and the factors they perceive to influence their role performances. The findings indicate that satirists perceive their business to be multifaceted and diverse and do not strictly distinguish between political satire and apolitical comedy. They identify with the accommodative role of the entertainer and roles connected to the development of public opinion while being reluctant to adopt interventionist roles. Even though professionalization in satire involves acquiring journalistic skills, the interviewees consider themselves to complement rather than substitute journalistic reporting. The findings also indicate strong politicization in satire that results from satirists standing up for their political beliefs. Finally, politicization and normativity in satire are influenced by media organizations and the perception of the political climate. By focusing on the producers of satire, the study extends previous research dominated by studies on satirical content and its effects.

AB  - Climate change presents serious risks to human communities around the world. To ensure rapid, widespread and equitable adaptation to these risks, government policy must be enacted to support community-wide adaptation. Public support for adaptation policy will be key to its passage. To date, few studies have focused on what factors motivate public support for adaptation policy, especially at the subnational level. To address these gaps, we develop a conceptual model that draws on and synthesizes past conceptual frameworks and literature related to environmental behavior and adaptation specifically. Using structural equation modeling with latent variables, we examine this model, drawing on data from a statewide survey of over 2700 individuals from the state of Indiana in the Midwestern United States. We assess the drivers of two distinct measures of policy support: support for climate adaptation policy and support for climate adaptation taxes. We find that threat appraisal, climate risk perception, perceived efficacy of government, respondent's climate change beliefs, perceived descriptive and dynamic norms around policy support, and social structural characteristics such as political affiliation are important drivers of support for adaptation policy, but that their effects differ across our two outcome measures. These findings point to opportunities to better engage the public in policy discourse, while also suggesting that distinct motivations shape support for policy compared to the taxes likely needed to support these new programs.

AB  - Negative public attitudes towards cancer may contribute to delays in presentation and present barriers to providing quality care. This study explored the views of cancer experts regarding the content of public health messages to improve public attitudes to cancer.
   Twenty-one healthcare professionals (HCPs) from a range of backgrounds took part took part in interviews. Interview transcripts were evaluated using thematic analysis focusing on the HCPs views of the prevailing negative stereotype of cancer patients and their recommendations for cancer awareness campaigns that could redress this view.
   HCPs contrasted the progress that had been made in the effective management of cancer with popular stereotypes and media representations. Information quality and supply were identified as barriers to changing the cancer stereotype held by the public.
   HCPs believe there is a need for more information about cancer in the public domain and it should focus on providing more balanced messages that include information about the improvements that have been achieved in preventing and treating cancer.

AB  - Over the last century, changing public attitudes about the value of wildlife have triggered substantial changes in species management that have both benefited and hindered conservation efforts. Understanding and integrating contemporary public values is therefore critical for effective conservation outcomes. Using historic and contemporary examples, we highlight how public attitudes-expressed through the media and campaigns-are shaping the management of introduced and native species, as values shift towards animal welfare and mutualism. We focus on the issue of deliberate human-caused killing of wildlife, because protests against such management have disrupted traditional political and management structures that favoured eradication of wildlife across many jurisdictions and ecological contexts. In doing so, we show that it is essential to work with multiple stakeholder interest groups to ensure that wildlife management is informed by science, while also supported by public values. Achieving this hinges on appropriate science communication to build a better-informed public because management decisions are becoming increasingly democratised.

AB  - Much of the protest literature has examined the policy consequences of social protests. Few studies focus on the effect of social protests on public opinion. We examine the impact of the 2006 immigration protests on the saliency of immigration among Latinos. The 2006 Latino National Survey was in the field before and after the protests began, creating a natural experiment. Using these data, we discover protests increased Latinos' perception of undocumented immigration as the most important problem facing Latinos. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the effect of protest was not uniform across the population but rather contingent on individuals' characteristics.

T2  - JOURNAL OF POLITICS
LA  - English
KW  - PUBLIC-OPINION
AB  - Interest group spending on issue advertising is growing dramatically, but we know very little about its deployment and purpose in legislative advocacy. This article begins to fill the gap, examining where, when, and why interest groups run television issue advertisements. We start from the premise that issue advertising is a form of outside lobbying, but we argue that it can serve two legislative ends. We hypothesize, first, that group strategists will target areas represented by committee allies they want to mobilize more than pivotal members they want to convert. When a roll call is approaching and the vote is likely to be close, however, groups will expand their advertising targets to include floor voters near the chamber pivot. Our statistical tests use data on television issue ads concerning the 2003 Medicare prescription drug bill. The analysis provides consistent support for the first hypothesis and mixed support for the second.

AB  - This study investigates the (de)mobilizing influences of political (dis)agreement in the news and in political discussion on political attitudes and participation in new information environments. Results demonstrate the mediating functions of political ambivalence in that exposure to proattitudinal news reduces ambivalence and thereby promotes political participation, whereas exposure to counter-attitudinal news increases ambivalence and thereby discourages participation. Importantly, the effect of exposure to counter attitudinal news on ambivalence was moderated by heterogeneous discussion networks on social network sites, such that the combination of exposure to counter-attitudinal news and to heterogeneous discussion networks amplifies ambivalence additively, and thereby augments the tendency toward demobilization. These results are interpreted as suggesting that changing media contexts may lead to complex roles of news and political discussion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article discusses the dynamism of Vietnam's social media landscape by identing three kinds of blogging and the different political views espoused by Vietnamese bloggers. This classification is based on a thematic analysis of blog postings, media discussions and semi-structured interviews conducted in 2013-15. The author's mapping of Vietnam's blogosphere demonstrates four features: first, the growth of political blogs; second, how the blogosphere has become an arena for competing political ideologies; third, the utilization of blogs by various factions within the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPT) to serve their own interests; and fourth, blogs as an important source of independent news and information. Understanding political blogs in Vietnam today helps us understand how Vietnamese bloggers maximize online freedom of speech, the zigzagging attitude of the CPV in managing the Internet in an attempt to reinforce its legitimacy and the challenges blogs pose to the state-run media's monopoly in the digital age.

AB  - Internet interventions may help bridging gaps in the treatment of depression but dissemination is slow in most countries. Attitudes towards these novel treatments options among health care professionals and potential users may be crucial for a successful implementation. We recruited 1004 adults with mild to moderate depression symptoms within a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) on the efficacy of an Internet intervention (EVIDENT trial), and 428 licensed psychotherapists. We used the Attitudes towards Psychological Online Interventions Questionnaire (APOI) and confirmed psychometric validity of an adapted version for health care professionals, in order to test if psychotherapists hold more negative attitudes towards such interventions compared to individuals with depression symptoms, and to explore variables that predict these attitudes. Individuals with depression symptoms reported more positive attitudes towards Internet interventions than psychotherapists (large group difference; eta (p) (2) = 0.384). Recruitment in clinical settings was associated with more negative attitudes compared to recruitment via the media. Among therapists, endorsing a psychodynamic rather than another theoretical orientation was associated with more pronounced negative attitudes. Results elucidate possible reasons for the slow dissemination of Internet interventions and suggest pathways for appropriate implementation into healthcare services.

AB  - The paper applies modern industrial economic theories to give an overview of the emerging phenomenon of digital personal assistants (DPAs). A DPA is an automated system that serves personal usage only and interacts with the user in natural language, meanwhile applying original and third-party services to obtain information and perform various actions. We analyze the economic benefits of increasing usage of DPAs, such as reduction of transaction costs, procompetitive effects, and boosting the e-commerce economy. Besides benefits, however, adopting DPA in life may also contain some risks and downsides, which may reduce the positive welfare effects or even lead to decreasing welfare: biased services, market power on the DPA market and economic dependence on a dominant DPA, potential leveraging of DPA suppliers' market power into neighboring markets, personalized data (ab)use and privacy, media bias and manipulation of public opinion, and loss of autonomy. We identify the degree of effective competition and the degree of rationality of consumer behavior as the most relevant factors for either the advantages or the disadvantages to prevail and derive first regulatory implications.

AB  - Violence against women (VAW) is widespread in East Africa, with almost half of married women experiencing physical abuse. Those seeking to address this issue confront two challenges: some forms of domestic violence are widely condoned and it is the norm for witnesses to not report incidents. Building on a growing literature showing that education-entertainment can change norms and behaviors, we present experimental evidence from a media campaign attended by more than 10,000 Ugandans in 112 rural villages. In randomly assigned villages, video dramatizations discouraged VAW and encouraged reporting. Results from interviews conducted several months after the intervention show no change in attitudes condoning VAW yet a substantial increase in willingness to report to authorities, especially among women, and a decline in the share of women who experienced violence. The theoretical implication is that interventions that affect disclosure norms may reduce socially harmful behavior even if they do not reduce its acceptability.

AB  - In recent years, social media has provided novel ways to gather information in significant quantities directly from users. Analyzing sentiment hidden in these data has proven useful for recommender systems, marketing, and monitoring public opinion. This paper demonstrates that using Chinese characters' unique tone as the input features improve accuracy in Chinese sentiment analysis. In terms of data augmentation, we construct a synonym replacement thesaurus for text classification. We propose a model that combines Char Convolutional Neural Networks (CharCNN) with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we call CharCNN-SVM, to obtain the emotional tendencies of users' reviews. Through experiments, results demonstrate that our method outperforms several traditional methods, such as Naive Bayes, maximum entropy, support vector machine and bag-of-words, in terms of Chinese sentiment analysis accuracy. We also note some useful phenomena and provide relevant explanations.

AB  - Empirical studies have persistently reported negative attitudes of meat eaters toward vegetarians and vegans (veg*ns), but scant attention has been paid to veg*ns' attitudes toward meat eaters. We aimed to investigate the attitudes of meat eaters and veg*ns from both perspectives. In addition, we explored the attitudes of occasional meat eaters. We performed a cross-sectional study (Study 1) among meat eaters, veg*ns, and occasional meat eaters, as well as a content analysis of publicly available tweets (Study 2). Study 1 (N = 477, M-age = 23.45, SD = 5.91) showed that the attitudes of veg*ns toward meat eaters are significantly more negative compared to the attitudes of meat eaters toward veg*ns, but both were lower than the midpoint on scales measuring negative attitudes toward the other. Study 2 showed that only a small portion (<1%) of tweets (N = 1,328) on meat eating or veg*nism contained signs of negative attitudes. The two studies provide little evidence of the existence of strong negative attitudes.

AB  - Purpose Web users rely heavily on online content make decisions without assessing the veracity of the content. The online content comprising text, image, video or audio may be tampered with to influence public opinion. Since the consumers of online information (misinformation) tend to trust the content when the image(s) supplement the text, image manipulation software is increasingly being used to forge the images. To address the crucial problem of image manipulation, this study focusses on developing a deep-learning-based image forgery detection framework. Design/methodology/approach The proposed deep-learning-based framework aims to detect images forged using copy-move and splicing techniques. The image transformation technique aids the identification of relevant features for the network to train effectively. After that, the pre-trained customized convolutional neural network is used to train on the public benchmark datasets, and the performance is evaluated on the test dataset using various parameters. Findings The comparative analysis of image transformation techniques and experiments conducted on benchmark datasets from a variety of socio-cultural domains establishes the effectiveness and viability of the proposed framework. These findings affirm the potential applicability of proposed framework in real-time image forgery detection. Research limitations/implications This study bears implications for several important aspects of research on image forgery detection. First this research adds to recent discussion on feature extraction and learning for image forgery detection. While prior research on image forgery detection, hand-crafted the features, the proposed solution contributes to stream of literature that automatically learns the features and classify the images. Second, this research contributes to ongoing effort in curtailing the spread of misinformation using images. The extant literature on spread of misinformation has prominently focussed on textual data shared over social media platforms. The study addresses the call for greater emphasis on the development of robust image transformation techniques. Practical implications This study carries important practical implications for various domains such as forensic sciences, media and journalism where image data is increasingly being used to make inferences. The integration of image forgery detection tools can be helpful in determining the credibility of the article or post before it is shared over the Internet. The content shared over the Internet by the users has become an important component of news reporting. The framework proposed in this paper can be further extended and trained on more annotated real-world data so as to function as a tool for fact-checkers. Social implications In the current scenario wherein most of the image forgery detection studies attempt to assess whether the image is real or forged in an offline mode, it is crucial to identify any trending or potential forged image as early as possible. By learning from historical data, the proposed framework can aid in early prediction of forged images to detect the newly emerging forged images even before they occur. In summary, the proposed framework has a potential to mitigate physical spreading and psychological impact of forged images on social media. Originality/value This study focusses on copy-move and splicing techniques while integrating transfer learning concepts to classify forged images with high accuracy.
   The synergistic use of hitherto little explored image transformation techniques and customized convolutional neural network helps design a robust image forgery detection framework. Experiments and findings establish that the proposed framework accurately classifies forged images, thus mitigating the negative socio-cultural spread of misinformation.

AB  - Aggression research often relies upon convenient samples with unknown generalizability to populations of interest, potentially threatening external validity. This article details the measurement properties of the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire Short Form (BPAQ-SF) and its subscales in two nationally representative U.S. samples (N = 924) and a concurrent study with U.S. college students (N = 384). The results provide useful benchmarks for generalizing BPAQ-SF results from convenient samples to U. S. adults, including distributions, reliability, and factor structure. The results also confirm basic relationships between trait aggression and key social and demographic variables such as sex, age, and socioeconomic status while establishing convergent validity with violent political attitudes. Results from the national studies closely align with those from the student sample, providing reasonable support for generalizing trait aggression elements to U.S. adults.

AB  - In this article we show that perceptions of corruption and the experience of bribery are related theoretically and empirically at the individual level, although the magnitude of this association relies on two context variables, country-level corruption and press freedom. For that purpose, we propose a sociological approach to understand how people form "mental images" of corruption beyond (as well as based on) their personal experience of bribery. We test its main implications using a cross-national approach based on ISSP's 2016 Role of Government module and the national-level predictors suggested by our theoretical framework and the specialized literature. Using multilevel models, we find that the generalized perception of corruption is associated with the personal experience of bribery and that this association is stronger in countries where corruption is relatively absent and press freedom is high, i.e., developed countries, and is weaker otherwise, i.e., developing countries.

AB  - This study investigates the news coverage of climate change in 45 different countries and territories. Using the news framing approach, this study identifies the connections between several national socioeconomic, governance, and environmental traits and the portrayals of climate change. Although climate change is a global issue that affects every country in the world, how the news media frame it varies from country to country. Such a variation is related to each country's economic development, climate severity, and governance. The findings of this study contribute to framing literature by assessing frame use in national contexts, filling in the gap in the application of this theoretical framework.

AB  - Using data from 28 European countries, this study examines factors influencing public attitude towards the use of AI/Robot. Its multilevel SEM analysis finds that several factors at the individual level including Perceived threat of job loss and Digital technology efficacy predict public Acceptance of AI/Robot. Although country-level factors such as economic development, government effectiveness and innovation do not directly influence public acceptance of AI/Robot, they do have significant effects on Perceived threat of general job loss due to AI/Robot, and Digital technology efficacy. Findings indicate that these nationally macro variables influence people's perceptions of AI and robotics technologies and their confidence in their digital skills. This research enriches the application of the Technology Acceptance Model by using predictive variables at two levels: individual and country. Furthermore, at the individual level, this study uses two variables (e.g. Perceived threat of job loss and Digital technology efficacy) that are unconventional to TAM, thus contributing to this theoretical model.

AB  - Do Americans consider polling results an objective source of information? Experts tend to evaluate the credibility of polls based on the survey methods used, vendor track record, and data transparency, but it is unclear if the public does the same. In two different experimental studies-one focusing on candidate evaluations in the 2016 U.S. election and one on a policy issue-we find a significant factor in respondent assessments of polling credibility to be the poll results themselves. Respondents viewed polls as more credible when majority opinion matched their opinion. Moreover, we find evidence of attitude polarization after viewing polling results, suggesting motivated reasoning in the evaluations of political polls. These findings indicate that evaluations of polls are biased by motivated reasoning and suggest that such biases could constrain the possible impact of polls on political decision making.

AB  - We examine the impact of the Fukushima accident (March 2011) on global public perceptions of nuclear power. We contrast conceptually and empirically two models, an event & effect (EE) model [Kim, Y., Kim, M., & Kim, W. (2013). Effect of Fukushima nuclear disaster on global public acceptance of nuclear energy. Energy Policy, 61, 822-828] and our own challenge & response (CR) model. We replicate Kim et al. (2013), who modelled retrospective opinion changes on a set of "objective" predictors, using historical opinion data 1996-2016 for 23+ countries. The EE model shows little explanatory power for opinion shifts beyond nuclear dependency in the energy mix. We argue that individual and societal responses to nuclear accidents are constrained by cultural memories, and introduce the alternative CR model. Memory, both individual and collective, is primarily adaptive and makes available schematic information to deal with uncertain and novel situations. The CR model explains better the responses to Fukushima with memory factors of "Past Responses to Nuclear Incidents", of "Nuclear Renaissance" and "Long-term levels of Acceptance". We are able to typify 23 countries according to their characteristic pattern of cultural memory and their Fukushima responses.

AB  - An experiment examined how episodic and thematic political message frames affect attitudes toward older adults and Social Security. When exposed to messages about abolishing Social Security, participants exposed to episodic frames were significantly more likely to endorse message-consistent attitudes than participants exposed to a thematic frame. In mediation analyses, an episodic frame featuring a counterstereotypical exemplar increased endorsement of individual responsibility for retirement planning, which then led to more negative attitudes toward Social Security. These effects did not occur with a stereotypical exemplar in an episodic frame. The same mediated pathway influenced attitudes toward older adults in a more complex manner. Results provide support for individual responsibility attributions as a mediating mechanism underlying the effects of certain episodic frames.

AB  - The recent wave of immigration across European countries has precipitated an unprecedented political crisis in many Western countries. This is compounded by the fact that the large majority of these migrants originate from Arab countries. Research has demonstrated that Arabs are devalued relative to other socioethnic groups. The present study sought to investigate representations of Arabs and their integration. Twenty-one interviews conducted in Malta were used to analyze the logic and structure of argumentation supporting both favorable and unfavorable positions relative to Arabs. The findings demonstrate a variety of perspectives founded on 6 major themes, namely cultural, sociopolitical, psychological, religious, stigma, and economic issues. All views were elaborated and warranted, and served to justify particular forms of social relations that make the integration of Arabs possible but highly difficult. In particular, findings demonstrate a lack of positive appraisals of Islam. These findings suggest that breaking the spiral of conflict between Europeans and the Arab communities they host requires affirmative action to redress the negative representational climate that Arab immigrants need to negotiate. Our study also introduces an innovative method for unpacking argumentation structures that mark representational fields. This serves to understand the ways by which social representations form and transform in everyday social interaction. This understanding is essential in designing, smart policy that can cater to the logic of ordinary citizens.

AB  - In recent debates on offensive language in participatory online spaces, the term 'hate speech' has become especially prominent. Originating from a legal context, the term usually refers to violent threats or expressions of prejudice against particular groups on the basis of race, religion, or sexual orientation. However, due to its explicit reference to the emotion of hate, it is also used more colloquially as a general label for any kind of negative expression. This ambiguity leads to misunderstandings in discussions about hate speech and challenges its identification. To meet this challenge, this article provides a modularized framework to differentiate various forms of hate speech and offensive language. On the basis of this framework, we present a text annotation study of 5,031 user comments on the topic of immigration and refuge posted in March 2019 on three German news sites, four Facebook pages, 13 YouTube channels, and one right-wing blog. An in-depth analysis of these comments identifies various types of hate speech and offensive language targeting immigrants and refugees. By exploring typical combinations of labeled attributes, we empirically map the variety of offensive language in the subject area ranging from insults to calls for hate crimes, going beyond the common 'hate/no-hate' dichotomy found in similar studies. The results are discussed with a focus on the grey area between hate speech and offensive language.

AB  - We present two studies examining the role of the British press in promoting heuristic-based decision-making about sexual crime. In Study 1, 1014 press articles were used in order to examine the role of the availability heuristic. That is, we used the recent high-profile Jimmy Savile sexual offending scandal to investigate how this case impacted upon press reporting of sexual crime. We found a 295% increase in the frequency of sexual crime coverage after this case, in addition to a 22:1 over-representation of sexual crime prevalence. Linguistically, tabloid stories about sexual crime did not significantly differ in the 12 months following the Jimmy Savile scandal, though broadsheets were less negative in their coverage after the scandal broke. Tabloid headline descriptors of sexual offenders were also substantially more offensive than those used by broadsheets. In Study 2, tabloid readership was associated with more negative attitudes and preferences for harsher punishments for sexual offenders, which we propose may be attributable to the affect heuristic. We discuss our findings within the context of dual-process cognition, and argue that the national press promote heuristic-based thinking about the issue of sexual offending. Future research avenues, and potential implications for press engagement, are also identified.

AB  - Recent years have seen the migration of Ministries of Foreign Affairs (MFAs) to social media in a practice referred to as digital diplomacy. Social media enable MFAs to craft frames so as to influence audiences' perception of foreign affairs. Such framing is especially relevant during times of war as states seek to legitimize their policies. Notably, given that social media are inherently visual platforms, MFAs are now visual narrators. Few studies to date have extended the reach of framing theory to that of digital diplomacy during conflict. This study addresses this gap by analysing 795 tweets published by the Israeli MFA during the 2014 Gaza War. The authors' analysis demonstrates that the Israeli MFA crafted 14 linguistic frames that were used to legitimize Israel's policies. Notably, the MFA used images to support these frames and it is through images that the linguistic frames were made to resonate with Israeli strategic narratives. The authors pay attention to how images published by the Israeli MFA constitute three visual tropes and highlight how images function to augment frames (which focus on the present) to broader narratives that involve the past, present and future. Here, they explore how images invoke the past to illuminate the present and future, and create a shared identity in the context of the Gaza War.

KW  - human rights
AB  - The Olympic Games are increasingly used by non-governmental organizations to demand transnational forms of accountability from public authorities. This article assesses the effectiveness of transnational public opinion surrounding the Beijing 2008 Olympics, when the pressure of Western public opinion was exerted upon the government of the world's most populous non-Western nation to improve its human rights record. Utilizing the concepts of imagined global community and transnational public sphere, it finds that the Olympic Games had helped to call into existence a transnational public that ran up against the obstacle posed by the incomplete formation of supra-national forms of governance. The International Olympic Committee, a non-governmental organization, was a weak substitute. Because of the strong desire of Chinese people to take part in transnational deliberations, the article concludes with optimism about the potential of transnational public spheres that include Chinese people to develop toward more effective forms of transnational governance. But the IOC must strengthen the voice of its non-Western members, and Western interlocutors, including the media, must accept their share of the responsibility for creating the conditions for egalitarian dialogue.

AB  - The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) aroused great public opinion in the Chinese Sina-microblog. To help in designing effective communication strategies during a major public health emergency, we analyze the real data of COVID-19 information and propose a comprehensive susceptible-reading-forwarding-immune (SRFI) model to understand the patterns of key information propagation considering both public contact and participation. We develop the SRFI model, based on the public reading quantity and forwarding quantity that denote contact and participation respectively, and take into account the behavior that users may re-enter another related topic during the attention phase or the participation phase freely. Data fitting using the real data of both reading quantity and forwarding quantity obtained from Chinese Sina-microblog can parameterize the model to make an accurate prediction of the COVID-19 public opinion trend until the next major news item occurs, and the sensitivity analysis provides the basic strategies for communication.

This article posits that crisis politics in Hong Kong has undergone a politicisation process brought about by non-state activists with the intention of pressing for government change. In the absence of full democracy, the escalation of issues into crises by intensifying political pressure through the media and public opinion has become a possible means to manipulate government decisions.

AB  - Since the emergence of the national protests at Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in South Africa in 2015, both the public media and social media platforms were inundated with debates justifying the credibility and validity of the protests. It appears that the public and social media had succeeded in swaying public opinion in favour of the protests, as much media attention was focused on portraying the protests in the same manner as those of June 1976, namely that these were students fighting for equality in education, similar to those of 1976. However, since the protests hit their peak in 2015, and even through 2016, what have we learnt about the crisis in higher education that the protests have created? First, is there a crisis? Second, do the protests reflect the reality of the state of education in South Africa, namely, that institutions no longer seek to educate, but to indoctrinate? These are the key questions addressed in this article.

AB  - Analysis of United States foreign policy is a constant in academia and the media. Among the widely analyzed and hotly debated issues on U.S. foreign policy is its relationship with the International Criminal Court (ICC). Yet, there has been little research on American public opinion if the U.S. should be more involved with the ICC. This paper analyzes historical and contemporary U.S. foreign policy on the ICC as well as American public opinion regarding greater U.S. involvement with the court. To accomplish these goals, we analyze data from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs' June 2010 Global Views survey, a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults. The analysis focuses on various ICC-related topics, chief among them being whether the United States should join the ICC. In addition, we examine if support for the ICC varies across various demographic and attitudinal variables, such as age, sex, race, income, political ideology, and support for multilateralism. This issue is first examined at a bivariate level of analysis and then within a multivariate framework to identify the most salient predictors of support for the ICC.

AB  - Far-right groups increasingly use social media to interact with other groups and reach their followers. Social media also enable 'ordinary' people to participate in online discussions and shape political discourse. This study compares the networks and discourses of Facebook pages of Western European far-right parties, movements and communities. Network analyses of pages indicate that the form of far-right mobilization is shaped by political opportunities. The absence of a strong far-right party offline seems to be reflected in an online network in which non-institutionalized groups are the most prominent actors, rather than political parties. In its turn, the discourse is shaped by the type of actor. Content analyses of comments of followers show that parties address the political establishment more often than immigration and Islam, compared to non-institutionalized groups. Furthermore, parties apply less extreme discursive practices towards 'the other' than non-institutionalized groups.

AB  - This article addresses how mainstream media are conceptualised as a site for mediated recognition in the city of Sydney, Australia. Utilising the notion of political listening, the analysis investigates how participants position certain media outlets as misrecognising the value of diverse voices. Through in-depth interviews, the article explores how audiences discuss perceived issues of significance to society in their recall of news coverage spanning politics, migration, international conflict and local crime. First, the article clarifies how participants construct specific racialised notions of Otherness by situating their use of mainstream media discourses in the context of their everyday communicative interactions. Second, it examines how racialised frameworks are mobilised by participants to evaluate certain news media as spaces of exclusion. This article posits that the participants' discussions of these media spaces as being integral in fostering inclusion endows the media outlets with a capacity for enhancing everyday mechanisms of mediated recognition.

AB  - Conventional e-government has many practical infrastructure development and implementation challenges. The recent surge of SMAC (Social media, Mobile, Analytics, Cloud) technologies re-defines the e-governance ecosystem. Cloud-based e-governance has numerous operational challenges which range from development to implementation. Moreover, the contemplation and vocalization of public opinion about any government initiative is quintessential to be cognizant of how citizens perceives and get benefitted from cloud/fog enabled governance. This research puts forward a semantic knowledge model for investigating public opinion towards adaption of fog enabled services for governance and comprehending the significance of two s-components (sentic and social) in aforesaid structure that specifically visualize fog enabled Sentic-Social Governance. The results using conventional TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) feature extraction are empirically compared with ontology driven TF-IDF feature extraction to find the best opinion mining model with optimal accuracy. The results depict that the implementation of ontology driven opinion mining for feature extraction in polarity classification outperforms the traditional TF-IDF method validated over baseline supervised learning algorithms. An average of 7.3% improvement in accuracy and approximately 38% reduction in features has been reported.

AB  - How is racism negotiated by those who are otherwise victims of racism? Social psychologists show the relevance of categorization in negotiating racism. In the present article I focus on a setting where the majority group itself can be considered a target of racism: racism against Black-Africans in India. I examine how victim categorization of the majority group is developed and used through a membership categorization analysis of broadcast media news debates. Analysis shows that, first, victim categories complicated the use of racial prejudice as an explanation for the attacks. Second, victim categorizations were developed in relation to social groups that were removed from the present setting. These allowed for accomplishing specific actions: denials and rejections of racism, moral concerns in racism, and acceptance of Black-Africans' claims about racism. Together, the findings show that racism can be negotiated in terms additional to racial/ethnic group membership: as victims or perpetrators of racism.

AB  - Based on data from a nationwide Annual Social Survey, the current study investigated the correlation between digital variables and perceived employability among the Jewish majority and Arab minority in Israel.In line with the human capital theory, Internet use for study and digital skills was positively correlated with perceived employability for the Jewish majority. Our findings among Arab participants only partially support our hypotheses. The positive correlation between digital skills and perceived employability corresponds to human capital theory. In contrast, our findings show negative effects for obtaining online services from government offices and e-mail use on perceived employability. These findings should be taken into consideration by e-government media authorities and policymakers, as e-government media have a strong influence on public opinion.

AB  - Considerable research indicates that personal contact from political campaigns can mobilize people to vote, but little attention has been given to whether the tone of the message matters. Studies of message tone have mostly been confined to mass media campaigns and ignored the growing role grassroots techniques play in contemporary political campaigns. Two randomized field experiments were conducted to determine the importance of message tone in grassroots contact. We find evidence that personally delivered messages can be effective at influencing voting preferences, but neither experiment uncovered a systematic difference between the effects of negative and positive messages on voter turnout or political attitudes.

AB  - Social media websites can be used as a data source for mining public opinion on a variety of subjects including climate change. Twitter, in particular, allows for the evaluation of public opinion across both time and space because geotagged tweets include timestamps and geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude). In this study, a large dataset of geotagged tweets containing certain keywords relating to climate change is analyzed using volume analysis and text mining techniques such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis. Latent Dirichlet allocation was applied for topic modeling to infer the different topics of discussion, and Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner was applied for sentiment analysis to determine the overall feelings and attitudes found in the dataset. These techniques are used to compare and contrast the nature of climate change discussion between different countries and over time. Sentiment analysis shows that the overall discussion is negative, especially when users are reacting to political or extreme weather events. Topic modeling shows that the different topics of discussion on climate change are diverse, but some topics are more prevalent than others. In particular, the discussion of climate change in the USA is less focused on policy-related topics than other countries.

AB  - The question of what constitutes torture has perhaps never held as prominent a place in US political discourse as it has since the attacks on 9/11. This has fueled a national conversation that causes us to consider to what extent do our actions as a nation reflect our values as a nation? In a post 9/11 world in which the country will confront terrorism at home and abroad and our values will be tested we should strive for a better understanding of citizens' attitudes towards the practices that are (and have been) used to counter terrorism. To the extent that democratic theory is correct in necessitating public policy and public opinions to be reasonably congruent, understanding the distribution and formation of citizen attitudes towards torture is an important endeavor.

AB  - This article presents a theoretical analysis and generalization of the views of various scientists on the understanding of the essence, significance, varieties, and effectiveness of the use of humanitarian technologies in information activities in general, and primarily in the conduct of modem information wars. It has been proved that the diverse use of various information means and technologies in itself, given its significance, is not enough to implement a full-fledged effect on the formation of mass consciousness and the effective functioning of public opinion in the process of such wars. The real effectiveness of such an impact is provided in cases where the functioning of such information flows, primarily in the media and the Internet, is supported by the use of humanitarian technologies based on specific technologies based on sociological, psychological, political science, and a number of other sciences, it is shown that the use of such technologies is aimed at creating certain approaches to the formation and formatting of the mass consciousness of the population, public opinion in order to ensure certain "defeated" results in information wars associated with gaining the affection of both its people and the population of the enemy country.

AB  - Objective Relations between the Big Five personality dispositions and individual differences in political trust and involvement in politics have been investigated in many studies. We aimed to systematically integrate these findings and further explore the correlations at different hierarchical levels of the Big Five and political trust and involvement. Method We conducted a meta-analysis of 43 publications (N-1 = 207,360 participants) and estimated latent correlations at different hierarchical levels using two additional samples (N-2 = 988 and N-3 = 795). Results The meta-analysis revealed substantial correlations between involvement and openness (+), extraversion (+), and neuroticism (-), but only small correlations between trust and the Big Five. We also found a substantial amount of inconsistency in findings across studies. Our additional analyses showed that (a) correlations with the Big Five were larger for higher-order factors of general political trust (as opposed to subdimensions such as trust in politicians) and general political involvement (as opposed to subdimensions such as political interest) and (b) correlational patterns within each Big Five domain differed across facets. Conclusion Our analyses indicate that political involvement is more strongly linked to the Big Five than political trust. We discuss the theoretical and empirical relevance of hierarchical constructs.

AB  - In recent years, the economic development of China and India and their border confrontations have intensified bilateral strategic competition. This study used the State of Democracy in South Asia survey to identify dual mindsets of competition and contingency that drive how Indians perceive China's influence in Asia. These two mindsets are based on a cognitive schema characterized by a political predisposition against China. However, this negative orientation is moderated as more information is acquired regarding the impact of China on India. The competition mindset does not always manifest itself, and is only cognitively activated when a change is perceived in India's power status. On the other hand, the contingent principle appears whenever competition seems to have abated, or disadvantage seems unavoidable. The mindsets of competition and contingency are not only relevant to the evolution of Sino-Indian relations, but also explain how Indian policymakers behave and respond in international society.

AB  - Since the introduction of the Internet, China's networked public sphere has become a critical site in which various actors compete to shape public opinion and promote or forestall legal and political change. This paper examines how members of an online public, the Tianya Forum, conceptualized and discussed law in relation to a specific event, the 2008 Sanlu milk scandal. Whereas previous studies suggest the Chinese state effectively controls citizens' legal consciousness via propaganda, this analysis shows that the construction of legality by the Tianya public was not a top-down process, but a complex negotiation involving multiple parties. The Chinese state had to compete with lawyers and outspoken media to frame and interpret the scandal for the Tianya public and it was not always successful in doing so. Data show further how the online public framed the food safety incident as indicative of fundamental problems rooted in China's political regime and critiqued the state's instrumental use of law.

AB  - As radio priest Father Charles Coughlin became more openly antisemitic and pro-fascist in the late 1930s, his broadcasts became increasingly divisivemore and more distressing to some listeners and more and more celebrated by othersand inevitably provoked debate about freedom of speech. Goodman analyses letters from Coughlin listeners, and compares them with the more familiar policy history of free speech regulation. Pro-Coughlin listeners attempted to make a civil rights issue of the refusal of some stations to sell time to Coughlin, talking of his right to broadcast and their right to hear him. Anti-Coughlin listeners documented the hurt and harm that the broadcasts caused and argued that limits had to be placed on Coughlin's right to broadcast in order to protect the rights of listeners. In making this case, in addition to clear and present danger' arguments about possible social disturbance, Coughlin opponents were proffering arguments about the harms caused by hateful speech that would only achieve widespread currency and provoke debate decades later, in the 1990s. Goodman argues that we need new histories of free speech that in this way juxtapose the views of Supreme Court justices and legal scholars with discussion of the same issues by ordinary people. This has the potential to change our sense of the chronology of free speech history.

AB  - Information about the degree of one's genetic overlap with ethnic outgroups has been emphasized in genocides, is frequently learned about through media reporting, and is increasingly being accessed via personal genetic testing services. However, the consequence of learning about whether your own ethnic group is either genetically related to or genetically distinct from a disliked ethnic group remains unknown. Across four experiments, using diverse samples, measures and contexts, we demonstrate that altering perceptions of genetic overlap between groups in conflictin this case Arabs and Jewsimpacts factors that are directly related to interethnic hostility (e.g., aggressive behaviors, support of conflict-related policies). Our findings indicate that learning about the genetic difference between oneself and an ethnic outgroup may contribute to the promotion of violence, whereas learning about the similarities may be a vital step toward fostering peace in some contexts. Possible interventions and implications are discussed.

AB  - The partisan politics and polarized messaging surrounding COVID-19 have attracted wide interest. We present the findings of a novel survey experiment, fielded March 21-23, 2020, on a nationally-representative sample of Americans. We found no statistically significant effects of partisan endorsements or messaging from President Trump on a wide range of health behaviors and policy attitudes. We speculate on potential explanations for these null results, such as America's saturated media environment or heterogeneous effects by party. Our results suggest that priming experiments face serious obstacles when implemented at the same time as a national crisis is unfolding.

AB  - The Latino population in the US is projected to grow substantially in the years ahead. Although often referred to as a single group, Latinos are not homogeneous. This article, based mainly on a national telephone survey of 1,478 Latino adults, examines the perspectives of six Latino heritage groups on the health care issues they face. The six groups differ in their reported health care experiences in: the types facilities they use in getting medical care, their ratings of the quality of care they receive, their experiences with discrimination in getting quality care, the level of confidence they have in being able to pay for a major illness. One thing the heritage groups agree on is that diabetes is the biggest health problem facing their families. Community health leaders, particularly at the state level, need to focus on the specific Latino groups in their state or area and their unique situations.

AB  - This article argues that censorship studies must concern themselves with matters beyond the actions of the censors if they are to understand how an instance of censorship occurs. It is based on a new study of the experiences of English-speaking audiences of A Serbian Film (2010), which was heavily censored by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). It employs discourse analysis of responses to a mixed-methods survey to examine how audiences discuss media violence and censorship. This article identifies four key competing discourses used by respondents, all of which have very different implications, along with the relationships between these discourses. It demonstrates the complexity of the reception of A Serbian Film and theorises the workings of the censorship debate more widely. The invocation of 'public opinion' by the BBFC to justify censorship decisions necessitates a better understanding of how everyday audiences talk about censorship.

AB  - The Enning Road redevelopment project has been controversial in Guangzhou as the site possesses many vernacular buildings that are not officially recognised by the authorities as significant but are nevertheless highly regarded by non-state stakeholders as important entities that embody the unique essence and culture of local neighbourhoods. This paper examines the positive role led by the press media, the New Express, in bringing about changes in the government-sanctioned Enning Road redevelopment project plan through the lens of the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF). The significance of this paper lies in detailing how the news group has helped shift the project priority from being property-led to conservation-led. Its reports have gained a wide audience in appreciating and recognising the conservation value of non-designated vernacular architecture in inner city areas. Nonetheless, this paper raises question about the sustainability of civil mobilisation in subsequent conservation efforts, due to a general lack of enthusiasm. Neither urban redevelopment strategies nor conservation agenda have been subject to a major overhaul due to the impact of this individual redevelopment project. Therefore, the promise of change is at best a tactical compromise adopted by the municipal authorities to nullify opposing public voices in Guangzhou.

AB  - Based on the current 2008/98/EC Directive, EU Member States are obliged to establish a waste management plan, waste prevention programmes by the end of 2013 and ensure that the general public will have the opportunity to participate in the elaboration of such plans and programmes. Energy recovery is one of the options laid down in the Directive as a possible solution and thus, the current study focuses on the environmental, technical, economical and marketing aspects of the operation of a modern Waste-to-Energy (WtE) plant in the Kotsiatis landfill. The present study includes the analysis of WtE plant aspects, such as the public's opinions, marketing and promotional activities, environmental depollution, financing options and operational costs. Personal interviews were conducted in the villages around the Kotsiatis landfill, and the techno economical study was based on the available literature. Results have shown that the construction of a WtE plant in the area will improve the quality of life of the habitants, reduce the current environmental problems, and that it is economically viable without governmental subsidy. The construction of a WtE plant that will be capable of incinerating 100,000 tonnes of waste/year will result to 11 MW of reliable power, in addition to the environmental benefits. The Net Present Value of such an investment will be [SIC]2,655,730 with an Internal Rate of Return of 10.5 %. However, the general public in the Kotsiatis village is against the construction of such a plant, but this is due to the lack of trustworthy information about incineration technologies (and renewable energy in general) from the local media. On the contrary, the general public in the vicinity of the area is in favour of a WtE plant, as they acknowledge the potential benefits.

AB  - In August 2018, Denmark became the latest European country to ban the wearing of the niqab (face veil) in public. Indeed, several European countries such as France, Belgium and Austria have already implemented a ban on the wearing of the niqab in public places in these countries on the basis that the niqab is a symbol of gender oppression, Islamist fundamentalism and lack of integration. This issue has been the subject of heated media, political and public debates; however, the voices of veiled Muslim women remain unheard. Within the framework of Critical Race Feminism, the paper draws on qualitative interviews with Muslim women who wear the niqab in the United Kingdom (UK), in order to explore their views on legislation banning the wearing of the niqab in public.

AB  - Background: The efficacy of e-cigarette prevention ads among adolescents has seldom been studied. We examined the impact of ads from the The Real Cost vaping prevention media campaign on what adolescents think and believe about vaping. We also sought to test whether perceived message effectiveness (PME) served as a proxy for ad impact.
   Methods: Participants were 543 U.S. adolescents ages 13-17. In an online experiment, we randomized participants to either: 1) persuasive e-cigarette prevention video ads from the Food and Drug Administration's The Real Cost campaign that was targeted to adolescents or 2) information-only e-cigarette harms control videos (control condition). Participants in each condition viewed 2 videos in a random order. After ad exposure, the survey assessed PME (message and effects perceptions), risk beliefs about vaping, attitudes toward vaping, and intentions to vape.
   Results: The FDA's The Real Cost ads led to higher beliefs about the harms of vaping (p < .001), more negative attitudes toward vaping (p < .001), and lower intentions to vape (p < .05) compared to the control videos. The Real Cost ads also scored higher on both message perceptions (p < .001) and effects perceptions (p < .001) compared to control videos. Effects perceptions were associated with all three outcomes (all ps < 0.001, adjusting for both types of PME and covariates), but message perceptions did not offer additional predictive value.
   Conclusions: Exposure to The Real Cost vaping prevention ads gave adolescents a more negative view of vaping and lowered their intentions to vape compared to control videos. Effects perceptions may be superior to message perceptions as a proxy for e-cigarette prevention ad impact.

AB  - In this article, I reveal the textual mechanisms that influential news editors employed to manipulate popular understandings of Mario Juruna, a Xavante leader who played an important role in advancing democracy during Brazil's military dictatorship and became the first Indian elected to national office. I argue that editors used the implicit messages of represented language to initiate shifts in the public's perception of the Xavante leader and thereby to change its opinion of him. Juruna's case illustrates that linguistic resources are powerful tools that hegemonic institutions, such as the press, and other dominant parties may employ to advance their own interests and influence public opinion on matters of political and social import.

AB  - This paper seeks to explore how Bangladeshi newspapers frame road safety governance. It investigates the prevalence of five news frames-responsibility, conflict, human interest, economic consequence and morality, in news stories on road safety in Bangladesh. Taking a deductive approach to qualitative content analysis, a total of ninety three (93) news stories from July 29 to August 30, 2018, were analyzed from four Bangladeshi newspapers. The findings suggest that the most common frame in news stories on road safety was the attribution of responsibility frame, followed by the conflict frame and human interest frame, respectively. In most of the cases, the government was seen as responsible for the problem, rather than the individual actors. It is argued that each of the frames can construct a distinct picture of the reality in which road safety is positioned and influence the policy preferences of the audience.

AB  - The article analyses the discursive appeal to solidarity in the mass media during the unfolding of Europe's migration crisis. Solidarity was claimed by numerous actors in the public discourse to legitimise political decisions and mobilise public opinion. While it seems that the call for solidarity was shared by many actors, media studies show the 'partisan journalism' of media outlets. Thus, the political orientation of media outlets influences their coverage of public debates. Hence, to what extent do different quality newspapers cover the same solidarity claims in times of crisis? In order to answer this question, the crisis coverage of two German and two Irish newspapers with centre-left and centre-right political orientations is examined via the discourse network methodology. Germany is selected due to high political parallelism and a strong affectedness by the crisis, while Ireland is selected because of low political parallelism and a weak affectedness by the migration crisis. The findings demonstrate that partisan journalism persists during Europe's migration crisis. Especially German party actors are present in both countries, underpinning the central position of Germany. Regarding the appeal to solidarity, political solidarity claims prevail in all four newspapers, indicating the political-institutional asymmetry in the Common European Asylum System. The study contributes to the strategic framing of concepts in public debates and demonstrates that the left-right distinction of media outlets is hardly affected by the migration crisis.

TI  - Quantifying Discrepancies in Opinion Spectra from Online and Offline Networks
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Online social media such as Twitter are widely used for mining public opinions and sentiments on various issues and topics. The sheer volume of the data generated and the eager adoption by the online-savvy public are helping to raise the profile of online media as a convenient source of news and public opinions on social and political issues as well. Due to the uncontrollable biases in the population who heavily use the media, however, it is often difficult to measure how accurately the online sphere reflects the offline world at large, undermining the usefulness of online media. One way of identifying and overcoming the online-offline discrepancies is to apply a common analytical and modeling framework to comparable data sets from online and offline sources and cross-analyzing the patterns found therein. In this paper we study the political spectra constructed from Twitter and from legislators' voting records as an example to demonstrate the potential limits of online media as the source for accurate public opinion mining, and how to overcome the limits by using offline data simultaneously.

AB  - All in the Family's Archie Bunker was a mouthpiece for 1970s white working-class men. Theirs was an anxious decade. Peddling stereotypes, "othering" those unlike them, enabled this group to assert their threatened authority. Analyzed as popular media texts, the show's many intersections with bigotry and anti-Semitism reveal unique insights into 1970s American life, especially the Jewish American experience. During the series' decade-long run, Bunker gradually confronted and softened his prejudices. However, this was not the case among all "Archies," a reality still visible in current times. Surveying the show's racialist meditations against the backdrop of "tiki torchers" and Trumpism reminds viewers about the fraught nature of American identity, explaining why some Jews may elect to pass.

AB  - This paper examines the ideological construction of educational discourses embedded within the South Korean print media. Significantly, these discourses have recently promoted the resurrection of a sweeping national testing and test results release policy. Through careful examination of the "test plus release" policy, the authors show how the government has achieved hegemonic power by shaping public opinion through the national testing contexts. Drawing on a critical discourse analysis of educational policy texts from the government and top 10 print media sources, this paper analyses how discourses on "accountability", "the right to know" and "the fairness of the tests" have been produced, reproduced and recontextualized to favour particular perspectives. The authors also examine how government and influential print media discourses interact with political and cultural factors such as "acclaiming the evaluative state", "education fever" and "meritocratic beliefs" to achieve public consent for the new "test plus release" policy.

AB  - Background: Media coverage of the Germanwings plane crash intensely focused on the co-pilot's mental illness and was criticized for potentially increasing depression stigma. We explored whether stigma beliek towards persons with depression changed in April 2015 (about one month after the crash) compared to 2014.
   Method: Telephone surveys among the adult population were conducted in Munich, Germany (N=650 in 2014 and N=601 in 2015). In both surveys, four components of stigma were assessed: (1) characteristics ascribed to persons with a depression, (2) belief in a continuum of symptoms from mental health to mental illness, (3) emotional reactions to people afflicted by depression (fear, anger, and pro social reactions), and (4) desire for social distance.
   Results: Some stigmatizing attitudes have increased after the crash. More specifically, we found more pronounced changes in the attributes ascribed (stereotypes) and in the perceived separation from persons afflicted (continuum beliefs) than in the emotional reactions and the desire for social distance. However, overall increase in depression stigma was smaller than expected as changes were not statistically significant in the majority of the analyzed items.
   Limitations: Due to the study design no causal interpretation of results is possible. Moreover, evidence presented is confined to a regional German sample.
   Conclusions: A single devastating event and related media coverage seem to have a limited impact On public stigmatizing attitudes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All tights reserved.

KW  - ECT

KW  - PERSPECTIVE
AB  - Background: Although electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a safe and effective treatment modality with a long history of use in psychiatry, it remains controversial owing to misconceptions and negative attitudes among the public and medical profession. The aim of this study was to explore the state of knowledge and attitudes towards ECT among a sample of South African medical students.
   Method: Prior to their theoretical psychiatry module, 131 second-year medical students responded to an anonymous online survey designed to assess the source and extent of their ECT knowledge as well as their attitude towards ECT and psychiatry in general.
   Results: The Internet (46.6%) and TV and/or movies (30.5%) were the principal sources of knowledge of ECT while 'professional publication' was the least common (0%). The students' attitudes towards psychiatry were generally positive and nearly one-third (29.8%) would consider specialising in the field. Overall, perception towards ECT was mixed, with many respondents approving of its use albeit only as a last resort. Notably, low ECT knowledge scores were associated with more negative attitudes towards this treatment modality and a lower perception of psychiatry as a medical speciality.
   Conclusion: The findings indicate that for these students, media is the main source of ECT knowledge. While they are generally knowledgeable about ECT, they still harbour some misconceptions and negative attitudes about the treatment. Knowledge appears able to amend these attitudes, thus underlining the importance of integrating accurate information about ECT into the preclinical medical curriculum rather than leaving it to mass media to forge warped perceptions and attitudes for these future clinicians.

AB  - The specificity of the transmission of ideas, methods of perception of various areas of public life, social stereotypes is described. The high potentia of the content analysis method in reflecting the key informational factors in the formation of public opinion is shown. The qualitative and quantitative aspects of the content analysis are considered. The importance of studying not only the texts of printed publications, but also publications posted on the internet, including publications in leading social networks, is described. The significance and prospects for the development of content analysis methods related to the study of large amounts of information are investigated. The perspective of the methods of content analysis based on the involvement of modern information technologies is considered. It is proved that in the course of social development, the importance of the content analysis method increases, which is accompanied by an increase in its capabilities associated with the development of machine technologies for processing large amounts of information.

AB  - This article presents a discussion on the main linguistic phenomena which cause difficulties in the analysis of user-generated texts found on the web and in social media, and proposes a set of annotation guidelines for their treatment within the Universal Dependencies (UD) framework of syntactic analysis. Given on the one hand the increasing number of treebanks featuring user-generated content, and its somewhat inconsistent treatment in these resources on the other, the aim of this article is twofold: (1) to provide a condensed, though comprehensive, overview of such treebanks-based on available literature-along with their main features and a comparative analysis of their annotation criteria, and (2) to propose a set of tentative UD-based annotation guidelines, to promote consistent treatment of the particular phenomena found in these types of texts. The overarching goal of this article is to provide a common framework for researchers interested in developing similar resources in UD, thus promoting cross-linguistic consistency, which is a principle that has always been central to the spirit of UD.

AB  - In the summer of 2017, several European Union Member States were involved in a food alert caused by the presence of fipronil pesticide residues in chicken eggs. The food alert became a major news and received wide coverage both in the mass media and on the Internet. This article describes a study that analyzed how the Italian online information sources represented the fipronil alert, using web monitoring techniques and both manual and automatic content analysis methods. The results indicate that the alert was amplified because general news media could represent the alert within the frame of a political scandal, and because different social actors exploited the case. However, online information sources correctly communicated that the risks for consumers were low, reporting mainly what was officially communicated by the Italian health authorities. The study provides empirical evidence on how the online information sources represent food risks and food alerts and offers useful indications for health authorities in charge of the public communication of food risks.

AB  - A recent study scrutinized the effects of providing people with information about suspended sentences on their opinions of these sentences, and concluded that the impact is modest or even absent. Re-analyzing the original data, we demonstrate that this conclusion greatly underestimates the relevance of informational provision. Recognizing that information is framed differently by people with different cultural predispositions, we show that the effects of informational provision are much stronger among groups with specific penal attitudes than analyses of mere direct effects suggest. Even more importantly, the direction of these effects also depends on people's penal attitudes; among specific groups, more information leads to less, instead of more, favorable opinions on suspended sentences.

AB  - Mobile apps for antiracism have become valuable pedagogical and activist tools for their real-time and mapping capabilities, their portability and intimate bodily presence, which enables a reaction exactly when an act of racism occurs. In this article, five mobile apps aimed at producing antiracism education or intervention outcomes from the United Kingdom, Australia and France are the focus of an interrogation of the ways in which racism and antiracism are framed and the strengths and weaknesses of these initiatives for countering dominant forms of everyday racism. We identify a number of different approaches to racism and antiracism in our inquiry, which lead to particular sets of aims, features and uses: the app as a tool for capturing, reporting and responding to racist acts; as a way of reinforcing a wider sense of community identity and solidarity; to demonstrate racism, especially Islamophobia, and make its forms visible, and as a means for challenging racism through raising awareness and encouraging bystanders to oppose it. We argue that while these apps are well disposed to exposing and manifesting isolated incidents of racism in everyday life, we question their potential for transformative societal outcomes beyond the level of unilateral action in the context of events experienced as unique incidents.

AB  - At least since 2016, distorted news published in populist alternative media outlets have raised global concerns about the effects of distorted news on democratic process such as opinion formation and voting. Not all individuals are equally susceptible to distorted news. In three experimental studies (total N = 1,024), we demonstrate that (a) distorted alternative news are seen as less credible compared to journalist news; (b) the perceived credibility of distorted news is greater among right-wing authoritarians and conspiracy-minded individuals; (c) exposure to distorted news can bias these types of individuals' attitudes about an unknown political candidate; and (d) distorted news leads people in general to develop less favorable attitudes toward the targeted candidate as compared to journalist news.

AB  - The information environment that social movements face is increasingly complex, making traditional assumptions about media, messaging, and communication used in social movement studies less relevant. Building on work begun within the study of digital protest, we argue that a greater integration of political communication research within social movement studies could offer substantial research contributions. We illustrate this claim by discussing how a greater focus on audiences and message reception, as well as message context, could advance the study of social movements. Specifically, we discuss a range of topics as applied to movement research, including information overload, selective attention, perceptions of bias, the possibilities that entertainment-related communications open up, and priming, among other topics. We suggest the risks of not adapting to this changing information environment, and incorporating insights from political communication, affect both the study of contemporary (including digital) protest, as well as potentially historical protest. The possibilities opened up by this move are immense including entirely new research programs and questions.

AB  - Purpose: Considerable research has examined public attitudes toward the police. Yet, little is known about the effects of direct and vicarious police stops upon youths' attitudes and perceptions of police. The purpose of the current study is to analyze the relationship between direct and vicarious police stops and urban youths' attitudes of and perceptions toward police officers.
   Methods: Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Survey (FFCWS), linear and ordered logistic regressions were used to examine the relationship between police stops and urban youths' perceptions of and attitudes toward police officers.
   Results: Findings indicate that direct and vicarious police stops are associated with lower levels of respect and confidence in the police. We also found that direct and vicarious police stops have a positive relationship with perceptions of procedural justice. However, the positive effect of police stops on procedural justice is mitigated by the level of police intrusiveness during such stops.
   Conclusions: While our findings on respect and confidence suggest that direct and vicarious police stops are catalysts of negative attitude formation, we also show that direct and vicarious stops play an important role in curbing negative sentiments of police injustice.

AB  - The increasing popularity of social network sites (SNSs) in election campaigns provides a unique climate for scholarly inquiry. The study reported here builds upon Zhang, Johnson, Seltzer, and Bichard and investigates the impact of different types of SNS use on voters' attitudes and behavior during the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign. Sites such as Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, and YouTube are included to offer a robust assessment of distinct relationships. A national online panel of Internet users was utilized to examine reliance on SNSs and the multiple consequences on political attitudes and behavior such as political participation, political interest, selective exposure, selective avoidance, and strength of party affiliation. The findings are evaluated for theoretical and practical implications on democratic governance.

AB  - What visual features characterize online migration data visualizations, and what do they suggest for the politics of representing migration and informing public attitudes? Audiences increasingly encounter quantitative information through visualization, especially in digital environments. Yet visualizations have political dimensions that manifest themselves through "conventions," or shared symbols and practices conveying meaning. Using content analysis, I identify patterns of representation in a sample of 277 migration data visualizations scraped from Google Images. I find evidence of several conventions including appeals to objectivity and traceability as well as perspectives and units of analysis centered on states-particularly higher income migrant destinations. Then, by locating my analysis within the growing field of digital migration studies, I argue these conventions potentially shape public attitudes and understandings about migrants, and contribute to broader migration politics involving categorization and quantification that have relevance both on- and off-line.

AB  - In contrast to the centrality of coming out' in the gay rights movement, transgender people may be less likely to disclose their transgender status due to the severity of anti-transgender stigma, structural factors and differences in how transgender status and sexual identity are expressed. As a consequence, intergroup contact with transgender people may be less common than gay contact, which may limit its effectiveness. In Study 1 (N=174), transgender contact was much less frequent than gay contact, and transgender contact frequency was not associated with anti-transgender bias, although more positive transgender contact was associated with lower anti-transgender bias, and gay contact frequency was also independently associated with lower anti-transgender bias. In Study 2 (N=277), greater transgender media contact' was associated with increased empathy for transgender people and decreased anti-transgender bias. In addition, several participants left unsolicited anti-transgender comments at the end of the study, and these participants tended to have less transgender contact and were higher in right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation. Our results suggest that increasing contact with the LGBT community and increasing media representations of transgender people may decrease anti-transgender bias. Future directions building on these results are discussed.

AB  - In the aftermath of 9/11, the academia witnessed a surge in the number of studies dealing with Islamophobia, the representations of Muslims in Western media and complex realities created by such (mis)representations. This article hopes to contribute to such scholarly efforts by examining the demonisation of Islam through the fashioning of celebrity Muslim hate preachers' (i.e. Abu-Hamza, Abu-Qatada and Omar Bakri) in British tabloids (i.e. The Sun and the Daily Mail ). Drawing upon insights from Serge Moscovici's theory of social representations, the article aims to diverge from the traditional approaches of content and discourse analysis to shed light on the nexus between forms of social thinking and the unique portrayal of these preachers in tabloids.

AB  - Introduction
   With the surge in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases across nations worldwide, World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Besides various policy guidelines and directions issued from time to time to combat the menace, there was the dissemination of a lot of misinformation and disinformation through social media or otherwise. This led to emotional, psychological, and mental agonies in the general population as well as Healthcare Workers (HCWs).
   Methods
   A cross-sectional quantitative study using purposive sampling techniques was done to assess the health-seeking behavior during the pandemic among HCWs of a tertiary care hospital in North India, designated as a dedicated COVID-19 hospital by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, India. A semi-structured questionnaire validated by experts with a reliability value (r=0.92) was taken. To maintain minimal contact and to follow COVID-19 Appropriate Behavior (CAB), a web-based link was used to obtain the data. Privacy of the participants and confidentiality of data obtained was maintained.
   Results
   Out of the total 250 participants enrolled in the study, the response rate was 81% (203). For 123 (60%) respondents, social media was one of the sources of access to information during the pandemic. The most common social media app(s) accessed were WhatsApp 82 (40%), Facebook, and Instagram 67 (33%). Social media had both positive as well as negative impacts on the mindset of respondents as 147 (72%) agreed that social media networks helped to further improve their understanding, whereas 178 (88%) stated that it aroused fear and panic among them.
   Conclusion
   During epidemics, timely, accurate, and authentic information is vital in shaping public opinion; on the contrary, an infodemic can pose a serious threat and panic in society by disseminating false and wrong information as was seen in the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The emergence of COVID-19 represented a critical problem for the legitimacy and prestige of the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese authorities had to fight not only to contain the spread of the virus but also to create a favorable public opinion about how they managed the crisis. Based on Foucault's approach to the "Regime of Truth", this article analyzes the narrative surrounding the origin of the virus and how science was employed to lend it legitimacy. The article concludes by reviewing how the idea of science as a truth knowledge is used to construct a particular viewpoint, one focused on legitimizing the outbreak containment measures taken by the Chinese government.

AB  - Although both events were fundamentally acts of contestation led by different segments of France's youth, the fall 2005 riots and the spring 2006 CPE protests received very different treatment in French public opinion. Whereas the riots were overwhelmingly condemned, the protests were not only tolerated but also often celebrated. By examining dominant interpretations of these events circulated in the news media alongside those of young people collected during a year of fieldwork in the public housing projects of a medium-sized French city, this paper shines light on fundamental French values and beliefs about how society ought to work while also contributing to ongoing debates about the cultural identity of such youth. More generally, it demonstrates the usefulness of comparison in the analysis of acts of political dissent.

AB  - Journalists rely on polls as they cover public opinion. In order to provide perspectives within the news stories, journalists frequently quote pundits - expert and partisan - who evaluate the methodological quality and implications of the numbers. While partisan pundits might attack unfavorable polls as biased and even fake, experts typically provide rational assessments of methodological quality; news readers may also encounter critiques of the reliability of polls in general in op-eds. How do Americans evaluate polls when they come accompanied with such commentaries? Building on evidence that individuals perceive polls in biased ways, this study examines whether and how individuals react to pundit commentary and whether such commentary can increase or decrease partisan bias in evaluations. In a nationally representative survey experiment fielded during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, we exposed 2,078 individuals to news stories about polls that included various expert or partisan comments. Although commentaries shifted perceptions of the polls, they did little to mitigate or amplify news readers' biases. We conclude that poll commentary is not an effective tool for mitigating bias. Implications for public perceptions, corrective attempts against biased processing of statistical information in news reports, and journalistic coverage at large are discussed.

AB  - Chief Caupolican is Emile Barrangon, an early 20th-century performer in the US who was born in Chile to an indigenous Mapuche father and a French mother. Despite his fame, he has not yet been included in studies on indigenous agency in Native American representations, likely because of his immigrant origins. We situate his indigenous self-identification and media success within the broader context of ongoing pan-indigenous activism in the country and Native Americans' efforts to engage indigenous representations in the media. The pan-indigenous movement that sought to unify indigenous political claims, regardless of tribal affiliation, enabled and encouraged foreign-born aborigines and persons of mixed ancestry to identify with indigeneity in ways that transcend nation-state borders. By presenting and examining his multi-faceted life, performance, and political views, this article contributes to better understanding the complex dynamics of the indigenous performance landscape in the early 20th century.

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SCIENCE POLITIQUE
LA  - English
AB  - The novel coronavirus reached the United States and Canada almost at the same time. The first reported American case was January 20, 2020, and in Canada it was January 15, 2020 (Canada, 2020; Holshue et al., 2020). Yet, the response to this crisis has been different in the two countries. In the US, President Donald Trump, prominent Republicans, and conservative media initially dismissed the dangers of COVID-19 (Stecula, 2020). The pandemic became politicized from the early days, and even though Trump and Republicans have walked back many of their initial claims, there continue to be media reports of partisan differences in public opinion shaped by that early response. At the same time, the response in Canada has been mostly characterized by across-the-board partisan consensus among political elites (Merkley et al., 2020).

AB  - Viral influence of consumer reviews can change the strategic intent of co-branding relationships between minority entrepreneurial startups and established corporations. When social justice positioning is involved, the intent is often to support minority businesses. We acknowledge this strategy as social justice branding. However, such alliances can trigger vitriolic responses. This backlash is an expression of free speech, and social media provides an obscure facilitative environment. The challenges of social justice branding are complex. We examine consumer online reviews of The Honey Pot and Target Corporation partnership, to understand the implications of social justice branding in practice. Using Leximancer analysis, we find that social justice branding elicits multiple emotions that empower action. Some consumers accepted the collaboration while others resisted. Analyzing the basis of the resistance revealed some consumers expressed racist and shameful behaviors displaying disagreement. Backlash reflected willful ignorance releasing pent up prejudices and disseminating viral-like negative information as weapons of retaliation against brands and marginalized communities. We contribute a conceptual model integrating theoretical frames of social justice, social marketing, brand activism and free speech elucidating the impact of consumer response to social justice branding. The findings and model add a lens to further explore race in the marketplace.

AB  - The UK's second nationwide referendum, held in May 2011, offers rich opportunities for analysing the dynamics of a referendum campaign. The articles gathered together in this symposium address three themes. The first concerns the determinants and dynamics of public opinion during a referendum campaign, the second relates to the potential for interaction between the referendum and simultaneous elections, and the third focuses on coverage of the referendum in the media. Following a brief outline of the background to the referendum, this paper introduces the contribution that each article makes to these themes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Whereas the preponderance of studies on public appeals evaluates their impacts on mass public opinion, we investigate behavioral responses-in particular, the willingness of donors to contribute to candidates for public office. As appeals, we identify and code the online messages from all 2018 candidates for Congress, winners and losers alike, about both Donald Trump himself and his signature policy initiative, immigration reform; and as behavioral responses, we track candidates' daily itemized fundraising totals. What Republican candidates for Congress say about Trump, we find, bears significantly on their ability to raise money. In the immediate aftermath of complimenting the president, Republicans secured a modest increase in fundraising; when they criticized him, however, they promptly suffered a substantial decline. We do not observe comparable evidence for Democratic candidates. Our findings are robust to a wide variety of measurement and modeling strategies, and expand our understanding of the political stakes of public appeals.

AB  - A nationally representative telephone survey (n = 1,006) was conducted to understand how different groups of Singaporeans regard the issue of climate change and their inclination toward action in dealing with it. We measured attitudes, knowledge, and perceptions of the problem of climate change and the role of various stakeholders in addressing it. The data were subjected to a latent class analysis to produce three distinctive segments of the population: the concerned, the disengaged, and the passive. These segments stand in contrast to those discovered in the United States, Australia, Germany, and India and suggest different strategies for public engagement campaigns. The results also clarify the need to account for national idiosyncrasies when promoting adaptation to, or mitigation of, climate change in different parts of the world.

AB  - This online experiment explored how contextual information embedded in new media channels such as YouTube may serve as normative social cues to users. Specifically, we examined whether the number of views listed under a YouTube video about climate change would elicit inferences regarding how others feel about the climate issue and, consequently, might influence perceptions of issue salience. Participants in this experiment were exposed to a YouTube video about climate change using two experimental conditions, one providing a small number of views under the video and the second listing a large number of views. Results suggest that the number of views cue did, indeed, influence participant perceptions of the importance assigned by other Americans to the issue of climate change. Further, compared to low self-monitoring participants, high self-monitoring participants registered an increase in their own judgment of issue importance.

AB  - Can Twitter data complement or supplement measures of economic confidence? This possibility was proposed in early work suggesting that sentiment surrounding the word "jobs" on Twitter closely tracked survey measures of consumer confidence. The current study uses knowledge of the processes generating Twitter data to develop and test hypotheses for when social media and survey data might align, and thus when social media processes may reflect survey measures. We expect and find the greatest correspondence when Twitter data were used to predict perceptions of recent societal economic change, rather than the aggregations of pocketbook economic experiences or reports of the state of the economy. In contrast to the concerns many scholars have raised about nonprobability data sources, the results suggest that correspondence between Twitter data and survey data did not depend on how similar Twitter users were to the population. Finally, we find evidence that the correspondences that did emerge were highly variable over time and appeared to be induced in the presence of economic volatility, suggesting that consistent long-scale trends may not be driven by consistent small-scale mechanisms.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to identify the structural processes that lead citizens to escape their common social circles when talking about politics and public affairs (e.g. "filter bubbles"). To do so, this study tests to what extent political attitudes, political behavior, news media consumption and discussion frequency affect discussion network heterogeneity among US citizens. Design/methodology/approach Supported by the polling group Nielsen, this study uses a two-wave panel online survey to study the antecedents and mechanisms of discussion network heterogeneity among US citizens. To test the hypotheses and answer the research questions, ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions (cross-sectional, lagged and autoregressive) and mediation analyses were conducted. Findings The findings imply that political discussion frequency functions as the key element in explaining the mechanism that leads politically interested and participatory citizens (online) as well as news consumers of traditional and online media to seek a more heterogeneous discussion network, disrupting the so-called "filter bubbles." However, mediation analyses also showed that discussion frequency can lead to more homogenous discussion networks if people score high on political knowledge, possibly reflecting the formation of a close network of political-savvy individuals. Originality/value The survey data give important insights into the 2016 pre-election situation, trying to explain why US citizens were more likely to remain in homogenous discussion networks when talking about politics and public affairs. By using two-wave panel data, the analyses allow to draw tentative conclusions about the influential and inhibiting factors and mechanisms that lead individuals to seek/avoid a more heterogeneous discussion network.

AB  - This bilingual, cross-national study analyzes stories about the Colombian peace process that were engaged with on social media to understand the use of peace and war framing in news reporting. Using content analysis as a method, this paper operationalized Galtung's classification of peace journalism and follows framing methodological adjustments and improvements suggested by previous peace journalism scholars. Results show that, even during peace talks, media use war narratives more often than peace frames, and social media users amplify more war than peace-oriented content. Proximity to conflict also was shown to be an important factor, as Colombian media used more war frames than foreign media. These findings are relevant for their implications about how national media consistently emphasized a war frame that social media users amplified, which we argue has implications for how citizens viewed the Colombian peace process, ultimately potentially influencing the decision to vote down the referendum.

AB  - In the past few years, millions have been forced to leave their homes seeking refuge in other countries, most displaced from Muslim majority countries. The inflow of refugees and recent terrorist attacks in Europe may have reinforced prejudice against Muslim immigrants in Europe. Research on these issues is almost non-existent in Iceland. Using a random sample of 3.360 individuals in late 2019 and a survey-based experimental design, we address several questions related to attitudes towards Muslim immigrants and refugees in Iceland. Our results indicate that just over half of the population is willing to accept more refugees than is currently done and does not want to limit the proportion of Muslims among them. Notwithstanding, about 44% of the public believe that the risk of terrorism will increase if Iceland accepts more immigrants from Muslim majority countries. Political orientation and education are associated with attitudes toward refugees, an association that is partly mediated through stereotypes of Muslims as a security threat. The findings also show that people who are informed that research finds no link between the number of Muslim immigrants and the risk of terrorism are less likely to stereotype Muslim immigrants as a security threat than people who get no such information. This type of information has similar effects on people irrespective of their political orientation. Consequently, the current study does not support the proposition that right-leaning individuals in Iceland are more distrustful of scientific in-yformation than those on the left. The effects are, however, significantly contingent on education.

AB  - The global reach of mass media leaves few unexposed to Western ideals and ideas, which privilege White and Eurocentric images. Through a combination of visual and narrative stereotypes, ads, movies, print media and television distribute implicit messages about how humans should be viewed, categorized and commented on based on their perceived social identity. This juggernaut of disproportional representation ensures that people exposed to implicit messages will unconsciously absorb and accept them. Drawing on the engaged scholarship of the first author and interviews with strangers, this manuscript explores the ways in which an intentional and inclusive combining of the same elements of visuals and narratives can be utilized to problematize one-dimensional stereotypes, create space for unlearning biased social messages, and provide an alternative method of seeing others and ourselves. This work demonstrates how Author 1 promoted her anti-racist White identity development while simultaneously supplanting stereotypical images of individuals with diverse lived experiences with complex, person-centered oral histories and portraits that serve as compelling counter-narratives.

AB  - This research article provides insight into the issue of the effect of cyber communication threats on online freedom of expression. Victims of cyber communication threats may avoid expressing themselves on cyber communication technology. This study quests for the rate of cyber communication threats faced by students having a relationship with how freely they express their views about political and social issues in online spaces. The study interviewed 800 students from six leading universities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan over a closed-ended questionnaire. Hypotheses were tested through statistical procedures. Results revealed that the hypothesis is partially accepted. Results also suggested that that cyber harassment and online identity theft harm online freedom of expression about political and social views while receiving unwanted material, hacking, and viruses showed positive correlation and having a positive effect on online freedom of expression about political and social views.

AB  - Because of their recognition as a comprehensive tool of environmental assessments and their increasing use by governments and industries, life cycle assessments (LCAs) are positioned to be prominent sources of mass media information on new products and technologies. The LCA studies underlying media reports are often viewed by nonexperts after the initial reporting. However, uncertainty is rife in early assessments of emerging technologies, and LCA's ability to inform environmental opinions and decisions is limited without the accompanying communication on uncertainty. Though approaches to the technical aspects of uncertainty analysis in LCA are available in the literature, those on communicating that uncertainty, in ways that are cognitively accessible to the nonexperts, are still lacking despite their highlighted importance across various disciplines. With the focus on communication, this article uses the existing literature to derive five criteria for making uncertainty communication accessible to a nonexpert audience. Then, LCAs on engineered nanomaterial (ENM) and ENM-enabled products, as a case study of emerging technologies where uncertainties abound, are reviewed for whether they meet these five criteria. The study concludes with recommendations for communicating uncertainty in LCAs in order to enhance their role as decision- and public opinion-informing assessments.

AB  - This article analyses the visibility of European Union (EU) citizens in EU news during the 2009 European Parliament election. It argues that the presence of EU citizens in EU news is vital for responsiveness of European governance. First, the theoretical notion of EU citizens is considered. Next, a new way of defining EU citizens is proposed: EU citizens are divided into national and supranational EU citizens. The visibility of EU citizens in EU news of 27 EU member states is analysed aiming to explain cross-country differences. The paper is based on a large-scale content analysis of TV and newspaper articles gathered during the 2009 European Parliament election. To explain different levels of visibility, a multi-level analysis is carried out. The results suggest that EU citizens are visible in the EU news, yet, their presence strongly varies across countries. The findings indicate that explanations for different levels of visibility can be found at both the media and country level.

AB  - Two experiments carried out in Spain and the Netherlands tested the joint effects of imagined contact and similarity with a narrative protagonist on attitudes and behavioral intentions related to stigmatized immigrants. We advance a concept of optimal reception condition: imagining a positive interaction with an immigrant before reading a testimonial of an immigrant who is similar to the native audience. The optimal reception condition induced greater identification and transportation than the reference condition, leading to more positive attitudes and a higher intention of intergroup contact. The findings are discussed in the context of research on narrative persuasion and prejudice reduction.

AB  - This study examines the impact of China's growing territorial ambitions on Japanese public opinion. By experimentally manipulating perceived territorial threats from China, we tested two potential mechanisms of increased support for a conservative incumbent leader in Japan. The first is the "rally 'round the flag" model, in which threats universally boost support for the leader through emotion. The second is the "reactive liberal" model, in which support from conservatives remains constant, but threatened liberals move toward supporting the conservative leader. Two survey experiments provided no support for the emotion-based "rally 'round the flag" model. but they lent support for the reactive liberal model in explaining the impact on Japanese public opinion. However, the second experiment indicated that priming with an image of the prime minister that highlights his role as the supreme commander of the national defense forces completely eliminated the gain in approval rates among liberals.

AB  - This study uses a hierarchical statistical model to explore what drives African attitudes toward foreign countries, an understudied and underappreciated topic in the fields of African studies, political psychology and international relations. Enabled by increasing access to information, technology and resources, African peoples across the continent are directing their national stages like never before. Yet when it comes to international engagements on the continent, there is little scholarly focus on African sentiment toward foreign countries. The present study finds that the drivers of attitudes toward foreign countries vary, depending on which foreign country is under consideration by the respondent. For China, positive sentiment is associated with individuals who report having assets, belong to the president's party, view domestic governance positively, are more politically interested, are more trusting, are educated and are more frequent news consumers. While political interest, trust, education, news consumption and positive evaluation of domestic governance also correspond to positive attitudes toward the USA, so does being employed and perceiving the domestic government as corrupt. When it comes to attitudes toward former colonies, trust, education, news consumption, positive evaluations of domestic governance, perceiving the domestic government as corrupt, employment, identification with the president's party and support for democracy are associated with positive sentiment. For China, the USA and former colonies, negative sentiment is associated with individuals who identify as Muslim.

AB  - This article will examine how the media reported the 2011 election campaign in Turkey in comparison to the 2007 elections. In order to reflect the different ideological segments within the society (pro-secular, nationalist vs religious-conservative), four newspapers - Zaman, Cumhuriyet, Hurriyet and Posta - are chosen. The empirical evidence suggests that there are similarities between the analysis of the 2011 elections and the previous research findings of the 2007 elections with regard to the topics garnered, the main themes and the absence of the European Union-membership-related narratives. Yet, we also observe a major difference in the 2011 elections. The themes of the contestation between competing party programmes, values, and issue positions have shifted away from the secularism and Islam to the daily politics such as the economic progress, the military operations, the terrorist attacks, the corruption allegations and the Kurdish issue.

AB  - This study examines a year of major coverage of hate crimes across select United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) newspapers. Historically, scholars have gained valuable insights into American perceptions pertaining to crime through a critical examination of American newspaper's reportage of crime. The central argument of this research is that the amount of press coverage of hate crimes isa determining factor in the formation of public perceptions, values, attitudes, and behaviors regarding hate crimes in the short run as well as in the long run. Previous studies reveal the existence of a unidirectional relationship between both news content and public opinion regarding social issues. The findings of this study suggest that the print media in the UK reports more stories of hate crimes than the print media in the US. The author concluded that the UK's more stringent laws regarding hate crimes might have contributed to the greater amount of print media coverage of hate crimes in the country.

AB  - With the quick penetration of Internet applications, online media have become an important carrier of public opinions. The opinions and comments expressed by young college students-one of the most active netizen groups-on the Internet have turned out to be an essential part of the online public opinions in colleges and universities. However, the existing systems generally employ simple statistical methods to analyze the effect of online public opinions on the image and reputation development of colleges and universities without taking account of other factors, such as the hotness characteristics of online public opinions and semantic information. Therefore, on the basis of Public Opinion Hotness Index and time series-based trend analysis, as well as the topics extracted using the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model, this study aims to improve the analysis performance on the online public opinions in colleges and universities using short-term trend prediction results. The experience and lessons learned from a real case may provide strong data support and feasible suggestions for colleges and universities in analyzing and guiding the online public opinions.

AB  - I examine the role of Occupy Wall Street in shifting presidential and congressional discourse on economic fairness and inequality. Using data from 4646 presidential speeches and 1256 congressional records from 2009 to 2015, I test different mechanisms, including repression, media coverage, public opinion, and presidential agenda-setting by applying a novel combination of web scraping, natural language processing, and time series models. I suggest that movement success can be measured in its ability to shape discursive opportunity structures, and I argue that the role of the president should be at the forefront of social movements research. Ultimately, I demonstrate (1) that the repression of Occupy protesters not only predicts media coverage but also increases discursive opportunities through President Obama and Congress, (2) that media coverage of Occupy predicts presidential discourse, (3) that the president's rhetorical shift increases congressional response, and (4) that this change persists after the movement faltered.

AB  - Nanotechnology cannot be directly experienced and observed-all that people know about it and their interpretations and opinions are mainly based on information from the mass media. Therefore, this first systematic study of the German media coverage about nanotechnology aims to analyse the media frames of this emerging technology. It comprises a standardized content analysis of nine print media from 2000 to 2008, which shows that the German media framing is predominantly very positive, specifically emphasizing the medical and economic benefits of nanotechnology. There is hardly any critical coverage opposing this one-sided perspective of progress. This result corresponds to the international media coverage.

A textual analysis was employed, and resulted in the identification of 5 frames: fandom, riot propagation, global perspectives, shame on Vancouver, and real fans vs. idiots. The identification of these frames illustrated Twitter's role as a source of news and information, and also an outlet for shaping public opinion and cultural perception. Twitter provided the opportunity to counter public perceptions of Canadian hockey fans and the rioters through displays of dissociation, embarrassment, remorse, and comparisons to substantial global events of political unrest.

AB  - Starting in 2008, debate about potential hazardous effects from exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) migrated from the pages of scientific journals to the U.S. media, regulatory authorities, and state legislatures. In the context of deep scientific conflict about the existence of adverse health effects attributable to BPA, this article asks why it was the case that some state legislatures considered or adopted legislative bans on products made from BPA, whereas others did not. Drawing on existing theories of agenda-setting and policy change via punctuated equilibrium as well as a well-defined methodology (event history analysis), evidence of agenda-setting is presented. Particularly, it is argued that routine and high-impact health coverage was significantly related to the chance that a state legislature considered legislation banning products made with BPA. This was indirectly, but importantly, related to the actual adoption by state legislatures of legislative bans on products made with BPA.

AB  - Recently, social media has been considered the fastest medium for information broadcasting and sharing. Considering the wide range of applications such as viral marketing, political campaigns, social advertisement, and so on, influencing characteristics of users or tweets have attracted several researchers. It is observed from various studies that influential messages or users create a high impact on a social ecosystem. In this study, we assume that public opinion on a social issue on Twitter carries a certain degree of emotion, and there is an emotion flow underneath the Twitter network. In this article, we investigate social dynamics of emotion present in users' opinions and attempt to understand (i) changing characteristics of users' emotions toward a social issue over time, (ii) influence of public emotions on individuals' emotions, (iii) cause of changing opinion by social factors, and so on. We study users' emotion dynamics over a collection of 17.65M tweets with 69.36K users and observe 63% of the users are likely to change their emotional state against the topic into their subsequent tweets. Tweets were coming from the member community shows higher influencing capability than the other community sources. It is also observed that retweets influence users more than hashtags, mentions, and replies.

TI  - Making and Breaking Party Leaders? An Informational Theory of Temporary and Lasting Impacts of Prime Minister Debates in Spain

KW  - ELECTIONS
KW  - COVERAGE
KW  - MODEL
AB  - Objective. In this project, we develop an informational theory that identifies which prime minister debates are the most meaningful in terms of shifting Spanish public opinion. We argue that debates immediately following the installation of new leaders (because they shine light on leadership traits) and debates occurring in times of crisis (because voters can judge both the leader's ability to remedy the problems and their policy proposals) will have the largest short-and long-term effects. Methods. We use seemingly unrelated regression to explore the impacts of 15 Spanish State of the Nation debates from 1998 to 2016 on vote intention for Partido Popular (PP) and the Partido Socialista Obrero Espanol (PSOE). Result. Debates following the installation of new party leaders often produce sizable improvements in vote intention, but the most meaningful debates occur during economic crises. Conclusion. Parliamentary debates are valuable opportunities for party leaders to shift public opinion in their favor, a fact that is not lost to them considering the time and energy devoted to crafting strategies, and the media's fascination with providing extensive coverage of the debates. This study has important implications for the study of dynamic processes (such as vote intention), and the link between parties' strategic communications and voting behavior.

AB  - Introduction: Breakthroughs in stem cell research (SCR) and regenerative medicine (RM) have attracted significant public attention worldwide. Simultaneously, scientific communities and science policies have tried to establish appropriate governance of SCR and RM. In this context, effective communication between scientific communities and the public is regarded as a key factor. However, the diversity of public attitudes and interests has not been sufficiently examined, especially the differences across countries. Methods: We conducted an international comparison of public attitudes toward SCR and RM. We circulated an internet questionnaire among people in six countries: Japan, South Korea, the United States, the UK, Germany, and France. We collected 100 valid responses from each country, and a total of 600 responses were obtained. Results: Our key findings are the diversity of interests in RM, which can be expressed as user pragmatism, governance and handling of RM, risk, and benefit, and scientific interests. The priority of interests varied across the six countries, and the variations may be influenced by the political, social, cultural, and media contexts of SCR and RM in each country. Conclusion: The implications can contribute to a deeper understanding of the diversity of public attitudes, and bring about an appropriate examination of a wide range of ethical and social concerns of SCR and RM in global contexts. ?? 2022, The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine.

TI  - TV NEWS AND "WHITE VOICES": DAGSREVYENS COVERAGE OF THE GAZA WAR
T2  - JAVNOST-THE PUBLIC
LA  - English
AB  - The media blockade imposed by Israel during its 22-day invasion of Gaza in December 2008 - January 2009 barred foreign reporters from entering Gaza. Eye witness reports were restricted to the invading Israeli military and to Palestinian and Arab journalists in Gaza. The blockade influenced media coverage and public opinion around the world. Two Norwegian aid workers and medical doctors managed to enter Gaza on the fifth day of the war to work at the Hamas-controlled Al Shifa Hospital. As the only Western doctors, they were interviewed repeatedly by global media. They frequently appeared also in Norwegian media, including Dagsrevyen, the prime time evening TV news of NRK - The Norwegian State Broadcasting Corporation. They attributed their media appearances to their "white voices," i.e. local Palestinian and Arab voices were less interesting to Western media. Drawing on framing theory, content analysis and interviews, we first discuss possible bias and framing in Dagsrevyen's coverage of the Gaza War as it ran its course. We also reflect on post-war developments, before addressing the two Norwegian doctors and their media relations during and after the war. Were their interactions with the media "source-driven journalism," and how justified is their "white voices"claim?

AB  - Exponential growth in mobile technology and mini computing devices has led to a massive increment in social media users, who are continuously posting their views and comments about certain products and services, which are in their use. These views and comments can be extremely beneficial for the companies which are interested to know about the public opinion regarding their offered products or services. This type of public opinion otherwise can be obtained via questionnaires and surveys, which is no doubt a difficult and complex task. So, the valuable information in the form of comments and posts from micro-blogging sites can be used by the companies to eliminate the flaws and to improve the products or services according to customer needs. However, extracting a general opinion out of a staggering number of users' comments manually cannot be feasible. A solution to this is to use an automatic method for sentiment mining. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the widely used classification techniques for polarity detection from textual data. This study proposes a technique to tune the SVM performance by using grid search method for sentiment analysis. In this paper, three datasets are used for the experiment and performance of proposed technique is evaluated using three information retrieval metrics: precision, recall and f-measure.

AB  - Do social cohesion activities change the attitudes of the participants? This paper uses intergroup contact theory to explore attitude change resulting from contact with out-group(s) in social cohesion activities. Results from a pre-test/post-test design with fifty-five participants in two bicommunal camps in Cyprus show how attitudes change at the immediate end of these activities; an analysis of fourteen participants' comments after one, thirteen, and twenty-five months provides a medium-to long-term assessment of attitude change. Not all participants were completely positive towards the other community before they took part, as assumed by some. There is clearly space for impact in terms of attitude change. Social cohesion activities represent indispensable tools for reducing prejudice and improving relationships between former enemies in post-conflict countries.

AB  - Twitter has become a fertile place for rumors, as information can spread to a large number of people immediately. Rumors can mislead public opinion, weaken social order, decrease the legitimacy of government, and lead to a significant threat to social stability. Therefore, timely detection and debunking rumor are urgently needed. In this work, we proposed an Attention-based Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network that uses tweet text with thirteen different linguistic and user features to distinguish rumor and non-rumor tweets. The performance of the proposed Attention-based LSTM model is compared with several conventional machine and deep learning models. The proposed Attention-based LSTM model achieved anF(1)-score of 0.88 in classifying rumor and non-rumor tweets, which is better than the state-of-the-art results. The proposed system can reduce the impact of rumors on society and weaken the loss of life, money, and build the firm trust of users with social media platforms.

AB  - This paper investigates the representation of university students in the collective Italian imaginary during '68 through the contemporary articles published in La Stampa and Stampa Sera describing the student uprisings at the University of Turin (Italy). The paper draws on a large amount of articles published in the daily newspapers La Stampa and Stampa Sera (nearly 400, from January to June 1968, the most dynamic phase of the protests) to highlight how journalists constructed the narrative of the rebellion by criticising the image of the rebel students, using words loaded with negative meanings and delegitimising their claims without any effort to understand their motivations. The image of the students that emerges from the articles over the period of time considered is negative, constructed to underline the destructive nature of the demonstrations against the political and social system of Italy in the 1960s. There was an unfailing tendency to highlight the rioting, disturbance of lessons, and physical and verbal attacks against teachers and the police, and the language used were reminiscent of that employed in times of war. The daily national press of the time is a rich source of material, with considerable interpretative and explanatory potential; in reconstructing the events day by day, it enables us to conduct an in-depth investigation into the ideology and the imaginary at play in a given space and time. It explores corners of the history of education that escape official recording and reveals the focus of interest and the priorities of the media groups.

AB  - This study of the U.S.-China trade war investigated how Beijing (a) uses institutional discourse and rhetoric to conceptualize digital public diplomacy based on the autocratic system of the Communist Party of China and (b) legitimizes its highly centralized and politicized international communication practices. We also investigated how China's domestic public diplomacy practices affect its international communication. Comparing the online activities of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs domestically (i.e., Weibo) and internationally (i.e., Twitter) revealed (a) that China first centralizes and politicizes communication content production and distribution to ensure that all messages follow the desired political direction and promote the desired value orientation; and (b) that, although inspired by the network communication perspective, Beijing's digital public diplomacy emphasizes advocacy and narrative, ignores listening and exchange, and does not seek mutual cross-cultural adaptation. Digital public diplomacy is an instrument that serves China's internal affairs, controlling and guiding domestic public opinion online to defend Communist Party of China leadership.

AB  - National identity is the cognition of citizens regarding to which political community they belong, and the tendency to accept the political, cultural and ethnic values of the state. Previous studies have found that national identity is heterogeneous at the subnational levels. Why do people hold different degrees of nationalism and patriotism in the subnational units? In this paper, we offer a political economic explanation of national identity, which links the state capacity with political attitudes. We employ a nationalism-patriotism framework to decompose the concept of national identity, then use the supervised learning approach to measure nationalism and patriotism based on a massive number of Weibo posts dating from 2011 to 2017. Automated text analysis shows that the state capacity plays an important role preventing the national identity from being weakened by globalization and the diversity of social information. Specifically, with the progress of China's globalization, multiculturalism and various information have crossed the national boundaries, which undermines China's national identity. In order to maintain this identity, the Chinese government utilizes its redistribution capacity to reinforce both nationalism and patriotism, and also its information capacity to strengthen nationalism.

AB  - In the article, the author uses a sociocultural approach to analyze debates in the US press that accompanied "Russian celebrations" in 1813. During the War of 1812, the Federalist opposition to President Madison's administration organized several celebrations of Russia's victories over Napoleon, who was a de facto ally of the USA in its war against England. As a result, harsh debates arose about the relative merits of the Russian nation. Madison's supporters described Russia in extremely critical terms, while the critics of the administration mostly spoke positively of the distant country. For both sides, the Russian victories were just a pretext for formulating their own political views, but by using an image of "the Other," they elaborated and affirmed two major characterizations of Russia: in one view, it was a barbaric and uncivilized country; in the other, a guarantor of liberty and a rapidly developing and freedom-loving nation. The main difference was summarized in a pamphlet publication of correspondence between Robert Harper and Robert Walsh. The article affirms that the level of civilization in Russia was not just used as an argument in domestic polemics, but was determined according to the demands of that polemic.
