T1  - Hashtagged Trolling and Emojified Hate against Muslims on Social Media
AN  - 2679827097
AB  - This empirical exploratory study examines a number of insulting hashtags used against Islam and Christianity on Twitter and Instagram. Using a mixed method, the findings of the study show that Islam is more aggressively attacked than Christianity by three major communities, unlike Christianity, which is targeted much less by two main online groups. The online discussion around the two religions is politically polarized, and the negative language especially used against Islam includes the strategic use of hashtags and emojis, which have been weaponized to communicate violent messages and threats. The study is situated within the discussion of trolling and hateful content on social media. Aside from the empirical examination, the study refers to the differences in Twitter’s and Instagram’s policies, for the latter does not allow using hashtags such as #f***Christians and #f***Muslims, unlike Twitter, which accepts all types of hashtags to be used.

TT  - Análisis del discurso de odio en función de la ideología: Efectos emocionales y cognitivos
AN  - 2642950866
AB  - El discurso de odio constituye un importante problema, especialmente en el entorno político, donde genera polarización y conflicto social. No existen trabajos experimentales de laboratorio que hayan analizado sus mecanismos de acción empleando registros biométricos para evaluar la emoción negativa implícita provocada por estos discursos, a pesar de la importancia esencial de la emoción en este problema. El objetivo de este trabajo es investigar, en una muestra universitaria, la interacción entre la ideología del emisor y el receptor (progresista vs. conservador) y el tipo de mensaje (odio vs. no-odio) sobre las cogniciones (percepción de credibilidad del mensaje y del emisor) y la emoción negativa (biométrica y auto-informada). La emoción biométrica se evaluó mediante registros de la variabilidad intercardíaca y la respuesta dermoeléctrica. Los resultados destacan la importancia de evaluar las respuestas biométricas implícitas que revelan datos inaccesibles con otras metodologías: los conservadores muestran mayor emoción en sus registros biométricos que en los auto-informados. También se detectan, con estas medidas, efectos de desensibilización del odio en ambas audiencias. Con medidas auto-informadas, se detecta mayor emoción negativa en las audiencias progresistas solo cuando el emisor es contrario a su ideología. En cambio, los conservadores manifiestan menor emoción negativa en todos los casos. Se interpretan estos resultados como consecuencia de la presión normativa y de sesgos endogrupales de conformidad.Alternate abstract:Hate speech is a major problem, especially in the political environment, where it generates polarization and social conflict.

This work investigates the interaction between the ideology of the source and the audience (progressive vs. conservative) and the type of message (hate vs. non-hate) on cognitions (perception of the veracity of the message and the source) and negative emotion (biometric and self-reported). Biometric emotion was assessed by recording heart rate variability and electrodermal response. The results highlight the importance of evaluating implicit biometric responses that reveal inaccessible data with other methodologies: conservatives show more emotion in their biometric records than in self-reported ones. 'With these measures, hate desensitization effects are also detected in both audiences. 'With self-reported measures, more negative emotion is detected in progressive audiences only when the source is contrary to their ideology; on the other hand, conservatives show less negative emotion in all cases. These results are interpreted as a consequence of normative pressure and endogroup cognitive biases.

T1  - Is It Terrorism?: Public Perceptions, Media, and Labeling the Las Vegas Shooting
AN  - 2626052864
AB  - When a mass casualty event occurs, why do some people label it terrorism while others do not? People are more likely to consider an attack to be terrorism when the perpetrator is Muslim, yet it is unclear what other factors influence perceptions of mass violence. Using data collected from a national sample of U.S. adults shortly after the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, we examine how media consumption and social identity influence views of the attack. Media consumption and individual-level factors—Islamophobia, political ideology, and other participant demographics—influence how people view the attack and how confident people are in their assessments.

T1  - The plight of racialised minorities during a pandemic: migrants and refugees in Italy and Australia
AN  - 2625203347
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to draw on data from interviews with six Italian migrant service providers and media stories in Italy and Australia to weave a comparative snapshot of the plight of precarious migrant and refugee communities in these two countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.Design/methodology/approachThe article draws attention to prejudicial shortcomings towards vulnerable migrant communities enacted by the states of Italy and Australia in response to COVID-19.FindingsWhile the unequal ecology of the pandemic has flared up the need for the State to strengthen participation and inclusion policies, it has also provided opportunities to foreground the disadvantages vulnerable communities face that also demand policy attention and sustained funding. Governments in migrant-receiving countries like Australia and Italy need to articulate culturally sensitive and inclusive responses that foreground agencies give vulnerable migrants, asylum seekers and refugees clear, supportive messages of solidarity leading to practical solutions.Originality/valueThis paper relays preliminary data from the coalface (migrant service providers) and media as the pandemic evolved in the two countries, whose support mechanisms had never before been critically compared and evaluated through the lens of racial inequality in the face of a health and social crisis.

T1  - What is algorithmic governance?
AN  - 2615915271
AB  - This article contributes a coherent framework to the rich literature emerging in the field of algorithmic governance while also resolving conflicting understandings. Tracing the history of algorithmic governance to the broad architecture of the universal Turing Machine, the article identifies a common thread of critical concern in the literature on algorithmic governance: the growing institutional capabilities to move contestable issues to a space of reduced negotiability, raising questions of social asymmetry, inequity, and inequality. Within the social context of algorithmic governance, the article highlights three general areas of concern where the social negotiability of processes is threatened: the problem of power (surveillance), discrimination (social bias), and identification (system identity).

T1  - <i>Be more human</i>. Is Reebok breaking women’s boundaries in sports?
AN  - 2613097134
AB  - Modern sports have increasingly acquired more social relevance, amplified as it is by the media and, especially, advertising, thereby making sports closer than ever to the average citizen. In 2015 the sports brand Reebok initiated a campaign to promote fitness by highlighting and valuing the human side of sports. The objective of this study is to analyze this campaign, assessing the existence of sexist prejudices, if any. Content analysis has been chosen as the method of study. A total of 439 images uploaded by Instagram users between January 2015 and May 2016 that were employed in Reebok’s campaign have been evaluated. The results indicate that photos of single, thin, and white women predominate. We can conclude that although the photos in Reebok’s campaign portray women in attitudes contrary to what sexist prejudices dictate – e.g. sweaty, tired – there is a clear adjustment to the canons of beauty that have traditionally been projected onto women.

T1  - Orientalism in a globalised world: Said in the twenty-first century
AN  - 2604245464
AB  - From its publication in 1978, Edward Said’s magnum opus Orientalism has generated fierce and unrelenting debates regarding its epistemology and scope, and the interpretive validity of its Western cultural representations of the self and other. Since then, however, the world has become increasingly governed by different sets of assumptions, ideologies, relations of production and reproduction, and matrixes of power relations. This article considers whether orientalism has kept its hold on Western public opinion, media presentations, political elites, and sections of the scholarly community’s mode of thinking in the current neo-liberal, globalised, digitalised and securitised world. It also considers whether its mutation has shifted to engender a paradigmatic change and argues that alongside the old-style orientalism, a more sophisticated, subtle, and up-to-date perspective has appeared. Although its emphases, concerns and methodologies might represent a certain departure from old orientalist dogmas, its objective seems to remain largely intact.

T1  - Why Do Immigrants Make Us More Authoritarian? The Impact of Direct and Normative Threat to Social Order from Outgroupers on Ingroup Authoritarianism
AN  - 2585642492
AB  - Inspired by the well-documented relationship between authoritarianism and prejudices, we tested whether a massive influx of immigrants can constitute social threats - direct (crimes, riots, violence) and normative (different norms, customs, values) - that increase ingroup authoritarian attitudes. Across two experimental studies (n1=251 and n2=230), we were able to show that both direct and normative threat to social order, originating from immigrants, lead to an increase in ingroup authoritarianism attitudes (Cohen’s d = 0.45–0.57), but do not impact the right-wing authoritarianism and cultural conservatism. The effect of threat on the rise of authoritarian attitudes was only partially and in a small degree mediated by collective security motivation. Implications for the authoritarianism-prejudices relationship and the functions of authoritarianism are discussed.

T1  - Bisexual Stereotypes Apply Differently by Body Size: An Assessment of Bisexual Prototypicality, Trait Application, and Body Size
AN  - 2638855867
AB  - We blend person perception work with queer appearance psychology to examine the relationship between body size and bisexuality. In an online survey (N = 472, Mage = 25.15, 63.8% women), we examined the specific traits associated with a range of computer-modeled bodies identified as bisexual. We found that average body sizes were perceived as most prototypical of both bisexual men and bisexual women, skinny, and fat bodies were more associated with clusters of traits that contrast with common stereotypes about bisexuality. Additionally, we found that bisexual men were associated with increased masculinity and decreased femininity relative to bisexual women, and found a general, though nonsignificant trend such that bisexual men were perceived as having heightened androcentric desire relative to women. Finally, we found evidence for the role of typicality as a mediator of perceived prejudice; less prototypical bodies tended to be perceived as experiencing greater prejudice based on body size.

T1  - Terrorists or Persecuted? The Portrayal of Islamic Nonprofits in US Newspapers Post 9/11
AN  - 2581102895
AB  - Media plays a major role in molding US public opinions about Muslims. This paper assesses the effect of 9/11 events on the US media's framing of the Muslim nonprofit sector. Overall it finds that the press was more likely to represent the Muslim nonprofit negatively post 9/11. However, post 9/11, the media framing of Muslim nonprofits was mixed. While the media was more likely to associate Muslim nonprofits and terrorism, they were also more likely to represent Muslim nonprofits as organizations that faced persecution because of Islamophobia, government scrutiny, or hate attacks against them. These media frames may have contributed to public perceptions that Muslim organizations support terrorism while also raising the alarm amongst various stakeholders that the government and the general public are persecuting the Muslim nonprofit sector.

T1  - A Stereotypical Approach towards Muslim and Islam in Australian Press: Framing Analysis of Daily Telegraph and Daily Courier Mail
AN  - 2578877568
AB  - Framing of the Muslims and Islam has been a debatable/is a contentious area of interest for researchers. This study is designed to analyze the approach of the Australian press towards the Muslims and Islam when it covers the terrorist incidents in Australia and in other part of the world, especially in the western countries. The news related to terrorist incidents and activities published during a six-month timeframe, that is, from October 2016 to March 2017, in two popular newspapers namely The Daily Telegraph (leaning towards the Liberal Party) and The Courier Mail (right-centered newspaper in its nature) was thoroughly analyzed. The major objective was to know how these newspapers frame the Muslims and Islam in their news contents when the issue of terrorism is under discussion. Despite the different political leanings of the selected newspapers, their approach towards the Muslims and Islam was found to be similar as both the dailies framed the terrorism related stories in a way to associate the Muslims and Islam with terrorism.

T1  - The representation of Islam within social media: a systematic review
AN  - 2577600859
AB  - This systematic review was carried out to provide insights into how Islam has been represented in social media; and the omissions and gaps in the synthesized literature on the topic. Two databases – Scopus and the Web of Science – were explored to collect data. Primary searches between 2010 and 2019, revealed more than 100 studies dealing with the topic of investigation. After scrutinizing abstracts and removing duplicates, 36 studies came within the research criteria and were retained for analysis. A thematic analysis was conducted for the derivation of themes. The themes that emerged were: (1) Islam as a liberal religion; (2) Islam as a religion of extremism and terrorism; (3) Islam as religion of gender discrimination; (4) Islam as a religion of collective identity; and (5) Islam as a humane religion. Although the representation of Islam in social media is wide-ranging, more empirical studies found that social media users represent Islam negatively than studies which revealed positive view of Islam by social media users.

T1  - Tipping the Scales: Effects of Gender, Rape Myth Acceptance, and Anti-Fat Attitudes on Judgments of Sexual Coercion Scenarios
AN  - 2572840821
AB  - A damaging belief exists that to become a victim of sexual violence, victims must be deemed sexually desirable. As a result, sexual violations where the victims are individuals whom society may deem as less attractive—such as overweight women—may elicit less empathy for the victim or minimize the likelihood they are believed. Yet, there is some evidence that overweight women actually report higher rates of sexual violence than women of other weight categories. Although there has been some research implicating weight biases in sexual assault cases, this has not been extended to cases of sexual coercion despite their growing share of police reports. A sample of 168 participants were recruited from Canada via social media (n = 82) and through a midsized university in Ontario, Canada (n = 86). Using a mock jury paradigm, participants responded to a vignette depicting the sexual coercion of a thin or overweight woman. Participants reported their opinions on the sexual coercion scenario, and prejudicial attitudes, using two standardized scales. Men reported greater rape myth acceptance, anti-fat attitudes, and victim responsibility and endorsed significantly more perpetrator mitigating factors and expressed more negative affect toward the victim. Participants in the overweight condition also expressed greater perpetrator sympathy, greater perpetrator mitigation, and less negative affect toward the perpetrator. These results suggest that overweight women may face additional barriers when reporting their experiences of sexual coercion, particularly to men.

T1  - Are Non-U.S. Citizens Color-Blind? The Racialization of Violent Crimes
AN  - 2562783433
AB  - The present study aims to investigate whether U.S. citizenship status influences the racialization of offenders engaged in homicide, sexual violence, and terrorism. The role of social media exposure and interracial contact are explored as additional proximal factors that may explain racialization across citizenship status. The cross-sectional online survey consisted of 729 participants enrolled at a culturally diverse northeastern university. Results suggest that non-U.S. citizens have a more color-blind perspective and are less likely to racialize crime when associating a particular race/ethnicity with violent crimes. Surprisingly, social media exposure and interracial contact were not significant contributors to racialization. Suggestions for future research and policy implications are discussed.

T1  - The ‘Scots porridge case’ of 1969: bogus discrimination, the loony state and the white backlash archive
AN  - 2673745297
AB  - In November 1969, a quite odd and ludicrous case of alleged discrimination was blown out of all proportion, perhaps wilfully, by Conservative politicians and the media in Britain, some eighteen months after Enoch Powell’s Birmingham speech. A quite high-profile issue at the time, the case has now been completely forgotten. Yet, Esteves’s article suggests that the event itself is helpful to make better sense of the British—rather than merely English—ramifications of debates on race relations and discrimination, particularly at a time of an upsurge in Scottish nationalism. More importantly, the case partakes of what Esteves calls the ‘white backlash archive’, a populist and popular repertoire that nativists—not only in Britain—draw from in order to underline that the state is inefficient and counter-productive when it tries to legislate against discrimination, as well as that ethnic minorities and immigrants get undue protection from the state authorities, even though the 1969 case itself had nothing to do with ethnic minorities or immigration.

T1  - ‘Breeders for race and nation’: gender, sexuality and fecundity in post-war British fascist discourse
AN  - 2673745291
AB  - Burnett and Richardson’s paper has two related aims. First, it develops a model of how gender is articulated within fascist and other far-right discourses based on a review of the relevant scholarship. This model is presented in the first section. Researchers have in the past suggested a gap, or even a wilful ignorance, of gender in studies of the far right, and claimed that the topic is ‘neglected’ and ‘under-researched’. This gap is to some extent held open by disciplinary, historical and definitional boundaries that work fractally to split inquiry. Burnett and Richardson have thus read the literature in a kaleidoscopic fashion, including analysis across different historical periods and country contexts, to examine how gender surfaces in various ‘fascist’ discourses. This approach covered psychoanalytical, discourse analytical, historical, art historical, literary, political and anthropological approaches to gender and fascism. The second aim of the paper is to show how the model proposed is brought into relief in a particular country context: that of the United Kingdom since the Second World War. Gender in post-war British fascism has been the subject of several important studies, though none of them have specifically traced the textual journey of key ideas and themes related to gender in mediatized far-right discourse. Building on a discourse-historical analytic approach to the development of fascist politics of this period, Burnett and Richardson argue that paying attention to gender in fascist discourse is a useful lens through which to analyse the local and historical contingencies that make one fascist discursive formation differ from another.

This community-led initiative involved trained Trust Building “Ambassadors” delivering workshops at places of work and other community settings to talk about Islam and facilitate open dialogue. Previously, the project reported trust among participants had significantly improved, but the reasons for this were not explored. In this paper, we unpack how and why trust was being built. Providing a forum that permits open dialogue between Muslims and the wider community allowed opportunities for stories and experiences to be shared, enabling negative stereotypes to be uncovered and addressed, and for mutual values to be recognised. With negative media portrayal and rise in hate crime towards minorities, this research is a promising model that has important implications to address the trust deficit seen within our society.

T1  - Digital media and identity construction: Exploring the discourse of Pakistani vloggers
AN  - 2582710809
AB  - Negative framing of the image of Muslims, especially after 9/11, has caused numerous Muslim communities to become apprehensive about the way their identity is presented in the mass media. One such community being affected by negative representations based on Islamophobia and other gender‐related stereotypes is Pakistan. As a result, these misunderstandings are being addressed through the construction of alternative and contrasting online identities by Pakistani vloggers through digital media. This paper excavates the diversified constructions of vloggers’ online identities using two theoretical approaches to explaining identity construction: micro‐hegemonies and the investment model. Nineteen Pakistani vloggers were purposively selected for the study, who were observed over a period of two years using online observations, interviews, and email conversations, adopting a digital ethnographic approach. The investigation found that the vloggers choose to portray their religious practices, Pakistani identity, and local culture and norms while simultaneously utilizing Western norms to indicate their modernity. Moreover, they regularly emphasize that they are normal, regular human beings. Hence, the paper contributes to understanding how Pakistanis present a complex, hybrid identity which counters the dominant narratives in the media.

T1  - Hiding in plain sight: Dehumanization as a foundation of white racial prejudice
AN  - 2568873131
AB  - In the media, during sporting events, in online forums, and in interpersonal interactions, whites often portray Black people as animals, especially as apes or monkeys. In this essay we consider what contemporary research on prejudice in American politics has to say about these dehumanizing portrayals of Black people. We argue that contemporary political science work has not done enough to understand both the historical roots and the continuing practices of whites' dehumanization of Black people, to the detriment of an accurate understanding of racial attitudes in the United States. To rectify this omission, we draw on the work of historians to map out a brief overview of race‐making and the dehumanizing attitudes that shaped this process. Then, we review political science literature on contemporary white attitudes toward Black people, emphasizing connections between prevailing conceptions of these attitudes and long‐standing processes of dehumanization. We conclude by charting directions for future scholarship; we seek to unsettle the mainstream of a subfield dominated by mild conceptions of racial attitudes.

T1  - The Role of Perceived Support and Perceived Prejudice in the Health of LGBT Soldiers
AN  - 2564698681
AB  - IntroductionVery little is known about factors that underlie the behavioral health status of LBGT compared with heterosexual soldiers. To address this knowledge gap, the current study explored the potential mechanistic roles of perceived prejudice and support for the LGBT community as they related to observed differences in behavioral health symptoms between LGBT and heterosexual soldiers.MethodsBetween May 10 and 12, 2016, a sample of active-duty soldiers (N = 759) completed a battery of study measures while attending an academic training institute. Latent variable models using diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) estimation were used to test for the direct and indirect effects of LGBT identity on behavioral health symptoms when treating perceived prejudice and support as simultaneous mediators.ResultsThere is no evidence for a direct effect of LGBT identity on behavioral health symptoms after accounting for the role of perceived prejudice and support. There are indirect effects of LGBT status on these behavioral health outcomes manifested through shared associations with perceived support for and prejudice against the LBGT community.ConclusionsEven though “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” is no longer an explicit guideline, there are critical differences in the experience of LGBT and heterosexual soldiers, which may explain differences in mental and behavioral health. Specifically, perceived prejudice and perceived support appear to play a mechanistic role in those differences.Policy ImplicationsThe culture of the military following the repeal of Don’t Ask Don’t Tell continues to impact both heterosexual and LGBT Soldiers. Understanding the mechanistic role culture plays in the behavioral health of LGBT Soldiers may be one means of addressing their behavioral health needs.

T1  - Anticipation of Stigma upon Parenthood Impacts Parenting Aspirations in the LGB Community in Israel
AN  - 2564698389
AB  - IntroductionThis study compared childless Israeli lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals to their heterosexual counterparts on anticipation of stigma upon parenthood and assessed its mediating role in the association between being a member of a sexual minority and lower parenting desires, intentions, and likelihood estimations.MethodsA total of 612 childless participants (174 self-reported as LGB people) ranging in age from 18 to 49 (M = 31.18, SD = 3.89) were recruited through convenience sampling between November 2019 and February 2020. They completed online questionnaires assessing their anticipation of stigma upon parenthood, parenting desires, intentions, and likelihood estimations.ResultsLGB individuals reported a higher anticipation of stigma upon parenthood than their heterosexual counterparts. The anticipation of stigma upon parenthood fully mediated the association between being a sexual minority and lower parenting desires and intentions and partially mediated the association between being a sexual minority and lower estimated likelihood of parenthood.Conclusions and Policy Implications The findings are interpreted in light of LGB possible awareness of prejudice and discrimination by local legislation that prohibits or impedes sexual minorities from pursuing parenthood. Policymakers and health professionals should be alerted to the impact of anticipation of stigma when accounting for the disparities in parenting aspirations between LGB individuals and heterosexual counterparts and its possible connections to discriminatory Israeli social policies toward LGB rights.

T1  - Lebanese adolescents’ expectations about social inclusion of peers in intergroup contexts
AN  - 2559002705
AB  - This study examined the role of group norms, group identity, age, contact, and stereotypes on youths’ decisions to include a peer in an intergroup context portraying Lebanese and American adolescents. Lebanese participants (N = 275), ages 12 and 16 years, were surveyed about expectations for inclusion of an out‐group target with similar interests or an in‐group target with different interests into their own Lebanese group or another American group. Findings indicated participants focused on shared interests, rather than national identity, when making inclusion decisions for either group and group norms mattered. Older participants expected American peers to be less inclusive towards an out‐group peer. Direct contact predicted inclusivity of out‐group American peers into one’s own Lebanese group, and indirect media‐based contact predicted expectations for inclusivity into an American out‐group. Findings have implications for interventions aimed at improving cross‐national friendships which, in turn, have the potential to reduce prejudicial attitudes.

T1  - Media Portrayals of Immigration and Refugees in Hard and Fake News and Their Impact on Consumer Attitudes
AN  - 2560493324
AB  - This study examined the effect of media portrayals of immigrants and refugees on participants’ attitudes using an experimental design. Participants included 196 male and female college students who were primed with either negative or positive media portrayals of immigrants and refugees from either hard or fake news sources, or no media portrayals. Participants then answered questions regarding immigrants, immigration policy, and Islamophobia. We hypothesized that there would be differences in participants attitudes based on experimental condition and that information presented from fake news would have a stronger effect on consumers than information presented via hard news. Factors related to participant susceptibility to media portrayals were also examined and included participant race, biological sex, social class, and political and religious affiliation. Significant differences were found based on experimental condition for viewing immigration as an economic, cultural diversity, and humanitarian benefit, as well as cognitive Islamophobia. As predicted, the effect of media portrayals, whether positive or negative, in video clips had a stronger effect on participants if the video clips originated from a fake news source. Additionally, biological sex, race, social class, and political affiliation were found to relate to participant susceptibility to media portrayals from both hard and fake news sources.

T1  - From “Oh, you’re Chinese . . . ” to “No bats, thx!”: Racialized Experiences of Australian-Based Chinese Queer Women in the Mobile Dating Context
AN  - 2583827949
AB  - This article explores racial exclusion, bias, and prejudice in the context of same-sex mobile dating, focusing on the experiences of a group of Australian-based Chinese queer women. Semi-structured in-depth interviews and participant observation were used to examine participants’ racialized experiences. The findings indicate that Western dating apps, such as Tinder, Bumble, and HER, served as crucial channels of these women’s interracial and intercultural encounters while living in Australia. However, they largely perceived these apps, and HER in particular, as White-dominated and ill-suited to their dating practices, thus reinforcing their sense of exclusion and ostracism. Although the participants frequently encountered subtle prejudice on dating apps, they experienced more blatant and aggressive forms of racism triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple factors, including their language capability, the COVID-19 pandemic, and their racial, ethnic, and diasporic identities, played an intersectional role in these women’s racialized experiences. Correspondingly, the participants developed diverse interpretations of and responses to their racialized experiences. This study reveals how the anti-Asian racism in the global West permeates the realm of queer women in the context of mobile dating. It contributes to understanding the digital dating practices and racialized experiences of queer women and the broader Chinese diaspora.

T1  - CAN WE HAVE TRUST IN HOST GOVERNMENT? SELF-ESTEEM, WORK ATTITUDES AND PREJUDICE OF LOW-STATUS EXPATRIATES LIVING IN CHINA
AN  - 2581018966
AB  - The paper aims to investigate whether trust in a host government can mitigate the negative effects caused by the social complexities facing low-status expatriates (LSEs) living in China. It models trust in host government as a mediator in the relationship between expatriates' perception of status-based prejudice and their work attitudes; it further outlines the role of self-esteem in this relationship. The study seeks to expand knowledge in the domain of expatriate management by explaining the prejudicial behavior of host country towards low-status expatriates. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze responses from LSEs in China. The results provide the evidence that perceived discrimination negatively affects expatriates' work attitudes and suggest that trust in the host government can mediate such effects. Self-esteem is found to be a significant moderator in the relationship. With this, the study empirically affirms social categorization theory, showing it to be a powerful lens through which LSE adaptability can be the behavior of host nationals towards low-status expatriates and can be further developed with regard to the adaptability of low-status expatriates.

T1  - Conversations About Opioids: Impact of the Opioid Overdose Epidemic on Social Interactions for People Who Live With Chronic Pain
AN  - 2572166597
AB  - The objective of this study was to understand the impact of the opioid overdose epidemic on the social lives of people suffering from chronic pain, focusing on interactions within their personal and professional circles. The study was based on 22 in-depth interviews with people living with chronic pain in Canada. Using thematic analysis, we documented three main impacts of the opioid overdose epidemic: (a) increased worries of people in pain and their families regarding the dangers of opioids; (b) prejudices, stigma, and discrimination faced during conversations about opioids; and (c) stigma management attempts, which include self-advocacy and concealment of opioid use. This study represents important knowledge advancement on how people manage stigma and communicate about chronic disease during everyday life interactions. By showing negative effects of the epidemic’s media coverage on the social experiences of people with chronic pain, we underscore needs for destigmatizing approaches in public communication regarding opioids.

T1  - Coping with Racial Discrimination with Collective Power: How Does Bonding and Bridging Social Capital Help Online and Offline?
AN  - 2549028497
AB  - Featuring an online experiment and content analysis of a research sample of 185 participants with different races/ethnicities, this study investigates how bridging and bonding capital online and offline (a) encourage targets of racial discrimination to seek support, (b) buffer targets’ emotional distress, and (c) facilitate assertive coping behaviors. Hierarchical regressions indicate individuals bridging with a wider range of interpersonal networks offline are more likely to seek support than those with fewer bridging ties. Online bonding helps buffer emotional distress when targets perceive the prejudiced acts encountered as less severe. Maintaining connections with diverse people offline also helps targets cope with racial discrimination assertively when the supportive messages received fail to fully validate their feelings. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - Cologne and the (un)making of transnational approaches to sexual violence
AN  - 2528410758
AB  - The sexual assaults reported on New Year’s Eve 2015 in Cologne posed major challenges to feminists struggling with the tensions and entanglements of feminism, imperialism, racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, sexism and nationalism. The aim of the present article is to examine these tensions through an analysis of the pressures framing the positionality of discourses. It examines how feminists, framed by the larger Western debates about the ‘failure of multiculturalism’ and the global Islamophobia underpinning the ‘war on terror’ era, engaged with the moral panic which pervaded the mediatization of the assaults. It argues that feminist initiatives like #ausnahmslos’, which situated anti-racism at the core of any engagement for gender equality, were a reaction to the femonationalist approach to the events pervading the media and the political debate, and attempts to counter arguments which associated the sexual assaults with cultural practices imported through (Muslim) immigration and which demanded (or condoned) stricter immigration laws and state surveillance of Muslims. Then, this article addresses the challenges posed by some feminists from Germany and from North African countries and/or with a Muslim background, who argued that the analysis of Cologne should address the religious-cultural background of the suspects. The article argues that the difficulty in engaging with their contributions in Germany derives from internal pressures, namely the risk of having their arguments co-opted by Islamophobic and anti-immigration agendas. By pointing at the role of positionality in defining priorities in a globalized world, this article addresses the constraints and potentials in developing transnational approaches to sexual violence.

T1  - Prosperous But Fearful of Falling: The Wealth Paradox, Collective Angst, and Opposition to Immigration
AN  - 2507923452
AB  - Building on growing evidence that relative economic gratification may be associated with prejudice toward minorities, such as immigrants, the question remains when and why prosperity and wealth may enhance opposition to immigration. In a correlational study (Study 1, N = 498), we show that increased fear of falling in the future (individually or collectively) is associated with greater opposition to immigration. We then experimentally studied the effects of potential (Study 2, N = 294) and actual (Study 3, N = 166) downward mobility among the relatively wealthy, as well as of relatively stagnating wealthy in the context where an initially poorer group is quickly gaining wealth over time (Study 4, N = 151). We find that fear of falling among the wealthy is associated with more opposition to immigration, mediated by collective angst. We conclude that the anticipation that the economic future looks less rosy than the present evokes collective angst, which, in turn, fuels prejudice toward immigrants.

T1  - “We are the victims of racism”: Victim categories in negotiating claims about racism against Black‐Africans in India
AN  - 2581010372
AB  - How is racism negotiated by those who are otherwise victims of racism? Social psychologists show the relevance of categorization in negotiating racism. In the present article I focus on a setting where the majority group itself can be considered a target of racism: racism against Black‐Africans in India. I examine how victim categorization of the majority group is developed and used through a membership categorization analysis of broadcast media news debates. Analysis shows that, first, victim categories complicated the use of racial prejudice as an explanation for the attacks. Second, victim categorizations were developed in relation to social groups that were removed from the present setting. These allowed for accomplishing specific actions: denials and rejections of racism, moral concerns in racism, and acceptance of Black‐Africans' claims about racism. Together, the findings show that racism can be negotiated in terms additional to racial/ethnic group membership: as victims or perpetrators of racism.

T1  - The British State’s production of the Muslim School: A simultaneity of categories of difference analysis
AN  - 2528345188
AB  - Recently, national populist politics has been translated with the emergence of two overlapping narratives of Islamophobia and anti‐EU immigration media discourses. Such discourses have been made highly visible in the increased spike in hate crimes that have been a hidden cost of the national(ist) debate about Britain leaving the European Union (Brexit). This is the context in which we can trace a remarkable shift in the state representation of the schooling of the South Asian/Muslim community and the reclassification from promoting South Asians as central to the future of a modernised multicultural Britain (1970s) to positioning Muslims as a ‘suspect community’ (2020). This article unpacks two cultural moments in the critical exploration of the State production of the Muslim School within a post‐Trojan Horse era. First, a national dominant image of the Muslim School operating within the State ascribed ‘no‐go’ ethno‐religious Muslim neighbourhoods, as a repository of regressive (extreme) Islamist religiosity; thus, reconstructing their religious belief as racialised identities, as they disconnect from British values. Second, the No Outsiders programme, with the accompanying framing of intolerant (Muslim) parents. In this case, the ensuing tension between ‘homophobic Muslims’ and ‘British values’ sets in place a homogenisation of differences. Deploying a simultaneity of categories of difference perspective, we address an underlying discursive re‐politicising of South Asian ethnic communities as religious communities, which is resulting in a perpetual negotiation of the meanings attached to being Muslim. This will enable an international application of the article beyond the specific focus on the city of Birmingham, identified in the international media as the Jihadi capital of Europe.

T1  - Claiming our Space: Muslim Women, Activism, and Social Media
AN  - 2501512274
AB  - This paper addresses the ways in which Muslim women seek to employ online media, particularly social media, to reclaim narratives around space, embodiment, and power. I argue that digital space is, like any other form of media, structured essentially by racism and patriarchy, but I also note the crucial potential for resistance exhibited by Muslim activists such as political leaders Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, Instagram influencer Ayesha Malik, and the largely anonymous women who participated in #MosqueMeToo, encouraged by the journalist and activist Mona Eltahawy. I draw upon a post/anti-colonial feminist framework and the tools of critical discourse analysis in examining specific instances where such women perform acts of resistance that, in turn, trigger a gendered and raced reaction. I note the ways in which some Muslim women, such as Saudi teenager Rahaf Mohammed, are constructed as media heroes, given that their stories can be co-opted to validate notions of the white colonial savior, while others directly challenge narratives of colonialism and oppression and are thus subjected to backlash. I point to the ways in which some of this vitriol continues to refer back to the notion that Muslim women should be silent, and to the fetishized Muslim woman's body: how it should look, where it can/should go, and what can be done to it.

T1  - Transnational Solidarity with Which Muslim Women? The Case of the My Stealthy Freedom and World Hijab Day Campaigns
AN  - 2500330456
AB  - The hijab has been the subject of public and academic debates that have polarized scholars, politicians, and activists. Opinions on veiling range widely: while some view veiling as an oppressive practice, others regard veiling as an expression of women's agency and empowerment. Solidarity practices, such as movements against compulsory veiling or actions encouraging non-Muslim women to temporarily wear the hijab, are some of the ways in which activists have tried to show solidarity with Muslim women. In this qualitative study, data from the content analysis of the online platforms of two media campaigns, together with in-depth interviews with Iranian women living in Belgium, were triangulated. Women's perceptions of two solidarity campaigns were explored: the anti–compulsory veiling movement My Stealthy Freedom and the pro-acceptance World Hijab Day campaign. The findings raise questions about the effectiveness of transnational feminist campaigning in solidarity with Muslim women and, more generally, how the notion of solidarity is conceptualized in feminist scholarship.

T1  - Gender and family rhetoric on the German far right
AN  - 2568241501
AB  - Historically, the family and, more generally, gender policies have been a central issue in both nationalist and far-right rhetoric. This holds particularly for Germany, where the so-called male-breadwinner model and the rhetoric of Kinder, Küche, Kirche (children, kitchen, church) have a long tradition. At the same time, Germany’s National Socialist past confers a negative connotation on notions of the family as a continuation of the nation. In this article, Fangen and Lichtenberg examine the family policies and views on gender roles, as well as the views on Muslims, of politicians from two German far-right parties and their youth organizations, as well as one German anti-immigrant social movement organization. Their study, based on press releases, party programmes and social media posts, adds to the growing literature on the importance of gender in nationalist and far-right politics in general, and in far-right critiques of Islam in particular. Their specific contribution is a detailed focus on the similarities and differences in various organizations on the German far right, as well as an analysis that draws on concepts such as femonationalism and, in a similar vein, Rogers Brubaker’s notion of civilizationism.

T1  - ‘I’m not a Muslim. In fact, my name is Katie.’: Muslim-drag in the C4 documentary <i>My Week as a Muslim</i>
AN  - 2507362856
AB  - In the UK Channel 4 documentary, My Week As a Muslim, an English, white woman named Katie donned a hijab, a prosthetic nose and copious amounts of brown foundation to disguise herself as a Pakistani Muslim so that she could spend a week experiencing Muslim culture and appreciate her position of white privilege. Although My Week as a Muslim was attempting to challenge many of the dominant stereotypes of Muslim women found in much of Western media, it was highly problematic in the way the entire experiment echoed the narrative conventions of cross-dressing comedy films. The documentary concluded with a final ‘reveal’ sequence where Katie removed her hijab, prosthetic nose and wiped off brown make-up to show her new Muslim friends that she merely had been performing Muslim-ness for the past week. Not only did this reinforce misconceptions that there are significant differences between British people and Islam (Katie could only pass as Muslim through the use of prosthetics and elaborate make-up) but the ‘hilarious’ reveal of the cross-dressing narrative also suggested the superiority of the Muslim-drag performer in comparison to the foolish people who were deceived by the act.

T1  - COVID-19 Stigma and Charismatic Social Relationship: A Legitimization Narrative of President Trump’s Status as a Charismatic Leader following a SARS-CoV-2 Infection Reported by the Portuguese Media
AN  - 2612840847
AB  - This concept paper aimed to understand how stigma, a concept usually associated with negative social relationships, in the context of a pandemic threat such as COVID-19 can, in some situations, structure a charismatic social relationship in a perceived positive association between stigma and a specific social characteristic. For this purpose, we used the example of the news selected and highlighted by several Portuguese media about the actions and messages developed by President Trump in the context of his infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent recovery process. These news reports gave visibility to a narrative that can be considered as reinforcing the legitimization of his condition as a charismatic leader in an electoral context marked by the pandemic threat. In conclusion, stigma associated with a pandemic health threat and generally linked to a negative social status can also reinforce admiration, trust, and belief in the charismatic leader by supporters and followers, as demonstrated with the plight of President Trump. Stigma can be a factor in social uplift in affirming an upward trajectory of social status and symbolic power for actors seen as ill, where stigma-motivated discrimination is experienced positively, unlike in most cases.

T1  - Performing Hybridity or Deflecting Islamophobia? Adaptable Identity Management amongst Young British Pakistani Muslims
AN  - 2612834823
AB  - This article engages with issues of identity construction and maintenance as expressed by a group of young British Pakistanis living in the North-West of England. Drawing on primary data from a qualitative study, we examine the ways in which Muslim identities are maintained, negotiated, and protected in relation to everyday situated cultural experiences. Nested within a context in which Islamophobia is pervasive, we discuss four salient processes of identity management articulated by participants: cherry picking; strategic adaption; ambassadorship and active resistance. Whilst these processes are to be considered as porous rather than mutually exclusive, our analysis elucidates evidence of both nimble and creative individual identity management and also an entrenchment of collective pride. We posit that, for the participants in this study, such practices constitute a grounded, pragmatic response to living in an environment in which their religious beliefs, political values and cultural commitments are frequently questioned within public life, the media and the political sphere.

T1  - Effects of Cognitive Knowledge and Intercultural Behavioral Skills on Cultural Stereotypes and Intercultural Affect: A Case of Elementary Students’ Perspective on Islam
AN  - 2612781908
AB  - Two decades have passed since the September 11 attacks by Islamist militants that shocked the world. Despite this, Islamophobia remains a common phenomenon. In Taiwan, the 2014 12-year Basic Education Curriculum amendments emphasize cultural and global understanding as core competencies. With more than 6 years of implementation, it would be therefore interesting to learn what elementary school students think of Islam. Anchoring on the concepts of intercultural competency development, stereotypes are said to be related to cognitive knowledge, intercultural behavioral abilities, and attitudes. A survey instrument was developed and validated to collect information on stereotypes, skills in intercultural interaction, and attitudes toward Islam. Additionally, cognitive knowledge of Islam was also tested. A total of 712 students participated in the study. Structural equation modelling was used to test the mediating role of cognitive knowledge and intercultural behavioral skills within the relationship between cultural stereotypes and intercultural affects. Findings show that behavioral skills alone are not enough to diminish the negative aspects of stereotypes. Importantly, it is only with the help of cognitive knowledge that the relationship between stereotypes and intercultural affects are improved. It is hoped that by understanding the importance of proper curriculum content, more sustainable coexistence can be established.

AN  - 2597847836
AB  - This article identifies and presents the main debates and issues that are generating interest in the field of creole studies. It is composed of two main sections. The first one presents the debates currently stimulating creolistics: the nature of pidgins and creoles and the relation between the two, the sociological and typological distinction between pidgins and creoles, the various theories explaining their origin, and their transformation through time. The second part raises issues linked to the social life of these languages, an area of research that, though present since the beginning of creolistics, has remained limited. Using the framework of linguistic ideology, this review surveys the social status of pidgins and creoles, the prejudices that exclude them from being used at schools, and their lack of linguistic legitimacy. It concludes with a discussion of pidgins and creoles on social media.

T1  - Political Rhetoric and Hate Speech in the Case of Shamima Begum
AN  - 2584477853
AB  - The relationship between political rhetoric and hate crime has been a topic of growing concern in recent years, with the narratives promoted by politicians widely seen as legitimating and inspiring hate crime as well as soothing or inflaming the tensions that result from antecedent hate crime events such as terrorist attacks. The potential return of so-called ‘IS bride’ Shamima Begum from a Syrian refugee camp in 2019, following her high-profile departure four years earlier, led to intense debate within the UK, particularly over the controversial removal of her citizenship by Home Secretary Sajid Javid. As an Islamist terrorism case with clear gendered dimensions, the Begum case was well-positioned to function as a hate crime trigger event. The divisiveness of this case was reflected in partisan political argument within the UK, and accompanied by high volumes of toxic and Islamophobic social media discussion alongside input from a variety of UK politicians. This paper offers a qualitative analysis of the political rhetoric promoted in the Twitter accounts of leading UK politicians in response to the citizenship decision, and subsequent developments between February and April 2019, such as the death of Begum’s child and the granting of legal aid to support her ongoing legal challenge. Through a Critical Discourse Analysis of politicians’ online rhetoric, this study aims to establish the contribution of UK political rhetoric to the hate speech discourses that emerged online in response to this case.

T1  - Justice Sensitivity Is Positively and Negatively Related to Prejudice and Discrimination
AN  - 2576370322
AB  - The trait justice sensitivity captures individual differences in the tendency to perceive injustice and to negatively respond to these perceptions. The tendency to negatively respond to injustice to ones disadvantage (victim justice sensitivity) was reliably linked to different measures of antisocial behavior and conservative values. Thus, we assumed that victim justice sensitivity should also be positively related to prejudice and discrimination. In contrast, the tendency to negatively respond to injustice to the disadvantage of others (altruistic justice sensitivity), was reliably linked to prosocial behavior. Hence, we assumed that altruistic justice sensitivity should also show negative relations with prejudice and discrimination. In order to test these assumptions, we surveyed justice sensitivity, prejudices against three different groups, and discrimination experiences among N=343 participants (M=26.61 years, 79 percent women) in Germany. We found that victim justice sensitivity predicted more self-perpetrated discrimination. Altruistic justice sensitivity predicted less total prejudice and self-perpetrated discrimination and mediated the link between self-experienced discrimination and prejudice/self-perpetrated discrimination unless age, gender, and education were controlled for. Discrimination can promote discrimination. Future research on correlates and potential risk and protective factors of prejudice and discrimination should also consider justice sensitivity as a moral-related trait.

T1  - Discrete Events and Hate Crimes: The Causal Role of the Brexit Referendum
AN  - 2480195812
AB  - ObjectiveThe article contributes to the literature on discrete events and behavioral change among the public by studying the link between the United Kingdom's 2016 “Brexit”referendum and racial and religious hate crime.MethodsTime series intervention models on daily and monthly hate crime numbers from the UK Home Office and police forces, controlling for other events such as terror attacks. A range of robustness tests including additional vector auto‐regression.ResultsThe Brexit referendum led to a 19–23 percent increase in hate crimes, but did not lead to a longer‐term increase. The results are robust to a range of alternative specifications, and there is no evidence of a relationship between media coverage of hate crime or immigration salience and hate crimes. The results also show the consistent, large effect of terror attacks on increasing the number of hate crimes.ConclusionThe Brexit referendum caused an increase in hate crimes on par with terror attacks. Discrete political events, like referendums and elections, can play a sizeable role in prejudicial behavioral change.

T1  - Heteronormativity, Disgust Sensitivity, and Hostile Attitudes toward Gay Men: Potential Mechanisms to Maintain Social Hierarchies
AN  - 2474584042
AB  - Within a social hierarchy based on sexual orientation, heteronormative ideology serves as a social force that maintains dominant group members’ status (e.g., heterosexual men). Disgust may be an emotional reaction to gay men’s violation of heteronormativity (i.e., same-sex sexual behavior) and motivate hostile attitudes toward gay men to promote interpersonal and intergroup boundaries. Based on this theoretical framework, we hypothesized that sexual disgust—compared to pathogen or moral disgust—would be most strongly associated with antigay hostility and would statistically mediate its relationship with heteronormativity. Heterosexual men in the United States (n = 409) completed an online questionnaire assessing heteronormative ideology, disgust sensitivity, and hostile attitudes toward gay men. Results support the hypotheses and suggest that gay men’s sexual behavior is the most likely elicitor of disgust and antigay hostility, as opposed to a perceived pathogen threat or moral transgression. The findings indicate that heteronormative attitudes and sexual disgust are likely contributors to antigay hostility. Thus, intervention efforts should seek to improve tolerance of same-sex sexual behavior among heterosexual men, which may mitigate emotional reactions and hostile attitudes toward gay men.

T1  - Intimacy Beyond Sex: Korean Television Dramas, Nonsexual Masculinities, and Transnational Erotic Desires
AN  - 2474491039
AB  - In the twenty-first century, Korean television dramas have gained transnational popularity in a phenomenon called Hallyu. Believing that these Korean television dramas accurately portray how Korean men are in real life, some white women from North America and Europe travel to Korea as Hallyu tourists to form intimate relations with Korean men. This essay is based on the data I gathered through ethnographic field research in 2017–18, during which I interviewed and observed these Hallyu tourists. Some of my Hallyu tourist informants claimed that they traveled to Korea because they were motivated by the nonsexual depictions of Korean men in the television dramas. They viewed Korean men as the racial, ethnic, and nonsexual others who would provide them with alternatives to sex-based intimacy. I examine my Hallyu tourist informants' desires for Korean men through the theoretical frameworks of nonsexuality and racialized erotics. I argue that some of my informants' erotic desires for nonsexual Korean men reinforce Orientalist stereotypes about Korean men's sexuality. By examining the racial and sexual politics of some white female tourists' erotic desires for nonsexual Korean men, I demonstrate the indivisibility of nonsexuality from race.

T1  - Interrogating Antipodean Angst: New Zealand's Non-Muslim Majority Talk About Muslims
AN  - 2470251221
AB  - This study addresses Douglas Pratt's 2010 claim that New Zealand's non-Muslim majority experience “angst” in relation to a growing Muslim population. Based on interviews with non-Muslim New Zealanders we identified two key discourses. Firstly, participants constructed New Zealand as a safe haven and as tolerant and accepting of different religions and cultures. However, this tolerance and acceptance was conditional on Muslim assimilation and on participants’ sense of security and safety. Secondly, in constructing Muslims, gender-based oppression was created as problematic. Further, Muslims were constructed as not all terrorists, suggesting a default link between Islam and terrorism. Media was constructed as deliberately overplaying this link. Overall, angst about the increasing numbers of Muslims in New Zealand society was not identified. However, the core underlying stance was that, to be accepted, those with different social norms should assimilate and not threaten current cultural norms. Covert racism was highlighted in this study.

T1  - Legitimizing Sexist Advertising: A Critical Focus on the Danish Consumer Ombudsman’s Guidelines and Adjudications of Complaints of Gender Discrimination
AN  - 2468555019
AB  - Feminist media studies have highlighted gender discrimination in advertising since the 1960s. Despite this focus and political attention on combating sexist stereotypes and prejudicial portrayals in advertising the problem persists. Few scholarly endeavours have thus far probed how the national agencies tasked with preventing sexism perceive and address such representations in marketing. To remedy this research gap this study investigates the Danish Consumer Ombudsman’s (DCO) definition of sexism and its evaluation of stereotypical representations of gender in marketing campaigns by Danish companies. The DCO is empowered to ensure non-discriminatory representations in advertising. Utilizing feminist critical discourse analysis as a theory and methodology the present study addresses two aspects of the institutional and discursive practices of this authoritative body, scrutinizing its latest Guidelines on gender-related advertising of 1 April 2012 and examining its application of these guidelines in adjudications of complaints against sexism. Applying the lens of post-feminism and sexism to the analysis, the article indicates how the DCO legitimizes and normalizes sexist advertising and offers significant insights into practices that perpetuate inequality in the media and its regulatory institutions. Ultimately, the article reveals how the very societal institutions established to safeguard gender equality reproduce gender discrimination.

TT  - Parents’ responses to toys representing impairment
AN  - 2459571589
AB  - PurposeThis study aimed to look at parents' perceptions of a number of different toy prototypes that represented physical impairments and predictors of these perceptions.Design/methodology/approachA correlational survey design was used. Parents of children aged 4–10 years who identified their child as having a disability (n = 160) and not as having a disability (n = 166) took part. They rated a number of prototypes for likelihood that their child would enjoy playing with them and completed measures of their responses toward children with disabilities and of their own and their child's direct contact with people with disabilities.FindingsIt was found that, among parents of children who did not declare that their child had a disability, the more open the parents were toward disability, the more contact the children had with other children with disabilities and the more likely they were to consider that their child would like to play with a toy prototype representing a physical impairment. This pattern of results was not found among parents who identified their child as having a disability, where instead positive friendship intentions of parents mediated this association.Research limitations/implicationsThese findings have implications for theories informing the positive benefits of disability representation.Practical implicationsThese findings indicate different paths through which parents might be moved to purchase toys that represent physical impairments for their children.Social implicationsThese findings suggest that representative toys might be associated with an open dialogue around the topic of disability.Originality/valueThis is the first study of the responses of parents to toys that represent physical impairments known to the authors.

T1  - Perceived Group Threat, Perceived Injustice, and Self-Reported Right-Wing Violence: An Integrative Approach to the Explanation Right-Wing Violence
AN  - 2435507275
AB  - The present study aims at explaining individual differences in self-reported political violence. We integrate key concepts from the field of criminology that are conceptually related to social identity theory (Flemish identity, feelings of group superiority, and ethnocentrism) and the dual process model on prejudice (perceived injustice, perception of threat, and right-wing authoritarianism). In our model, social identity concepts are hypothesized to play a mediating role between mechanisms derived from the dual process model and political violence. To test the integrated model, a model was run for testing the strength of direct and indirect effects of perceived injustice, authoritarianism thrill-seeking behavior, feelings of superiority, Flemish nationalism, ethnocentrism, right-wing extremist beliefs, and exposure to racist peers on political violence. The analyses are based on a web survey (N = 723) among adolescents and young adults in Flanders, Belgium. Results indicate that social identity variables play an important mediation role between perceptions and ideological attitudes related to injustice, and political violence. The main path revealed by our study is that perceived injustice may result in heightened perceptions of threat, which in turn positively influence levels of right-wing authoritarianism. Mediated by ethnocentrism, this variable has a significant and positive effect on right-wing beliefs, which in turn has a positive effect on political violence.

T1  - Keep America Christian (and White): Christian Nationalism, Fear of Ethnoracial Outsiders, and Intention to Vote for Donald Trump in the 2020 Presidential Election
AN  - 2690247592
AB  - Some of the strongest predictors of voting for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election were Christian nationalism and antipathy toward Muslims and immigrants. We examine the interrelated influence of these three factors on Americans' intentions to vote for Trump in 2020. Consistent with previous research, Christian nationalism and Islamophobia remained strong and significant predictors of intention to vote for Trump; however, the effect of xenophobia was stronger. Further, xenophobia and Islamophobia significantly and substantially mediated the effects of Christian nationalism. Consequently, though Christian nationalism remains theoretically and empirically distinct as a cultural framework, its influence on intending to vote for Trump in 2020 is intimately connected to fears about ethnoracial outsiders. In the penultimate year before Trump's reelection campaign, the strongest predictors of supporting Trump, in order of magnitude, were political party, xenophobia, identifying as African American (negative) , political ideology, Christian nationalism, and Islamophobia.

T1  - Atmospherics of War A Response
AN  - 2494379874
AB  - This brief response to Neel Ahuja’s “Animal Death as National Debility” focuses on his analysis of the intersections of speciesism, racism, and ableism in Syrian war narratives. Ahuja insightfully untangles a media-driven, over-determined portrayal of the Syrian uprisings that began in 2011, as well as the subsequent war that was framed as one of the world’s first “climate wars.” The appropriation of war terminology in the framing of “climate wars” is a liberalization of the violence of the Syrian uprisings and the many conduits of its brutal repression, a ventriloquizing of atmospherics of violence on which some types of causal trajectories surface or sublimate others.

T1  - Portrayals of Jihad: A Cause of Islamophobia
AN  - 2477273984
AB  - When the first Muslims arrived in America in the 16th century, Americans were faced with something that was unknown to them: Islam. At the time, many Americans were afraid that Islam would impose its own values and ideals, thereby threatening their Protestant Christian tradition. For this reason, Islamophobia has been in America as long as Islam has been in America; it is not a new phenomenon. This fear of Islam penetrating a nation built on Protestant Christian values is still present today, but why? There are many causes of Islamophobia, but a popular explanation that every American who watches the news probably knows is jihad. Jihad has come to be perceived as "holy war" in American media and by many Americans. It sounds like a petrifying notion, but it does not carry the definitions and implications that many Americans, especially Islamophobes, claim it does. Jihad is highly misrepresented in America, thereby distorting Americans' understanding of Islam as a religion. Furthermore, the misrepresentation of jihad in American media and by Islamophobes as well as cherry-picked verses in the Qur'an and ahādīth (sayings and actions of Muhammad-the founder of Islam) contribute greatly to the construction of Islamophobia. Furthermore, these misrepresentations of jihad are used to define Islam as a whole and spread Islamophobia.

T1  - Depicting Black Women, the Politics of Respectability, and HIV in <i>Precious</i>
AN  - 2471143890
AB  - This article analyzes how Precious: Based on the Novel “Push” by Sapphire (2009) makes implicit the connection between Black women, welfare, and HIV when the lead character, Precious, an obese teenage mother, is eventually diagnosed as HIV positive. Building on scholarship that examines media representations of Black women living with HIV, this essay examines how Precious mediates respectability politics (a conservative strategy to counter racist constructions of Blackness, gender, sexuality, and class) in order to delineate racialized and gendered authenticity. We argue, by compartmentalizing Precious’s HIV diagnosis as simply another tragic life circumstance and inconsequential to her Black womanhood, the film forecloses possibilities to critically engage mediated depictions of low income Black women living with HIV. We consider the ways the film dismisses Precious’s HIV diagnosis in order to forefront her potential for respectability, thus designating her as deserving of welfare benefits.

T1  - All the Muslims Fit to Print: Racial Frames as Mechanisms of Muslim Ethnoracial Formation in the <i>New York Times</i> from 1992 to 2010
AN  - 2451348986
AB  - A generative turn in scholarship examines the institutional and political dimensions of Islamophobia, conceptualizing Muslim representations as a mechanism of ethnoracial formation in which the media is one such site of racialization. Moments of great political and cultural transformation can motivate and activate these racial projects, generating racialized representations that attach racial meaning to bodies. Much of the research on Muslim representations in news media centers on this very question: did the attacks of 9/11 usher in a new racial project? Previous studies offer competing hypotheses. Bridging social movement and communication theories with a theory of ethnoracial formation, the author develops an approach for evaluating racial framing processes through a comparison of diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational frames. The author applies this approach using computational text analysis techniques to examine latent shifts in the racial framing of Muslims in the New York Times in the decade before and after 9/11. The author finds evidence of increasingly racialized, but more complex, representations of Muslims in the decade after 9/11 in which diagnostic frames evolve from locating social problems in states and institutions to locating social problems in Muslim bodies. Prognostic frames shift from institutional reforms to those targeting group pathology. The author argues that excavating the latent mechanisms of racial projects helps us better understand the dynamic and ongoing processes of ethnoracial formation.

T1  - Bridging the communal gap: The politics of “Hindu–Muslim” Salman Bhaijaan
AN  - 2449123585
AB  - Of the three Khans that dominate Bombay cinema, Salman Khan enjoys fan popularity amongst Muslims in India. This adoration and identification for Khan is surprising particularly because he has been publicly decried as a Muslim since his implicit support of prime minister Narendra Modi. And yet, his films often get released on the Muslim festival of Eid to tremendous box office success.This article analyzes the intersection of fandom and stardom of Salman Khan to discuss how his stardom is a product of negotiations between the public discussions of his religious identity, interviews that seek to convey his star image as authentic, and the cinematic construction of the star as articulated through his roles. An analysis of media coverage of his films across newspapers that cross nations (India and Pakistan), languages (English, Hindi, and Urdu), and urban-rural divides, I examine the paratextual construction of him as a bhaijaan/brother that then impacts interpretation of his films within local, national, and global imaginaries. I argue that the implicit positioning of Salman Khan across the Hindu-Muslim divide becomes explicit through his roles in Ek tha Tiger (2012), Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015), and even Sultan (2016). This article proposes that the discourse around what I call his “bhaijaanification” serves as an interruption to the fundamentalist trends within India and Bombay cinema that have become worse as a result of large-scale transnational Islamophobia since 2001, and indicates the extent of stardom’s auteurist function where it influences meanings that go beyond the cinematic and into the political.

T1  - Love knows no colour bar: Windrush, racism and <i>Flame in the Streets</i>
AN  - 2428991997
AB  - Released in the aftermath of the 1958 Notting Hill riots, Flame in the Streets [Baker, Roy. 1961. UK: The Rank Organisation.] remains a distinctive British film of the 1960s in its examination of the racial prejudices that defined African-Caribbean's antagonous relations with the wider British Society. In Baker's attempt to expose the passive racisms of Jacko Palmer by paralleling his family conflict between his wife and daughter with his industrial conflicts as a trade union representative defending the rights of a black co-worker despite the disquiet that his ethnicity has generated from the white workers, the film presents ethnic minority characters in a form that links the personal with the political, interweaving themes of both class and race. Through a historicization and contextualization, this article sets out to examine the ways in which twentieth century post-war immigration and subsequent race struggles influenced the socio-political character of Flame in The Streets.

T1  - Estimating the extent and nature of offending by Sudanese-born individuals in Victoria
AN  - 2439231208
AB  - The involvement in crime of some young Sudanese-born Victorians has received sustained public attention in recent years. The media coverage of these occurrences has been extensive, with some outlets criticised for sensationalist reporting and prejudiced undertones. A range of views were held across the commentariat including, for example, the notion that Sudanese-Victorian criminal involvement has been overstated; that some level of justice over-representation was inevitable due to the demographics of Sudanese-born Victorians, which skew young and male (i.e. the demographic hypothesis); and that offending rates may be associated with heightened law enforcement responses following a high-profile criminal incident in March 2016 that received protracted media coverage and political commentary (i.e. the racial-profiling hypothesis). This paper sought to address these contentions by (i) examining the offending rates of both young and adult males across three cultural sub-groups (i.e. Sudanese-born, Indigenous Australian, Australian-born) across several offending categories between 2015 and 2018 and (ii) exploring the impact of a high-profile criminal incident in March 2016, on the offending rates of Sudanese-born Victorians. Offending rates were calculated using offender incident data from the Victorian Crime Statistics Agency and population estimates from the Australian Bureau of Statistics Census data. Findings indicate that Sudanese-born individuals figure prominently in both youth and adult offending categories relative to other major cultural sub-groups. Rates for ‘crimes against the person’ were especially pronounced for Sudanese-born youth and significantly higher than rates for crimes more subject to police discretion (i.e. public order offences). The ‘demographic hypothesis’ did not hold for the specified age range of 10 to 17 years. An increase in offending was observed post-March 2016 across two offending categories for Sudanese-born Victorians. Findings are contextualised within.

T1  - An Initial Test of the Cosmetics Dehumanization Hypothesis: Heavy Makeup Diminishes Attributions of Humanness-Related Traits to Women
AN  - 2430245186
AB  - Objectification theory suggests that sexualization has significant dehumanizing consequences for how perceivers see women. To date, research has mostly documented how sexualized bodies in the mass media are objectified and dehumanized. The purpose of the present work was to test the novel cosmetics dehumanization hypothesis (CDH), that is, that subtler manifestations of sexualization, such as heavy makeup, might influence the way people attribute humanness-related traits to women. Across four experiments, 1000 participants (mostly from the United Kingdom and United States) were asked to evaluate women’s faces with or without heavy makeup. Consistent with the CDH, results showed that faces with makeup were rated as less human while using complementary indicators of dehumanization: They were perceived as possessing less humanness, less agency, less experience (Experiment 1), less competence, less warmth, and less morality (Experiments 2–4) than faces without makeup. This pattern of results was observed for faces of both models (Experiments 1–2) and ordinary women (Experiments 3–4). In Experiment 4, we manipulated the part of the face that wore makeup (eye makeup vs. lipstick) and found that faces with eye makeup were attributed the least amount of warmth and competence. A meta-analysis based on Experiments 2–4 confirmed the robustness of the findings, which were not moderated by either participant gender or sexual orientation. Whereas prior studies suggested that a focus on faces may serve as an antidote for objectification and related dehumanization, the present set of experiments indicates that this strategy might not always be effective.

T1  - TWO STEPS FORWARD, ONE STEP BACK
AN  - 2573887320
AB  - Drawing on original interview data, this article analyses the impact of social media on Indian Women Human Rights Defenders (WHRDs). It argues that social media can help WHRDs to expand their advocacy, but can also leave them open to online threats, which can translate into offline risks. It also argues that WHRDs face threats due to their gender, as well as other factors, meaning that it is vital to consider this topic in both a gender-sensitive and intersectional way. Overall, this article concludes that social media both helps and harms WHRDs.

T1  - Exploring daily mediating pathways of religious identity in the associations between maternal religious socialization and Muslim American adolescents' civic engagement
AN  - 2435540832
AB  - Despite its implications for positive youth development, factors and processes that promote civic engagement are critically understudied, particularly among Muslim American adolescents for whom opportunities for civic engagement could be hindered by Islamophobia and hate crimes. Prior work has proposed that parents can strengthen adolescents' group belonging and motivate their civic engagement, but this mediating link has not been empirically tested. Moreover, parents' religious socialization and adolescents' religious identity remain understudied, especially with respect to possible daily fluctuations. We used experience sampling methods to: (a) explore momentary fluctuations and temporal relations between two dimensions of Muslim American adolescents' religious identity (i.e., private regard and centrality) over the course of 14 days (Phase 2), and (b) examine if Muslim American adolescents' momentary religious identity (Phase 2) mediated associations between their stable perceptions of maternal religious socialization (Phase 1) and subsequent civic engagement (Phase 3). Dynamic structural equation modeling revealed positive autoregressive and cross-lagged relations between religious private regard and centrality. Moreover, adolescents' momentary religious identities differentially mediated the associations between maternal religious socialization and civic attitudes and behaviors, suggesting specificity in these developmental processes. Our findings have important implications for programs and policies to support the self-empowerment and positive development of Muslim American adolescents.

T1  - “It’s not something I can shake”: The Effect of Racial Stereotypes, Beauty Standards, and Sexual Racism on Interracial Attraction
AN  - 2278322600
AB  - Sexual racism, a form of prejudice enacted in sexual or romantic settings, is a complex phenomenon that can interact with racial stereotypes and media representations of beauty to affect interracial attraction. Research suggests that racialized beauty standards and racial stereotypes can perpetuate broader racist tendencies in social interactions. This study aims to develop a critical understanding of how undergraduate students conceptualize the intersection of race and sexuality, and how racial identity shapes their sexual and romantic experiences. Using a qualitative methodology of survey analysis and in-depth interviews, this study examines the attitudes and behaviors of students at a large public university in California, and focuses on the thematic analysis of qualitative data obtained during eighteen student interviews. This research identifies three significant themes: (1) the impact of racial stereotypes on interracial attraction, (2) the media’s tendency to perpetuate Whiteness as a standard of beauty, and (3) the harmful consequences of sexual racism on students’ self-esteem and self-worth. Findings suggest that racial stereotypes, beauty standards, and sexual racism are prevalent among this student community and have harmful consequences for students of color, including decreased self-esteem, sexual repercussions, and internalized racism.

T1  - Media of Contempt: Social Media Consumption Predicts Normative Acceptance of Anti-Muslim Hate Speech and Islamoprejudice
AN  - 2444990891
AB  - The new era of information technology brings new opportunities but also poses new threats. In our paper, we examine whether a shift from traditional print and broadcasting to new online media results in the increased normalization of hate speech towards minorities, and whether this change can subsequently increase prejudice towards minorities. Our research uses data from a representative two-wave longitudinal survey of Polish adults. In wave 1 (N = 1060), data on respondents' primary sources of information about the world (TV, newspapers, radio, online, social media, blogs) was collected. Wave 2 (N = 628), conducted six months later, included measures of perceived normativity of anti-Muslim hate speech and Islamophobia. We found that respondents who were frequent social media users expressed higher levels of Islamoprejudice and perceived higher normativity of antiMuslim hate speech than the respondents who got their news from traditional mass media. We also found that an increase in perceived normativity of anti-Muslim hate speech can act as one of the mechanisms through which use of social media is linked to higher Islamoprejudice.

T1  - Islamophobia, Racism and the Vilification of the Muslim Diaspora
AN  - 2410495495
AB  - Is Islamophobia a new phenomenon? Are Islam and the Judeo-Christian West still hateful of and hostile toward each other? Do Muslim women with veils and headscarves constitute a threat to the Wests secular and liberal values? What has fueled the sudden rhetoric of Islamophobia in the United States of America and Europe? How does Anglophone print and digital media report pressures, prejudices and discriminatory practices against male and female students? How do Western media cover the social exclusion of the Muslim diaspora? These questions need a thoughtful coverage and concentration in academia. It is believed that most of the grievous and painful stories experienced, for example, by Muslim immigrants- be they legal or illegal, asylum seekers, refugees, or whatsoever, still do not find a room in scholastic research. This paper utilizes the narrative research method to study and probe into the problem of Islamophobia, the vilification of and racism against Muslims in the United States of America and Europe. The usage of human stories, peoples personal experiences and narrative accounts or recounts of Islamophobic incidents (real or imagined) as the basis of this inquiry is particularly suitable for research because it can help understand the status quo of Muslim diaspora in the United States of America and Europe. Narrative data are retrieved from five major US-news publications and press elite (e.g., Foreign Policy, The New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today and Chicago Tribune). The analysis of these data can be used to improve the situation of Muslim diaspora and their interaction with non-Muslims all over the world. The mediums cited above have been chosen because they are the prime source of information for intellectuals and policy-makers. Decidedly, they construct and build up ample epistemologies on Islamophobia and other epiphenomena of racism.

AB  - In this paper I discuss Islamophobia as a form of racism especially intensified in the press and media. The women in my study talked about how they coped with what they saw as a backlash of Islamophobia. I show how they have come to deal with the effects of this in their everyday life. Even though most of the women in my study were born and raised in Britain, this antipathy towards Muslims has made them question their sense of belonging. This paper brings to light the experiences of prejudice and discrimination from the perspective of middle-class British-Pakistanis.

T1  - Media experiences in community-driven rural areas: exploring children's media cultures in rural Gujarat, India
AN  - 2246310258
AB  - In this paper, we examine how social structures of gender, caste, and religion, within which children in India operate, inform their engagements with media technologies/narratives. We demonstrate our approach using the case of three villages in the Ahmedabad district of Gujarat, India. We examine children's media cultures using ethnographic methods which occasion long-term immersion and paying attention to children's narratives. We also argue that children experience and enact their agency while engaging with media from within the limitations or norms imposed by the social structures. This is evident in the simple negotiation strategies they have developed to challenge social structures and norms prevalent in their societies. Based on empirical evidence we conclude that the children's exposure to and consumption of media narratives under adult management allow the families and communities to reinforce the dominant rationality of patriarchy, caste hierarchy, and religious prejudice.

T1  - Minority Stress and LGB-Inclusive Television Viewing Frequency Among LGB Adults: The Roles of Community Connectedness and Perceived Social Support
AN  - 2193681013
AB  - Using a cross-sectional, correlational design, the present study examined the moderating roles of perceived social support and community connectedness in the relationship between minority stress and viewing frequency of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB)-inclusive television shows among LGB adults. Participants identified predominately as White and female, and the largest group identified as bisexual. Participants completed self-report measures of minority stressors, social support, LGB community connectedness, and viewing frequency. A multiple linear regression was conducted to examine the relationships among these variables. Findings revealed that perceived social support moderated the effect of prejudice events on viewing frequency, such that LGB viewers who reported high levels of prejudice events and low perceived social support endorsed the highest levels of viewing frequency. These findings provide further insight into the ways in which LGB individuals consume media content and may be informative for clinicians in understanding coping strategies for minority stress among LGB clients.

T1  - Islamophobia in the East of the European Union: an introduction
AN  - 2139169966
AB  - There is some truth in the common view that hostility to Muslims and Islam is more prominent on the eastern flank of the European Union (EU). Yet this East–West difference appears to be diminishing, as governments in Austria and Italy follow Donald Trump’s America by turning Islamophobia into a political platform. On the whole, East–West differences in Islamophobia are often seen as greater than they really are. In terms of content, the discourse of Islamophobia is practically identical to that in the East of the EU and the West, as well as in North America and other parts of the world. Charges of terrorism, immigrant crime, the oppression of women and homosexuals, and/or a desire to invade and ‘Islamize’ Europe and change its Christian character are directed at Muslims as a whole on both sides of the former Iron Curtain. What is different is not so much in the character or degree of anti-Muslim prejudice as such. Rather, it is in the extent to which its political expression is entrenched in national consensus, and to which it is able to undermine resistance by the judiciary, the media and human rights organizations. Islamophobia is discussed in this issue not as the latest incarnation of an ‘East European’ cultural inclination towards racial prejudice, but as an example and a warning about a process that is also happening, though it may not have advanced quite as far (yet?), in most of the West. The most promising avenue of research into the specifically East Central European situation is to study how the fear and rejection of Muslim migrants has been employed in negotiating a new place for the formerly socialist eastern members of the EU. Several authors in this special issue suggest that Islamophobia serves here as a misguided means to raise the region from its current status within the EU as a semi-peripheral, semi-colonial appendage.

T1  - Who’s Getting the Best Sex? A Comparison by Sexual Orientation
AN  - 2057717184
AB  - This study examined the difference in sexual satisfaction between sexual minority and heterosexual college students testing the mediation effects of institutional affiliations and interpersonal relationships. A convenience sample of 280 college sociology students completed a 47-item Internet questionnaire, including self-reports on sexual satisfaction and sexual behaviors/activities. Data on 193 heterosexuals and 87 sexual minority respondents were analyzed using regression to test for differences in reported levels of sexual satisfaction by sexual orientation. Results revealed that sexual minority undergraduates reported lower sexual satisfaction than heterosexual undergraduates. This difference persisted when controlling for sex, race, education, and SES. Mediation analyses found support for the hypothesis that institutional affiliations and interpersonal relationships have an effect on this association. Previous researchers have suggested that sexual minority relationships exist in a context of heterosexism, suppression, stigmatization, prejudice, discrimination and violence which results in lower relationship quality. Such an impact on minority couples’ satisfaction may spill over into lower sexual satisfaction.

T1  - Would you date ‘the undateables’? An analysis of the mediated public debate on the reality television show ‘The Undateables’
AN  - 2092734411
AB  - This article examines the different discourses in the online public debate surrounding the television dating show ‘The Undateables’. The programme, which exclusively focuses on dates of disabled people, was launched in the UK in 2012, and local adaptations of the format were broadcast in Belgium and the Netherlands. The article applies the dis/ability approach of Goodley and Runswick-Cole (2014) to examine the way in which representations of disabled singles are evaluated online. As a perspective, dis/ability destabilizes notions of normativity and enables an inquiry into not just marginalized identities, but also dominant identities. The analysis of blog posts, tweets and online press reviews of the first series of the British, Flemish and Dutch version of ‘The Undateables’ provides more insights into hegemonic and resistant notions on disability, dating and romantic relationships. This article argues that prejudices, as already identified by Morris in 1991, are still very dominant today.

T1  - Do Stereotypical Media Representations Influence White Individuals’ Perceptions of American Indians?
AN  - 2081904087
AB  - In this study, we examined exposure to stereotypical movie portrayals of American Indians, motivations to respond without prejudice, and awareness of White privilege on racist attitudes. European American participants (N = 232) were randomly assigned to watch stereotypical representations of American Indians or control videos. Hierarchical regression results revealed that higher internal motivations to respond without prejudice and awareness were associated with lower levels of racist attitudes. Higher external motivations to respond without prejudice were associated with higher levels of modern racist attitudes. For participants high in awareness, there was no significant difference in modern racist attitudes between the control and stereotype conditions. For participants low in awareness, those in the control condition reported lower modern racist attitudes than those in the stereotype condition. Results suggest awareness is an important predictor of lower racist attitudes but needs to be reconceptualized within the counseling literature. Social justice implications and limitations are discussed.

T1  - ‘I'm happy to own my implicit biases’: Public encounters with the implicit association test
AN  - 2064683651
AB  - The implicit association test (IAT) and concept of implicit bias have significantly influenced the scientific, institutional, and public discourse on racial prejudice. In spite of this, there has been little investigation of how ordinary people make sense of the IAT and the bias it claims to measure. This article examines the public understanding of this research through a discourse analysis of reactions to the IAT and implicit bias in the news media. It demonstrates the ways in which readers interpreted, related to, and negotiated the claims of IAT science in relation to socially shared and historically embedded concerns and identities. IAT science was discredited in accounts that evoked discourses about the marginality of academic preoccupations, and helped to position test‐takers as targets of an oppressive political correctness and psychologists as liberally biased. Alternatively, the IAT was understood to have revealed widely and deeply held biases towards racialized others, eliciting accounts that took the form of psychomoral confessionals. Such admissions of bias helped to constitute moral identities for readers that were firmly positioned against racial bias. Our findings are discussed in terms of their implications for using the IAT in prejudice reduction interventions, and communicating to the public about implicit bias.

T1  - Audience Contradictions in the Negotiation of Controversial Cultural Media Content
AN  - 2059070003
AB  - This paper analyses how people negotiate representations of other cultures in the media, in particular those traits that can be considered controversial in the sense of generating strong opinions and opposing stances. A news story about an Egyptian television channel run by Egyptian women journalists wearing the niqab (Maria TV) was used to stimulate debate in four focus groups. Although most of the participants initially criticized the approach adopted by the television channel, they also expressed opinions on journalists in niqab that agreed with the representation proposed by the channel. The article shows that even though audiences may seem capable of criticizing media biases, they do not recognize their own internalized prejudices and, ultimately, accept the discourse proposed by media.

T1  - Europe and refugees: 1938 and 2015-16
AN  - 2031358274
AB  - Ahonen attempts to provide some historical contextualization for the refugee crisis that has dominated much of European public and political debate since 2015. He draws comparisons between the crisis-ridden present and the decade of the previous century that was particularly laden with anticipation of disaster and doom: the 1930s. More specifically, his article explores parallels in public discussions of refugees by European political leaders and media commentators in 1938, on the one hand, and 2015-16, on the other. The coverage of 1938 focuses on the Evian Conference, organized to discuss the problem of Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany, while the analysis of 2015-16 concerns the period from the rapid acceleration of the refugee influx into Europe in the late summer of 2015 to the Brexit referendum of June 2016. Ahonen contends that, despite obvious and significant structural and contextual differences between the late 1930s and the mid-2010s, recent public discussions of the refugee crisis in Europe have closely resembled those conducted around the time of the Evian Conference. Fear and a sense of threat have been the dominant sentiments in the mid-2010s, as they were in the late 1930s, with many similarities in the language and analytical categories in which those sentiments have been publicly expressed. He also provides observations about the potential benefits and pitfalls of diachronic historical comparison, suggesting that an analysis of the failings of refugee policy during the 1930s can provide lessons for better practice today. Aggressive, racialist language about refugees of the kind that was common in the 1930s should have no place in today's public discourses in Europe. Awareness of the continuities that exist in this area can provide important historical perspective, highlighting the persistence of prejudice and the urgency of the need to reject and resist it.

T1  - Media’s Influence on Perceptions of Trans Women
AN  - 1992792646
AB  - Although media representations of trans women are becoming increasingly common, many trans women still face discrimination in their daily lives, in part due to prejudices and stereotypes that are perpetuated by media. In two studies, we investigated group differences in baseline transphobia linked to gender, sexual orientation, religiosity, and political ideology; we then measured whether different representations of trans women in media led to attitude change. After providing information about their baseline attitudes, participants were randomly assigned to positive, negative, or control film-viewing conditions, with a problematic condition (i.e., sympathetic portrayal of a trans woman by a cisgender male actor) added in study 2. In each condition, participants viewed two depictions of trans women from film or television shows. After watching the clips, participants’ attitudes toward trans individuals were re-assessed. Heterosexuals, Christians, conservatives, and men (study 2 only) showed greater transphobia at pretest than LGB individuals, atheists, liberals, and women, respectively. Attitudes of participants who viewed negative film depictions of trans women became more negative after viewing the clips. We discuss implications of these findings in relation to recent media interest in representing trans women.

T1  - Rhetoric and Etiological Beliefs About Sexuality: Reader Responses to Cynthia Nixon's New York Times Interview
AN  - 2002462532
AB  - In 2012, the U.S. actress Cynthia Nixon was quoted in the New York Times Magazine as having stated that "for me, it [being gay] is a choice. I understand that for many people it's not, but for me it's a choice, and you don't get to define my gayness for me." The interview attracted international media attention and public criticism by lesbian and gay activists. This article suggests a rhetorical approach to understanding etiological beliefs and provides a discursive analysis of 198 online comments by readers of Pink News, a gay news Web site that reported on Nixon's controversial interview. This article explores common arguments used in readers' comments about Nixon and examines the rhetorical construction of sexuality. The analysis examines three themes within the data. First, biological essentialism was treated by many readers as common knowledge; second, readers suggested that only bisexuals have "choice"; and, third, it was suggested by both Nixon's critics and her supporters that counterarguments colluded with homophobia. The article suggests that there is an ideological dilemma whereby both "born-this-way" and "choice" arguments can be understood as colluding with anti-gay prejudice.

T1  - Roma Press Center - 20 years of making a difference
AN  - 1969942565
AB  - The Roma Press Center (RPC) is the first Roma news agency in Hungary with the goal of reducing prejudice against the Roma. Their profile has been changed throughout the years, since the technological developments of the media and the political and economic changes of the country challenged their way of effectiveness. Until recently, the RPC was always about reacting to the negative stories about the Roma and balancing this image in the media. In the last 3 years, RPC changed its attitude by becoming a proactive media organisation which directly participates in shaping the public discourse about the Roma with their work. The interview with the two decisive characters of the RPC tells about this process.

T1  - Islamophobia: What Teachers Can Do To Reduce It in the Classroom
AN  - 2007680714
AB  - The year 2017 marked the sixteenth year anniversary of the destruction of the World Trade Center, the worst domestic attack in US history. The global environment has been very different since Sep 11, 2001. Prior to that date, terms such as terrorism, terroristic actions, and Islamophobia were not commonly heard. The world environment has changed greatly since then. Now people all over the world are continually on edge. When considering a dictionary definition of Islamophobia, the Oxford Dictionary states it as a "dislike of, or prejudice against, Islam or Muslims, especially as a political force." Islamophobia is not only focused on Islam or Muslims, but also on anyone "who may appear to be Muslim". Here, Hossain addressing the issue of Islamophobia from pre-school to college classrooms.

T1  - Direct, extended, and mass-mediated contact with immigrants in Italy: their associations with emotions, prejudice, and humanity perceptions
AN  - 1883989487
AB  - Two correlational studies investigated the associations between different forms of intergroup contact, on the one hand, and Italians' prejudice and humanity attributions toward immigrants in Italy, on the other. Study 1 examined the effects of direct contact, extended contact, and parasocial contact through mass-media, assessing separately contact through TV news and newspapers and contact through entertainment programs. Study 2 analyzed the distinct effects of positive and negative episodes of the contact forms considered in Study 1. Across the studies, we tested the mediational role of intergroup anxiety, empathy, and trust. Overall, results showed the importance of taking into account different forms of contact and considering the emotional processes during contact experiences to understand intergroup attitudes.

T1  - Essentialist beliefs: Understanding contact with and attitudes towards lesbian and gay individuals
AN  - 1877774170
AB  - Sexual prejudice remains a widespread problem worldwide. Past research demonstrates that cross-orientation contact (contact between heterosexuals and lesbian/gay individuals) reduces sexual prejudice among heterosexuals, especially when contact is high quality. This study extends the literature on the relationship between cross-orientation contact and sexual prejudice and the mediation of this relationship by intergroup anxiety by examining the role of a key ideology - essentialist beliefs about homosexuality (immutability, universality, and discreteness beliefs). Findings indicate that the mediation of the relationship between cross-orientation contact and sexual prejudice by intergroup anxiety differs by level of essentialist beliefs. Additionally, the relationship between cross-orientation contact and sexual prejudice appears to be mediated by essentialist beliefs as well as intergroup anxiety. These results suggest that individuals who endorse essentialist beliefs commonly associated with increased bias (high discreteness and low immutability and universality beliefs) may benefit the most from cross-orientation contact and resultant decreases in intergroup anxiety. Further, decreasing essentialist beliefs generally associated with increased bias may be a mechanism through which cross-orientation contact reduces sexual prejudice. Implications and future directions are discussed.

T1  - Longitudinal Effects of Religious Media on Opposition to Same-Sex Marriage
AN  - 1830830326
AB  - Religion and anti-gay prejudice in the United States are closely connected. Yet we still know little about the specific mechanisms through which religious subcultures may shape adherents' attitudes toward gays and lesbians. This study considers religious media consumption as a unique mechanism through which religious Americans are socialized and embedded within an anti-gay religious subculture. Drawing on panel data from the nationally-representative Portraits of American Life Study, and focusing on opposition to same-sex marriage as a measure of anti-gay prejudice, analyses show that more frequent consumption of religious radio and TV (but not internet) is associated with higher levels of opposition to same-sex marriage over time. These effects remain significant with different model specifications as well as controls for previous attitudes toward same-sex marriage, general media use, sociodemographic and religious characteristics, and intimate contact with gays and lesbians. We propose that consuming religious media over time may influence Americans' views toward LGBT issues directly through explicit messages about homosexuality and indirectly by embedding Americans within a broader religious subculture (largely, conservative Protestantism) that opposes homosexuality.

T1  - Combining CDA and topic modeling: Analyzing discursive connections between Islamophobia and anti-feminism on an online forum
AN  - 1800514584
AB  - In this article we present an analysis of the discursive connections between Islamophobia and anti-feminism on a large Internet forum. We argue that the incipient shift from traditional media toward user-driven social media brings with it new media dynamics, relocating the (re)production of societal discourses and power structures and thus bringing about new ways in which discursive power is exercised. This clearly motivates the need to critically engage this field. Our research is based on the analysis of a corpus consisting of over 50 million posts, collected from the forum using custom web crawlers. In order to approach this vast material of unstructured text, we suggest a novel methodological synergy combining critical discourse analysis (CDA) and topic modeling -- a type of statistical model for the automated categorization of large quantities of texts developed in computer science. By rendering an overview or 'content map' of the corpus, topic modeling provides an enriching complement to CDA, aiding discovery and adding analytical rigor.

Apparently the function of humour is to generate laughter in order to amuse people and release their tension but verbal humour also involves the use of language to construct or deconstruct people's identity. The aim of the current study is to explore the identity constructed through the humour employed in one of the programmes: Khabardaar telecast on Express, a Pakistani News channel, in order to unmask the hidden ideologies. Being a qualitative case study, instances of verbal humour taken from different shows of the programme are analyzed within the framework of Critical Discourse Analysis. The data analysis reveals that in most of the cases the physical features of people, including their obesity and skin colour, are made the target of humour. The study exposes injustice against such people who are considered physically unattractive, according to our cultural notion of attractiveness and addresses the issue of inequality highlighted by Fairclough (1995). The humour is not just confined to the physical appearance of people but also involves ridiculing people on the basis of their gender, ethnicity, and nationality. The paper ends with a note of recommendation for the TV channels in general and the comedians in particular, that advertently or inadvertently, become agents in spreading hatred and intolerance against individuals and groups leading to further reinforcement of different forms of prejudice that already exist in our society.

T1  - Pride and Prejudice: Pervasiveness of Colorism and the Animated Series Proud Family
AN  - 1784150856
AB  - Issues of race and racism continue to be subjects of interest for media critique; however, the more subtle notion of colorism is often ignored in the examination of media texts. An analysis of the popular children's animated series Proud Family demonstrates that even in a context where a "traditional" African American family and positive community relations are shown, colorism is still prominent. Rather than being critiqued or challenged, kids' media is used to reinforce colorist ideals within the African American community. Attributes of wealth, beauty, and intelligence are applied to characters with Eurocentric phenotypic characteristics while deviance, stupidity, poverty and unattractiveness typify characters with more Afrocentric facial features.

T1  - Australian Muslim Jobseekers and Social Capital
AN  - 1685997106
AB  - In spite of the above, the educational attainment profile of Muslims in Australia is "either similar to or better than non-Muslim Australians. This applies to both Muslim men and women" ([Hassan] 2010, 579) even though qualifications do not translate into equitable labour force participation (Akbarzadeh, [G. Bouma], and [R. Woodlock] 2009). Muslims in Australia endure high levels of prejudice and intolerance (United Nations 2010), constituting a distinct labour market disadvantage ([Kabir] and Evans 2002). Muslims are frequently named by public sources as representing a threat to the nation (Northcote and [S. Casimiro] 2010). The Australian media has focused intensely on the risks posed by radical Islamist terrorism for Western nations (Rane 2010). Imtoual (2010, 56) names prejudice against Muslims in Australia as "religious racism". Anti-Muslim attitudes, negative stereotyping and cultural racism and discrimination, especially since 9/11, serve to disadvantage Muslims, creating limited opportunities for Muslim jobseekers in some occupations. Many Muslims "believe that as a result of this media bias, they are vilified in society, and particularly in the workplace" (Kabir 2006,313; see also Wise and [J. Ali] 2008). The subtle and not-so-subtle discrimination that Muslim jobseekers encounter constitutes a major obstacle to their labour force engagement (Kabir and Evans 2002). In viewing our data through a lens of social capital, we include this background Islamophobia when considering the preference for networking and support that we found among Muslim jobseeker informants.              Jobseekers of Muslim faith in Australia come from diverse backgrounds. Not only do they belong to many different ethnic groups but they vary widely in terms of length of time in Australia, English language fluency, educational attainment and labour market experience. They might be refugees, but might as easily be first, second and third generation immigrants. It was therefore a research challenge to study Muslim jobseekers as a group, even though this was the brief given by the project funding body itself: an Australian Government department, and we could not depart from it. Yet, in spite of the diversity of our informants, we found significant points of similarity in the Muslim jobseekers' accounts of their difficulties in entering the labour market, difficulties which were not inherent in ethnicity or any of the characteristics listed above. Rather, the participants in this study were judged, and felt judged first as Muslims, especially women who wore the headscarf and those who favoured pious practices. For example, one woman said,"[It's] not my accent but my appearance. So many times when I get a job over the phone and they ask me for interview. I could see the reaction when they see me wearing this scarf. They slam the door in my face" (R3,30s, F, Malaysian migrant). A male informant told us,"For me I try my best to dress up nicely and shave my beard almost everyday as I do not want anybody to think I am a complicated Muslim, could go to pray five times a day" (A3, 43, M, Arab-Iraqi refugee). We have already reported on our findings of the experience of Islamophobia for Muslim jobseekers elsewhere (see Lovat, Nilan, [H. Hosseini], Samarayi, Mansfield and Alexander 2013a, 2013b; Nilan 2011,2012; Nilan, Samarayi and Lovat 2012). In this article we focus on the strategies and networking practised by those who encounter implicit or explicit anti-Muslim prejudice in looking for work. It is appropriate not just to depict the social suffering of Muslim jobseekers but to give due consideration to the networking and communication strategies this group use to overcome such labour market disadvantage. The concept of social capital is a useful heuristic for the task we undertake below.

T1  - The-Truth-About-Islam.Com: Ordinary Theories of Racism and Cyber Islamophobia
AN  - 1748865192; 201600771
AB  - This essay contends that the digital debates over Islamophobia show a curious resemblance to pre-existing American folk theories of racism. The outcry surrounding the reality show All-American Muslim is the case study, but the argument applies to a broader development of cultural racism and Islamophobia in American society. Starting from a discussion of the politics of racialization and 'post-civil rights' racism in the USA, the article outlines the mediation of racial politics through reality television and online commenting in relation to Islamophobia. Finally, appropriating the work of Eduardo Bonilla-Silva and Jane Hill on the underlying theories of American racism, I examine two seemingly opposing discourses entailed in the AAM controversy, and demonstrate that the entire online outcry has closely followed the old paradigms through which Americans talk about racism.

T1  - British-Born Pakistani and Bangladeshi Young Men: Exploring Unstable Concepts of Muslim, Islamophobia and Racialization
AN  - 1748865072; 201600784
AB  - Much recent academic work on making sense of the changing public profile of the Muslim community in Britain operates within an explanatory framework that assumes a shift from ethnicity to religion and an accompanying shift from racialization to Islamophobia. A key limitation of this work, often grounded in media representations, is that it tends to be disconnected from contemporary lived social relations. In response, this paper critically engages with these debates, drawing upon qualitative research that explores a changing cultural condition that is inhabited by British born, working-class Pakistani and Bangladeshi young men. It is argued that this emergent cultural condition cannot conceptually be contained within a singular category of religion as the contours of the young men's cultural condition are embedded within a range of intensified and ambivalent rapidly shifting local, national and international geo-political processes. Therefore in contrast to recent theorizing and research on Muslim communities and identities, the young men in this study critically engage with the contextually-based local meanings of Muslim, Islamophobia and racialization to secure complex masculine subjectivities. Alongside this, the article highlights that young men recognize that Islamophobia, displacing a notion of racialization, is a danger for their community because of the attendant invisibility of the current impact of social class within conditions of socio-economic austerity, which for them is a central element of their social and cultural exclusions.

T1  - 'Maybe it is prejudice ... but it is NOT racism': Negotiating racism in discussion forums about Gypsies
AN  - 1504423729; 201406698
AB  - This article addresses the ways in which opposition towards Gypsies is debated, with particular regard to whether or not this opposition constitutes racism or prejudice towards a group shown to be vulnerable and subject to discrimination. A discursive analysis of a corpus of internet discussion forums about Gypsies in the UK is undertaken. The analysis demonstrates that opposition towards Gypsies can be presented as racist; however, such accusations are met with criticism so that writers become accountable for making them. While writers do go to rhetorical lengths to dissociate themselves from being presented as racist, there is nevertheless an acceptance that opposition to Gypsies may constitute prejudice. This prejudice is presented as an inevitable result of Gypsies' behaviour and, of particular note, appears to be deemed acceptable. The implications of this finding for the discursive literature on taboos against, and denials of, racism are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Interaction Through Technological Lenses: Computer-Mediated Communication and Language
AN  - 1322723551; 201312173
AB  - In 2004, the second International Association of Language and Social Psychology Task Force focused on relationships involving language and emerging communication technology, culminating in a Special Issue of the Journal of Language and Social Psychology (Vol. 23, No. 4). The present article reviews the topics and conclusions of that work and traces the continuation of study on those topics as they have evolved and influenced language and social psychology research to the present. Communication technology research offers views on the central question of how individuals adapt language to communicative action in the presence or absence of various nonverbal cue systems. This question is reflected in topics such as the expression of affect and immediacy online, the virtual presentation of self and gender, the management of online conversations, adaptation via visual grounding in electronic collaboration, and the employment of online interaction technology to reduce intergroup prejudice. As communication systems have evolved, interfaces offer new cues and representations of users, which continue to propel inquiry into these central questions about language and its usage within various technological contexts.

T1  - 'Beards, scarves, halal meat, terrorists, forced marriage': television industries and the production of 'race'
AN  - 1125219216; 201241230
AB  - This article considers the persistence of stereotypical representations of 'race' that appear in television in the West. According to a particular policy discourse, improving the on-screen representation of non-white groups is a matter of increasing the number of black and Asian folk working in the broadcasting industries -- particularly at the senior management level. However, this article argues that the constant production of hegemonic images of 'race' cannot be tackled via recruitment measures alone. Adopting a 'cultural industries' approach to television production, the article uses an ethnographic study of British Asians working in the UK broadcasting industry to examine the conditions of production through which minority representations are created. By paying closer attention to the experience of cultural work, the article reveals how it is the increasingly commercialized cultures of production in television, constituted by the industry's shift towards deregulation and neoliberal market models, that steers the work of Asian filmmakers and executives themselves into producing problematic, reductive representations of 'race'.

AB  - Social and political tensions heightened after the attacks of 9/11 have created an increase in Islamophobia. Historically, vilified depictions of Muslims have legitimized discriminatory acts against Muslim Americans. In this context, Islamophobia has infiltrated our classrooms, making it urgent for educators to develop a critical pedagogical stance that counters discrimination and demystifies stereotypes against Muslim American students.

T1  - Exploring the everyday world of hate victimization through community mediation
AN  - 1364700018; 201327227
AB  - For some time, hate crimes were conceptualized as acts of hatred committed by strangers -- typically as violent attacks against people perceived to be different from the attacker. Considering hate as an aggravating feature resulted in increasingly punitive and exclusionary criminal justice and sentencing legislation. Left out of this picture were the messier, sometimes intractable disputes between people known to one another -- neighbours, colleagues or other acquaintances -- conflicts sometimes only partly motivated by prejudice. This article brings these under-researched conflicts to centre stage. Drawing on a study of community mediation in cases of 'hate conflicts', we explore the effects of prolonged processes of hate-motivated abuse on those involved -- the main parties and often the wider community. We provide evidence of two distinct 'types' of hate crime cases. The first looks at the persistent targeted abuse of vulnerable victims, while the second is characterized by multi-layered conflicts involving numerous disputants. In these latter cases, we argue, it is not always helpful, and sometimes not even possible, to label one party the 'perpetrator' and one the 'victim'. Indeed, we show that at times during long-term disputes, these roles are reversed and at other times they become meaningless. In both 'types' of hate conflict we explore the potential of community mediation to repair broken relationships and the harms caused by acts of hatred. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Effects of the 2008 Obama Presidential Campaign on White Racial Prejudice
AN  - 1283642392; 201304257
AB  - Research on the importance of race in the 2008 presidential campaign has focused almost exclusively on how white racial prejudice influenced vote choice. Instead, I test a theory about how mass public exposure to Obama influenced white racial prejudice. This is the first study to assess the impact of exposure to Obama on individual-level changes in prejudice using nationally representative panel data collected during the campaign. Throughout the campaign, innumerable images of Obama and his family contradicted negative racial stereotypes and changed the balance of black exemplars in mass media in a positive direction, thus causing reductions in prejudice among political television viewers. Exposure to Obama caused the largest reductions in prejudice among McCain supporters, Republicans, and conservatives. Although these individuals surely resisted Obama's political message, consistent with previous research, racial exemplars influence judgments without deliberative processing, thus minimizing resistance to counter-stereotypical portrayals. Because conservatives have more negative preexisting images of blacks, exposure to Obama countered their expectations far more than those with more positive expectations. Moreover, consistent with the psychological basis for mediated intergroup contact, even exposure to conservative programs that criticized Obama's politics reduced prejudice because these programs nonetheless portrayed him as countering negative racial stereotypes. Using three waves of panel data and fixed effects analyses of within-person change, I am able to make the strongest causal argument possible outside of experiments. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - What's the point? Anti-racism and students' voices against Islamophobia
AN  - 1023030338; 201225475
AB  - In a climate of Islamophobic racism, where media racism saturates our TV screens and newspapers, where racism on the streets, on campus, in our community become everyday realities, I ask, what can we -- teachers, lecturers and educationalists -- do in the work of anti-racism in education? This article examines classroom debates on Islamophobia by exploring the connections between student experiences and the wider social political issues and ideologies that create and re-enforce racism. The underlying interest for me is to examine the ways in which classroom interaction; dialogue and exchanges can undo racist thinking by informed anti-racist critique. This article has three sections; first, I discuss the multicultural and anti-racist discourses within education in the British context. I then go on to explore theoretical developments found in Critical Race Theory (CRT) as a tool for this anti-racism in education. In the second section I examine Islamophobia, the hatred of Muslims, as a measurement of current racism. My interest is to explore the meanings of Islamophobia, and its relevance to students lived realities. Media representation and text on Islamophobia are used as a way of pulling out the student views and lived experiences of such racism. In the final section I raise the question of 'what's the point of studying racism?' Here I discuss a class seminar on the viewing of a YouTube role play of a racist incident against a hijaab wearing woman. The point here is to unpack student's views and reactions to Islamophobia. I conclude that classroom discussions can be a place where anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-oppressive views emerge to inform the discussion for social justice in education.

T1  - Validity and reliability of the IAT: Measuring gender and ethnic stereotypes
AN  - 907925975; 201125111
AB  - The Implicit Association Test (IAT) was developed in response to reports of low validity of explicit (self-report) measures of attitudes, stereotypes, and prejudices. Usually, people are unwilling to report what they think and feel about other races, groups, and nationalities. The IAT has been written about in many books, newspapers, journal articles, websites, and has been featured frequently on radio and television many times; its web site has now reached a peak of 5 million visits. However, despite this popularity its validity and particularly its reliability is under question. This article reports on the validity and reliability of the IAT. Four different experiments were conducted on 150 students at California State University, Long Beach to investigate the temporal reliability of IAT. Also students' opinion (trust) about the validity and reliability of the test was evaluated. The results showed that while there are numerous reports of moderate validity of the test, its reliability as measured in this study, particularly for the first time users, is relatively low. Familiarity with similar tests, however, improves its reliability. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

AN  - 896217819; 201121955
AB  - Predictions from the stereotype content model (SCM; Fiske et al. 2002) that suggest high-status career women are perceived as competent but cold were tested with a sample of college students in California (N=294; 51% female; M age=21.49). Participants completed measures of sexism and attitude extremity, read a positive or negative article about a female senator, and rated her warmth and competence. Results indicate positive media coverage counteracts the competent but cold prediction of the SCM. In the context of negative media, extreme hostile sexism predicted evaluations of low warmth and competence; however, males with less extreme sexist attitudes had greater warmth and competence evaluations. Results are discussed in relation to the SCM and worldview confirmation hypothesis. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Effects of Intergroup Conflict and Social Contact on Prejudice: The Mediating Role of Stereotypes and Evaluations
AN  - 1545066711
AB  - This study explored the mediating role of stereotypes and evaluations in the relationships between intergroup conflict, social contact, and behavioral intentions to engage in intergroup contact. The hypotheses, derived from realistic group conflict theory and intergroup contact theory, were tested on samples of Arab and Jewish high school students in the context of an ethno-racial intergroup conflict. As hypothesized, the less participants perceived a conflict between the groups, and the greater their past contact with out-group members, the more they were willing to engage in intergroup contact. Moreover, stereotypes and evaluations mediated these effects in the Jewish sample. The implications of these findings for the study of the mechanisms underlying prejudice are discussed.

T1  - Beck-Styled Liberation: Bulletpoints and Bromides
AN  - 862595611; 201109423
AB  - Over the past several months, much to the chagrin of my family and friends, I have daily tuned into Glenn Beck's television program. Admittedly, I do not engage in this activity because I share in his political opinions indeed, I regard most of them as anathema rooted in half-truths and wild associations. I also do not view Mr. Beck's show because he is, in the words of Sarah Palin, "America's professor." As an adjunct professor of theology at a major Catholic university, I find that a majority of his theses do not adhere to the most basic rules for logical argument building. Rather, I begrudgingly turn on Fox News at 5:00 p.m. because Beck has begun to position himself as a burgeoning theologian. His forays into religion are not new: during the 2008 campaign he attacked, with extreme prejudice, Rev. Jeremiah Wright and the United Church of Christ (UCC). But, as of late, he has turned his attention to liberation theology, a system of thought about which, as I explain below, his understanding is incorrect. Yet he is using his hours of daily radio and television time to unleash a vitriolic and irresponsible attack on liberation theology, positioning it as a politico-religious palimpsest masking a Marxist plot to take over the United States. This is not hyperbole on my part; Beck has made these claims repeatedly. Nevertheless, it is important to understand that Beck presents himself as a political commentator and not a fledgling religion critic; his true intention is to lambast President Barack Obama because Obama is un-American. In many ways, Beck is unabashed about this goal. He has said several times since his August 28, 2010 "Restoring Honor Rally" that he "is not attacking anyone's faith," but just wants to understand what is happening to his country. This sentiment is belied by his actions; indeed, he is attacking the faith of President Obama. And as a follower of liberation theology and a member of the UCC, my own faith is assailed. While I would be a nebbish defender of Obama's political accomplishments, as a published theologian I feel called to enter into the fray of the current religious debate.

T1  - The Glocalization of Politics in Television: Fiction or Reality?
AN  - 743064723; 201027669
AB  - This article investigates the 'glocalization' of the US TV popular drama series The West Wing, while focusing on one (in some ways) exceptional episode. Because politics is inherently linked to language, discourse & communication, I will take an approach from the perspective of critical discourse analysis (the discourse-historical approach), with a particular focus on elements of argumentation theory & rhetoric, & combine this with media studies. More specifically, I attempt to illustrate how a thorough understanding of the topoi operating within the complex dialogues & interactions helps to reveal the series' (manifest & latent) political & didactic objectives, embedded in a longstanding tradition of conveying US American liberal values via films & TV. The episode analyzed in this article, Isaac & Ishmael (which was broadcast immediately after 9/11) is exceptional because it explicitly relates to salient real life events; its topical focus on the 'war on terror' shifts attention from US domestic politics to an issue that, according to US policy rhetoric, concerns the whole world. Thus, this episode links the debates taking place in one of the world's most famous institutions, The White House, with those occurring in workplaces across the world: a truly 'g/local' moment. The interdisciplinary analysis allows insight into the intricate & complex discursive construction of new glocal narratives, particularly in times of political crisis, revealing which norms are projected & recontextualized both locally & globally, given the many translations of the series worldwide.

T1  - Beyond Orientalism
AN  - 60351706; 201013169
AB  - Factors beyond the control of journalists and media organizations are essential in the construction of news about the Middle East. Ideology plays a role and so do ignorance and prejudice, but even when as a correspondent one knows the local language and is hypersensitive to the pitfalls of ethnocentrism and orientalism, still the coverage one produces often reinforces stereotypes. The cause seems to lie in the dilemmas inherent in the collection and representation of information, in particular in non-western, non-democratic contexts. A solution may be to embrace rather than obscure these dilemmas but this requires a fundamental rethink of what news is, both on the part of journalists and of audiences.

T1  - The glocalization of politics in television: Fiction or reality?
AN  - 1933213512
AB  - This article investigates the 'glocalization' of the US TV popular drama series The West Wing , while focusing on one (in some ways) exceptional episode. Because politics is inherently linked to language, discourse and communication, I will take an approach from the perspective of critical discourse analysis (the discourse-historical approach), with a particular focus on elements of argumentation theory and rhetoric, and combine this with media studies. More specifically, I attempt to illustrate how a thorough understanding of the topoi operating within the complex dialogues and interactions helps to reveal the series' (manifest and latent) political and didactic objectives, embedded in a longstanding tradition of conveying US American liberal values via films and TV.The episode analyzed in this article,  Isaac and Ishmael (which was broadcast immediately after 9/11) is exceptional because it explicitly relates to salient real life events; its topical focus on the 'war on terror' shifts attention from US domestic politics to an issue that, according to US policy rhetoric, concerns the whole world. Thus, this episode links the debates taking place in one of the world's most famous institutions, The White House , with those occurring in workplaces across the world: a truly 'g/local' moment. The interdisciplinary analysis allows insight into the intricate and complex discursive construction of new glocal narratives, particularly in times of political crisis, revealing which norms are projected and recontextualized both locally and globally, given the many translations of the series worldwide.
