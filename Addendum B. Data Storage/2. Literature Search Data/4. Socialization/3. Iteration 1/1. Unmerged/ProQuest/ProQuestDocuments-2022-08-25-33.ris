T1  - <i>Possible</i> Citizens: Migration Enforcement as the Performance of Citizenship in the United Arab Emirates: IMR
AN  - 2685962047
AB  - While most boundary-making studies examine native-born citizens’ opposition to immigration, this article explains why immigrants develop anti-immigrant attitudes. Under what conditions do previous generations of immigrants develop solidarity with newcomers? When might immigrants, instead, police national boundaries and oppose further immigration or naturalization? I argue that under uncertain citizenship status, long-term immigrants are unlikely to develop solidarity with newcomers, despite common experience with exclusionary citizenship policies. Drawing on interviews with naturalization applicants in the United Arab Emirates, this article analyses how policies that unevenly distribute rights and protections to non-citizens structure relationships between immigrant groups. Moving beyond citizen/non-citizen binaries, it calls attention to hierarchies among non-citizens, examining how long-term immigrants with partial and conditional rights police national boundaries to navigate exclusionary policies. When states restrict citizenship, making it a scarce good, immigrants may respond to uncertainty by competing and, thus, limiting access to that good for newcomers. When naturalization is arduous, applicants face pressures to continually perform citizenship to prove that they deserve inclusion. Naturalization applicants lacked citizenship, but they immigrated to the UAE before the establishment of its guest-worker program and claimed Emirati identity by differentiating themselves from “migrant workers.” I show how migration enforcement and boundary-policing factored into their perceptions and performances of what it meant to be a “good” Emirati citizen. Ethnic hierarchies and the timing of migration created distinctions between immigrants eligible for naturalization and those who were not. The mere possibility of inclusion in the citizenry may generate hierarchies between immigrants, precluding solidarity, and encouraging boundary-policing.

T1  - Past and Present Intergroup Contact and Conflict Among Inhabitants of Former Mixed Villages of Cyprus: The Role of Individual and Collective Experiences in Predicting Attitudes and Trust
AN  - 2688528799
AB  - Positive attitudes and trust towards former adversaries facilitate reconciliation and peace building. Both historical and current intergroup experiences such as intergroup contact and conflict predict intergroup attitudes and trust, but no previous research has investigated the joint effects of these experiences. Therefore, we study the interplay of positive intergroup contact preceding conflict, negative experiences of the conflict, and positive intergroup contact following conflict. Drawing on social representations theory and using a multilevel design, we highlight the importance of both individual and collective experiences. We examine the effects of such experiences on intergroup attitudes and trust among a large sample of Greek Cypriots (N = 802) and Turkish Cypriots (N = 718) from 54 formerly ethnically mixed villages in the context of a protracted and frozen conflict in Cyprus. Present‐day individual contact related to more positive attitudes and higher trust regardless of participants’ past experiences of conflict or contact. Furthermore, past collective contact experiences predict more positive attitudes and higher trust, whereas past collective conflict experiences predicted more negative attitudes and lower trust. Finally, present‐day contact closes the gap in trust between respondents with low and high past contact. Overall, both current and historical and individual and collective experiences matter.

T1  - Interpersonal bonds with fellow nationals, blind patriotism and preference for Immigrants' acculturation
AN  - 2687741535
AB  - Strong interpersonal bonds between group members have been found to either increase intergroup antipathy or improve intergroup attitudes, depending on the intergroup situation. However, the question of whether close ties with fellow group members can contribute positively and negatively to intergroup attitudes at the same time remains unexplored. We explore this question in the context of a national group taking the example of Finns' acculturation attitudes toward immigrants. One adolescent sample (N = 401) and one adult student sample (N = 285) completed surveys assessing these factors. Across both studies, strong interpersonal bonds with fellow nationals showed a negative effect on acculturation attitudes toward immigrants via an increase in blind patriotism. At the same time, interpersonal bonds also had a direct and positive effect on attitudes toward contact with Finns and (among younger respondents only) attitudes toward cultural maintenance. Our results indicate that the strength of interpersonal bonds with fellow nationals has simultaneous and opposing associations with acculturation attitudes via a combination of direct and indirect pathways. Based on these results we argue that groups can be simultaneously both caring and moral communities.

T1  - Foreign Accents in the Early Hiring Process: A Field Experiment on Accent-Related Ethnic Discrimination in Germany: IMR
AN  - 2646910615
AB  - Based on a field experiment conducted in Germany between October 2014 and October 2015, this article focuses on the disadvantages associated with the presence of a foreign accent in the early hiring process, when applicants call in response to a job advertisement to ask whether the position is still available. We examine whether a foreign accent influences employers’ behaviors via productivity considerations and/or whether foreign-accented speech is related to statistical discrimination or tastes among employers or customers that translate into differential treatment. To address these processes, we supplement our field-experimental data with information on job and firm characteristics from the texts of vacancy announcements and advertising companies’ homepages, on labor supply from the Federal Employment Agency, and on anti-immigrant attitudes from the German General Social Survey. Results suggest that while calling with a Turkish name did not result in a lower rate of positive replies, this rate was reduced for candidates who called with a Turkish accent. Turkish-accented applicants were told more often than the advertised position was already filled. Our findings suggest that the difference in response rates was not due to productivity considerations related to how well individuals understood foreign-accented speakers. Instead, results support the notion that the observed disadvantages were linked to discrimination based on employers’ ethnic tastes. While we found no indications pointing to the relevance of customer tastes or statistical discrimination, we cannot rule out these processes altogether. Our findings demonstrate that language cues can be more relevant than applicants’ names in shaping employers’ initial responses. They, thereby, highlight the need to consider multiple ethnic cues and different stages of the hiring process.

T1  - Female perpetrated domestic violence against men and the case for Bangladesh
AN  - 2657157093
AB  - Whilst domestic violence against women receives significant international attention and prominence within the scholarly, media and policy discourses, much silence and reservation is evident in the case of domestic violence against men by women. The dominant societal notion portrays women as the natural victims and men as perpetrators, making it challenging to contextualize men’s experiences of domestic violence in the intimate relationship. Against this backdrop, using Bangladesh as a case study, this article highlights key factors contributing to the silences, subjugations and controversies associated with domestic violence against men in order to present the state of current knowledge for such violence. Currently, there is a paucity of scholarly information on domestic violence against men and policy, legal and social supports available for these victims require attention. It is thus, suggested to break the social prejudice associated with such violence and adopt appropriate policy and legal interventions including gender-neutral laws to protect men at home from violence perpetrated by women.

T1  - State approaches towards managing ethnic diversity in Myanmar and Malaysia: British legacies, postcolonial nationalism and contemporary issues
AN  - 2624027645
AB  - A lasting legacy of colonial rule across the world is the political salience of ethnicity in many modern postcolonial nation-states. Upon independence, these nation-states had to grapple with the challenging task of nation-building amidst often tense inter-ethnic group relations. This article examines and compares the state approaches towards ethnic diversity of two former British colonies in Southeast Asia – Myanmar and Malaysia. It finds that in both countries, the key similarity is that the state has favoured the numerically dominant ethnic group in its policies. However, while the main ethnic divisions in Myanmar are within the indigenous ethnic groups, the Malaysia’s ethnic divisions lie along an indigenous/non-indigenous dichotomy. Given the long histories of these ethnic divisions, any long-term solution will be challenging, but is arguably not impossible. A closer analysis of nationalist concepts in Myanmar and Malaysia suggests that moving towards a more civic form of nationalism is possible.

T1  - Two tales of two protests: Principled and partisan attitudes toward politically charged protests
AN  - 2618401653
AB  - The First Amendment of the United States Constitution protects individual's right to protest, but people tend to have differing attitudes toward protests depending on the issue being protested. Across two studies we examined general attitudes toward protests, racial attitudes, and political ideology as predictors of support for two separate pairs of recent, politically distinct protest actions. In Study 1, participants provided attitudes toward the 2017 Charlottesville and 2016 NFL protests. In Study 2, attitudes toward the 2020 George Floyd and COVID‐19 lockdown protests were assessed. In both studies, support was highest for protests aligned with political ideology, and racial prejudice consistently emerged as a predictor of protest support, even for the COVID‐19 lockdown protest that was not explicitly racially motivated. These findings provide further evidence of prejudice being a political force and partisan beliefs biasing understandings of social issues.

T1  - National identity, cosmopolitanism, and attitudes toward immigrants
AN  - 2605153851
AB  - This study examines the effects of national and cosmopolitan self-identity on xenophobic attitudes across 33 countries with a multilevel analysis of data from the National Identity Module III of the International Social Survey Programme. Of primary interest is how country contexts are intertwined with the sense of national belonging to predict individuals’ anti-immigrant attitudes. The study finds that individuals with a stronger ethnicity-based national identity tend to evidence stronger xenophobia. Net of the individual-level effect of ethnic national identity, citizens of countries with a higher average of ethnic national identity also tend to be more xenophobic. Interestingly, the link between ethnic national identity and xenophobia is stronger in countries where this perspective is not shared as strongly. In the seemingly more ‘open’ country context, individuals’ belief in the requirement of ancestral roots for national membership may entail stronger exclusivism as a fringe ideology.

T1  - Are emotionally intelligent people less prejudiced? The importance of emotion management skills for outgroup attitudes
AN  - 2559690634
AB  - People vary in their ability to understand, process, and manage information about one's own and others’ emotions, a construct known as Emotional Intelligence (EI). Past research highlighted the importance of EI in interpersonal relations as well as the key role of emotions underlying outgroup prejudice. Remarkably, hardly any research has investigated the associations between EI and outgroup prejudice. In three studies (total N = 922) conducted in Spain and the United Kingdom, we measured emotional intelligence using self‐report and performance tests and prejudice toward a variety of outgroups. Results showed that those with stronger performance‐based emotion management skills expressed lower generalized ethnic prejudice (Studies 1–3), more positive attitudes toward immigrants (Study 2a) and refugees (Study 2b), and less homophobic attitudes (Study 3). This negative association between emotion management and prejudice was found with different performance‐based EI measures and held after controlling for self‐perceived EI (Study 1) and self‐reported abilities to regulate emotions (Study 3). Study 3 further demonstrated that higher empathy partly accounted for the association between emotion management and prejudice. The findings suggest that emotion management abilities play an important, but so far largely neglected role in generalized prejudice.

T1  - At the forefront of racial tolerance?: African-Americans and high school football in Iowa in the 1930s
AN  - 2518073221
AB  - In the upper Midwest, at least until the late 1930s, there was a modest presence of black athletes in American football and track and field in particular, with a smaller number in basketball and other sports. We know a great deal about how the post-war desegregation in professional baseball and football began to slowly change the landscape of elite American sports. But despite this overarching national narrative of small numbers of black athletes in integrated sports in the north and segregated structures in the south, we still know very little about specific contexts, especially at the high school level where the vast majority of organized sporting competition is held in the USA Key questions remain: was there a qualitative difference between the treatment of African-American athletes in different regions of the United States during the first four decades of the twentieth century? Was there a difference in racial attitudes in places where African-Americans were resident in small numbers such as in the towns and medium sized cities of the upper Midwest? Indeed, Iowa was regarded as relatively welcoming of African-American athletes by the 1930s whether that reputation was fully deserved or not. In this article we examine this question from a case study point of view.

T1  - Economic conditions and perceptions of immigrants as an economic threat in Europe: Temporal dynamics and mediating processes
AN  - 2533167420
AB  - This article addresses the extent to which economic downturns influence the perception of immigrants as an economic threat and through which channels this occurs. Our primary objective is an investigation of the specific mechanisms that connect economic conditions to the perception of immigrants as a threat. We therefore also contribute to theoretical discussions based on group threat and realistic group conflict theory by exposing the dominant source of competition relevant to these relationships. Furthermore, we investigate whether people react more sensitive to short-term economic dynamics within countries than to the long-term economic circumstances. Our database comprises all waves of the European Social Survey from 2002 to 2017. The macro-economic indicators we use include GDP per capita, unemployment, and national debt levels, covering the most salient economic dimensions. We furthermore control for the country’s migration situation and aggregate party positions toward cultural diversity. Our results show that the dynamic short-term developments of the economy and migration within countries are of greater relevance for perceived immigrant threat than the long-term situation. In contrast, the long-term political climate appears to be more important than short-term changes in the aggregate party positions. Further mediation analyses show that objective economic conditions influence anti-immigrant attitudes primarily through individual perceptions of the country’s economic performance and that unemployment rates are of primary importance.

T1  - The political economy of individual-level support for the basic income in Europe
AN  - 2479005294
AB  - There is a long-standing debate in academic and policymaking circles about the normative merits and economic effects of a universal basic income (UBI). However, existing literature does not sufficiently address the question of which factors are associated with individual support for a UBI. While a large literature in political economy has focused on individual preferences for existing welfare state benefits, it has not analysed the case of a UBI. Using the eighth wave of the European Social Survey (ESS), this article seeks to remedy this gap by analysing individual support for a UBI in 21 European countries. The findings from logistic regression analyses with country fixed effects are partly consistent with the expectations of previous social policy and political economy literatures. Younger, low-income, left-leaning individuals and the unemployed are more likely to support a UBI. Individuals with positive views of benefit recipients and/or high trust in political institutions are also more supportive, while anti-immigration attitudes are associated with lower support. By contrast, the patterns across occupations are mixed and male respondents appear slightly more supportive. Trade union membership is not statistically significant, perhaps because of contradictory effects: unions typically support new welfare state policies but they also have a key role in many existing welfare state schemes and may worry about individuals’ attachment to the labour market. At the cross-national level, support tends to be higher where benefit activation is more pronounced and unemployment benefits less generous. These results suggest one possible reason why countries with high support for a UBI have not introduced it: the mixed support among the left means a pro-UBI coalition has to draw on right-wing voters who may support it only with lower taxes and/or extensive replacement of welfare state benefits, which in turn may further alienate parts of the left.

T1  - BOXING, RACE, AND BRITISH IDENTITY, 1945–1962
AN  - 2462386608
AB  - With a formal colour bar on British championships operating until 1948, boxing had long been a site of racial discrimination. The abolition of the sport's colour bar was recognition of the wrongness of racial exclusion and it was followed by a celebration of black fighters as local and national heroes. The sport became a rare space where black men could be spoken about, discussed, and celebrated without primary reference to their colour. However, race was never irrelevant, especially as the number of black boxers rose with wider patterns of migration. Race was thus widely discussed in boxing, although there was rarely open discussion of racism. This absence, along with black successes in the ring, masked deep levels of both structural and interpersonal prejudice. Racial differences remained accepted as common sense by white Britons. Indeed, immigration intensified racism in Britain, changing the perceived position of people of colour from exotic novelties to threats to society. Boxing is thus a reminder of the contradictory dynamics of race. Formal mechanisms of exclusion could be removed, while informal mechanisms intensified. Individuals could be celebrated, while people of colour as a group were looked down upon. Black achievements could simultaneously reinforce ideas of black inferiority.

T1  - Cross-group friendships, the irony of harmony, and the social construction of “discrimination”
AN  - 2390692846
AB  - Cross-group friendships are often assumed to be a panacea to intergroup conflict. However, the irony of harmony hypothesis suggests that friendships can have negative consequences for collective action and social change. We complement this research with accounts of cross-group friendship, using interviews and focus groups with minority (African-Caribbean and/ or gay) and majority (White and/ or heterosexual) participants (n = 54). Participants repeatedly deployed “friendship” as an idealized category such that what happened within friendship could not be constructed as discrimination. Majority participants said that anything that happened within friendship could only be a mistake/ misunderstanding that would be easy to rectify. Minority participants struggled to reconcile the category entitlements of friendship with the problematic experiences that they described, but constructing such experiences as “discrimination” presented practical, moral, and rhetorical difficulties. Harmonious cross-group friendship may therefore require that minorities become tolerant to discrimination, while simultaneously enabling majorities to warrant (ill-informed) claims.

The analysis will show how the internalization of dominant and subjugated sociopolitical discourses that conflate social class, race, ethnicity and culture, compounded the client’s existing psychological conflict and associated mental health symptoms. It will then discuss why the Integrated Sociopolitical and Psychological Analysis Model is a needed approach in direct clinical practice.

T1  - Señor Jim Crow Still Roosts in Cuba: A Comparative Analysis of Race and Resistance in the United States and Cuba
AN  - 2426551152
AB  - After touring Havana, Cuba, with a group of African American Scholars in the fall of 2019, I am inspired to identify the subtle and explicit racist experiences that we endured. A common message from those in the tourism industry is that Cubans love African Americans. This message was constant, yet it rang like a gong in our ears because the message did not match the treatment we received. In truth, this love was not for the African aspect of our identities but for the financial prosperity in the American part of our identities. The Cuban tour guide constantly announced the propaganda publicly that when Castro came to power in 1959 the government formally abolished racism. However, the undercurrent of racism saturated our visit. Proclaiming racism is abolished does not make it so; instead, the proclamation was an ostrich’s head in the sand. The obvious was ignored for the postulated utopian racial harmony indoctrination. Eradication of racism or other ‘isms’ involves a trajectory of social change from tolerance, then acceptance on the path to respectful inclusion. Centuries of racism are not whisked away with a few decades of government declaration and externally motivated pressure to change. These learned racially charged behaviors are derived from internal motivation and value systems that must be unlearned over time and across generations. Consequently, with the scholarship of other academics, I will utilize the self-determination theory to compare Cuba’s race politics with the United States’ own rocky history in confronting contentious race relations.

T1  - Australian Whiteness and Refugee Politics
AN  - 2392855501
AB  - This paper offers the historical context and a conceptual framework to understand how race has shaped Australia's identity, border and asylum politics. It examines how socially constructed whiteness has fostered a perceived need to exert strict and often violent control over the movement of people of colour in and around Australia. We outline the colonial foundations of Australian whiteness and how it has fostered anxiety and bigotry at Federation and during the First World War, in contemporary multicultural and Indigenous policies, and on sporting fields. Whiteness operates along horizontal axes that promote racist insecurities and vertical axes that promote racist hierarchies. An imperative for spatial and racial mastery also underpins the twenty‐first century militarization of Australia's migration policy, as exemplified in deterrence measures such as mandatory detention, excision, interdiction and offshore processing and resettlement. Moreover, this whiteness is present in paternalistic claims that border policies are motivated by a compulsion to save lives at sea. Understanding the distinctively anxious and punitive character of Australian refugee politics requires coming to terms with Australia's history of white authority and committing to displacing it from the prominent place that it holds in the national identity.

T1  - ROHINGYA CRISIS CONCLUDING STATEMENT
AN  - 2376924335
AB  - On 27-28 July 2019, the Department of Political Science and Sociology and the South Asian Institute of Policy and Governance of North South University in Dhaka, Bangladesh, together with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, sponsored and convened an international academic conference (a) to explore the challenges of responding to the Rohingya refugee crisis in southeast Bangladesh and (b) to consider reasonably practicable and sustainable solutions to the crisis. As noted in the Organizing Committee's call for papers, the Rohingya refugee crisis is an especially critical ongoing concern for Bangladesh as the host country, but also for the international community that provides humanitarian assis tance to more than a million refugees now living in temporary settlement camps. The significant financial and logistical burden of providing for the basic needs of men, women, and children is extraordinary under most circumstances of humanitarian care; but it is even more so in present case given that Bangladesh is a lower middle income country having little of its own resources disposable towards any long-term humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya. Clearly, these refugees await earnest conclusion of bilateral and multilateral diplomatic efforts with the hope of a voluntary and secure repatriation to their former homes in Myanmar. After two days of intense discussion in parallel sessions and plenaries engaging academics, government officials, and practitioners from the field, the Organizing Committee committed itself to providing this overview statement at the concluding session of the conference. It is important to provide the concerned public with a perspective on what was learned from this important meeting about both the challenges and the prospects for sustainable solution to the Rohingya crisis. The participants of the conference continue to believe, as was asserted even at the inception of the conference, that humanitarian action and national and regional security are inextricably linked. A feasible solution to the humanitarian crisis will have positive effect on the national security of the two principal countries involved as well as for regional political stability. Further, it is broadly recognized that while there are complex moral and legal issues of human rights to be settled, we uphold the principles of (1) non-refoulement and (2) a responsibility to protect persons rendered stateless due to armed conflict and forced displacement. We also assert a principled commitment to the undeniable fact that the Rohingya are a self-identifying ethnic group having verifiable historical roots in the territories from which they have been displaced. Accordingly, the Rohingya people have fundamental human rights that are to be protected as a matter of international law. We believe this to be so despite customary recognition of national sovereignty central to the policies adopted by both the government of Bangladesh and the government of Myanmar as they work to resolve the crisis.

T1  - Is civic nationalism necessarily inclusive? Conceptions of nationhood and anti‐Muslim attitudes in Europe
AN  - 2341350447
AB  - Despite the centrality of national identity in the exclusionary discourse of the European radical right, scholars have not investigated how popular definitions of nationhood are connected to dispositions toward Muslims. Moreover, survey‐based studies tend to conflate anti‐Muslim attitudes with general anti‐immigrant sentiments. This article contributes to research on nationalism and out‐group attitudes by demonstrating that varieties of national self‐understanding are predictive of anti‐Muslim attitudes, above and beyond dispositions toward immigrants. Using latent class analysis and regression models of survey data from 41 European countries, it demonstrates that conceptions of nationhood are heterogeneous within countries and that their relationship with anti‐Muslim attitudes is contextually variable. Consistent with expectations, in most countries, anti‐Muslim attitudes are positively associated with ascriptive – and negatively associated with elective (including civic) – conceptions of nationhood. Northwestern Europe, however, is an exception to this pattern: in this region, civic nationalism is linked to greater antipathy toward Muslims. It is suggested that in this region, elective criteria of belonging have become fused with exclusionary notions of national culture that portray Muslims as incompatible with European liberal values, effectively legitimating anti‐Muslim sentiments in mainstream political culture. This may heighten the appeal of anti‐Muslim sentiments not only on the radical right, but also among mainstream segments of the Northwestern European public, with important implications for social exclusion and political behaviour.

T1  - A divided nation? Ethnicity, name-calling and nicknames in cyber Ndebele soccer discourse in Zimbabwe
AN  - 2333839426
AB  - In Zimbabwe, ethnicity has long informed the ways people make sense of their membership to the nation. Sport has since the turn of the century emerged as one of the major sites for the performance of 'patriotic' and subversive notions of 'unity in diversity'. This article explores the significance of nicknaming and name-calling by Highlanders Football Club fans on virtual spaces, in illuminating the ethnic threat to dominant conceptions of nation in post-2000 Zimbabwe. The study argues that as psycho-social and cultural constructs, football team nicknames reveal deeper states of ethnic attitudes which indicate the politics of complex ethnic sentiments that destabilise popular notions of belonging to a nation.

T1  - About Language Policy in Latvia
TT  - О языковой политике в Латвии
AN  - 2445575064
AB  - Language policy is the attitude and plan of a country to indicate the existence of diversified language types in this country. The complexity of the historical tradition and social background of a multi-ethnic country often lead to a diversification of the language situations and corresponding language policies. The evolution of Latvian language policy has a complicated history. With the change of the political environment, the status planning of Latvian has experienced twists and turns. The history of Latvia has been seriously influenced by Germanization and Russianization, and the language life is bilingual or multilingual. After independence, Latvia made Latvian a national language for promotion and popularization. Russian is listed as a foreign language after English and German; however, the inheritance of Russian has a history of hundreds of years in Latvia. Due to special geographical reasons, political and linguistic issues in Latvia have always been intertwined with ethnic issues. The solution of language problem in Latvia should be based on the principle of respect for the tradition of language practice, for the language of each person in order to avoid social conflicts. Mass unrest, as a form of reflection of social conflicts, is inevitable from the point of view of the sociology of conflict.Alternate abstract:Языковая политика отражает отношение государства к языковому разнообразию в стране. В Латвии ее развитие обусловлено историческим процессом – статус латышского языка менялся в результате перемен в политическом положении страны, ее государственности. Германизация и русификация в языковой среде Латвии породили явления би- и мультилингвизма. После обретения независимости Латвией в конце ХХ в. латышский язык стал государственным, русский стал иностранным. Однако языковые проблемы Латвии связаны с этнополитическими. Избранная правящим классом современной Латвии модель языковой политики скорее свидетельствует о необходимости оптимизации на основе уважения к традиции языковой практики, к языковому праву каждого человека во избежание социальных конфликтов.

T1  - Witnesses/Bystanders: The Tragic Fruits of Passivity, the Power of Bystanders, and Promoting Active Bystandership in Children, Adults, and Groups
AN  - 2325245786
AB  - I briefly describe my experiences that gave rise to a life‐long motivation to work on these issues. I then discuss the roots of extreme violence by groups, focusing on passivity by witnesses/bystanders that allows the evolution of increasing violence, including genocide. As an example, I discuss the genocide in Rwanda, and describe work I and my associates have done there to help with healing and reconciliation after the genocide of 1994, and to prevent future violence. I then discuss reasons for bystander passivity and the power of bystanders to make a difference. I describe ways of generating caring, helping/active bystandership, first through positive socialization of children, in the home and in classrooms, and then the development of caring and helping in people who have suffered, “altruism born of suffering.” I then describe interventions based on research that promote active bystandership: the training of police officers to prevent or stop unnecessary harmful behavior by fellow officers, with a successful example in New Orleans; the training of students to stop fellow students from harming others; an intervention in Amsterdam to improve relations between ethnic Dutch and Muslims after intense violence there. In the latter instance, the city government was the primary active bystander. I mention my colleagues’ and my theory and research on constructive (vs. blind) patriotism, and the special relevance of different forms of patriotism in the United States under the Trump Presidency.

T1  - An online experiment on the influence of online user comments on attitudes toward a minority group
AN  - 2318594529
AB  - In recent years, there is interest in examining the effects of user comments on online content consumers' attitudes and perceptions. Building on theoretical foundations from social psychology and using an online experimental design, we investigated whether exposure to online comments attached to news content affects attitudes toward refugees. We recruited students from a public university in the Mediterranean region and, after administering a printed pretest on their attitudes toward refugees, we assigned them into three groups: one that read a series of positive comments about refugees (positive experimental group), one that read a series of negative comments about refugees (negative experimental group) and one that did not read comments (control group). The comments and a neutral reference news video were communicated to the participants via email during a five-day period after the pretest. After the implementation of the experimental stimuli, we administered a modified version of the pretest as a posttest. We found that exposure to positive comments reduced prejudice and that the intensity of prior prejudice was positively associated with the magnitude of prejudice reduction. Exposure to negative comments did not affect prejudice. A repeat posttest, administered one week after the posttest, showed stability of the observed attitude change.

T1  - Racial boundaries, stigma, and the re-emergence of “always being foreigners”: Iranians and the refugee crisis in Germany
AN  - 2240385562
AB  - The 2015 refugee crisis is at the center of public and political discourse across Europe, especially among nations that have accepted refugees. Utilizing ethnographic fieldwork and 48 in-depth interviews conducted in 2011 and 2016 with Iranians in Hamburg, Germany, this paper considers how the refugee crisis impacts the racial boundaries between Germans and immigrant communities. It details how the crisis has made ethnic nationalism, Islamophobia, anti-foreigner prejudice and racism more pronounced and salient throughout Germany. The interviews demonstrate that this climate affects Iranians in several ways: they cite feeling more threat and stigma, as well as experiences of marginality, perpetual foreignness, and discrimination. This research contributes to sociological scholarship on migration and race by examining how critical international events influence and shape processes of racialization, identity and belonging, and social boundaries and hierarchies.

T1  - Précis of The Evolution of Moral Progress: A Biocultural Theory
AN  - 2389429985
AB  - The idea of moral progress played a central role in liberal political thought from the Enlightenment through the nineteenth century but is rarely encountered in moral and political philosophical discourse today. One reason for this is that traditional liberal theorists of moral progress, like their conservative detractors, tended to rely on under-evidenced assumptions about human psychology and society. For the first time, we are developing robust scientific knowledge about human nature, especially through empirical psychological theories of morality and culture that are informed by evolutionary theory. On the surface, evolutionary accounts of morality paint a rather pessimistic picture of human moral nature, suggesting that certain types of moral progress are unrealistic or inappropriate for beings like us. Humans are said to be ‘hard-wired’ for tribalism. However, such a view overlooks the great plasticity of human morality as evidenced by our history of social and political moral achievements. To account for these changes while giving evolved moral psychology its due, we develop a dynamic, biocultural theory of moral progress that highlights the interaction between adaptive components of moral psychology and the cultural construction of moral norms and beliefs, and we explore how this interaction can advance, impede, and reverse moral progress.

T1  - Decolonizing the civic/ethnic binary
AN  - 2191802138
AB  - The founding works of nationalism theory identify two overarching categories of nationalism: civic and ethnic. While the former is lauded as liberal, inclusive, and rational, the latter is derided as regressive, restrictive, and exclusionary. More recent work on nationalism has problematized these characterizations, but has largely retained the civic/ethnic binary. This article critiques the civic/ethnic binary from the perspective of postcolonial theory. Drawing on de Sousa Santos’s abyssal line and Fanon’s zones of being and non-being, the article argues that the relationship between metropolis and empire is foundational to the relationship between civic and ethnic nationalism. Yet the category of civic nationalism obscures racialized patterns of exclusion within civic nations, such that the standards of inclusion within a civic nation are constructed on the basis of excluding the nation’s Others. Because civic nationalism is predicated on the creation and denial of Others, presenting civic nationalism as a global ideal is impossible. The article concludes by considering the promise of transnational social movements in the global South as an answer to both civic and ethnic nationalism.

T1  - Multiple Identities: Touchstones in Terrorism, Democratic Institutions, and the Rule of Law
AN  - 2264112450
AB  - This paper explores the underlying, foundational politico-social theories and themes that relate closely to radicalization, terrorism, democracy and the rule of law. It examines factors (touchstones) critical to these areas (political violence, terrorism, rule of law and democracy, along with democratic institutions). Some of these touchstones include the 'lenses' of identities, tribalism, and contrasts between identities, including cultural, linguistic, socialization and civilizational aspects.

T1  - Improving outgroup attitudes in schools: First steps toward a teacher‐led vicarious contact intervention
AN  - 2167016425
AB  - Despite the urgent need for promoting positive intergroup relations in schools, research on intergroup relations is not systematically translated into prejudice‐reduction interventions. Although prejudice‐reduction interventions in schools based on indirect contact have been conducted for decades, they have all been carried out by researchers themselves. In a field experiment in Finland in autumn 2015, we tested for the first time a vicarious contact prejudice‐reduction intervention for its effectiveness among adolescents (N = 639) when implemented independently by school teachers instead of researchers. In addition, we tested the extent to which the intervention's effect depends on initial outgroup attitudes, previous direct outgroup contact experiences, and gender, hypothesizing that the intervention improves outgroup attitudes particularly among adolescents with more negative prior attitudes and less positive prior direct contact, and more among girls than among boys. We found an unanticipated overall deterioration in the outgroup attitudes during intervention in both the experimental and control groups. However, attitudes seemed to deteriorate somewhat less in the experimental than in the control group, and the intervention had a significant positive effect on outgroup attitudes in one experimental subgroup that needed it most: girls who had negative rather than positive outgroup attitudes at the outset. We discuss our results in light of previous research and contextual particularities.

T1  - The Power-Sharing Model in Theory and Practice: Lessons from Post-Conflict Macedonia (2001–2019)
AN  - 2355278996
AB  - The Ohrid Peace Agreement, signed between the central government in Skopje and the guerrilla army of ethnic Albanians after the armed ethnic conflict in Macedonia in 2001, has largely changed the constitutional framework of the previous political system. The so-called Westminster, or majoritarian, democracy established by the 1991 Constitution, which favoured the country's ethnic majority (the Macedonians amount to 64% of the population), was fundamentally changed. A new model has been set up, known in political theory and practice relevant to such situations, as power-sharing. In the last 18 years, this model has demonstrated its advantages as well as its disadvantages. Under the umbrella of the so-called international community, which invested in the stabilization of this part of the Balkans (especially in Bosnia, Kosovo, Albania, Serbia and North Macedonia), this model of ethnic quotas and proportionality, decentralization, preferential policies and right of minority veto, contributed to inter-ethnic peace and a fragile balance of power. But the past 19 years has been a sufficiently long time for a critical assessment of the model, which has turned out to be largely reduced to corrupt governance. On February 9, 2015, the opposition party, Social Democratic Alliance (SDSM) publicly released a total of 36 packets of illegally made recordings of telephone conversations, including those of the Prime Minister, government ministers, holders of high public offices, mayors, deputies, the parliamentary speaker, opposition leaders, judges, the public prosecutor, civil servants, journalists, editors and media owners. These recordings had been made by the national intelligence services, at that time controlled by the ruling right-wing party VMRO-DPMNE (IMRO-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity). As a result of this massive abuse of human rights, after the elections in December 2016, VMRO-DPMNE was unable to form a government and the mandate was handed to the party with the second largest number of votes, SDSM (Social Democratic Union of Macedonia). A new coalition government, composed of SDSM and the party of ethnic Albanians, Democratic Union for integration (DUI), was able in two years to solve the most difficult and persistent problems – the country's disputes with neighboring Bulgaria and Greece, and to fast-track the country's membership in NATO and the EU. For the first time, citizens were divided not along ethnic lines but along ideological and political ones. They were either pro-Western or anti-Western (which meant pro-status quo). We have yet to see whether the thesis will be confirmed that, when citizens feel more secure, they are more inclined to be tolerant toward minorities, more sensitive to ethnic diversity and ready to adapt to the situation.

T1  - Diplomacy and Motivation in the Political Discourse
AN  - 2247533136
AB  - Communication and politics are consubstantial. Communication relationships are inseparable from power relations, which, by their form and content, depend on the material or symbolic power accumulated by political institutions and agencies engaged in these relations. Political communication has as a specific the manifestation of a tension between cooperation and conflict. Political discourse allows for agreement, but the same kind of speech promotes conflict and domination. Whether persuasion or conviction, negotiation or intimidation is desired, recourse to political language is an alternative to physical violence. Public space has a conflicting character, but compromise is negotiated within its perimeter. Differences are balanced, the representation of those who are not in power becomes more lenient, those in power regulate their discourse. What is dominant in political communication is the word, written or spoken. In society, any problem can become politics. Politics evolves into the dynamics of economic, social, cultural, religious, ethnic, linguistic stakes. Political activity is focused on the emergence of collective issues, the formulation of questions addressed to public authorities, the development of solutions, the conflict between these projects and their regulation. In each of these processes communication is involved and its contribution to political activity is omnipresent, whether it is socialization and participation, agenda development, mobilization or negotiation. Communication impregnates all political activity to the extent that almost all such behaviors involve the recourse to some form of communication. The specificity of contemporary political relations and activities is the political belief crisis, which forces political people, as Gabriel Thoveron said, to invest more and more in the communication: "as soon as there is any difficulty between them and those who mandate them, it is considered to be a communication problem, to convince citizens of the basis of their acts or decisions."

T1  - Are education and nationalism a happy marriage? Ethno-nationalist disruptions of education in Dutch classrooms
AN  - 2187133745
AB  - Following Gellner, citizenship education has often been framed in terms of nationalism. This framing is supported by methodological nationalism that legitimizes nationalism as either functional (civic nationalism) or natural (ethnic nationalism). Based on a triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data, this study of the dynamics in the classes of a Dutch faculty of social professions highlights the disruptive impact of nationalism on citizenship education, spilling over to other courses as well. Ethno-nationalist discourses in Dutch media and politics as well as in multiculturalism approaches used in citizenship education fuel conflicts between non-migrant students and students with a migration background that disrupt education. It is argued that in globalized settings like these classes, a more viable approach to citizenship education would take an institutional instead of communitarian perspective.

T1  - Identifications of Individual. Territorial Communities and Social Space an Attempt of Conceptualisation
AN  - 2177122230
AB  - Each individual or human collective determines their place in the world taking into account geospatial units of different nature (administrative-territorial, ethno-territorial, geopolitical, civilisational, etc.) and on the various geographical scales (local, regional, national, subnational, and global). In the scientific research on the relations between individuals and social groups with geographical space, attention is paid to comprehension of the connections between human consciousness, perception and identification. The authors attempt to conceptualize this issue, emphasizing differences in the interpretation of identity in a spatial context. Significant nuances, at the individual and socio-territorial level, in discrepancies between consciousness, identification, identity and power are underlined. At the supranational level, three possible variants of relations are discussed. The first refers to the construction of a regional association based on the geographical proximity of participating subjects. It has pluralistic nature. In such cases, as European Union, preservation of national identity and cultural traditions are highlighted. In the second case, ethno-territorial groups realize their common identity (as Balkan people and countries), but they do not aspire to deepen cooperation and regional integration. It is possible to distinguish the third type – a supra-national community, projected and proclaimed by one force with post-imperial ambitions. This is the case of Turkish Neo-Ottomanism. In addition to theoretical conceptualization of the above mentioned issues, relevant examples from the post-socialist states of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe are discussed. The practical significance of territorial identity in its spatial aspect, including relations of ethnic and national identity with the territory, is also stressed.

T1  - Diversity exposure in preschool: Longitudinal implications for cross-race friendships and racial bias
AN  - 2178947827
AB  - Intergroup contact among young children has implications for improving racial attitudes and social inclusion. This study examined associations between children's (N = 670) racial biases and cross-race friendships, and whether diverse people and materials in the preschool classroom predicted children's racial biases or cross-race friendships in first or third grades. Results demonstrated weak-moderate stability in racial biases and cross-race friendship across elementary school. First-grade cross-race friendship predicted lower third-grade racial bias, but not vice versa. Exposure to diverse people in preschool was associated with greater odds of having a cross-race friend in first-grade, which predicted the likelihood of having a cross-race friend and lower levels of racial bias in third grade. Diverse materials predicted lower levels of racial bias in first grade, which predicted third-grade racial bias. Results suggest that educators can promote intergroup friendships and positive attitudes by increasing children's exposure to diverse people and materials in the preschool classroom.

T1  - Practice recommendations for addressing racism: A content analysis of the counseling psychology literature
AN  - 2139499053
AB  - Although racism persists as a significant public health issue that adversely impacts the mental health of people of color (U.S. Department of Health and Human Service, 2001), there has been very little systematic guidance for mental health professionals to address racism through practice (S. Harrell, 2000). Therefore, we conducted a content analysis of the peer reviewed counseling psychology literature-the first of its kind-to provide a summary and critique of the extant practice recommendations and facilitate the development and enhancement of practice efforts aimed at addressing racism. We reviewed racism-related articles published in the Journal of Counseling Psychology, The Counseling Psychologist, and Counseling Psychology Quarterly and identified 73 relevant articles, of which 51 provided practice recommendations. Based on our review of this literature, we identified eight general categories of recommendations for addressing racism: psychoeducation, validation, self-awareness and critical consciousness, critical examination of privilege and racial attitudes, culturally responsive social support, developing positive identity, externalize/minimize self-blame, and outreach and advocacy. We found that most recommendations within each category were at the individual level with far fewer at the group and systemic level. A critique of recommendations is provided along with suggestions for developing and bolstering practice, research, and consultation efforts aimed at addressing racism.

T1  - Symbolic Racism, Institutional Bias, and Welfare Drug Testing Legislation: Racial Biases Matter
AN  - 2095253703
AB  - Since the devolution of welfare policymaking to the states after the passage of the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, there has been contentious debate about drug testing welfare applicants. Beyond elite rhetoric and debate points about the implications of welfare drug testing, extant research remains limited insofar as providing theoretical understanding about what factors influence state proposal of legislation requiring welfare applicants to submit to drug tests. I develop and test expectations that derive from research on welfare attitudes, social construction theory, and policy design—specifically, hypotheses that the proportion of blacks on state temporary assistance for needy families caseloads, as well as state‐aggregate levels of symbolic racism, significantly influence state proposal of drug testing legislation. My multilevel analysis of every state proposal of welfare drug testing legislation from 2008 to 2014 yields strong evidence in support of these hypotheses and paints a more complete picture of the influence of racial attitudes on state welfare policymaking. Specifically, while much research finds evidence of institutional racial biases in the implementation of welfare policy, the evidence presented herein shows that these biases, as well as public biases, influence policymaking at the proposal stage. Implications of these findings are discussed in light of recent significant electoral gains made by Republicans in state legislatures.

T1  - THE INSTRUMENTAL FUNCTION OF GENDERED CITIZENSHIP AND SYMBOLIC POLITICS IN THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF LABOR RIGHTS FOR MIGRANTS
AN  - 2159624570
AB  - Following Choo (2016), this article advances the notion that the rules regulating gendered citizenship may function as a tool of exclusion, isolating outsiders from individuals whom the state and society consider deserving of rights and respectability. We are interested in how prior research investigated the idea that migrant people and other civil society participants catalyze diverse material and moral resources to assert rights and acceptance. Social disparities of gender, race, class, and nation determine the constituting of citizenship worldwide. Empirical and secondary data are employed to support the claim that as the frontiers of nation-states have become gradually indefinite, rising amounts of noncitizens live close by citizens, supplying a political incentive to allocate citizenship rights to migrant people and strengthening anti-immigrant attitudes and social disparities. Our research makes conceptual and methodological contributions to the conception that the societal principles of gender, race, and labor influence vigorous mechanisms of citizenship-making.

T1  - Cultural nationalism and everyday resistance in an illiberal nationalising state: ethnic minority nationalism in Russia
AN  - 2086131358
AB  - Ethnic minority nationalism has always been one of the most important subfields of nationalism studies, yet it lacks the consideration in illiberal settings. Limitations of civil liberties and restrictive legislation have undoubtedly affected the existence and the ways to express minority nationalism when it is considered a threat to authoritarian government, which is the case of the contemporary Russian Federation. The paper provides a methodological framework that helps to investigate ethnic minority nationalism when its direct articulation is restricted. It argues that the combination of a cultural nationalism approach and complexity theory can be a fruitful way to explore minority nationalism in an illiberal nationalising state using the case of Russian ethnic minorities. It also argues that the complex context of authoritarianism and market economy creates tipping points towards the growing importance of ethnic minority identification as a basis for social solidarity.

T1  - A sociological look at the evolution of recent scholarship on ethnic conflicts
AN  - 2054453458
AB  - It is commonly held that there was increased scholarly interest in ethnic conflicts following the end of the Cold War, though what this greater interest has meant in terms of the evolution of this subfield in subsequent decades has rarely been studied. To fill this gap, this article looks at all articles (n = 246) on the causes of ethnic conflicts, out of a total of 20,105 articles published in 30 key journals between 1990 and 2012. Adopting a sociological stance, it argues that the subfield expanded over the period. However, ethnic conflict literature appears to have been at key points largely driven by external factors. There is also indication that duels as opposed to dialogue were the modus operandi for this period. Overall, the broad notion of expansion needs to be nuanced in light of some concerning trends behind the subfield’s sociological evolution.

T1  - Much more than airtime: radio strategies to foster an inclusive Latino identity in the Basque country
AN  - 2046624436
AB  - New opportunities for launching media projects targeting minority migrant audiences have emerged in the wake of international migration [Georgiou, Myria. 2001. "Mapping Diasporic Minorities and their Media in Europe. Studying the Media." A working paper for the EMTEL project "Diasporic Minorities and Their Media: A Mapping." http://www.lse.ac.uk/media@lse/research/EMTEL/minorities/papers/]. However, most start-up enterprises in this category fail to develop effective strategies for establishing a dialogue between the minority audiences they serve and the native-born local populations. This paper, which examines the role radio plays in the integration of newcomers to the Basque Country, analyses the successful programming and outreach initiatives of Candela Radio in Bilbao, Spain, as well as the barriers to multiculturalism that must be overcome in complex societies like the Basque Country, in which deeply rooted traditions and values [Shafir, Gershon. 1995. Immigrants and Nationalists: Ethnic Conflict and Accommodation in Catalonia, the Basque Country, Latvia and Estonia. New York: State University of New York Press] are inextricably bound to language. The results of this qualitative study indicate that publically funded Radio Candela has not only managed to construct an audience that bridges the traditional gap between local migrant and native communities but is also actively fostering the development of a hybrid Latino-Basque identity.

T1  - Life Quality of University Students From Immigrant Families in the United States
AN  - 2048227157
AB  - The numbers of university students from immigrant families have been increasing in the United States, yet little research exists on factors influencing their life quality. Self‐report data were collected from 2,210 students from one university in California. Direct effects of four contextual stressors (i.e., ethnic discrimination, parent–child cultural conflict, family disengagement, and family financial stress) were examined in relation to life quality. Also, the potential moderating and mediating role of perceived stress was examined, as well as the potential moderating role of students' generational status. The results provided strong support for mediation, showing contextual stressors influenced students' life quality through their perceived stress. Some evidence was found for moderation, showing the complex role of perceived stress. Generational status did not play a moderating role.

T1  - The Brief Peer Conflict Scale: Psychometric Properties Among a Sample of Incarcerated Male Juvenile Offenders
AN  - 2041071967
AB  - Aggression can be considered a multidimensional construct that influences various forms of antisocial behavior, including juvenile delinquency and conduct problems. The aim of the present study was to assess the psychometric properties of the Brief Peer Conflict Scale–20 item version (PCS-20) among a Portuguese forensic sample (N = 192) of incarcerated male juvenile offenders (M = 16.62 years; SD = 1.52 years; age range = 13-18 years). The PCS-20 demonstrated good psychometric properties in terms of its four-factor structure, internal consistency, convergent validity, and discriminant validity that generally justify its use among incarcerated male youth. The findings provide additional support for the extension of the PCS-20 across different cultures, ethnic groups, and samples.

T1  - The Effect of Segregation on Intergroup Relations
AN  - 2021700588
AB  - Inter-ethnic residential segregation is correlated with intergroup bias and conflict, poorly functioning states and civil societies, weak economic development, and ethnocentric political behavior. As such, segregation has been a subject of long-standing interest. However, segregation has not been assigned in randomized controlled trials, so the observed correlations may be spurious and the mechanism behind these correlations is poorly understood. In two experiments, we randomly assign segregation in a laboratory and demonstrate that segregation affects perceptions of other people and causes intergroup bias in costly decision-making. Rather than segregation merely inhibiting intergroup contact, we demonstrate that segregation directly affects perception and thus can affect intergroup relations even when holding contact constant.

T1  - Division on Ice: Shared Space and Civility in Belfast
AN  - 2017950441
AB  - In Northern Ireland the Good Friday Agreement brought with it top-down political and social approaches to construct and increase intergroup contact and shared spaces in an effort to reconcile divided Nationalist and Unionist communities. In the period following the peace agreement, the Belfast Giants ice hockey team was established, and its games have become one of the most attended spectator activities in Belfast, trending away from the tribalism, single-space, single-class, and single-gender dynamics of modern sport in Northern Ireland. This article utilises the setting of the Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) Arena, home of the Giants, to demonstrate normalisation of interactions occurring between supporters who are willing to purchase a ticket beside someone to whom they are politically opposed. This sport and its supporters choose to enjoy the experience of the hockey game, rather than be caught in the politicised attachment of meaning expected of shared space, offering a challenge to the reconciliation-centric assumptions in post-peace agreement Belfast.

T1  - Fear of small numbers? Immigrant population size and electoral support for the populist radical right in Switzerland
AN  - 2012857522
AB  - In this paper, we examine the association between contact with migrant populations and support for the populist radical right (PRR) in Switzerland. Building on group threat and intergroup contact theories, which offer opposing predictions, and drawing on Appadurai's thesis of the 'fear of small numbers', we propose a new theoretical framework to explain this association. We predict that the relationship between the size of the migrant populations and PRR voting is nonlinear: a small but noticeable minority triggers the formation of anti-immigrant attitudes, which soften as the minority grows and people start having meaningful interactions with foreigners. To test these theories, we combine individual-level data with municipality-level information. Mixed-effects multilevel models confirm that individuals in municipalities with a moderate proportion of foreigners are more likely than those with fewer or a greater number of migrants to cast their vote in support of PRR parties; this is particularly so for certain stigmatised minorities. We further explore the effect of perceived immigrant threat in moderating these relationships.

T1  - Introduction: rethinking reconciliation and transitional justice after conflict
AN  - 1993976047
AB  - The concepts of reconciliation and transitional justice are the foundations for a new body of connected normative meta-theories that address conflict transformation and peace building. The articles in this special issue provide a comparative perspective on the concepts and their implementation. The articles are primarily focused on intra-state conflicts. A range of cases involving different types of conflict are included, including those driven by ethnic, racial, religious and ideological factors, and different regimes from authoritarian to democratic states, and cases where colonial legacies and mentalities endure. The articles offer critical reflections on the contradictory logics between external construction of norms and the efforts at their domestic imposition, adoption, and distortion and obstruction in conflict states and societies. These processes are not linear but vary over time. The ambiguities in the concepts are also often magnified by political considerations, which make the peace processes new stages in the conflict.

T1  - The use of sport in the Arab-Israeli conflict
AN  - 1975990167
AB  - This article explores the use of sport in the formation of an Israeli cultural (multi-ethnic) identity and its historical and contemporary place in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The power of sporting events lies in the fact that the teams represent for their fans an ideology beyond the game itself. Supporting a sports team is a primary form of identity for many people. Highly salient sporting events, which are supercharged with emotion and garner eager interest, are also a venue for achieving political objectives on the local, national, and international levels.

T1  - Sociolinguistic Indexicalities in Ethnic Diversity: Perceptions of Ethnicity and Language in Suriname
AN  - 2056022885
AB  - Ethnicity and language have often been considered jointly on the ground of their intrinsic interrelation: hard ethnic boundaries are manifested by the use of heritage languages, while dynamics of assimilation reduce the need to linguistically project ethnic distinctness. The tension between ethnolinguistic separation and integration has mostly been studied in the context of immigration, and to a lesser extent in the context of national minorities. By contrast, it has been much less discussed in relation to historically multiethnic states where the imperative of national cohesion often calls for the use of a lingua franca that is perceived as ethnically neutral. The national context that this article discusses is Suriname, a postcolonial, multiethnic society today still marked by a segregationist heritage, where the imagery of national unity rests to a large extent on the use of Dutch-the former colonizer's language-as a formal lingua franca, which superimposes itself upon heritage languages, including Sranan Tongo, commonly portrayed as the country's informal lingua franca. The general question that this article raises is to what extent historical ethnolinguistic boundaries are eroding in Suriname. To answer this question, this study analyzes perceptions of ethnolinguistic distinctions elicited from a sample of young Surinamese informants from Suriname's capital city, Paramaribo, building on a previous qualitative survey held by Monique C. Menzo (2012). The article is organized as follows. First, I provide a theoretical perspective on the interrelation between ethnicity and language in general, before providing sociolinguistic background information on Suriname. The next section presents the sample of informants recruited for the study, and the interview protocol used for eliciting sociolinguistic perceptions from them. The analysis of the data is subdivided into three sections. First, I deal with social categories-ethnic and other-perceived as salient by the informants. Next, I focus on the perceived linguistic attributes of Surinamese ethnicities expressed in terms of mainly language knowledge and language dominance. The next two sections describe perceived linguistic conventions and the extent to which these conventions seem constrained by ethnicity. Finally, I summarize the findings and place them in the perspective of other, comparable sociolinguistic environments.

AB  - The article reviews the present state of interdisciplinary analysis of the conflict resolution strategy in the North Caucasus. The goal of the research is to analyse the underlying theoretical concepts, constructive methods and peacebuilding strategies for resolving ethnic tensions in the region. The collapse of the USSR, the 'sovereignisation' of ethno-political subjects of the Russian Federation, the destruction of social and economic relations, strengthening of ethno-nationalistic tendencies and religious fundamentalism have been significant factors in the imbalanced position held by the Russian regions, their disintegration of all-Russian space. This article explores the main theoretical approaches to the study of conflict resolution strategy from a variety of interdisciplinary perspectives. It argues that a conflict resolution strategy as a civil integration resource is tool needed to overcome the deep-rooted ethnic conflicts in the unstable North Caucasus.Alternate abstract:V članku pregledamo trenutno stanje interdisciplinarne analize strategije reševanja konfliktov na Severnem Kavkazu. Cilj raziskave je analizirati temljne teoretske koncepte, konstruktivne metode in strategije izgradnje miru za reševanje etničnih napetosti v regiji. Razpad ZSSR, 'suverenizacija' etno-političnih subjektov Ruske federacije, uničenje družbeno-političnih odnosov, krepitev etno-nacionalističnih tendenc, verski fundamentalizem so bili pomembni dejavniki neravnovesij v položaju ruskih regij in dezintegracije vseruskega prostora. V članku raziščemo glavne teoretske pristope k raziskovanju strategije reševanja konfliktov z različnih interdisciplinarnih perspektiv. Trdimo, da je strategija reševanja konfliktov kot vir družbene integracije nujno orodje za premagovanje globoko zakoreninjenih etničnih konfliktov na nestabilnem Severnem Kavkazu.

T1  - British Pakistani lesbians existing within the confines of the closet
AN  - 1975721113
AB  - This study explores the complex interaction between ethnicity, gender and [homo]sexuality and how this creates a framework of stigma that compels some British Pakistani lesbians to remain within the closet. The 'closet' here is a metaphor that describes the concealment of one's homosexual identity and the outward 'performance' of heterosexuality. British Pakistani lesbians precariously inhabit a sociocultural environment that constrains the expression of female sexuality. Women who oppose and contravene heteronormative values and ideals unsettle comfortable assumptions of heterosexuality. Being in the closet keeps lesbians isolated and marginalised from their ethnic and cultural communities. Drawing on findings from online interviews with seven British Pakistani lesbians, the study explores what shapes their decision to stay within the closet and how doing so influences their self-perception. Being in the closet is a source of considerable conflict, strain and anxiety, which has an impact on the women's readiness to embrace individual choice, freedom and desire. Findings orientate the reader toward an understanding of the multiple, interlocking systems of social relations within which British Pakistani lesbians are marginalised as the result of their gender, sexuality and ethnic identity.

T1  - Beyond the Nationalist Narrative: Contextualising the History of the Overseas Chinese Press in Japan
AN  - 1961018036
AB  - Scholars tend to overlook the overseas Chinese press as a communicative tool for Chinese nationalism. This paper takes media history as its focal point to demonstrate the contextual influences that shaped the operations of Chinese print media and gave rise to the manifestation of the overseas Chinese (huaqiao) identity in Japan. In particular, it emphasises that the mobilisation of the modern Chinese nationalism movement of the time was not the sole determinant of Chinese identity. It was also influenced by the way in which Chinese ethnic boundaries came to be shaped and reshaped in different historical periods through the dynamics between overseas Chinese communities and Japanese society. I use two overseas Chinese publications from different periods to illustrate the impacts of modern Chinese nationalism and the changing social and political context of Japan on the Chinese press. Finally, I present a synthetic narrative to account for the history of the overseas Chinese press in Japan.

T1  - The human right to health: exploring disability, migration and health
AN  - 2059550655
AB  - Across the globe, an estimated one billion people are on the move today, of whom 244 million are international migrants. Not only have global horizons expanded in the realm of work and study; global conflict and exploitation have resulted in forced migration. Migration is a political issue, which raises questions of identity, citizenship, diversity and integration and is utilised to play upon the fear of the stranger, the 'Other' and difference in contemporary society. Disabled migrants are a hidden population whose experiences are often overlooked or subsumed within wider debates around disability and ethnicity. This article considers the intersection of disability and migration in contemporary society through the lens of healthcare access. Reflecting on the impact of citizenship rights on the realisation of human rights in the context of contemporary migration, using health as an example, the article considers the implications for disabled migrants, focusing primarily on the European Union.

T1  - International solidarity and ethnic boundaries: using the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to strengthen ethno-national claims in Northern Ireland
AN  - 1936016133
AB  - While scholars have described vertical nation-building narratives that genealogically anchor a specific group to a specific territory (Smith 1981; Eriksen 2002), I argue that, in addition to vertical strategies, expressions of international solidarity constitute horizontal nation-building strategies. Expressions of international solidarity can be used to maintain local ethnic boundaries and reinforce local divisions. By adopting an ally, expressions of international solidarity also designate an adversary, making the boundary between the two a possible incentive for solidarity. In Northern Ireland, some Unionist and Nationalist political entrepreneurs rely on expressions of international solidarity with Israelis or Palestinians, respectively, to make adversarial ethno-national claims to the nation-state. This study examines flags, graffiti, murals and political speech on display in Northern Ireland that advocate for either Israelis or Palestinians. Through the concept of 'borrowed legitimacy', I acknowledge the strategic use of the ethnic boundary in expressions of international solidarity.

T1  - Modes of transition and the timing of separatist war onset: a comparative analysis of South Ossetia and Kosovo
AN  - 2697558325
AB  - This paper compares the escalation of civil war in South Ossetia and Kosovo and shows how different modes of transition deeply influenced the timing and type of conflict in these two cases. It argues that regimes resulting from a transition from above – when the elite in power leads the process of regime change and imposes its political agenda on other social actors – are more likely to ensure political stability in the short term, since governments are more cohesive internally, enjoy the support of the military, and can rely on a loyal bureaucracy. In contrast, regimes that emerge from transitions from below are more likely to experience civil war with an ethnic minority in the short term because of an intrinsic weakness of the elite in power. Under these circumstances, the newcomers need to win the loyalty of the military and of the bureaucracy, and separatist groups can take advantage of the incumbents’ weaknesses and try to build resources to militarily challenge the state.

T1  - Is ethnic prejudice declining in Britain? Change in social distance attitudes among ethnic majority and minority Britons
AN  - 1934916221
AB  - Most literature on racial prejudice deals with the racial attitudes of the ethnic majority and ethnic minorities separately. This paper breaks this tradition. We examine the social distance attitudes of white and non-white British residents to test if these attitudes follow the same trends over time, whether they are driven by the same social processes and whether they are inter-related. We have three main findings. Firstly, social distance from other ethnic groups has declined over time for both white and ethnic minority Britons. For the white majority there are both period and cohort elements to this decline. Secondly, we see some evidence that social distance between the majority and minority groups is reciprocal. Specifically, minorities who experience rejection by the white British feel a greater sense of distance from them. Thirdly, we find that all groups share the perception of the same ethnic hierarchy. We see evidence of particularly widespread hostility towards Muslim Britons from all ethnic groups suggesting that Muslims are singled out for negative attention from many British residents of all other backgrounds, including a large number who do not express hostility to other groups.

T1  - In Whom Do We Trust? Racial Trust in the Early Years of Barack Obama’s Presidency
AN  - 2406943719
AB  - For many African Americans, Barack Obama’s presidential victory in 2008 was a step toward a racially tolerant society. Yet for others, the attack on Obama’s religious faith and citizenship status reflected long-standing racial divisions within the electorate. Using ordered probit analyses, our study focuses on racial trust and social capital in the early years of Obama’s presidency. In assessing the relationship between Obama’s domestic policies and racial trust, our study closely aligns with the research on policy feedbacks. We investigate the possibility that Obama’s flagship economic and social policies—specifically the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and unemployment insurance—operated as a bridge between whites, blacks, and Latinos. We further consider whether higher support for these policies reproduced greater levels of interracial trust among the groups. To measure racial trust, we draw from a 2010 survey sponsored by the Diane D. Blair Center of Southern Politics and Society at the University of Arkansas. The Blair-Rockefeller Poll was administered shortly after the 2010 midterm elections and includes a sample size of 3,406 respondents with an oversample of blacks (825) and Latinos (932). Although we found noticeably high rates of racial distrust, blacks expressed the lowest levels of distrust compared to whites and Latinos. We also discovered varying effects of Obama’s policies on increasing racial trust.

T1  - Changing patterns of mobility, citizenship and conflict in Indonesia
AN  - 1924017575
AB  - Mobility and migration are inherent ingredients of Indonesian cultures. In an archipelago with thousands of islands of various size, character and nature, mobility is an important means to make a living and to survive by migration. The right to free movement in Indonesia is constitutionally granted. It can create mobility and give expression to equal citizenship rights at the same time as it can trigger the enforcement of borders among cultural groups and the ethnification of local and regional politics. Mobility thus always comes along with immobility. Physical mobility of one group of people might cause immobility of another group or it might create cultural and political immobility in the same group. In places such as Eastern Indonesia, people have developed reciprocal means to integrate newcomers. Whereas the immigrants are usually disadvantaged citizens with regards to land and customary rights, those living in the area for generations have nonetheless become integral parts of quite peaceful local settings, one way or the other. The advancement of decentralization, democratization and direct elections of political representatives can lead to political empowerment, the promotion of ethnicity as election capital and changing patterns of belonging. This paper illustrates these ambivalences by looking at mobility in Indonesia more generally and how changing national policies and laws lead to reinterpretations of mobility patterns and trigger changes in relations between local population groups and existing mechanisms of cultural and political inclusion and exclusion. Butonese migrants in Maluku will here serve as a case study.

T1  - College Students, Sexualities Identities, and Participation in Political Marches
AN  - 1883505337
AB  - Student protest is often an engine of social change for sexual minorities and other oppressed groups. Through an analysis of college students in the Add Health survey (n=2,534), we found that sexual minorities attend more political marches than heterosexuals. To understand why this sexuality difference occurs, we performed a logistic regression analysis to decipher the importance of four explanations: essentialism, selection, embeddedness, and conversion. We discovered that participation in political groups is the best explanation of the sexuality gap in activism, but racial attitudes were also important. Type of college major was generally connected to student activism, but educational attainment and disciplinary curriculums did not explain the increased activism of sexual minorities.

T1  - The mediated politics of place and people: picturing the 'contested place-making' of Irish Travellers at Dale Farm
AN  - 1923059869
AB  - This article discusses meanings of people-place relationships, relating to ethnicity-class-gender intersections. The case examined concerns the 'contested place-making' of Irish Travellers at Dale Farm (UK), where the Travellers were eventually evicted from a place they owned. The material consists mainly of online slideshows in the Guardian. Visuals and place share the role of concretizing news, situating them and underlining their truth claims. Hence, news visuals are well suited for discussions of relationships between places and peoples. The study comprises theories of media, place and identity, relating to mobility, minorities and globalization. Methodologically, compositional analysis, discourse-theoretical method and an intersectional approach are combined. The place conflict is rarely understood in terms of justice. Instead, ethnicity-class-gender intersections appear as significant in the imagery, countering certain old stereotypes, but also connecting to discourses of 'threatening minorities', and 'bad mobility'. Manifested through excessive imagery of barricades/fences/walls/gates, 'identity management' meets 'place management', detaching some identities from some places. The Travellers thus appear as anomalies, separated from others. This is partly connected to the slideshow format, where linguistic elaboration on motifs is very limited, partly to the selection of certain themes and motifs in the slideshows, and partly to the societal politics surrounding the issue.

T1  - Stepping Out of the Fish Tank
AN  - 1835866130
AB  - This article explores the ethnic identity work in which Indian parents engage with regard to allowing their daughters to pursue a tertiary education and a career. Life story interviews were conducted on a purposive sample of 12 sets of South African Indian parents. The results indicate that these parents, especially mothers experience tremendous inner identity conflict, as they are torn between ensuring that daughters maintain their honor and dignity as respectable Indian women, and allowing daughters the freedom to venture away from the protective space of the home and family. The study highlighted that although parents were living in the postapartheid era ethnic identity work was still influenced by the lingering impact of apartheid regarding the status of women. Daughters were still not accorded the same status as sons although they were perceived as future breadwinners in their natal families.

T1  - “The pitch itself was no man's land:” Siege, Željezničar Sarajevo Football Club and the Grbavica Stadium
AN  - 2697556018
AB  - Inspired by microhistory, this essay explores the wartime plight of a football stadium and the multi-ethnic club that called it home as a means of understanding Bosnia and Herzegovina's descent into conflict, the siege of Sarajevo, and the impact upon civilians. Like the suburb of the same name, Grbavica became part of the frontline during the siege. Deprived of its home, FK Željezničar continued to function, while players, staff, and supporters longed for a return to the shattered ground. At a local level, the organization offers a means of visualizing the development of the Grbavica suburb, from its socialist foundations to its post-Dayton reintegration. In this way, the life of the stadium and those who frequent it map onto the history of Yugoslavia, its dissolution, and the independent republic that emerged in its wake. Moreover, the wartime partition of the stadium, the club, and its supporters’ group – all of which were claimed by actors on both sides of the frontline – were representative of political developments in a state where the ethnic balance was forcibly reengineered. This reconstruction of Grbavica's war harnesses original photographic evidence, oral history, maps, contemporary journalism, and the transcripts of the Hague Tribunal.

T1  - Predicting support for collective action in the conflict between Turks and Kurds: Perceived threats as a mediator of intergroup contact and social identity: GPIR
AN  - 1830218141
AB  - Two studies investigated the role of perceived realistic and symbolic threats in predicting collective action tendencies, and in mediating effects of intergroup contact and social identity on collective action in the context of an intractable conflict. Extending earlier research on collective action, integrated threat theory, and intergroup contact theory, we tested whether realistic and symbolic threats would predict collective action tendencies and outgroup attitudes; and mediate the effects of intergroup contact and social identity on collective action tendencies and outgroup attitudes among the advantaged, Turks, and the disadvantaged, Kurds. Findings from both studies (Study 1, N = 289 Turks; Study 2, N = 209 Kurds) supported the predictive and mediating role of threats on collective action tendencies and outgroup attitudes. Overall findings suggest that advantaged and disadvantaged groups might not always have disparate psychologies regarding collective action and incorporating perceived threats as antecedents of collective action can help to explain collective action tendencies among both groups especially in conflictual contexts.

T1  - The global-local negotiation: between the official and the implemented history curriculum in Israeli classrooms
AN  - 1800747788
AB  - Globalisation and technological advances in the twenty-first century have caused a blurring of national lines, which in the past were the basis of a nearly indisputable model of civic identity. This process has led to a noticeable trend of the globally oriented pressures within the national curricula, on top of the existing locally oriented demands. By employing an interpretative, qualitative methodology, this study offers a multidimensional analysis of the tensions and power relations within the global-local nexus in history teaching. We reveal and discuss Israeli teachers' perceptions and behaviours regarding the tension between the global and local inclinations within four major themes: teachers' entrepreneurial performance, critical views of the existing curricula, the presence of Israeli-Palestinian conflict throughout teaching involvements, and the meaning the teachers attribute to Holocaust in their teaching. The context for this study is Israel: a developed OECD country locked into an intense and long-standing ethnic and political conflict. The tension between the 'global' and the 'local' in the Israeli education system, studied through the prism of teachers themselves, provides a thought-provoking case study.

T1  - Sleeping with a philosopher? Emmanuel Levinas and 'critical social work'
AN  - 1885912026
AB  - It has been categorically asserted that Emmanuel Levinas's philosophy, dwelling on accepting responsibility for the 'Other', can be used to bolster the theorisation of 'critical social work'. Furthermore, a number of social work academics maintain that his complex contributions create a new framework for working across 'differences'. In contrast, this article will challenge these assertions, shedding light on an array of deeply problematic aspects of Levinas's philosophy and politics. These have so far been omitted in the way he has been presented to a social work readership. Particular attention will be paid to Levinas's self-proclaimed Euro-centrism and racist condescension toward those beyond Europe. The discussion will then turn to explore his ethnic nationalism which functions to conceptually misrecognise, disrespect and discursively delete Palestinians.

T1  - Asian American Public Relations Practitioners' Perspectives on Diversity
AN  - 1805051224
AB  - Shifting demographics in the United States imply growing diversity in the marketplace and create unprecedented demand for professionals capable of communicating strategically with diverse publics. In spite of diversity efforts in mass communication, public relations faces difficulties in attracting ethnic minorities. This study explores this lack of diversity through the lens of Asian American public relations practitioners in the United States, a population that is underrepresented in the field of public relations despite being the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States. In-depth interviews with Asian American practitioners reveal a perceived lack of diversity in public relations, attributed to lack of interest in public relations within Asian American communities, limited knowledge about the industry and opportunities for ethnic minorities, family influence to pursue other professions, and cultural expectations for Asian American professionals to attain leadership roles, which are scarce for ethnic minorities in public relations. Based on these findings, we recommend educating Asian American communities about the management function of public relations, framing it as a social science with emphasis on research and strategic planning, and increasing recruitment of Asian American students in public relations education to provide them with training and education necessary to succeed in the field.

T1  - Public trust in the Chinese police: The impact of ethnicity, class, and Hukou
AN  - 1790506831
AB  - Under the shiny surface of continued rapid economic growth, China has become a country rife with discontent over social inequalities, providing a unique social laboratory for studying social divisions and public perceptions of the police. We extended the conflict perspectives developed in the West to China and became the first to simultaneously examine the effects of three most vital social stratification variables in China -- ethnicity, social status, and hukou -- on trust in the police. Using nationwide data, we found that ethnic minorities showed the same or higher levels of trust than the Hans, rural registers held more favorable views than urban registers, and self-identified social status emerged as the most important concept associated with conflict theory in explaining Chinese trust in the police. Findings provided important theoretical and policy implications of social stratification and policing in a country of rapid modernization. [web URL: http://anj.sagepub.com/content/49/2/179.abstract]

T1  - The quality of inter- and intra-ethnic friendships among roma and non-roma students in Hungary
AN  - 2443382850
AB  - In this paper I compare the quality of inter- and intra-ethnic friendships. Findings of previous studies suggest that interethnic friendships are less likely to be characterized by closeness and intimacy than friendships among same-ethnic peers. I analyze data of a Hungarian panel study conducted among Roma and non-Roma Hungarian secondary school students. Descriptive analysis of 13 classes shows that interethnic friendships are indeed less often characterized by a co-occurring trust, perceived helpfulness, or jointly spent spare time nomination than intra-ethnic ones. This association holds if I include self-declared ethnicity as well as peer perceptions of ethnicity into the analysis. Analyzing self-declared ethnicity of students I also find that interethnic relations are less often reciprocated than intra-ethnic ones. If I concentrate on ethnic peer perceptions, however, I find that outgoing nominations of non-Roma students are more often reciprocated by classmates perceived as Roma than by classmates perceived as non-Roma.

T1  - Identity construction through phonetic crossing among young Capetonian gang members
AN  - 1805464564
AB  - Uncountable gangs operate in post-Apartheid South Africa, particularly in greater Cape Town, competing over turf and controlling the drug trade. Consequently, gang violence is rife in Western Cape and especially widespread in urban areas. In this paper young Capetonians' narratives of gang violence are analyzed. In the narratives of attacks on Black or White South Africans by Coloured gang members, the Coloured narrators make use of their victims' varieties of English, more precisely, of phonetic features. Hence, the aggressors do language crossing towards their targets when narrating their feats. Rampton (1995a:485) considers language crossing a 'code alternation by people who are not accepted members of the group associated with the second language that they are using (code switching into varieties that are not generally thought to belong to them)'. This switching involves a transgression of social or ethnic boundaries that allows the young gangsters to construct, negotiate, uphold and manage their social identities, as language still functions as an utterly important identity marker in post-Apartheid South Africa.

To address this issue, this study explores the social organization of Ku Klux Klan mobilization in 1960s North Carolina. While regarded as a progressive state in the civil rights era, North Carolina exhibited a greater level of Klan mobilization than the rest of the South combined. We build on models of "mediated competition," where ethnic competition and group threat are held as necessary, and propinquity, authority work, and legacies of previous racial violence link threat and competition with mobilization. Extending prior formulations centered on the discrete impact of individual components of competition, we employ fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to precisely specify the conjunctural conditions governing two modes of Klan mobilization: public rally events and the establishment of local organizational units. Our findings indicate that the mobilizing effects of threat and competition varied between rural and urban areas, and that threat/competition and organization/leadership play a dual role in translating collective grievances into mobilization.

AB  - Taking the history of post-Independence conflict in Nigeria as his model, the author shows how different conceptual metaphors are used to create a sense of national unity by those who seek to prevent a breakup of the Nigerian state on the one hand, and a desire for ethnic independence by those who seek to achieve self-governance under separate, independent, ethno-religious, and linguistic cultural republics on the other hand.

T1  - Ethnic Diversity, Economic and Cultural Contexts, and Social Trust: Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Evidence from European Regions, 2002-2010
AN  - 1660145279
AB  - A growing literature investigates the relationship between ethnic diversity and social trust. Comparative research in the European context employing country-level indicators has predominantly produced inconclusive results. This study examines the relationship between immigration-related diversity and social trust at the sub-national level of European regions. The regional perspective allows the capture of relevant variations in ethnic context while it still generates comparable results for a broader European context. Using survey data from the European Social Survey 2002-2010 merged with immigration figures from the European Labour Force Survey, this study builds upon previous research by testing the relationships between various diversity indicators and social trust in cross-sectional and longitudinal perspective. In addition, it investigates the role of economic and cultural contexts as moderators. The results show that across European regions, different aspects of immigration-related diversity are negatively related to social trust. In longitudinal perspective, an increase in immigration is related to a decrease in social trust. Tests of the conditional hypotheses reveal that regional economic growth and ethnic polarization as a cultural context moderate the relationship. Immigration growth is particularly strongly associated with a decrease in social trust in contexts of economic decline and high ethnic polarization. However, there is some evidence that in contexts of low polarization the relationship is actually positive.

T1  - The Challenges of Ensuring that Justice is Done and is Seen to be Done in Post- Ethnic Conflicts: The Case of Rwanda 1
AN  - 1903519772
AB  - The principle of ensuring that justice is done and is seen to be done' in post- ethnic conflicts countries such as Rwanda has been and remains a controversial and a far-fetched objective in post-inter-ethnic conflict countries such as Rwanda. The methodology applied in this paper is essentially a qualitative approach and relies on the analysis of the available literature. Using the analysis of available literature, the paper seeks to demonstrate why it is difficult for the winners of the Rwandan conflict to "ensure that justice is done and is seen to be done" by the alleged suspects of the Rwandan genocide. The paper rejects the claims of impartiality when the judges and the prosecutors have direct and indirect personal interests on the issues they are presiding over. The paper argues that in order for to avoid the "victor's justice", the judges must be impartial and not be part of the conflict they adjudicate. The paper further argues that for the Rwandan judges to be impartial they must not be under external influence. The Rwandan judges have personal interests in the outcome of the Rwandan genocide trials. The paper recommends that the prosecution of crimes of genocide and genocide ideologies in Rwanda be done by competent and independent courts of justice which are not party to the alleged crimes they have prosecuted.

T1  - Political Polarization as a Social Movement Outcome: 1960s Klan Activism and Its Enduring Impact on Political Realignment in Southern Counties, 1960 to 2000
AN  - 1637996491
AB  - Radical social movements can exacerbate tensions in local settings while drawing attention to how movement goals align with political party agendas. Short-term movement influence on voting outcomes can endure when orientations toward the movement disrupt social ties, embedding individuals within new discussion networks that reinforce new partisan loyalties. To demonstrate this dynamic, we employ longitudinal data to show that increases in Republican voting, across several different time intervals, were most pronounced in southern counties where the Ku Klux Klan had been active in the 1960s. In an individual-level analysis of voting intent, we show that decades after the Klan declined, racial attitudes map onto party voting among southern voters, but only in counties where the Klan had been active.

T1  - Migration and the dialogue of multiple identifications: Kurdish migrants in the tourist industry of Istanbul
AN  - 1660022622; 201505957
AB  - This article examines the cultural dilemmas proceeding from the multiple identifications of Kurdish migrants working in the multicultural environment of Istanbul's tourist industry. Since identifications invariably multiply when migrants enter multicultural environments, the question emerges how migrants cope with increasing identifications? How are multiple identifications related within the self? In this article, these questions are addressed, first, by analysing how Kurds explain ethnic stereotypes of themselves with reference to migration from the region of origin. Furthermore, conflicts and ambiguities between identifications as individual migrant and identifications as family member are investigated. Third, identifications of the 'villager' versus the 'urbanite' are reviewed, while, finally, the role of 'learning' in the migration process for Kurdish identifications will be highlighted. Dialogical self theory is used to situate the analysis of cultural dilemmas and contradictions of Kurdish migrants in Istanbul within the broader study of multiple identifications of migrants in multicultural societies.

T1  - 'How Many Pharmacists of Slovakian Origin Lived in Hungary in the Age of the Tartar Invasion?' Additions to Istvan Bibo's Picture of Central Europe
AN  - 1650147626; 201501867
AB  - The Hungarian thinker and politician Istvan Bibo examined the history of Central Europe in several significant studies. He drew attention to the serious social and political problems of the area, including those pathological symptoms which, in his opinion, had led to both World Wars. The ethnic conflicts of the region had been escalating since the 18th century, turning into historical traumas and political hysteria in the 20th. Bibo considered the Trianon Peace Treaty such a trauma. Therefore, he rejected and raised his voice against the infringements committed by Czechoslovakians and Romanians against their Hungarian minorities. Bibo proposed the consistent application of the principle of self-governance and the introduction of political arbitration for the resolution of ethnic conflicts, but in the long term he believed in the reconciliation of these nationalities. In his view a historical shift of this kind could bring about a positive change for the Hungarian minorities of the formerly Hungarian territories. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - For Us Only? Examining the Effect of Viewing Context on Black Audiences' Perceived Influence of Black Entertainment
AN  - 1445186338
AB  - A host of theories including symbolic interactionism explains how media construct our social perceptions. Research suggests that stereotypes of blacks reinforce negative racial attitudes, whereas other findings suggest that blacks enjoy black media characters, even ones that may be considered stereotypical. Current research has yet to address or explain this discrepancy. The present study explores the impact of the race of co-viewers on blacks' responses to stereotypical content in black films. An experiment was conducted where black participants viewed clips of black films with either an All black audience or a racially mixed group with a majority white audience. Findings revealed that watching black films with white co-viewers did not influence blacks' enjoyment or perception of bias; however, an interaction between viewing condition and influence target emerged such that when viewing among a racially mixed audience, blacks expressed concern that portrayals in the film would negatively influence whites' attitudes toward blacks and their likelihood to interact with black people more than themselves. Implications for race relations in a multicultural media landscape are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Nationalism, anti-colonialism and the crystallisation of Greek Cypriot nationalist party politics
AN  - 2115175369
AB  - While the effects of nationalism and anti-colonialism on party politics in Cyprus have been influential throughout its contemporary history, mobilisation of the anti-colonial cleavage within the Greek community of Cyprus largely accounts for the nature of Greek Cypriot politics in the early decades of British rule. Nationalism and anti-colonialism produced a permanent division among the nationalist circles of the Greek ethnic community between intransigents and moderates. Within this overarching division Greek Cypriot politics was characterised by continuous factionalism among a small social and religious elite. The bases of factionalism among the leading dignitaries of the Greek Cypriot elite were access to and ownership of power channels overlaid by individual differences over the anti-colonial struggle. The institutional context established by the British facilitated the demarcation of the conflict on an ethno-religious basis, subsequently retaining its largely intraethnic character and only becoming largely interethnic with the later political mobilisation of the Turkish community.

T1  - Germanization, Polonization, and Russification in the partitioned lands of Poland-Lithuania
AN  - 2698628640
AB  - Two main myths constitute the founding basis of popular Polish ethnic nationalism: first, that Poland-Lithuania was an early Poland, and second, that the partitioning powers at all times unwaveringly pursued policies of Germanization and Russification. In the former case, the myth appropriates a common past today shared by Belarus, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine. In the latter case, Polonization is written out of the picture entirely, as also are variations and changes in the polices of Germanization and Russification. Taken together, the two myths to a large degree obscure (and even falsify) the past, making comprehension of it difficult, if not impossible. This article seeks to disentangle the knots of anachronisms that underlie the Polish national master narrative, in order to present a clearer picture of the interplay between the policies of Germanization, Polonization, and Russification as they unfolded in the lands of the partitioned Poland-Lithuania during the long nineteenth century.

T1  - Diasporas, Remittances and State Fragility: Assessing the Linkages
AN  - 1417525804; 201332118
AB  - The growing prominence of diaspora communities around the world has led to increased recognition of the role they play in the domestic affairs of their respective homelands. Current research in the field of ethnic conflict has begun to focus on transnational ethnic linkages, identifying and analysing a wide range of processes through which they affect political and social outcomes. However, the overall impact of these relationships on civil conflict is still poorly understood. Although existing quantitative research in this area is limited, there is some evidence to suggest that, under certain circumstances, diaspora groups pose a risk to intrastate security by increasing the probability of civil war. Approaching the issue from a state fragility perspective, this paper challenges the notion that transnational ethnic linkages are primarily detrimental, proposing instead that kin groups with the greatest capacity to mobilize resources are more likely to promote stability. The results of the analysis support this hypothesis, indicating that larger, more geographically concentrated diasporas located in high-income, democratic host states typically have a stabilizing effect on fragile home communities.

T1  - Urban Mongols: The Flourishing of Multiple Identities in a Vibrant Ethnic Community
AN  - 1463012926; 201346643
AB  - China's ethnopolitics are grounded in two contradictory philosophies that often give rise to competing policies: the upholding of the ethnic group as well as the individual's right to achieve prominence within the established social order. An individual's sense of ethnic belonging and national identification are affected by the degree to which these ideals-individual achievement verses group interests-are internalized. The issue of the relevant strength of Chinese nationalism as opposed to minority nationalism within a given group is largely unexplored territory. In this article, I focus on the various notions Hohhotian Mongols have about what constitutes ethnic integrity, proper friendship, styles of ethnic interaction, ethnic nationalism, multiple identification, and satisfactory historical remembrance. Specifically, I explore whether the criterion Mongols use to mark Mongolian identity changed with China's shift from an insular, work-unit redistributive system to a more fluid market-driven society.

T1  - Group Conflict Theory in a Longitudinal Perspective: Analyzing the Dynamic Side of Ethnic Competition: IMR
AN  - 2558413172
AB  - One of the most established approaches to explain attitudes toward immigration is group conflict theory. However, even though the theory was articulated in dynamic terms, previous research has almost exclusively tested it through cross-sectional analyses. The aim of this study is to disentangle the dynamic character of ethnic competition from more permanent determinants of ethnic threat. The findings show that a remarkable variation of concern over immigration, usually attributed to permanent positions of economic vulnerability, disappears when within-person variation is modeled. In line with a dynamic approach of ethnic competition, becoming unemployed or being laid off increases concern over immigration. This effect is independent of social class.

T1  - Strange familiarities: a response to Ash Amin's Land of Strangers
AN  - 1364701426; 201323765
AB  - Ash Amin's Land of Strangers captures succinctly the way the multiplicities of urban life have reshaped our thinking about intercultural relations beyond reified characterisations of ethnicity. Amin draws together an analysis of the ensemble of relations between humans, between humans and the non-human, between work and leisure, and between temporal and spatial relations, to explore our 'society of strangers'. The book provides a productive framework for conceptualising the collaborative commingling that develops across ethnic lines, without losing a sense of imminent conflict, and the pedagogic processes that foster the capacities and habits of living with difference.

T1  - Developing a culture of marginality: Nepal's current classificatory moment
AN  - 1364701416; 201323971
AB  - This article examines the complex relationships between marginalized communities, the state, and nonstate actors such as development agencies and social scientists in crafting the classificatory regimes that undergird affirmative action policies. Focusing on the current dynamics of "ethnic restructuring" amid the broader political process of postconflict "state restructuring" in Nepal, I suggest that international actors often unwittingly encourage the hardening of ethnic boundaries through development projects that target "marginalized" populations defined in cultural terms. However, such interventions can also yield unexpected transformations in agentive ethnic consciousness. This ethnographic exploration of current classificatory processes in non-postcolonial Nepal provides an important counterpoint to material from the Indian context, where histories of colonial classification have debatably influenced contemporary categories-and their critique-to a significant extent.

T1  - Mobilizing ethnic competition
AN  - 1438556236; 201339849
AB  - Ethnic competition theory provides a powerful explanation for ethnic conflict, by demonstrating how variation in ethnic mobilization relates to intergroup struggles over scarce resources. However, the tendency to capture such relationships at the aggregate level, through macro-level proxies of intergroup competition, offers little insight into the processes through which ethnic grievances mobilize into contentious action. This article integrates insights from the social movements literature to address how competitive contexts crystallize into broader conflicts. Drawing on data from the civil rights-era Ku Klux Klan-perhaps the quintessential case of contentious ethnic organization in the United States-the analysis focuses on the ways in which meso-level arrangements mediate the relationship between overarching competitive contexts and ethnic conflict. Results of a paired comparative analysis of KKK mobilization in Greensboro and Charlotte demonstrate that social and spatial relations within each city shaped the contours of perceived competition and subsequent ethnic organization in ways that were not always predictable through observation of conventional proxies of competition.

T1  - (Social) Democracy in the Blood? Civic and Ethnic Idioms of Nation and the Consolidation of Swedish Social Democratic Power, 1928-1932
AN  - 1315598958; 201307315
AB  - This paper attempts to explain Swedish Social Democrats' consolidation of power between 1928 and 1932 through an examination of idioms of nation. Qualitative analysis of articles and editorials from a Social Democratic and a liberal newspaper is carried out. The analysis focuses on how civic, ethnic and, a mixed civic-ethnic idiom of nation were deployed in order to expand the Social Democrats' electoral base. The Social Democrats could combine egalitarianism/democracy with ethnic nationalism because ethnic bases for the nation were more inclusive than other, especially class, bases available to them. Two challenges for the literature on nationalism and the welfare state are raised: (1) the civic-ethnic distinction must be rethought to accommodate the Swedish case, wherein ethnic nationalism was used for "civic" ends; and (2) the focus on the Social Democrats as promoting working class interests may be misplaced given the party's mobilization on the basis of nation.

T1  - Explaining Attitudes Towards Immigration Policies in European Countries: The Role of Human Values
AN  - 2076973391
AB  - European societies have been experiencing increasing rates of immigration in recent decades. At the same time one can observe a substantial rise in anti-foreigner sentiments. In this study we investigate the effect of human values on attitudes towards immigration. We hypothesise that self-transcendent individuals are more supportive of, and conservative individuals are more adverse to, immigration. We do not expect large differences in the effect of values across contexts. To explain cross-country and cross-time differences we use group threat theory, according to which larger inflows of immigration combined with challenging economic conditions impose a threat on the host society, resulting in more negative attitudes towards immigration. To test our hypotheses we use data from the first three rounds of the European Social Survey (2002-03, 2004-05 and 2006-07) and multilevel analysis. Prior to the interpretation of the results, we guarantee that the concepts display measurement invariance across countries and over time. Our results largely confirm our hypotheses regarding the role that values play in the explanation of anti-immigration attitudes.

T1  - Human Population Biology in the Second Half of the Twentieth Century
AN  - 1030869287; 201227979
AB  - Human population biology can be identified as the biocultural study of living humans from evolutionary, historical, populational, developmental, biomedical, and anthropological perspectives. Biological anthropology really "came of age" during the second half of the twentieth century, after the end of World War II. Human population biology, as a subfield of biological anthropology, was a part of this "scientific maturation" of the discipline. Contributions to the postwar transformation of living population studies were (1) wartime studies of military personnel exposed to novel environments, (2) an increase in young academic professionals with new ideas, (3) a decrease in both racist (racialist) attitudes and interest in race typology, and (4) the explosion of research and literature on human biology and behavior.

AN  - 1023025184; 201225154
AB  - This article brings the thought of Giuseppe Mazzini back into the field of nationalism studies, from which it has been largely missing for a half century. It suggests the following: that Mazzini is much more modern and secular than he is usually portrayed; and that his commitment to liberal policies while rejecting liberal principles suggests that the distinction between civic and ethnic nationalism has been misconceived. Nationalism, to Mazzini, was not an end in itself but a means to an end -- government of, by and for the people. The demand for such a government was manifested in three popular demands in nineteenth-century Europe: in the West as democracy, in the East as national sovereignty (the precondition for democracy) and in both East and West as social democracy. Thus nationalism may be instrumental rather than an end in itself, and it may be attributable not to ethnic groups' natural striving for autonomy but to the pursuit of democracy.

T1  - Accounting for Successful Control of Implicit Racial Bias: The Roles of Association Activation, Response Monitoring, and Overcoming Bias
AN  - 1912093516
AB  - Individuals who are primarily internally motivated to respond without prejudice show less bias on implicit measures than individuals who are externally motivated or unmotivated to respond without prejudice. However, it is not clear why these individuals exhibit less implicit bias than others. We used the Quad model to examine motivation-based individual differences in three processes that have been proposed to account for this effect: activation of associations, overcoming associations, and response monitoring. Participants completed an implicit measure of stereotyping (Study 1) or racial attitudes (Study 2). Modeling of the data revealed that individuals who were internally (but not externally) motivated to respond without prejudice showed enhanced detection and reduced activation of biased associations, suggesting that these processes may be key to achieving unbiased responding.

T1  - CONSEQUENCES OF BLACK EXCEPTIONALISM? Interracial Unions with Blacks, Depressive Symptoms, and Relationship Satisfaction
AN  - 885086678
AB  - Using data from Wave 4 (2008) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 7,466), we examine potential consequences of black exceptionalism in the context of interracial relationships among nonblack respondents. While increasing racial diversity and climbing rates of interracial unions have fostered the notion that racial boundaries within the United States are fading, our results add to the accumulating evidence that racial/ethnic boundaries persist in U.S. society. Results suggest that among non-Black respondents there is more stigma and disapproval attached to relationships with Blacks than there are to relationships with members of other racial/ethnic groups. Specifically, our results indicate that nonblack individuals with black partners have significantly more depressive symptoms and less relationship satisfaction than their counterparts with nonblack partners, regardless of respondent race and whether the nonblack partner is the same versus a different race from the respondent. Further, the relationship between partner race and depressive symptoms is partially and significantly mediated by relationship satisfaction. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Marital conflict and children's sleep: Reciprocal relations and socioeconomic effects.
AN  - 1023030855; 201226064
AB  - We examined reciprocal relations between parental marital conflict and children's sleep disruptions over two years. The roles of ethnicity (African American and European American) and socioeconomic status were tested as moderators of the examined relations. A community sample of 176 school-age children (M age = 8.68 at T1) and their parents participated at T1 and T2 with a 2-year interval between waves. Mothers, fathers, and children reported on parental marital conflict, and children's sleep was measured via actigraphy and self-reports. Latent variable modeling indicated that T1 marital conflict predicted increases in children's sleep disruptions longitudinally; results were more pronounced for African American children and those from lower SES homes. Further, children's sleep disruptions at T1 predicted increases in marital conflict over time. Results demonstrate the importance of reciprocal relations between a prevalent familial stressor and a fundamental facet of children's health, especially when considering the sociocultural milieu.

T1  - Nature's Gift, Man's Curse: Natural Resources and Civil Conflicts in the Niger Delta and Cabinda
AN  - 1081861778; 201235820
AB  - As proffered within the resource curse theory, states which have an abundance of mineral resources hold a higher propensity for contest over resource rents. The resultant rentier system leads a politico-economic contest over access to resources and the associated benefits, fostering economic policies which breed corruption, regional and ethnic factionalism, and eventually violent conflict. As the two leading oilproducing regions on the subcontinent, Nigeria's Niger Delta and Cabinda in Angola are no exception to this trend. To place the conflicts in these regions in their historical context, this article examines the linkages between oil resources and the onset and prolongation of violence, bearing out the significance of the various mechanisms within the resource curse theory which inform the commencement and duration of resource-laden conflicts.

T1  - Economic Dynamics and Changes in Attitudes Toward Undocumented Mexican Immigrants in Arizona
AN  - 1030869555; 201230123
AB  - Mexican immigration to the United States comprises an important social issue in contemporary public policy debate, particularly given the recent passage of Arizona's Senate Bill 1070 (SB 1070). The current study investigated how individuals' sentiments toward undocumented Mexican immigrants shifted between 2006 and 2009 in Arizona, and also examined economic concomitants to these shifts. Participants included 3,195 culturally diverse students attending a state university in Arizona. They reported their attitudes toward undocumented Mexican immigrants regarding housing, employment, values, social welfare, citizenship, health care, and education issues. Results show less-positive attitudes as each year progressed among European and Latino Americans, as well as other ethnic minorities. Further, anti-undocumented immigrant sentiment increased as unemployment increased and gross domestic product real growth rate decreased. Ethnic differences emerged in the relative negativity toward undocumented immigrants such that European Americans were less positive towards undocumented Mexican immigrants than Latinos over 4 years. These findings suggest that economic dynamics may beget anti-immigrant sentiment, leading to contentious legislation, such as Arizona's recent immigration law. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - What has globalization done to developing countries' public libraries
AN  - 1018362269; 201212961
AB  - The goal of this article is to highlight the major trends in the establishment of public libraries in developing countries under conditions of globalization. Based on a review of research from library history and the sociology of culture, the author develops hypotheses about the conditions under which public libraries are likely to be established in relatively large numbers in developing countries. Analysis of historical trends in library establishments and crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis of UNESCO data on public libraries in six developing nations reveal that globalization is associated with decreasing or flat numbers of public libraries on a per capita basis. The only observed exceptions are Malaysia and Chile, where public libraries have been established in large numbers partly for purposes of national integration as a counter to sectarian and ethnic heterogeneity. Implications of these findings for research in the information society paradigm, and for development theory, are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Interracial public-police contact: Relationships with police officers' racial and work-related attitudes and behavior
AN  - 822521967; 201072821
AB  - In a sample of Flemish police officers (n = 172), we examined whether interracial public-police contact is associated with police officers' racial and work-related attitudes and self-reported behavior. Complementing previous studies, it was revealed that interracial contact (both positive and negative) is related to prejudiced behavior toward immigrants via the mediating role of racial attitudes. Moreover, intergroup contact was also shown to be related to police officers' organizational citizenship behavior toward colleagues and superiors via their perceptions of organizational fairness. We elaborate on the severe impact of negative contact as well as the applied consequences of our findings within police organizations. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Effects of Intergroup Dialogue: Public School Teachers and Sexual Orientation Prejudice
AN  - 758124152; 201056720
AB  - Prejudice and hate crimes against lesbians and gay men are prevalent throughout the United States. Prejudice in public school settings is particularly problematic for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) students and LGB parents. Efforts to reduce prejudice for LGB groups have met with limited success. Creating safer and more inclusive school environments is essential. An experimental mixed methods field design tested outcomes of an intergroup dialogue intervention on public school teacher attitudes, feelings, and behaviors toward LGB students and parents. Quantitative results indicate dialogue participation resulted in statistically significant positive changes in attitudes, feelings, and behaviors. Qualitative data analysis confirmed positive changes as a result of dialogue participation. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Does a common ingroup identity reduce intergroup threat?
AN  - 754037940; 201049577
AB  - Intergroup threat is regarded as a cause of negative outgroup attitudes; however, little research has attempted to examine ways of reducing intergroup threat. Two studies examine the effectiveness of a superordinate identity for reducing intergroup threat. It was predicted that when two groups were aware of a shared identity, intergroup threat would be lowered and attitudes would become more positive. In Study 1, perceptions of common identities among Black and White students were related to decreases in intergroup threat and increases in positive outgroup attitudes. In Study 2, when their shared identity as Americans was made salient, Democrats and Republicans experienced less threat and more positive outgroup attitudes compared to when political party identities alone were salient. In both studies, intergroup threat acted as a mediator of the relationship between common identity and outgroup attitudes, suggesting that a common identity increases positive outgroup attitudes by first reducing intergroup threat.

T1  - Synergy between Molecular and Contextual Views of Coping among Four Ethnic Groups of Older Adults
AN  - 1906100860
AB  - The coping styles of four ethnic groups of older adults in response to negative life events were analyzed in a population-based study of 1118 residents of Brooklyn, New York. Using a molecular approach, data regarding the context of events and the corresponding coping responses was obtained. Open-ended semi-structured interviews allowed participants to describe recent negative life events and explain how they coped. An empirically derived coding system distinguished four major negative life events: Death, Illness/Injury, Empathic Response to Distress of Others, and Interpersonal Conflict. Nine major styles of coping emerged: Medicate, Active Coping, Passive Response, Prayer, Stoicism, Social Support, Positive Self-Talk, Acknowledgment of Emotions, and Distraction. Gender and ethnic differences in coping styles were found. Although ethnic specificity in coping emerged when context was considered, the few effects of ethnicity suggests that the major normative events of later life may pull for generic coping responses.

T1  - Ethnic Intermarriage and Social Cohesion. What Can We Learn from Yugoslavia
AN  - 754037585; 201052335
AB  - Social cohesion theory is tested using data on ethnic intermarriage in former Yugoslavia. Before the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the proportion of marriages outside the own ethnic group was generally low, but in this respect large differences among the groups existed. The proportion of mixed marriages with a Serbian partner was much higher among the Montenegrins and Hungarians than among the Muslims, Slovenes, or Albanians. The findings are largely in line with the predictions of social cohesion theory that intermarriage reduces the probability of violent conflict among social groups. Besides proportions of mixed marriages, loglinear parameters are presented. These parameters show that percentages not always give a good indication of the social distances among groups. The boundaries of the largest ethnic groups, the Serbians and Croatians, were less closed than their rather low intermarriage rates suggested. The social distance between the Hungarians and the Serbians, on the other hand, was larger than expected on the basis of their intermarriage rates. The findings stress the importance of including information on ethnically mixed marriages into models of ethnological monitoring and early warning systems for ethnic conflicts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnic and Linguistic Minorities and Political Participation in Europe
AN  - 1928744166
AB  - Understanding the political behavior of ethnic minorities is important for their integration in contemporary European societies. We compare the political participation rates of ethnic and linguistic minorities to those of the majority population using data from the 2002--03 European Social Survey which covers 21 countries in Europe. Using a broad index of participation, we show that the differences between minority and majority groups are virtually zero. Only voting in national elections displays a gap between majorities and minorities. Based on a multivariate model we estimate that a person with a minority background both with reference to ethnicity and language has an 80 percent probability of voting in national elections compared to 89 percent for a person in the majority population. In making sense of these findings we have to remind ourselves that ethnic and linguistic minorities in Europe are groups that show great heterogeneity, and that not all characteristics of these groups should lead us to expect them to be less active than majority groups in every single act of political participation. This finding is in line with the emphasis of variation and heterogeneity in effects of ethnicity and language that Anderson and Paskeviciute (2006) have found in research based on aggregate indicators.
