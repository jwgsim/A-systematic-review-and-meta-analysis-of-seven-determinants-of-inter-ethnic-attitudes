T1  - Individual Characteristics Associated With Color-Blind Racial Attitudes in Master of Social Work Students
AN  - 2685826989
AB  - Schools of social work are tasked with preparing students to support the field’s ethical challenge of eliminating racism. Given that color-blind racial attitudes constitute a form of continued racism, identifying the factors associated with color-blind racial ideology (CBRI) in social work students represents a first step toward meeting this challenge. Drawing from critical race theory, this cross-sectional study surveyed a convenience sample of 305 master of social work (MSW) students across five schools of social work to explore which individual characteristics are significantly associated with CBRI at the bivariate and multivariate levels. A multiple linear regression assessed CBRI’s multivariate associations with demographic characteristics (i.e., age, gender, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation) and professional characteristics (i.e., prior work experience with marginalized communities, bachelor of social work [BSW] attainment, MSW concentration). Results showed that increased age, gender identification as men, and BSW attainment had statistically significant, positive associations with CBRI, compared to their respective reference groups. Compared to straight sexual orientation, identification as gay or lesbian, bisexual, and other sexual orientation was significantly associated with lower CBRI. Macro-focused MSW concentration was the strongest statistically significant independent variable and was associated with decreased CBRI. Fostering critical self-awareness of MSW students’ racial blind spots may support meeting social work’s ethical challenge.

T1  - Psychological bases of anti‐immigration attitudes among populist voters
AN  - 2673616615
AB  - The ascent of populism has been linked with economic and cultural disruptions of modernization. From this perspective, it could be implied that factors such as psychological insecurity and uncertainty are key in making voters gravitate toward the populist narrative. The present research aimed at highlighting the psychological determinants that uncertainties deriving from modernization processes may activate in populist voters. Specifically, we focused on immigration in Italy, investigating whether and how support for different populist parties relates to development of negative attitudes toward immigrants. Two samples of Italian adults (total N = 1655), who voted in the Italian general elections of March 4, 2018 took part in the research. Multigroup path analysis showed that assumption of anti‐immigration stances through the joint mediating role of Dangerous World Belief and Right‐Wing Authoritarianism was shared by different groups of populist voters. However, different populist voters differed in the strength of the path passing through Competitive Jungle World Belief and Social Dominance Orientation. Results underline the relevance of social worldviews and ideological attitudes in shaping the attitudes of the Italian populist electorate.

T1  - Understanding Racial Attitudes Among Students and Teachers in a Ethnically/Racially Diverse High School
AN  - 2672685333
AB  - This study examined the role of racial attitudes in a diverse high school setting. Teachers and students were recruited from a public charter high school in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The final sample consisted of 19 students and 10 teachers who participated in face‐to‐face interviews regarding racial attitudes and racial bias in the academic setting. Three themes emerged among the teacher interviews: rejecting racial inequalities, contradicting thoughts and color‐blind explanations, and racially conscious explanations. For the student interviews, two themes emerged: color‐blind racial attitudes and witnessing/experiencing bias. These findings yield evidence that color‐blind racial attitudes are prevalent in diverse schools among students and teachers, presenting a challenge to intervention efforts in schools aimed at promoting racial justice.

T1  - Parent socialization and anti‐racist ideology development in White youth: Do peer and parenting contexts matter?
AN  - 2673335684
AB  - The development of anti‐racist ideology in adolescence and emerging adulthood is informed by parent socialization, parenting style, and cross‐race friendships. This study used longitudinal, multi‐reporter survey data from White youth and their parents in Maryland to examine links between parents' racial attitudes when youth were in eleventh grade in 1996 (N = 453; 52% female; Mage = 17.12) and the youths' anti‐racist ideology (acknowledgment of anti‐Black discrimination and support for affirmative action) 1 year after high school in 1998. This study also examined whether these associations varied based on authoritative parenting and the number of cross‐race friendships. Positive parent racial attitudes toward racially and ethnically minoritized populations predicted higher anti‐racist ideology in the independent contexts of more cross‐race friendships and low authoritative parenting.

T1  - Disentangling national and religious identification as predictors of support for religious minority rights among Christian majority groups
AN  - 2646666095
AB  - It is often assumed that, in Western societies, Christian values are embedded in national identities, yet, the association between religious identities and prejudice has seldom been studied in parallel to national identity. According to both the social identity theory approach and integrated threat theory, group identification is important for perceiving threats and expressing corresponding attitudes. Nevertheless, their independent roles on intergroup outcomes have often been ignored, although they are two of the most salient and important identities when considering support for religious minority rights. We address this gap in research by looking at the associations of religious identity with support for religious minority rights in general and Muslims in particular in parallel to national identity through diversity threat. This study was conducted among the members of majority groups in four Western countries: Australia, Finland, Germany, and Norway (N = 1,532), all of which are characterised as traditionally Christian. We found that a higher religious identification was associated with greater support for religious minority rights in general and for those of Muslims in particular, while national identification had no direct association with support for either groups’ religious rights. However, both group identifications were also associated with heightened perceived diversity threat, which in turn, predicted reluctance to support religious minority rights. This demonstrates the dual role that religious identities may play in intergroup relations.

T1  - The Family Transmission of Ethnic Prejudice: A Systematic Review of Research Articles with Adolescents
AN  - 2679831296
AB  - Ethnic prejudice is one of the most studied topics in social psychology. Empirical research on its development and intergenerational transmission is increasing but still scarce. This systematic review collected and analyzed psychosocial studies focused on the transmission of ethnic prejudice within families with adolescents. Specifically, it aimed at addressing the following research questions: (a) To what extent is there a vertical (between parents and children) and horizontal (between siblings) transmission of ethnic prejudice within the family? (b) Is this process unidirectional (from parents to children) or bidirectional (between parents and children)? (c) Which individual and/or relational variables influence this process? (d) Can adolescents’ intergroup contact experiences affect the family influence on adolescents’ ethnic prejudice? The literature search of four databases (Ebsco, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science), carried out from February 2021 to May 2021, following the PRISMA guidelines, yielded 22 articles that matched the eligibility criteria. The findings highlighted a moderate bidirectional transmission of ethnic prejudice between parents and adolescents, which was influenced by several individual and relational variables (e.g., the adolescents’ age and sex and the family relationship quality). Moreover, the adolescents’ frequent and positive contacts with peers of different ethnicities reduced the parents’ influence on the adolescents’ ethnic prejudice. The findings are discussed, and their limitations and implications for intervention and future research are considered.

T1  - Shared disadvantage as a determinant of the relationship between White Americans’ socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic prejudice
AN  - 2623504364
AB  - The present studies examined the conditions under which low subjective socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with greater racial/ethnic prejudice among White Americans. Using theories of intergroup threat and inclusive victim consciousness, we predicted that describing racial/ethnic minorities as disadvantaged (vs. as competitive or in neutral terms) would increase empathy and reduce prejudice among White Americans who consider themselves low in SES. Study 1 provided correlational evidence that White Americans who perceived themselves as low‐SES (but not high‐SES) were less prejudiced against racial/ethnic minorities the more they perceived minorities as disadvantaged. In Study 2, portraying the target outgroup (Arab immigrants) as disadvantaged increased outgroup empathy, and in turn reduced prejudice, among participants induced to think of themselves as low‐SES. Study 3 conceptually replicated these results using a different outgroup (Mexican Americans) and a behavioral measure of prejudice. Implications for reducing prejudice among White Americans of different socioeconomic backgrounds are discussed.

Ši metodologija leidžia įvertinti asmenines (vertybines, socioekonomines ir demografines) bei kontekstines (bendrojo vidaus produkto, nedarbo lygio, nelygybės) priežastis, nulemiančias neigiamą požiūrį į imigrantus. Tyrimo rezultatai rodo, kad Europos Sąjungoje asmeninės vertybės yra susijusios su požiūriu į imigrantus.Alternate abstract:This paper aims to analyse the connection between values individuals hold and perception whether immigration is bad or good for economy in the European Union. It applies the multilevel modelling approach on the European Social Survey rounds 1-7 and a set of the OECD economic measures. The method allows for an examination of personal (values, socioecomic and demographic) and contextual (GDP, inequality and unemployment rates) drivers of anti-immigrant tendencies. The results show that individual values are connected to how people perceive immigrants in the EU.

T1  - ‘Birds of a feather’? Assessing the prevalence of anti-immigration attitudes among the far right electorate
AN  - 2568176909
AB  - This article focuses on the prevalence of anti-immigration attitudes among the far-right electorate. Drawing on the distinction between the predictive power of immigration concerns, and the question of how widespread these concerns are among the far-right voter pool, we proceed in two steps. First, we assess the extent to which anti-immigration attitudes are a necessary condition for voting far-right; and second, we examine whether far-right voters with different levels of anti-immigration attitudes exhibit similar individual and attitudinal characteristics. Using data from the 8th wave of the European Social Survey (ESS) we find that, surprisingly, anti-immigration attitudes are not a necessary condition for voting for the far-right as approximately one third of far-right voters have no concerns over immigration. We further show that far-right voters with different levels of immigration concerns have different profiles when it comes to other predictors of the far right-vote including ideological affinity, attachment to the EU and government satisfaction. Our contribution is significant as we suggest that there are different routes to voting for the far right by groups with different grievances, including non- immigration related.

T1  - Race talk: How racial worldview impacts discussions in interracial relationships
AN  - 2541701703
AB  - Using a mixed-method approach, this study investigates how individuals believe race impacts their interracial relationship. Two-hundred and three individuals representing diverse racial-gender compositions of relationships responded to a series of measures to assess their Racial Worldview—a collective of notions about racial/ethnic identity, intergroup relations, and recognition of racist hegemony—before indicating the ways in which race or racial issues affect their romantic partnership. Results revealed four distinct types of Racial Worldview through K-means cluster and four broad themes of influences on relationship communication and functioning. Cross-tabs analyses indicated that Racial Worldview and participants perceptions of the impact of race were related with statistically significant differences between those who acknowledge racism and valued group differences reaching different conclusions than those who do not. The results add to existing research by drawing attention to the heterogeneity of thought and understanding within interracial relationships. The promise of using Racial Worldview in future research is discussed.

T1  - Differences by Victim Race and Ethnicity in Race- and Ethnicity-Motivated Violent Bias Crimes: A National Study
AN  - 2540330210
AB  - Over 80% of bias-motivated violent victimization is motivated by race or ethnicity and over 50% of bias victimization occurs in non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Our aim was to determine the risk and health impacts of race/ethnicity-motivated violent victimization by victim race/ethnicity. We examined data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (2003-2015) to estimate violent victimization risk by victim race/ethnicity across race/ethnicity bias victimization, other types of bias victimizations, and non-bias violent victimizations. We examined incident and offender characteristics for race/ethnicity-motivated victimization by victim race/ethnicity. The risk of race/ethnicity-motivated violent victimization was greater for non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) and Hispanics than for NHWs (incidence rate ratios [IRR] = 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.0, 2.0], and IRR = 1.6; 95% CI = [1.2, 2.1]). This translates into an additional 46.7 incidents per 100,000 person-years (95% CI = [1.4, 92.1]) for the NHB population and an additional 60.3 incidents per 100,000 person-years (95% CI = [20.3, 100.4]) for the Hispanic population. Violent incidents for NHB victims more frequently resulted in injury or medical care. Nearly 40% of NHB victims reported difficulties at school or work related to the incident where only 21.5% of NHWs and 11.7% of Hispanic victims reported similar problems. Roughly 37% of NHB victims identified a NHW offender and 45% of NHW victims identified a NHB offender. Hispanic victims identified NHB or NHW offenders in over 70% of incidents. Although literature suggests that NHWs account for the majority of bias victimizations, the risk of non-fatal violent victimization motivated by race/ethnicity is greater for NHBs and Hispanics. Crimes perpetrated against NHBs are likely more severe and victim/offender racial incongruity is common. Findings provide empiric evidence on race/ethnicity-related structural disadvantage with adverse health consequences.

T1  - Women’s Daily Performance, Enjoyment, and Comfort in Male-Dominated Majors: The Role of Social Interactions in Classes
AN  - 2531845567
AB  - Women drop out of male-dominated majors (MDMs) at a higher rate than men (Blickenstaff 2005). Research is needed to better understand contextual factors in the major, such as social interactions in major classes, that may increase women’s engagement in MDMs and ultimately reduce attrition (Lawson et al. in Sex Roles 78:542–560, 2018). The present study examined whether women in MDMs differed from men in MDMs and women in gender-neutral majors (GNMs) in terms of (1) levels of daily student engagement in major classes; and (2) the association between daily social interactions in classes and student engagement. Daily data were collected from 120 students (40 women in MDMs, 40 men in MDMs, 40 women in GNMs) about social interactions (talking to a peer, interacting with a professor one-on-one, and class discussions) and student engagement (perceived performance, enjoyment, and feelings of comfort) in major classes at the end of the day over a two week period. Results indicated that women in MDMs reported lower levels of daily engagement in major classes, relative to their peers. Talking with a peer and class discussions were associated with higher levels of student engagement, but these associations were qualified by group. Overall, the daily association between social experiences and student engagement were stronger for women in MDMs, relative to their peers. Results support the social-contextual model of prejudice (Murphy et al in Policy Insights Behav Brain Sci 5:66–74, 2018) in that classroom experiences disadvantaged women in MDMs, but daily social interactions may be particularly beneficial for women in these contexts.

T1  - White Working-Class Support for Trump: Understanding People in Their Social Worlds
AN  - 2532485856
AB  - Why do working-class Whites support Donald Trump? The accepted explanation points to racial and ethnic resentment and anxiety about immigration, with economic factors secondary. Based on a community study, the author argues that feelings of reverse discrimination and anti-immigrant sentiment reflect both racial and economic factors. This article explains why it is difficult to conclude that either factor was more important than the other.

T1  - Reactions by émigré Polish leaders and intellectuals in the United States to the television series <i>Holocaust: The Story of the Family Weiss</i> (1978)
AN  - 2568242196
AB  - Matyjaszek’s article discusses a set of reactions by Polish émigré cultural and political activists in the United States to the screening of the NBC television series Holocaust: The Story of the Family Weiss on 16–19 April 1978. It offers an analysis of the emergence of Holocaust history as a source of collective identity and memory in western societies, and as a part of popular culture. The end of the 1970s witnessed a series of cultural and political events as well as the publication of scholarly texts that put images of the mass murder of the European Jews at the centre of North American and global debates on identity and history as well as their political uses. In his analysis of reactions by Polish intellectuals and community leaders, Matyjaszek examines the cultural position of members of the post-war Central-Eastern European intelligentsia in the United States, both in relation to their own reference group’s painful and violent history, and to their position within the North American society of the time. In a critical evaluation of contemporary uses of the concepts of ‘bystander’ and ‘survivor’ with regard to the Holocaust, he focuses on a set of documents stored in the private archive of Jan Nowak-Jeziorański (Ossoliński Institute, Wrocław, Poland), as well as on published documents and correspondence.

T1  - Racial Attitudes and Criminal Justice Policy
AN  - 2623521699
AB  - Empirical research on public policy preferences must attend to Whites’ animus toward Blacks. For a quarter-century, studies have consistently found that Kinder and Sanders’s four-item measure of “racial resentment” is a robust predictor of almost every social and criminal justice policy opinion. Racial animus increases Whites’ opposition to social welfare policies that benefit Blacks and their support for punitive policies that disadvantage this “out-group.” Any public opinion study that fails to include racial resentment risks omitted variable bias. Despite the continuing salience of out-group animus, recent scholarship, especially in political science, has highlighted other racial attitudes that can influence public policy preferences. Two developments are of particular importance. First, Chudy showed the progressive impact of racial sympathy, a positive out-group attitude in which Whites are distressed by incidents of Blacks’ suffering (such as the killing of George Floyd). Second, Jardina and others documented that Whites’ in-group racial attitudes, such as White identity/consciousness or white nationalism, have political consequences, reinforcing the effects of racial resentment. As the United States becomes a majority-minority nation, diverse in-group and out-group racial attitudes are likely to play a central role in policies—including within criminal justice—that the public endorses.

T1  - Bias in the Air: A Nationwide Exploration of Teachers’ Implicit Racial Attitudes, Aggregate Bias, and Student Outcomes
AN  - 2455488209
AB  - Theory suggests that teachers’ implicit racial attitudes affect their students, but large-scale evidence on U.S. teachers’ implicit biases and their correlates is lacking. Using nationwide data from Project Implicit, we found that teachers’ implicit White/Black biases (as measured by the implicit association test) vary by teacher gender and race. Teachers’ adjusted bias levels are lower in counties with larger shares of Black students. In the aggregate, counties in which teachers hold higher levels of implicit and explicit racial bias have larger adjusted White/Black test score inequalities and White/Black suspension disparities.

AB  - Between 2015 and 2017, the European Union (EU) was confronted with a major crisis in its history, the so-called “European refugee crisis.” Since the multifaceted crisis has provoked many different responses, it is also likely to have influenced individuals’ assessments of immigrants and European integration. Using data from three waves of the European Social Survey (ESS) — the wave before the crisis in 2012, the wave at the beginning of the crisis in 2014, and the wave right after the (perceived) height of the crisis in 2016 — we test the degree to which the European refugee crisis increased Europeans’ anti-immigrant sentiment and Euroscepticism, as well as the influence of Europeans’ anti-immigrant attitudes on their level of Euroscepticism. As suggested by prior research, our results indicate that there is indeed a consistent and solid relationship between more critical attitudes toward immigrants and increased Euroscepticism. Surprisingly, however, we find that the crisis increased neither anti-immigrant sentiments nor critical attitudes toward the EU and did not reinforce the link between rejection of immigrants and rejection of the EU. These findings imply that even under a strong external shock, fundamental political attitudes remain constant.

T1  - The psychosocial effects of Native American mascots: a comprehensive review of empirical research findings
AN  - 2422105959
AB  - Approximately 2,000 teams in the U.S. utilize Native American mascots, the majority of which are associated with schools. Across the nation there continue to be many intense conflicts over these mascots. Most conflicts focus on differences in opinion, rather than on the effects of these mascots. The purpose of this article is to provide educational decision-makers with a comprehensive review of research on the psychosocial effects of Native American mascots. This body of research suggests that these mascots generate undesirable effects. First, they are psychologically detrimental to Native American students. Second, for non-Native persons, they are associated with negative stereotypes of Native Americans. Third, these mascots undermine intergroup relations by increasing negative stereotyping of Native Americans. Lastly, supporters of these mascots are more apt to believe prejudicial ideas. We discuss these findings relative to broader societal contexts.

T1  - Color-Blind Racial Attitudes Among Social Work Students: Exploration of Individual and Social Network Correlates
AN  - 2428991832
AB  - Racial attitudes can be shaped by personal attributes and social network properties. Literature on White social work students’ racial attitudes remains scarce. The purposes of this study are to explore racial attitudes among social work students and identify personal and social network correlates of such attitudes. One hundred and sixty-three White social work students in a major Midwest public university were recruited via social work electronic mailing list to complete an anonymous online survey measuring personal-level characteristics (e.g., demographic information and racial attitudes as measured by the color-blind racial attitude scale) and social network composition (e.g., information regarding network diversity). Descriptive analysis and linear regression models were conducted for the study. Social work students demonstrated moderately low levels of color-blind racial attitudes. Age was positively associated with unawareness of institutional and blatant racism. Identifying as politically liberal was associated with lower unawareness of racial privilege, institutional racism, and blatant racism. Having more social network members to talk to about topics related to race and ethnicity was associated with lower unawareness of blatant racism. Being familiar with a campus antidiscrimination protest was negatively associated with unawareness of racial privilege and blatant racism. Implications for social work educators are discussed.

T1  - What Difference Does a Negative Opinion Climate Make? Assessing Immigrants’ Low-Wage Risks in Times of Heightened Anti-Immigrant Attitudes
AN  - 2439514972
AB  - The paper argues that a negative opinion climate vis-à-vis immigrants increases the low-wage risks of second-generation immigrants. Analysing data from 18 waves of the German Socio-Economic Panel and using a matched case design, we provide strong support for this hypothesis. The findings complement studies of immigrants’ wages, bringing evidence for their sensitivity to contextual factors. They also complement recent findings from firm-level studies that found that the wage bias in cases of second-generation immigrants reflects the perception of competition between them and German workers.

T1  - Has religiosity become a key factor in Jewish Israelis' attitudes toward minorities? A call for research
TT  - Religiosity and minorities
AN  - 2532611359
AB  - PurposeAttitudes toward minority employees are hard to predict, and there is no enough information about the variables that are associated with increased and decreased prejudice toward them. The Jewish and Arab education systems in Israel are, for the most part, segregated, which may potentially contribute to prejudice and alienation between the two populations. The integration of Israeli–Arab teachers in Jewish schools has been suggested to reduce prejudice. The current study sought to examine Israeli teachers' attitudes toward the inclusion of Arab teachers in Jewish schools (AJ) and its relation to degree of religiosity, minority status and demographic variables.Design/methodology/approachA total of 1,644 teachers completed an online 22-item questionnaire that surveyed background variables such as gender, mother tongue, seniority and degree of religiosity, the two independent variables, religiosity and minority status, and the dependent variable, attitude toward the inclusion of AJ.FindingsOverall, teachers exhibited positive attitudes toward the integration of AJ. Multiple linear regression indicated that among Jewish teachers, the degree of religiosity was the strongest predictor of the teachers' attitudes toward inclusion but was a poor predictor among Arabs. Conversely, minority status was the strongest predictor among Arab teachers but was a poor predictor among Israeli Jews. Not only did religiosity differ in its prediction of attitudes among Arabs and Jews but also the patterns of religiosity were quite different among these two groups.Research limitations/implicationsWhile the overall sample was wide, the specific minority groups that were examined were small and did not allow deep exploration of minority nuances. The study's generalizability is hampered by the given exceptionality of the Israeli context, where “Church” and State are not separated. Religiosity was examined in a unidimensional way and failed to explore other related factors that may be relevant, such as political inclination.Practical implicationsThe study further refutes the notion of commonality among minorities. It proposes to place more emphasis on religion's role in attitudes toward minority employees. Further research into the role of religiosity in Israeli Jews' attitudes toward Arabs is needed.Social implicationsThe findings suggest that the degree of religiosity might be a central factor in Israeli Jews' attitudes toward the Arab minority in general.Originality/valueThe research calls attention to the association of Judaism and nationalism as well as segregation, contributing to negative attitudes and prejudice toward the Arab minority. Unlike previous research using contact theory, the authors call attention to the importance of examining willingness to make contact prior to examining the impact of contact itself.

T1  - “A Little More Ghetto, a Little Less Cultured”: Are There Racial Stereotypes about Interracial Daters in the United States?
AN  - 2406942034
AB  - Negative stereotypes about racial minorities, particularly African Americans, persist in the United States. Given the imperviousness of racial stereotypes about minorities, can individuals who date interracially also be stereotyped? The author investigates this by conducting the first systematic study of men’s attitudes toward white and black women who date outside their race. First, the author inductively uncovers these stereotypes through focus groups. Second, to assess these stereotypes’ nationwide prevalence and to minimize social desirability bias, the author applies a survey experiment, in which interracial dating is subtly primed via photographs of couples, to a national sample of men. The findings are mixed. In the experiment, crossing the white-black racial boundary does activate negative stereotypes for women, which may have reputational costs, but mostly among older white male respondents. These costs include changes in men’s perceptions of their class status, cultural values, and even sexual practices. In conclusion, interracial dating is a key social site where gender-based moral norms are policed, class divisions are constructed, and racial boundaries are maintained.

T1  - Economic conditions, group relative deprivation and ethnic threat perceptions: a cross-national perspective
AN  - 2376776340
AB  - Explaining negative attitudes towards immigration in general and threat due to immigration, in particular, has been a major topic of study in recent decades. While intergroup contact has received considerable attention in explaining ethnic threat, group relative deprivation (GRD), that is, feelings that one’s group is unfairly deprived of desirable goods in comparison to relevant out-groups, has been largely ignored in cross-national research. Nevertheless, various smaller-scale studies have demonstrated that GRD can have a decisive impact on prejudice. In the current study, we examine the association between GRD and ethnic threat systematically across 20 European countries, thereby controlling for intergroup contact and value priorities. The 7th round of the European Social Survey (ESS) includes questions assessing respondents’ feelings of group deprivation compared to immigrants and offers for the first time an opportunity to contextualise the threat-inducing effect of GRD across Europe. A multilevel structural equation model (MLSEM) demonstrates a considerable association between GRD and ethnic threat both on the individual and country levels. The results indicate that GRD is not only an important mediating factor between social structural positions and perceived threat, but also fully mediates the relation between contextual economic indicators and ethnic threat.

T1  - Targeted identity-safety interventions cause lasting reductions in discipline citations among negatively stereotyped boys
AN  - 2271770728
AB  - High rates of discipline citations predict adverse life outcomes, a harm disproportionately borne by Black and Latino boys. We hypothesized that these citations arise in part from negative cycles of interaction between students and teachers, which unfold in contexts of social stereotypes. Can targeted interventions to facilitate identity safety-a sense of belonging, inclusion, and growth-for students help? Experiment 1 combined social-belonging, values-affirmation, and growth-mindset interventions delivered in several class sessions in 2 middle schools with a large Latino population (N = 669). This treatment reduced citations among negatively stereotyped boys in 7th and 8th grades by 57% as compared with a randomized control condition, 95% CI [−77%, −20%]. A growth-mindset only treatment was also effective (70% reduction, 95% CI [−84%, −43%]). Experiment 2 tested the social-belonging intervention alone, a grade earlier, at a third school with a large Black population and more overall citations (N = 137 sixth-grade students). In 2 class sessions, students reflected on stories from previous 7th-grade students, which represented worries about belonging and relationships with teachers early in middle school as normal and as improving with time. This exercise reduced citations among Black boys through the end of high school by 65%, 95% CI [−85%, −15%], closing the disparity with White boys over 7 years by 75%. Suggesting improved interactions with teachers, longitudinal analyses found that the intervention prevented rises in citations involving subjective judgments (e.g., "insubordination") within 6th and 7th grades. It also forestalled the emergence of worries about being seen stereotypically by the end of 7th grade. Identity threat can give rise to cycles of interaction that are maladaptive for both teachers and students in school; targeted exercises can interrupt these cycles to improve disciplinary outcomes over years.

T1  - Stigmatization of War Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): Stereotyping and Social Distance Findings
AN  - 2406941436
AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects a significant portion of the US population, but there remains limited information on public responses to affected individuals. Diagnosed mental illnesses can lead to negative stereotyping by the public, who can then socially exclude or otherwise discriminate. This paper presents results of an experiment (N = 830) that assessed the extent to which workers with PTSD labels—either resulting from an auto accident or wartime military service—evoked negative stereotypes in a workplace scenario and social distance from study participants. Results demonstrated that PTSD from wartime service evoked perceptions of dangerousness and incompetence (similar to other severe mental illness conditions) but did not evoke worse perceptions of assertiveness (a requisite managerial trait). The condition also led to levels of social exclusion similar to some other mental health labels. These findings provide insight into the context of stereotyping and social distance for PTSD relative to other conditions.

T1  - Do Positive and Negative Stereotypes of Gay and Heterosexual Men Affect Job-Related Impressions?
AN  - 2112429572
AB  - Traditional gender stereotypes encompass (typically masculine) agency, comprising task-related competence, and (typically feminine) communion or warmth. Both agency and communion are important for successful performance in many jobs. Stereotypes of gay men include the perception that they are less gender-typed than their heterosexual counterparts are (i.e., more gay-stereotypical and less masculine). Using a German sample, Experiment 1 (n = 273) tested whether gay men at the same time appear higher in communion, but lower in agency than heterosexual men and whether a trade-off in hireability impressions results between both groups if jobs require both agency and communion. We measured participants’ willingness to work together with applicants, in addition to hireability, as dependent variables, and we assessed as mediators perceived masculinity, how gay-stereotypical male targets were judged, as well as perceived communion and agency. Findings showed that gay men appeared more gay-stereotypical, less masculine, and more communal than heterosexual men, but no difference in agency was observed. The direct effects of sexual orientation on willingness to engage in work-related contact and on hireability were not significant. Instead, both positive and negative indirect effects of sexual orientation on hireability/contact were found. Experiment 2 (n = 32) replicated the findings pertaining to agency, communion, and masculinity and demonstrated that a gay applicant appeared better suited for traditionally feminine jobs, whereas a heterosexual applicant appeared better suited for traditionally masculine jobs. We discuss who is discriminated under which conditions, based on gender-related stereotypes, when men’s sexual orientation is revealed in work contexts.

T1  - Examining the Relationship Between Diversity Exposure and Students' Color-Blind Racial Attitudes and Awareness of Racial Oppression
AN  - 2220278448
AB  - This cross-sectional study surveyed graduate-level social work and undergraduate psychology students (N = 409) at a large university to explore the association of diversity exposure (diversity of undergraduate institution, diversity of childhood neighborhood, previous diversity courses), and color-blind racial attitudes and awareness of racial oppression. White students scored significantly higher on level of color-blind racial attitudes compared to racial/ethnic minorities. Students who attended predominantly White undergraduate institutions had greater awareness of racial oppression than students who attended racially balanced or institutions comprised exclusively of one racial/ethnic group other than White. Understanding how diversity exposure influences color-blind racial attitudes and awareness of racial oppression will better inform multicultural training and curricular delivery.

T1  - Some personal reflections on Michael Banton's illustrious career in the sociology of race relations
AN  - 2164082771
AB  - Given that we already have two excellent appreciations of Michael's overall contributions to the field of race and ethnic relations, as well as to sociological theory and social policy more broadly (Barot 2006; Husbands 2016), I have decided to confine my reflections to a couple of areas where my friendship with Michael has been particularly rewarding for me and to other activities in which we have both been involved. As my career has been split between Britain and America, and increasingly in the latter country in recent years, it is to this earlier period that I will focus my comments. Let me say at the outset of these remarks that I did not always agree with Michael's intellectual positions on a variety of issues. But this was never a problem with Michael whose philosophy was to challenge ideas with other ideas and that such a procedure was the only manner in which academic progress would ever take place. The Ghost of Karl Popper loomed large in his weltanschauung which was indeed fortunate as on several issues I found myself agreeing with his great rival John Rex, who was a little less comfortable with intellectual dissent! Michael himself never failed to explore a vast range of topics — from ideas concerning racial theories, case studies of race relations in West Africa and Britain, not to mention both national and global reports on such practical issues like policing and the intemational action against racial discrimination — and he was even prepared to continue his debates with John Rex's positions even after John's death in December 2011 (Symposium 2015). So I am sure that he would have no objection to me taking issue with some of his own arguments at a time when he is no longer able to respond in person.

T1  - Reflections from the Field: Reduce Age Stereotyping through Experiential Learning: An Intergenerational Pen Pal Project
AN  - 2219318727
AB  - Misconceptions about the aging process and the negative stereotypes associated with older adults can impede positive social interactions and discourage meaningful conversations between younger and older generations. Age stereotypes oftentimes occur automatically when a person uses a top-down or category-based processing style when meeting or engaging with a person perceived as older (Schroyen et al., 2017). This can be explained using the age stereotypes in interaction model in which Hummert (1994a) advanced that the physical characteristics associated with aging (e.g., grey hair, wrinkles) activate negative stereotypes when an older person is encountered in an age-sensitive context (e.g., nursing home, hospital). Hummert (1994b) further postulated that negative age stereotype affect perceivers' beliefs about the older person's ability to communicate, resulting in an age-adapted speech style. This speech pattern, known as elderspeak, further reduces interaction and augments the negative stereotypes of aging. While there is a good amount of information that can be disseminated in the classroom to educate on the realities of aging and dispel myths, formal education does not entirely shield us from believing ageist stereotypes or using an ageist communication pattern. Therefore, it is important to supplement classroom learning with practical experience which exposes students to elders in a variety of settings. This helps them to understand the uniqueness and diversity found in the older adult population. One effective measure is a Pen Pal program. Now in its fifth year, more than 75 students enrolled in my undergraduate Introduction to Aging Studies course have participated in this engaging intergenerational learning activity designed to promote bottom-up processing as students get to know elders without the visual cues of aging or an age-sensitive context.

T1  - Political constructions of a cross-community identity in a divided society: how politicians articulate Northern Irishness
AN  - 2153869934
AB  - A shared identity has been shown to reduce prejudice between conflicting social groups. One such common national category is the 'Northern Irish' identity which can be inclusive of both Catholics and Protestants. This study analyses the plenary sessions of the Northern Ireland Assembly to show how the national category 'Northern Irish' is framed by politicians. Content analysis shows that it is used more often by centrist parties who tend to frame it positively and as part of their political viewpoint. There is also evidence of the instrumental use of this identity by unionists in line with the ingroup projection model.

T1  - Constructing Critical Conversations in Social Work Supervision: Creating Change
AN  - 2113981423
AB  - Clinical social work supervision is not immune to enactments of racial and social injustice, prejudice, power and privilege rampant in our social environment and institutions. These dynamics are active in all social interactions. Most often felt on impact, these remain underground and unevenly experienced—though predominantly by people representing intersecting marginalized identities. Such real enactments can be misunderstood or avoided in social work supervision. Negative consequences not only impede learning for the supervisee and supervisor, and affect clinical understanding of client care they also perpetuate injustice based on power and social locations. Social work supervision provides space for critical analysis to identify and alter dynamics of power, privilege, and social oppression. The critical conversations (CC) model provides a framework to illuminate and examine power dynamics in order to produce change with parallel insight and action—supervisee, supervisor, and client care. Supervisee and supervisor gain capacity to engage in reflection, examine personal and professional values, hold tension and tolerate ambiguity, use one self critically, articulate ideas and insights thoughtfully and effectively, as well as inform clinical understanding of clients. The need for critical dialogue in social work supervision regarding dynamics of sameness, differences, intersectional identities, power and privilege is emphasized. Theoretical grounding is offered to elucidate how complex structural forces of oppression and privilege, cultural patterns and narratives are internalized. A definition of CC, its theoretical underpinnings and the CC model are presented with a case scenario to illuminate the application of the CC model in clinical supervision.

T1  - The three facets of national identity: Identity dynamics and attitudes toward immigrants in Russia
AN  - 2154944731
AB  - This study contributes to the discussion on individual-level determinants of anti-immigrant prejudice by applying a multi-dimensional model of manifestations of national identity in Russia. This context is particularly interesting as anti-immigrant sentiments are widespread across all social strata and thus, socioeconomic indicators and political views are weak predictors of such sentiments. We use cross-sectional data from 1995, 2003, and 2013 ISSP National Identity module to assess the dynamics of three facets of national identity in Russia, namely nationalism, political patriotism, and cultural patriotism, and their relations with attitudes toward immigrants. We find nationalism, political patriotism, and anti-immigrant attitudes to increase over time. More importantly, our findings support the theoretical distinction between the facets of national identity: nationalism is linked to anti-immigrant attitudes, political patriotism is linked to more positive attitudes, and cultural patriotism is largely unrelated to attitudes toward immigrants. We show that these facets of national identity have much higher predictive power than sociodemographic indicators or political views. Our findings underscore the utility of a nuanced assessment of national identity in explaining attitudes toward immigrants in non-Western contexts.

T1  - Doddering but dear … even in the eyes of young children? Age stereotyping and prejudice in childhood and adolescence
AN  - 2110222165
AB  - This study aims to explore age prejudice, and to examine age stereotyping in children and adolescents by adopting the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) as a theoretical framework. It was hypothesised that children are socialised into adopting an ambivalent representation of old age (socialisation hypothesis) and that this cognitive bias becomes weaker in adolescence due to greater cognitive maturity (developmental hypothesis). By analysing representative data from Portugal (European Social Survey; N = 2367), it was ascertained that the ambivalent age stereotype (higher evaluations of warmth than competence for older people) is indeed a shared social representation of older people in Portuguese society. A total of 103 Portuguese children (6–10 year olds) and adolescents (11–15 year olds) were then sampled from a local school and responded to age‐appropriate measures assessing age prejudice as well as age stereotypes. Contrary to previous studies, the findings do not provide evidence for the existence of age prejudice because both children and adolescents reported positive feelings towards older people. However, the socialisation hypothesis was corroborated by showing that the ambivalent old age stereotype was already present in childhood. Contrary to the stipulated developmental hypothesis, the magnitude of this cognitive bias was very similar in adolescence.

T1  - The multimodal construction of race: a review of critical race theory research
AN  - 2050474882
AB  - Issues of race periodically rupture in the national and international consciousness, while at other times, there is a false belief that society has arrived at a post-racial era. Either way, there remains impetus for the critical interrogation of the racialisation of multimodal literacies in education, and critical race theory (CRT) is a leading approach. This article reviews original studies that collectively analyse multimodal texts and practices to understand the construction of race in education. Multimodal texts have proliferated in online textual ecologies due to the ease of production and rapid global dissemination of image-based texts in the twenty-first century. Such texts combine two or more modes, such as images, words, sounds, and gestures. Sites for the circulation of multimodal literacies - online and offline - serve to disrupt, reify, or perhaps even exacerbate racial identities, prejudice, and subordination in education. The review highlights the prevalent themes: (a) Discursive construction of race in the spoken mode, (b) Anti-racist and multimodal counter-narratives, (c) The racialisation of multimodal literature for children and adolescents, and (d) Race in music, visual and performing arts, and digital media. Gaps in CRT research and challenges are posed for future research of race in the context of cultural and technological change.

T1  - Predictors of “the last acceptable racism”: Group threats and public attitudes toward Gypsies and Travellers
AN  - 2047355690
AB  - Prejudice against Gypsies/Travellers is prevalent in the United Kingdom and elsewhere but there is a lack of research investigating the underlying factors. The present research examined the relationships between different types of intergroup threats and their antecedents and U.K. residents' attitudes toward Gypsies/Travellers. Regression analyses confirmed that negative stereotypes, symbolic threats, and intergroup anxiety predicted attitudes, whereas multicultural ideology endorsement, ingroup identification, realistic threats, and intergroup anxiety predicted support for Gypsy/Traveller group rights. Moreover, multicultural ideology endorsement predicted support for group rights indirectly through realistic threats, whereas negative stereotypes predicted attitudes indirectly through symbolic threats and intergroup anxiety and predicted support for group rights indirectly through realistic threats and intergroup anxiety. Discussion focuses on the implications for strategies aimed at reducing what is often defined as “the last acceptable racism.”

T1  - Does Asserting a Nonblack Identity Elicit Positive Evaluations? White Observers' Reactions to Black, Biracial, Multiracial, and White Job Applicants
AN  - 1986849627
AB  - How do white observers react when people with black heritage assert a biracial, multiracial, or white identity rather than a black identity? To address this question, I conducted two experiments in which participants evaluated a darker-skinned or a lighter-skinned job applicant who presented his identity as either black, biracial, multiracial, or white. The results show that identity assertions influenced how white observers categorized applicants but not how they evaluated applicants. Most white observers accepted the identity of both the lighter-skinned and darker-skinned applicant when they asserted that they were black, biracial, or multiracial, but observers did not accept the identity of the darker-skinned applicant who asserted a white identity. However, white observers did not perceive applicants who asserted that they were multiracial, biracial, or white as more hirable than applicants who asserted that they were black. Based on these results, I argue that racial identity assertions do not independently provide a pathway to racialized advantages.

T1  - Multilingualism and Out-Group Acceptance: The Mediating Roles of Cognitive Flexibility and Deprovincialization
AN  - 1965318247
AB  - In this research, we systematically study multilingualism as a predictor of acceptance of ethnic out-groups. It is argued that people who speak more languages are more cognitively flexible, that is, they have an enhanced flexibility in understanding and representing information. Higher cognitive flexibility is in turn expected to be related to higher deprovincialization: a reevaluation of one's ethnocentric worldview. Deprovincialization is then expected to result in more openness toward ethnic out-groups, evidenced by a more inclusive notion of the national identity and reduced out-group dislike. Cross-sectional survey data among a representative sample of native Dutch participants from the Netherlands (N = 792) provide convincing support for these hypotheses and show that multilingualism is an important yet understudied factor in social-psychological research on prejudice reduction.

T1  - Racial Attitudes of PreK-12 and Postsecondary Educators: Descriptive Evidence From Nationally Representative Data
AN  - 1943426023
AB  - PreK-12 and postsecondary educators' racial attitudes have important consequences for students' learning and development, yet we know little about educators' racial attitudes overall, how their attitudes might differ from those of noneducators, or how attitudes might be changing over time. I investigate these questions using the nationally representative General Social Survey. Some educators hold worrisome racial attitudes, yet compared to noneducators, educators are less opposed to governmental equalizing efforts, give more politically liberal explanations for racial inequalities, express less negative racial stereotypes, and report less social distance and collective resentments toward minoritized groups. Many educator/noneducator differences were explained by demographics, particularly education level. Time trends mostly show progress in Americans' racial attitudes, with generally similar trends for educators and noneducators.

T1  - Is Blindness Contagious? Examining Racial Attitudes among People of Color with Close Interracial Relationships
AN  - 1934858291
AB  - Are people of color with close relationships with whites more likely to embrace colorblind racial ideologies (CBRI)? Using restricted data from waves 1 and 2 of the Portraits of American Life Study (N = 2,713), collected in 2006 and 2012, we test whether black, Latina/o, and Asian respondents are more likely to express colorblind racial attitudes if they have an intimate partner or close friends who are white. We use ordinal logit models to examine seven CBRI attitudinal items, controlling for the respondent's socioeconomic characteristics, immigrant generation, national origin, gender, age, characteristics of the city, and region. Although black, Latina/o, and Asian respondents are less likely to express CBRI than whites are, respondents of color with close relationships with whites are more likely to minimize certain types of racism, even after controlling for other characteristics of the individual. We discuss the implications of these findings, considering the patterns of antiblack and anti-immigrant attitudes among groups of color and placing them in the context of the more negative attitudes often expressed by whites. We also describe how other demographic patterns in these attitudes could shape future trends in attitudes and suggest possible interventions.

T1  - Does Terror Defeat Contact? Intergroup Contact and Prejudice Toward Muslims Before and After the London Bombings
AN  - 1961000088
AB  - Allport (1954) proposed a series of preconditions that have subsequently been shown to facilitate effects of intergroup contact on attitudes toward outgroups (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). The present study examines whether objective threat, in the form of the 2005 London 7/7 terror attack, can inhibit the positive effects of contact. We tested hypotheses that contact would affect prejudice toward Muslims regardless of the bombings (contact prevails) or that the bombings would inhibit the effects of contact on prejudice (threat inhibits). Data were collected through representative national surveys 1 month before and again 1 month after the attacks in London on July 7, 2005 (pre-7/7 N = 931; post-7/7 N = 1,100), which represent relatively low and relatively high salience of "objective threat." Prejudice against Muslims significantly increased following the bombings. Psychological threats to safety (safety threat) and to customs (symbolic threat) mediated the impact of the bombings on prejudice, whereas perceived economic threat did not. All 3 types of psychological threat mediated between contact and prejudice. Multigroup structural equation modeling showed that, even though the objective threat did raise levels of psychological threats, the positive effects of contact on prejudice through perceived psychological threats persisted. Results therefore support a contact prevails hypothesis. [web URL: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-07257-001]

T1  - Between Breivik and PEGIDA: the absence of ideologues and leaders on the contemporary European far right
AN  - 1883150738
AB  - In the aftermath of the Norwegian terror attacks of 22 July 2011, the question of agency with regard to the convicted perpetrator, Anders Behring Breivik, has frequently been discussed. Did he really act on his own? Were his actions self-directed? Was he, as a typical 'lone wolf', inspired by the prevalent far-right concept of 'leaderless resistance' or, simply, a blind tool, a string puppet pushed and pulled by dark forces, as some commentators have claimed? His cut-and-paste manifesto points to inspiration from ideas circulating in the European Counter Jihad Movement (ECJM), in itself a contradictory mix of ideological positions. A number of these ideas were given new life when the so-called 'populist right-wing movement of indignation', the Patriotische Europäer Gegen die Islamisierung des Abendlandes (PEGIDA) took to the streets of Dresden in the autumn of 2014. The driving force behind PEGIDA, Lutz Bachmann, with a past as petty criminal and doorman, is an unlikely front man for one of the most successful political initiatives in post-unification Germany. Comparing Breivik and PEGIDA, Önnerfors argues that the ECJM is part of the 'third generation' of right-wing discourse that is without a consistent world view, dominant leaders and prolific ideologues. Instead, in a new atmosphere of 'politics of passion' and 'post-politics', fuzzy ECJM ideology turns into a screen upon which diffuse uneasiness with current political affairs can be projected and channelled. Outside the scope of Önnerfors's article but worth noting is the considerable impact these developments have had on electoral support for right-wing populist parties such as the Front National in France, the Alternative für Deutschland in Germany and the Sverigedemokraterna in Sweden.

T1  - Does Size Really Matter? On the Relationship between Immigrant Group Size and Anti-Immigrant Prejudice: IMR
AN  - 1876790251
AB  - Group threat theory understands prejudice as a manifestation of the threat, either actual or assumed, that minority groups pose to majority groups. This theory is often operationalized by analyzing the impact of group size on anti-immigrant prejudice. We test this hypothesis with a new dataset documenting 487 effects of group size on prejudice provided in 55 studies. More than half of these results show no relationship and the remainder shows both positive and negative relationships. Three explanations for this divergence are that there are (1) differences in the measurement of prejudice and immigrant group size across studies; (2) differences in the model through which size is hypothesized to lead to prejudice; and (3) differences in the geographic unit of analysis at which these relationships have been considered. Our analyses support the measurement explanation: results vary across studies because they reflect different measures of group size and prejudice.

T1  - Learning Opportunities: International Students and Lessons About Education, Immigration and Cultural Diversity On and Off the (Atlantic) Canadian Campus
AN  - 1963073357
AB  - This paper explores Canada's accelerated expansion of international university enrollments from the perspective of 72 international students and graduates from 29 countries, who participated in semi-structured interviews conducted in the four provincial capitals of Canada's Atlantic region. Addressing the emerging campus diversity and incoming students' immigration potential, this research illustrates that students encounter campus dynamics and immigration policy landscapes shaped by long-spanning histories of race and ethnic relations, by current multi-scalar iterations of economic development, and by regional reorganizations of immigration and higher education in Canada. In turn, the ways students experience and negotiate their positions within these contexts is directed by multigenerational projects of geographic and social mobility, to include key lessons learned about the possibility of long-term settlement in Canada. Set in less populous urban centers in Canada's Atlantic provinces, the outcomes reported here also provide an opportunity to explore international students' experiences outside Canada's large metropolitan areas and more predictable sites of education internationalization.Alternate abstract:Cet article explore l'expansion accélérée des étudiants internationaux du Canada vue par 72 étudiants et récents diplômés provenant de 29 pays, qui ont participé à des entretiens semi-structurés menés dans les quatre capitales provinciales de la région Atlantique du Canada. Traitant de la diversité émergente du campus et du potentiel d'immigration des étudiants entrants, cette recherche illustre que les étudiants internationaux rencontrent des dynamiques de campus et politique d'immigration façonnés par de longues histoires de relations raciale et ethnique, par d'actuelles itérations multi-scalaires de développement économique, et par des réorganisations régionales de l'immigration et de l'enseignement supérieur au Canada. A leurs tours, la façon dont les étudiants éprouvent et négocient leurs positions dans ces contextes est dirigée par des projets multigénérationnels de mobilité géographique et sociale, pour inclure les principales leçons apprises sur la possibilité d'un établissement à long terme au Canada. Etablis dans des centres urbains plus petits dans les provinces Atlantiques du Canada, les résultats ci-reportés offrent également l'opportunité d'explorer les expériences d'étudiants internationaux à l'extérieur de grandes régions métropolitaines du Canada et des sites d'internationalisation de l'éducation plus prévisibles.

T1  - Conceptions of Immigrant Integration and Racism Among Social Workers in Sweden
AN  - 1855640148
AB  - Drawing on 22 qualitative interviews with social workers in Sweden, this article analyzes how social workers conceive immigrant integration and racism and tackle racism within their institutions and the wider Swedish society. The majority of the white social workers framed integration in relation to cultural differences and denied or minimized the role of racism in structuring their services and the ethnic relations in Sweden. In contrast, social workers with immigrant backgrounds were less compromising in discussing racism and assumed it as a problem both for themselves as institutional actors and as immigrants in everyday life and institutional settings. Social institutions in Sweden have been important actors in endorsing equality and accommodating differences. However, it is of paramount importance for social justice-minded social workers to identify and unsettle those structures and discourses that enable racist and discriminatory policies and practices against those groups who are not viewed as "core" members of the Swedish society. The absence of anti-racist social work within Swedish social work is primarily related to the idea of color-blind welfare universalism that is assumed to transcend the particularity of the needs, experiences, and perspectives of different groups in Sweden. While integration is envisioned and framed as a political project of inclusion of non-white immigrants, it tends to become a political device through which hierarchies of belonging are constructed. Following such conception of integration, cultural/religious differences and equality are framed as conflicting where cultural conformity underpinned by assimilationist discourses becomes a requirement for political, social, and economic equality.

T1  - Racialized illegality: The regulation of informal labor and space
AN  - 1896339515
AB  - Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork in Oakland, California, this paper analyzes the construction of racialized forms of difference between indigenous and nonindigenous Latino workers, based on an examination of their solicitation practices at day labor hiring zones. I reveal how the construction of these racialized divisions shapes how workers organize themselves at hiring zones, and impacts their migration experience and relationship with the host community. I argue that migrants’ experience of illegality must be seen as coterminous with other forms of difference that produces new modes of discrimination not solely reducible to legal status. My concept “racialized illegality” draws attention to how migrants’ experience of illegality exacerbates racial divisions amongst Latino subgroups. Racialized illegality is an analytical tool to push scholarship to assess how an increasingly racially diverse group of Latin American migrants is experiencing migration and settlement processes.

T1  - The contact-prejudice relationship among ethnic minorities: examining personal discrimination as a boundary condition
AN  - 1801901262
AB  - This paper contributes to the literature on how perceived discrimination influences the impact of intergroup contact among ethnic minority members. Previous research has shown that perceived group discrimination inhibits the positive outcomes of intergroup contact among ethnic minority members. In extension, this paper examines whether perceived personal discrimination has a similar negative impact as a boundary condition of the contact-prejudice relationship among ethnic minority members. Analyses expand previous intergroup contact research by showing that the impact of intergroup contact is uniform across various levels of perceived personal discrimination. This finding suggests that the otherwise harmful consequences of perceived personal discrimination can be effectively counterbalanced by positive contact experiences among ethnic minority members. Analyses use evidence from a national probability sample, which was fielded in 2006 to examine some of the largest ethnic minority groups (N = 3,462). The concluding section discusses the theoretical implications of the empirical findings.

T1  - The Nouvelle Droite in Portugal: a new strategy for the radical right in the transition from authoritarianism to democracy
AN  - 1807164657
AB  - Marchi examines how the French Nouvelle Droite (ND) was introduced into Portugal at the end of the Salazarist regime and during the transition to democracy. The relevance of the Portuguese case lies in the fact that the early diffusion of the ND in Europe coincided with the profound crisis of the radical right in Portugal as it faced the liberalization of the authoritarian regime and repression during the revolutionary transition. For that reason the far right in Portugal, in comparative terms, can be seen to have been subject to historical constraints quite different from those in Spain and other Western European democracies. Marchi describes the groups on the Portuguese radical right, and certain figures who were inspired by the ND and disseminated its ideas in Portugal. His analysis of their main publications, their statements and the media campaign to promote the ND from the end of the 1960s to the beginning of the 1980s highlights the different reasons for and ways in which Portuguese radicals engaged and dealt with the ND. Marchi also looks at the reactions of the national right-wing milieu to the spread of ND ideas. As part of his paper's contribution to comparative studies on the transnational radical right, it also provides new evidence, derived from the Portuguese case, of the way in which one of the most important schools of right-wing thought at the end of the twentieth century has influenced extreme-right milieux all over Europe. In light of Tamir Bar-On's analysis of the ND's cultural and pan-European impact, the findings presented here confirm its transnational character while drawing on this and other cases from southern Europe to question the French movement's long-term effectiveness in reorienting the culture of the right-wing milieu.

T1  - Perspective Taking Explains Gender Differences in Late Adolescents' Attitudes Toward Disadvantaged Groups
AN  - 1795436293
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Understanding Diversity and Inequality: Dimensions Ranging from Race, Ethnicity, Immigration and Sexual Identity to Social Class 
Adolescents' attitudes toward disadvantaged groups are surprisingly understudied. What we know from these few studies is that adolescents' attitudes tend to become more favorable over time and that adolescent girls display more favorable attitudes than do adolescent boys. However, researchers have not offered explanations for why these effects occur. We proposed that changes in social-cognitive abilities that accompany adolescent development increase perspective taking and that the increased perspective taking facilitates more favorable attitudes toward disadvantaged groups. Because girls develop social-cognitive abilities earlier than boys, girls should show greater perspective taking and thus more positive attitudes toward disadvantaged groups than should boys. Importantly, we propose that these more positive attitudes are explained better by perspective taking than by gender. Participants were late adolescents (n = 803, 53.3 % female, ages 15-19) from high schools in north-central Florida (United States) participating in an ongoing, multi-wave study. Participants completed a measure of perspective-taking and reported their attitudes toward three disadvantaged groups (Black, gay, and poor people) during their third year of high school and, again, 6 months later during their fourth year of high school. Our findings provided strong support for our theorizing. Girls generally reported warmer attitudes than did boys toward disadvantaged groups, with the gender differences in warmth tending to diminish across time. Similarly, girls were higher than boys in perspective-taking abilities at both time points, although boys increased over time whereas girls did not. Crucially, perspective taking mediated observed gender differences in attitudes, suggesting that perspective taking is a mechanism for improving attitudes toward disadvantaged groups during late adolescence.

T1  - Debating LGBT Workplace Protections in the Bible Belt: Social Identities in Legislative and Media Discourse
AN  - 1794901714
AB  - This article reports a case study of the legislative and media discourse surrounding the addition of sexual orientation and gender identity language to the employment nondiscrimination ordinance of a city in the heart of the Bible Belt. The purpose of the study is to uncover how different identities were constructed and contested at city council meetings and in the news media on the way to passing legal protection for LGBT city employees in a region that is often characterized by anti-gay prejudice. This debate over the nondiscrimination ordinance centered on the question of whether LGBT identities are equivalent to identity categories based on race, gender, or religious belief, and it was shaped by various intergroup communication dynamics, specifically between members of the LGBT minority and the straight majority, between LGBT and Christian identities, and between "true" and "false" Christian identities.

T1  - W E B DuBois on the history of empirical social research
AN  - 1789067596
AB  - This review of The Scholar Denied by Aldon D. Morris emphasizes the importance of DuBois for the start of American empirical social research. A.D. Morris correctly shows why W.E.B. DuBois was rejected, forgotten and suppressed by white sociologists for almost 100 years. Racial prejudices and scientific racism among American sociological elites prevented both Du Bois and his work from receiving the attention they rightly deserve. But my paper accentuates the role of Du Bois in the development of sociology as an empirical social science discipline. He created and published a programme of research on the African-American population. Publishing 'The Philadelphia Negro', he provided an excellent example of how to do such research. He also headed the first school of sociology on the American continent at the Atlanta University from 1898 to 1910.

T1  - 'If I climb a wall of ten meters': capoeira, parkour and the politics of public space among (post)migrant youth in Turin, Italy
AN  - 1786265026
AB  - Rather than being seen as citizens, the children of immigrants are portrayed as a population to be controlled and contained across Europe. In Italy today, debates about cultural 'authenticity' and renewed nationalism accompany waves of moral panic that depict a country under siege by illegal and unwanted immigrants. Specifically in cities, immigrants and their children are imagined and portrayed as alien and out of place. Drawing on fourteen months of ethnographic research in Turin, Italy, with children of immigrants aged between 16 and 21, De Martini Ugolotti and Moyer illustrate how these youth make use of their bodies through capoeira and parkour practices to contest and reappropriate public spaces, thereby challenging dominant visions about what constitutes the public, how it should be used and by whom. They analyse the 'body in place' to understand how the children of immigrants navigate unequal spatial relations and challenge dominant regimes of representation, while also attempting to improve their life conditions and reach their personal goals.

T1  - White [not =] Poor: Whites Distance, Derogate, and Deny Low-Status Ingroup Members
AN  - 1933734197
AB  - Throughout society, White people of low socioeconomic status (SES) face prejudice, often from racial ingroup members. The present research tested the ingroup distancing effect , which predicts that Whites' negative reactions to low-SES ingroup members are motivated responses to perceived threats to their personal and group-level status. To cope with perceived status threats, White people psychologically and physically distance themselves from low-SES Whites. Four studies provide converging support for this theorizing. Among White participants, low-SES Whites elicited derogation, impaired racial categorization and memory, and inflated perceived personal status. White participants explicitly perceived low-SES Whites as greater status threats than low-SES Blacks, and these perceptions of threat predicted increased discomfort in anticipated social situations with low-SES White targets. Moreover, threatened status led Whites who strongly identified with their racial ingroup to physically distance themselves from a low-SES White partner. This research demonstrates that concerns with status motivate prejudice against ingroup members.

T1  - Prejudice and paranoia: a comparative study of antisemitism and Sinophobia in turn-of-the-century Britain
AN  - 1784144946
AB  - Renshaw examines in comparative terms two of the most virulent manifestations of racial prejudice in early twentieth-century British society. The language of antisemitism and Sinophobia in the Edwardian period and the years preceding the First World War, the similarities and differences in the ways that these two forms of prejudice were articulated, and the overlap between them are analysed. Five strands of anti-Jewish and anti-Chinese sentiment and action are discussed. The first examines how international manifestations of antisemitism and Sinophobia, suspicions aimed at Jews and Chinese as transnational diasporic communities, and perceptions of these minorities, through Russian pogroms, the Boxer Rebellion in China and the post-Boer War economic situation in South Africa, were framed in narratives of victimhood and aggression. Second, the transnational and colonial circuits of racialized discourse and the relationship between periphery and metropole are considered, as are divergences in the articulation of anti-Jewish and anti-Chinese prejudice. The third strand investigates the use of the language of 'invasion', used by both the political right and the left in discussing Jewish and Chinese immigration and economic activity in Britain, with Chinese employment in British industries (in this period particularly as sailors on British ships) framed in the context of a demographic 'Asiatic' takeover of European societies. The fourth strand looks at the intersection of racial prejudice and sexual and social angst, the visceral association of immigrant groups with dirt and disease, and the sexual threat that racist and antisemitic literature attributed to Jews and Chinese. Finally, physical manifestations of antisemitism and Sinophobia in the period and the racial violence that occurred in Cardiff and Tredegar in 1911 will be described and placed in context. The article positions Edwardian antisemitism and Sinophobia as a transitory stage in the evolution of British racism: a bridge between the separate domestic and colonial forms of prejudice present in late Victorian discourse, and the new manifestations of racism located in British cities and ports, but aimed at non-white minorities, that emerged in the interwar period.

T1  - Service Delivery Considerations in Dealing with Honour-based Violence
AN  - 1880692334
AB  - This study examines honour-based violence (HBV) towards young women from immigrant families from a variety of standpoints. Interviews with service providers and women affected by HBV reveal that young women in Winnipeg experience emotional abuse and control; financial abuse and perceived exploitation; physical violence and forced marriages. The abuse takes a serious toll on the emotional well-being of young women. We learn that the violation of family honour is one of various factors that lead to family conflict and violence. Other causes of violence include intergenerational conflict, patriarchal norms, settlement stressors, overcrowded living conditions and the precarious mental health of parents and guardians. Young women affected by HBV face multiple and intersecting barriers that prevent them from seeking help, particularly fear of being rejected and isolated by their families and communities if they reveal the violence to others. Recommendations made by women affected and by service providers include access to a safe and welcoming environment including service providers who will respect them, understand their situations, and effectively help them to seek culturally and age appropriate services. Furthermore, family members need assistance on how to parent and discipline their children in a Canadian context.Alternate abstract:La présente étude a examiné les soi-disant violences fondées sur l’honneur envers les jeunesfemmes issues des familles immigrantes de divers points de vue.

Ces abus posent ungrave préjudice au bien-être émotionnel des jeunes femmes. Nous avions noté que la violation del’honneur familial est l’un des facteurs qui mènent à la violence et aux conflits familiaux.

T1  - The Minstrel Legacy: African American English and the Historical Construction of "Black" Identities in Entertainment
AN  - 1929870302
AB  - Linguists have long been aware that the language scripted for "ethnic" roles in the media has been manipulated for a variety of purposes ranging from the construction of character "authenticity" to flagrant ridicule. This paper provides a brief overview of the history of African American roles in the entertainment industry from minstrel shows to present-day films. I am particularly interested in looking at the practice of distorting African American English as an historical artifact which is commonplace in the entertainment industry today. Dialogue which is clearly meant as an imitation of African American English still results in the construction of an ethnic stereotype that serves as a reflection of European American attitudes regarding African Americans. As a result, such depictions provide non-Black acculturated people with a perception of Blackness that is founded in inaccuracies and derision but has been portrayed as authentic, leaving Black life open to continual mimicry.

TT  - Odmevi odpora: druzbene skupine in mnozicno nasilje v Nigeriji
AN  - 1771763455
AB  - This article recognizes the gap in existing literature, regarding the capability of social groups in resistance to mass violence. The basic assumption of this article is that social groups as networks could serve as platforms of resistance to mass violence, regardless of their organizational goals and objectives. In order to explore this fundamental assumption, one research question was formulated: what is the utility of social groups in resisting mass violence? In a bid to provide an answer to this question, the article analyses the religious affiliation, geographical location and spread, ethnic stock and dynamics of selected social groups in Nigeria. The article is based on a review of academic articles, published newspaper reports and articles, and commonly used reports from the human rights circle. The article notes the linkage between social groups, on one hand, and prejudices, fears, and identities within societies, on the other. It recommends empowerment, which would allow social group members to find paths towards the solution to the problem of mass violence.

T1  - An Exploration of Racial Considerations in Partnered Fathers' Involvement in Bringing Up Their Mixed-/Multi-Race Children in Britain and New Zealand
AN  - 1727672340
AB  - This article considers how partnered fathers' involvement may be shaped by their understandings of the salience and impact of their children's racial belonging where fathers do not share the same race as their (biological) children. We draw on findings from a small-scale study of fathers with a partner from a different racial background living in Britain and New Zealand, to consider their involvement with their mixed or multi-racial children. Bringing up mixed/multi-race children can involve White fathers in thinking about issues that they would not necessarily otherwise have to consider. It could, for example, mean that they supported their children 's access to minority cultural knowledge and challenge racism. Equally, bringing up mixed/multi-race children can involve fathers from racial minorities in thinking about racial considerations in different ways. Notably they may transmit racial pride and cultured history to help their children deal with prejudice from the father's own minority ethnic group as well as racism from Whites.

T1  - Constraining and confining ethnic minorities: impoverishment and the logics of control in neoliberal Ireland
AN  - 1784144930
AB  - Neoliberalism and associated policies and practices of constraining and confining are adversely impacting on minority ethnic populations in the Republic of Ireland. In exploring these developments, it is vital to comprehend the specificity of Irish neoliberalism and to recognize evolving modes of impoverishment, containment and quasi-incarceration. In recent years, shifting patterns of migration have transformed the population, providing a significant contextual dimension to how minority groups are contained and managed. Garrett's tripartite, mostly descriptive, survey explores the current position of Irish Travellers, Roma and asylum-seekers.

T1  - Documenting Portrayals of Race/Ethnicity on Primetime Television over a 20-Year Span and Their Association with National-Level Racial/Ethnic Attitudes
AN  - 1662632613
AB  - The current study content analyzes the 345 most viewed U.S. television shows within 12 separate television seasons spanning the years 1987 to 2009. Using multilevel modeling, the results from this comprehensive content analysis then are used to predict national-level racial/ethnic perceptions (between the years 1988 and 2008) with data from the American National Election Studies (ANES). Content analysis results reveal severe underrepresentation of Latinos, Asian Americans, and Native Americans, and a tendency to depict ethnic minorities stereotypically (e.g., overrepresentation of hyper-sexualized Latino characters). Multilevel-modeling analysis indicates that both the quantity and quality of ethnic media representations contributes to Whites' racial attitudes.

T1  - Contact with immigrants in times of crisis: An exploration of the Catalan case
AN  - 1700674335; 201525297
AB  - Contact theory and threat group theory offer contradictory hypothesis regarding the effect of contact with immigrants. Does contact reduce or increases negative attitudes towards immigration? This article integrates both approaches and tests the effect of contact towards immigrants when different contexts are considered. We investigate the effect of the economic environment and the immigrant group size on modifying attitudes towards immigration in the context of Catalonia, which offers a complex environment where traditional hypotheses can be tested. Results show that close contact and family contact with immigrants reduce prejudices. However, mixed results are reported regarding the effect of the economic environment or the immigrant group size. Findings also show that Catalan identity is related to lower levels of negative attitudes towards immigrants, regardless of having experienced contact with foreigners. Results have implications on the impact of context when dealing with the impact of contact on attitudes towards immigration. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Homosexuality in Turkey: Strategies for Managing Heterosexism
AN  - 1551000577; 201428888
AB  - The goal of this study was to identify the strategies used by young homosexuals to manage their sexual minority status in Turkey. In-depth interviews were conducted with 15 self-identified homosexual university students. The data on the strategies employed by homosexuals suggested a categorization of these strategies into four interrelated areas: strategies employed in the process of self-acceptance; strategies to manage sexual stigma and prejudice; strategies specific to the coming-out process; and the strategies used while openly expressing their sexual identities.

T1  - 'Arab invasion' and decline, or the import of European racial thought by Iranian nationalists
AN  - 1559007176; 201432040
AB  - Historical research on western racial theories has grown exponentially in the past few years. A number of scholars have also investigated various cases of ethnic prejudice beyond the western pale, for instance against Koreans in Japan or Muslims in India. Yet, little attention has been given to the modalities in which European nineteenth-century racial thought was adopted in other parts of the world. This article attempts to broach a discussion on this under-analysed aspect of race studies by reviewing one case, that of Arab-hatred in modern Iran. I argue that the intense hatred of Arabs in Iranian nationalist texts derives from a racialized vision of Iranian history born in nineteenth-century European texts. Racialized historiography was selectively imported by the ideologues of Iranian nationalism as it allowed them to explain Iran's weakness in terms of a loss of racial purity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Help-Seeking Helps: Help-Seeking and Group Image
AN  - 1512220598; 201408611
AB  - Seeking help from an outgroup can be difficult, especially when the outgroup is known to stereotype the ingroup negatively and the potential recipient cares strongly about its social image. However, we ask whether even highly identified ingroup members may seek help from a judgmental outgroup if doing so allows them to disconfirm the outgroup's negative stereotype of the ingroup. We presented participants with one of two negative outgroup stereotypes of their ingroup. One could be disconfirmed through seeking help, the other could not. Study 1 (n = 43) showed group members were aware of the strategic implications of seeking help for disconfirming these stereotypes. Study 2 (n = 43) showed high identifiers acted on such strategic knowledge by seeking more help from the outgroup when help-seeking could disconfirm a negative stereotype of their group (than when it could not). Implications for the seeking and acceptance of help are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - The role of social values and psychosocial variables in Brazilian racial prejudice
AN  - 1728662195; 201534162
AB  - In the drive of comprehending the racial prejudice, social psychology has sought to identify factors that influence their presence or absence in societies. A factor to be explored is its relationship to social values. This article aims to analyze the relationship between social values, certain expressions of prejudice (blatant, symbolical) and political-ideological variables. Four hundred and twenty university students took part in this research. Classic measures were used to identify the mentioned expressions of prejudice: a questionnaire of psychosocial values, a scale of perceived distances and a scale of positive attitudes towards the first and the third worlds. It was identified that the accession to hedonistic and materialistic values, as well as the adoption of favorable attitudes towards developed countries, might predict prejudice against black people. On the other hand, the adherence to social justice values, and the closeness to black people are related with the non-expression of prejudice. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Introduction: Patterns of generational change: convergent, reactive or emergent?
AN  - 1531932418; 201423289
AB  - The aim of this special issue is to map the extent of generational change among Britain's ethnic minority population and to understand some of the underlying processes involved. Is there greater integration across generations, or has the 'new second generation' in Britain remained isolated from the mainstream, perhaps as a result of the prejudice and discrimination from the white British that they have encountered or because of desires to maintain ethnic values and resist western practices? We also ask whether processes of generational change have proceeded at the same pace and direction in different domains -- notably cultural, social, structural and political -- and whether it has proceeded at the same pace among different minorities.

T1  - Antisemitic obsessions: the case of H. W. Wicks
AN  - 1520331150; 201413112
AB  - Henry William Wicks is a very unusual case. A conspiracy theorist, whose efforts at litigation had led him to jail in 1936, he became convinced, under the influence of his fellow prisoner Arnold Leese, that the Jews were responsible for all his ills. In 1937-9 he spent much time moving in British antisemitic and pro-Nazi circles and, in early 1939, he took his family to Germany, publicly proclaiming in the newspapers that they were 'refugees from Jew-controlled England'. After the outbreak of war he wrote broadcasting scripts for the German government, was later interned, but in 1942 returned to working for a Nazi broadcasting station. Despite many lies and obfuscations as to his wartime role, he was sentenced in 1946 to four years' penal servitude. His case is interesting for a number of reasons. First, he stands as an example of how the ideologies of the time could affect people who were already vulnerable in various ways. This extreme example illustrates, however, the fact that most antisemites are, often less obviously, subject to similar obsessions and irrational hatreds. His case puts these issues under the magnifying glass, illustrating some of the constants in antisemitic behaviour. Finally, he is also one of the best examples of the syndrome whereby those who had been involved in such activities 'rewrote' history in the post-war period. In Wicks's case, his often convincing lies, found in his post-war writings and at his trial, are unfortunately for him found to be wanting when placed against the contemporary evidence of his letters from the period 1939-43, which were at the disposal of his accusers, and which can now be found in the released MI5 files. Where other renegades, such as Margaret Bothamley (who successfully convinced the courts that she was just a confused elderly lady) got away with it, Wicks failed miserably. This was yet another example of his pathetic lack of success in all his ventures. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'If you feel that nobody wants you you'll withdraw into your own': Gypsies/Travellers, networks and healthcare utilisation
AN  - 1767327985; 201609890
AB  - Gypsies and Travellers are the unhealthiest group in British society, suffering from higher levels of physical and mental illness, lower life expectancy and with low levels of healthcare utilisation. They also continue to experience the highest level of prejudice and discrimination in society. While studies indicate that social networks play an important role in shaping health beliefs and the response to symptoms, evidence on the influence of networks on health is unclear and contradictory. This article draws on social network theory and research into the relation between discrimination and health to critically examine how networks mediate between collective experiences of racism and health-related behavior. Qualitative interviews with 39 adult Gypsies and Travellers were conducted in the South-East of England to explore the wider structural and institutional context and the influence those contexts play in shaping health beliefs and decisions whether to access formal health services. The findings indicate that the influence networks play in shaping health behaviour is dependent on the particular social context of the group and its status in relation to wider social structures, making generalization problematic.

T1  - "There but for the grace of God go we": Prejudice toward asylum seekers
AN  - 1448996589; 201342910
AB  - Australia receives relatively few asylum seekers, but the public debate on this issue is intense and there is widespread prejudice toward them. The current research considers the role of two approaches in explaining prejudice toward asylum seekers: similarity priming and affective reactions of empathy. Participants (N = 119) were primed that asylum seekers were either "similar" to or "different" from them and were asked whether these similarities or differences were important. Dispositional empathy and asylum-seeker empathy were measured. Results showed that priming was associated with increased prejudice when priming involved similarity and those similarities were held to be important. Moreover, cognitive similarity priming and affective empathy contributed separately and additively to the prediction of prejudice. Qualitative responses to the priming question revealed that even when "difference" was primed, two of the three prevalent themes were positive. Results are discussed in relation to understanding the cognitive and affective bases of empathy and prejudice, and practical implications for activists working to reduce prejudice toward asylum seekers.

T1  - The changing face of newspaper representations of the mentally ill
AN  - 1463007825; 201347253
AB  - Background Negative stereotypes presented in the media may contribute to the stigma associated with mental illness. People's attitudes towards the mentally ill are initially influenced and subsequently maintained in part by the frequent media presentation of negative stereotypes of mental illness. This could result in social rejection of individuals with mental illnesses. Aim To explore how four main UK national newspapers reported on mental health/mental illness stories over a 10-year period. Method This study utilised content analysis to identify words, themes and trends of representation related to the mentally ill in articles from the four newspapers. Results The findings indicated that there was an increase in the number of articles related to mental health/illness over the time of the study. The rate of increase was far greater than that for the increase in the total number of articles carried in the press over this time period. It was also identified that pejorative terms were used, in a number of the articles, to describe the mentally ill person. Conclusion Many of the newspaper reports highlighted the need for protection of the general public from the mentally ill, and that the mentally ill were in some way different to the general public. In particular, both the words "violence" and "drugs" were linked to mental health/mental illness in these articles. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - An Intersectional Approach to Black/White Interracial Interactions: The Roles of Gender and Sexual Orientation
AN  - 1357005952
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Intersections of LGBT, Racial/Ethnic Minority, and Gender Identities              Although researchers have long advocated taking an intersectional approach in order to better understand how race, gender, and other social identities influence social experiences, this approach is only beginning to take hold in the interracial interaction literature. This paper describes the importance of considering gender (as well as other social identities, such as sexual orientation) in addition to race in the context of Black/White interracial interactions in the United States. The role of prior experience is discussed (i.e., encounters with prejudice at the intersection of race and gender, gender differences in the content of racial stereotypes, and the sometimes-conflicting messages of racial and gender socialization). The ways in which gender and racial identities interact with situational aspects of interracial interactions are also considered. Finally, the current representation of gender in the interracial interaction literature is reviewed, and recommendations for future research are provided, including techniques for recruiting racial minority participants.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Tiger Moms and Liberal Elephants: Private, Supplemental Education among Korean-Americans
AN  - 1438561006; 201340296
AB  - This article discusses the transnational industry of private, supplemental education (PSE) among ethnic Koreans, especially in Southern California. PSE offers a unique vantage point to examine the educational struggles and values of students, parents and teachers. A "Tiger Mom" educational culture reflects the extreme competition for elite, educational credentials, which can foster academic cheating and racial prejudices among Korean-Americans. In response, a growing number of educators, parents and students espouse more traditional, liberal-humanistic values of developing individual interests and talents and of mutual respect among diverse persons. This "Liberal Elephant" culture receives significant support from some members of actively proselytizing, Christian churches. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - A key argument of Dixon et al. in the target article is that prejudice reduction through intergroup contact and collective action work in opposite ways. We argue for a complementary approach focusing on extreme emotions to understand why people turn to non-normative collective action and to understand when and under what conditions extreme emotions may influence positive effects of contact on reconciliation.

T1  - Negative Stereotyping of Older Nurses Despite Contact and Mere Exposure: The Case of Nursing Recruiters in Western Australia
AN  - 1567049040; 201437128
AB  - Ageist attitudes have been identified across different industries. The nursing profession has a high proportion of older workers. As this facilitates regular contact with, as well as exposure to, older nurses, it may be expected to show less ageism. This study investigated 163 Western Australian nursing recruiters' attitudes toward older nurses. Results showed clear evidence of both negative and positive stereotyping of older nurses. Nursing recruiters indicated that they would be more than likely to hire older nurses and that age was less relevant in making hiring decisions. These findings suggest that enhancing the employability of older workers does not necessarily change ageist attitudes. This is relevant to policy formulation, attitude change interventions, and the well-being of older workers. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - How Race and Class Stereotyping Shapes Attitudes Toward Affordable Housing
AN  - 1221409196; 201244172
AB  - The development of affordable housing often involves a contentious siting process. Proposed housing developments frequently trigger concern among neighbors and community groups about potential negative impacts on neighborhood quality of life and property values. Advocates, developers, and researchers have long suspected that these concerns stem in part from racial or class prejudice. Yet, to date, empirical evidence supporting these assumptions is lacking. This study seeks to examine roles that perceptions of race and class play in shaping opinions that underlie public opposition to affordable housing. This study applies a public opinion survey to determine the extent to which stereotypes and perceptions of the poor and minorities relate to attitudes toward affordable housing. The results demonstrate that such perceptions are particularly strong determinants of negative attitudes about affordable housing. These findings provide advocates, planners, developers, and researchers with a more accurate portrayal of affordable housing opposition, thereby allowing the response to be shaped in a more appropriate manner.

T1  - Foreign Wars and Domestic Prejudice: How Media Exposure to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Predicts Ethnic Stereotyping by Jewish and Arab American Adolescents
AN  - 1283637696; 201305725
AB  - This study was based on the theory that adolescents view scenes of violent ethnic conflicts in the mass media through the lens of their own ethnicity, and that the resulting social-cognitive reactions influence their negative stereotypes about similar ethnic groups in their own country. We interviewed 89 Jewish and 180 Arab American high school students about their exposure to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, their social cognitive reactions to it, and their stereotypes toward ethnic groups. Beyond the effects of ethnic identity, the degree to which adolescents identified with Israelis and Palestinians in the media was a key variable linking exposure to media depictions of the conflict and the implicit ethnic stereotypes they displayed about Jewish Americans and Arab Americans.

T1  - Women and warfare at the start of the twentieth century: the racialization of the 'enemy' during the South African War (1899-1902)
AN  - 1283644051; 201303298
AB  - The internment of Boer civilians in concentration camps by the British military authorities during the South African War of 1899-1902 was a highly controversial policy, not least because around 26,000 women and children were estimated to have died as a result of epidemics in the camps. Both supporters and opponents of the camps addressed the policy using gendered language rooted in ideas about British standards of 'civilization'. Apologists defined the camps as one of the protective measures of the chivalrous British authorities, and downplayed the significance of the mortality rates by blaming infant deaths on the maternal shortcomings of Boer women. Opponents, however, stressed similarities between the British and Boer peoples, and invoked gendered language to attack what were held to be barbaric policies towards defenceless members of the community. At the heart of both discourses was a belief in British aspirations to embody an ideal 'civilization', underpinned by traditional gender ideologies. The association of this concept of 'civilization' with not merely cultural but racial difference led to the development of a racialized image of the enemy, rooted perhaps more strongly in perceptions of the female Boer civilian than of the male soldier.

T1  - DISCOURSES ON ANTISEMITISM AND ISLAMOPHOBIA IN ARAB MEDIA
AN  - 1551002041; 201429144
AB  - This paper discusses the relationship between antisemitism and Islamophobia, focusing on debates in Arab newspapers in the wake of the Second Intifada and 9/11 and then in response to two issues of contention for Muslim communities in Europe, the Danish cartoon crisis in 2006 and the Swiss referendum on building minarets in 2009. The paper relates these debates to major UN and EU resolutions for combating racism, Islamophobia and antisemitism. The aim of this paper is to explore how far discussion of antisemitism and Islamophobia in the Arab world is dominated by those who see Islamophobia as the real danger in today's Europe and antisemitism as a Zionist ploy, and how far antisemitism and Islamophobia have become two competing terms relating to two communities that perceive themselves as victims of prejudice and racism and also of each other. The paper seeks to qualify this image. It acknowledges that the entanglement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict adds a political aspect to the discussion of the two terms, intensifies competition between them for recognition as unique forms of racism and discrimination, and curtails the creation of positive ground for dialogue. However, it also demonstrates the presence of other voices which are more open to addressing both forms of exclusion. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Secrets in Romantic Relationships: Does Sexual Orientation Matter?
AN  - 1551001696; 201428945
AB  - Analysis of data from a 50-item survey on 'Secrets in Romantic Relationships' completed by 431 respondents (primarily attending a large southeastern university) revealed that more than 60% reported ever having kept a personal secret in a romantic relationship and one-fourth were currently doing so. Findings included that homosexuals were more willing to keep significantly (p <.01) more secrets than heterosexuals. The suggested explanation is that homosexuals live in a heterosexist context, which encourages regular deception by hiding their sexual orientation to avoid prejudice and discrimination (the phrase 'in the closet' means 'keeping a secret'). Homosexuals may keep a secret from a romantic partner more often because they have a pattern of keeping secrets. Other significant findings included that females, spouses, and blacks kept more secrets than males, dating partners, and whites. Implications and limitations are suggested.

T1  - Determinants of Perceived Immigrant Job Threat in the American States
AN  - 1373428727; 201328763
AB  - In the United States, the 2000s were marked by record numbers of immigrants and heightened levels of pro- and anti-immigrant agitation. As a result, research investigating anti-immigrant prejudice in the United States and other societies has surged. In this article, the authors investigate the determinants of perceived immigrant job threat in the fifty U.S. states in 2005. They draw upon three theoretical perspectives that dominate the study of prejudice -- group threat theory, contact theory, and cultural theory -- but move beyond these established theories to adduce three new perspectives, which they label economic competition, labor market deregulation, and globalization. The authors find support for all six perspectives. The three new perspectives augment, rather than supplant, the traditional theories. The authors find that levels of perceived immigrant job threat tend to increase in settings where there is economic stagnation, where labor unions are growing weaker, where the minimum wage is low, and where corporate restructuring has taken place.

T1  - Marijuana Prohibition In California: Racial Prejudice And Selective-Arrests
AN  - 1347781247; 201318955
AB  - In 1913, California outlawed marijuana on the basis of express racial animus. The federal government prohibited marijuana in 1937 on a similar basis. We hypothesize that the racism behind marijuana prohibition influences current arrests. An analysis of data from 2000-2008 in California connects the racialized origins of marijuana prohibition to current marijuana arrests. Blacks and Hispanics are significantly more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana offense. We conclude that marijuana prohibition is too entangled with racism to be fairly enforced today. Evaluating selective-arrests, we show evidence of institutional racism regarding marijuana prohibition in California. We argue that a medical marijuana framework should replace prohibition, returning to the policy that existed prior the beginning of prohibition. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Discrimination, policies, and sexual rights in Brazil
AN  - 1125217560; 201240372
AB  - This article focuses on a politics arena that has been articulated through the impact of ideals of sexual rights on Brazilian sexual politics, namely the affirmation of "LGBT rights". These rights have been constructed both through attempts to extend civil and social rights to the LGBT population that were previously restricted to heterosexuals, and by the enactment of provisions directly banning homophobic discrimination and violence. The focus will be on some of the principal social actors in this process, especially those situated in the three branches of government, since the most decisive clashes are now being waged at this level. Without intending to offer an exhaustive description of what has occurred in the Brazilian courts, Congress, and Administration, we point to the complexity of a situation which shows numerous innovations and breaks in its different dimensions, while simultaneously revealing contradictions, gaps, and ambiguities.

T1  - How (not) to resurrect the body politic: the racist bias in Carl Schmitt's theory of sovereignty
AN  - 1531932712; 201423332
AB  - Carl Schmitt's 1927/1932 definition of the political domain as one based on the distinction between 'friend' and 'foe' (Freund v. Feind) has exercised political scientists, philosophers and historians to this day, not least on account of Schmitt's role before and during the Third Reich and his alleged influence on post-war German and West European political thought. In his 1938 book The Leviathan in the State Theory of Thomas Hobbes, which built on Hobbes's version of the ancient body politic concept, Schmitt tried to underpin this distinction with a depiction of the 'political physiology' of the state. However, as his subtitle Meaning and Failure of a Political Symbol indicated, he was forced to admit that such a notion-and thus also its theoretical or practical 'resurrection' in the twentieth century-was not feasible. Musolff argues that Schmitt's friend-foe distinction, his emphatic notion of national sovereignty and his pronounced antisemitism are integral parts of a thought-system steeped in body imagery. However, rather than providing a basis for a new 'concept of the political', the state-body metaphor reveals the blind spot of Schmitt's vision of the sovereign nation state, which made it vulnerable to totalitarian interpretations.

T1  - Images of the Self and the Other in Paul Rohrbach's 'German Idea'
AN  - 1531932495; 201423353
AB  - Rash presents the results of a close linguistic analysis of the 1912 monograph Der deutsche Gedanke in der Welt (The German Idea in the World) by the German political journalist and economist Paul Rohrbach (1869-1956). Rohrbach's monograph is a 250-page tract expressing nationalist and expansionist sentiments. It compares the British, as experienced players on the world stage, with the Germans, who were, in 1912, still hoping to join Britain (or 'England' as Rohrbach usually had it) as a Weltvolk, a 'world people' or 'world power', with equal rights and responsibilities. Rash adopts the methods of corpus-assisted discourse studies (CADS) devised for qualitative analysis by Paul Baker and his colleagues. Adapted from the source document.

Attempts have been made to encourage religious mixing through integration in schools, housing, and workplaces predicated on the theory that bringing people together can improve community relations and remove prejudices -- known as the 'contact hypothesis'. However, little is known about those who enter into mixed-religion partnerships often against the wishes of their families and communities. This paper examines the characteristics and attitudes of mixed-religion couples and suggests that they differ in their socio-demographic characteristics and in their attitudes from those who marry within their own religion. These findings add to the weight of evidence from other countries in conflict suggesting that intermarriage has a role to play in contributing to less sectarian views and improved community relations.

T1  - Opposing Islamification or promoting Islamophobia? Understanding the English Defence League
AN  - 964197837; 201207380
AB  - The emergence and growth of the English Defence League (EDL) in the past two years as a socio-political mass movement are unprecedented in the British setting. Initially dismissed and duly condemned as a racist and Islamophobic far-right organization, little is known about the EDL. Allen's article begins by tracing the development of British far-right political groups that were trail-blazers in campaigning against the alleged threat posed by Muslims and Islam since 2001. The rise -- and subsequent fall -- of the British National Party is considered as a vehicle for understanding the climate in which hostility to Muslims has become increasingly apparent. It is in this context that the messages and discourse of the EDL are explored, as well as in regard to the organization's roots in the English football hooligan fraternity and specific events in Luton in the spring of 2009. Allen looks at the EDL's innovative use of social networking -- in particular its use of Facebook -- to support its street marches and protests, as well as its recognition of the economic impact it has had, given the costs associated with policing its marches and protests. Having established how the EDL is supported both actively and passively, not least through a somewhat unique coalition that brings together sometimes disparate groups on the basis of "the enemy of my own enemy is my friend" -- including groups that have historically been discriminated against by the far right -- Allen considers the the arguments for recognizing the EDL as a multicultural movement. He concludes that the messages of the EDL are indeed Islamophobic -- understanding Islamophobia as an ideological phenomenon -- in that they create a form of order that clearly demarcates Islam as the Other.

T1  - The Benefits of Sexual Orientation Diversity in Sport Organizations
AN  - 902085271; 201122231
AB  - While sexual orientation diversity can potentially serve as a source of competitive advantage, researchers have largely failed to fully articulate the theoretical linkage between this diversity form and organizational effectiveness. As such, we propose a theoretical framework to understand these dynamics. Sexual orientation diversity is posited to positively contribute to organizational effectiveness through three mechanisms: enhanced decision making capabilities, improved marketplace understanding, and goodwill associated with engaging in socially responsible practices. We also propose two approaches to leveraging the benefits of sexual orientation diversity: targeting the categorization process and creating a proactive and inclusive diversity culture. Contributions and implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Implicit Prejudicial Biases in Student Learning: The Effects of Sexual Orientation
AN  - 902084375; 201122295
AB  - In an investigation of students' potential biases toward gay and lesbian instructors, 93 female and 59 male undergraduates viewed a lecture, rated the instructor and perceived learning, and completed a lecture-retention test. Lectures were given by a man or woman, identified as straight or gay or lesbian. Sexual orientation did not affect the instructor evaluation or perceived learning ratings for any of the groups. Although sexual orientation did not affect the lecture-retention scores for the female students, learning by the male students was significantly lower with the gay male instructor than with the straight male instructor (p = .03), suggesting an implicit bias.

T1  - On the Meaning, Measurement, and Implications of Racial Resentment
AN  - 862595901; 201109602
AB  - A new racism, it is claimed, has become a dominant feature of contemporary American politics. According to the theory's originators, the new racism has largely replaced the old racism, which was based on the alleged biological inferiority of blacks. The new racism, referred to as "symbolic racism" or more recently, "racial resentment," by contrast, is defined as a conjunction of anti-black feelings and American moral traditionalism. According to its proponents, this new racism now structures and dominates the racial thinking of whites generally. Howard Schuman has suggested, however, that the index used to measure racial resentment may be fundamentally flawed because it may be conflated with the measurement of attitudes toward racial policies. The authors' analysis supports Schuman's suggestion. They conclude that racial resentment is not a valid measure of racism, which raises questions about the extent to which a new racism now dominates the thinking of white Americans.

T1  - 'A curious relationship': Barack Obama, the 1960s and the election of 2008
AN  - 902082796; 201122339
AB  - Ward explores the diverse ways in which memories, understandings and misunderstandings of the 1960s were mobilized during the 2008 election cycle. At the time, Barack Obama's campaign and triumph were hailed by many as marking a series of a decisive breaks with the past, notably with the culture wars and fiercely ideological political partisanship unleashed in the late 1960s. Others suggested that Obama represented a new kind of candidate who somehow transcended, or might even heal, the racial divisions in the United States, in a fanciful vogue for 'post-racialism' that Ward argues was also connected to popular conceptions of the 1960s and, in particular, to a misreading of the social philosophy of Martin Luther King, Jr and his 'I Have a Dream' speech. While some commentators stressed rupture and discontinuity with the past in interpreting Obama's victory, others--friend and foe alike--were keen to stress continuities with the past, often explicitly with a 1960s routinely, if simplistically, parsed into 'good' early and 'bad' later periods. Thus Ward considers Obama's connections to the civil rights and black power movements, as well as to other 1960s organizing traditions, charismatic leaders and conceptions of federal government, arguing that the decade continues to offer an important, if ambiguous touchstone in contemporary American politics and social memory.

T1  - Beyond the 'Auschwitz syndrome': Holocaust historiography after the Cold War
AN  - 835111684; 201100560
AB  - The end of the Cold war has seen an explosion in Holocaust history, and some significant changes in the main historiographical explanations. The 'return of ideology' that began displacing the 'functionalist' or 'structuralist' dominance of the 1980s remains strong. But it is being supplemented by very detailed regional and local studies, by analyses of different experiences of ghettoization in different places, and by a focus on the widespread plunder and corruption that accompanied the killing process. This enormous attention to detail reveals that the Holocaust unfolded differently in different places; but it also demonstrates the existence of an overall framework in which all the operations took place, what we might call an 'antisemitic consensus'. Simultaneously, historians have broadened the discussion of the Holocaust, situating it into a transnational or world-historical context of imperialism and colonialism. Stone outlines in broad brush some of these themes, and asks what effects they have had and will continue to have on Europeans' self-understanding in an age in which the post-war anti-fascist consensus has been dismantled while Holocaust-consciousness is officially enshrined into European identity.

T1  - Addressing contradictory needs: the Lega Nord and Italian immigration policy
AN  - 835111451; 201100457
AB  - Cento Bull addresses the question of whether the Italian Lega Nord, when in government, pursues policies that contradict its rhetoric (politics of simulation or symbolic politics) or policies that are in line with its dominant discourse (politics of identity). Her analysis focuses on immigration policy because this is an area that links together economic issues (immigration is highly functional to the economy of those regions of Italy that form the Lega's strongholds) and identity issues (immigration is seen as visibly threatening cultural values and disrupting community cohesion). She argues that recent legislation in this area, approved in July 2009, is formally in line with Lega rhetoric but also that actual policy outcomes contradict both the party's rhetoric and the legislation itself. This confirms the validity of the concept of 'simulative politics' in so far as it refers to a societal practice of self-deception, rather than simply to practices of deception on the part of political actors.

AB  - This article discusses the often forgotten contributions of black African infantry to the French and British war efforts from Europe to Asia during the Second World War. It traces the relationship between black African soldiers and their imperial rulers as it evolved over the course of two global conflicts from 1914 to 1945. The article points out how racist preconceptions about the 'inferior' abilities and intelligence of Africans paralleled white Americans' prejudices against African-Americans and how the British and French attempted to systematically omit, diminish, or discredit the achievements of African soldiers.

T1  - From Posttrauma Intervention to Immunization of the Social Body: Pragmatics and Politics of a Resilience Program in Israel's Periphery
AN  - 744010830; 20563631
AB  - This article traces a critical change in the professional therapy of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD): from treatment of a disorder borne by individuals to treatment of an anticipated disorder to be prevented by fortifying the entire population. A community resilience program in the city of Sderot in southern Israel, which has been subjected to Qassam rockets by its Palestinian neighbors across the border, serves as our case study. Drawing on an ethnographic study of this new therapeutic program, we analyze how the social body that the professionals attempt to immunize against trauma was treated. In particular, we follow the various practices used to expand the clinical. We found that the population was split into several groups on a continuum between the clinical and the preclinical, each receiving different treatment. Moreover, the social body managed according to this new form of PTSD was articulated through ethnic and geopolitical power relations between professionals from the country's center and professionals from its periphery, and between the professionals and the city's residents. Finally, we discuss how this Israeli case compares with other national sites of the growing globalization of PTSD, like Bali, Haiti and Ethiopia, which anthropologists have been exploring in recent years.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - New Panthers, old Panthers and the politics of black nationalism in the United States
AN  - 754038494; 201049763
AB  - The New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense has been a cause du scandale since it was formed in the early 1990s. Indeed, the Anti-Defamation League has described it as 'the largest organized anti-Semitic and racist black militant group in America'. It is somewhat surprising, then, that there has been very little detailed analysis of the party and its activities. Mulloy begins to fill this gap by outlining the origins and development of the party, and by closely examining the ongoing dispute between the New Black Panthers and surviving members of the original Black Panther Party--established by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale in Oakland, California in 1966--over the right to claim the name, the history and the legacy of the Panthers in the United States. Critically assessing the strategies and actions of the New Black Panthers, Mulloy argues that its high-profile, media-centred approach to political activism has largely been a failure with regard to its overall aim of reviving the Black Power movement in the United States.

T1  - Understanding East Indians' Attitudes Toward African Americans: Do Mainstream Prejudicial Attitudes Transfer to Immigrants?
AN  - 2076972744
AB  - Previous research-especially in the United States-has largely utilised a Black/White focus in studying intergroup attitudes, and has not sufficiently dealt with how racial/ethnic minority groups (including newer immigrants) view one another. To address this dearth in the literature, the present study investigates predictors of intergroup attitudes of one minority group (East Indian immigrants and Indian Americans) toward another (African Americans). We assessed 144 East Indian students' ethnic identification, worldviews, contact with and attitudes toward African Americans. Results indicate that Indian immigrants held more negative attitudes towards African Americans than Indian Americans. Ethnic identity, beliefs about social hierarchy, contact with African Americans and immigrant status had direct and indirect associations with attitudes toward African Americans. The results suggest the need for further study of intergroup attitudes among ethnic minority groups.

T1  - Understanding Bias toward Latinos: Discrimination, Dimensions of Difference, and Experience of Exclusion
AN  - 60362625; 201017449
AB  - White-Black relations have historically been the defining form of intergroup relations in the study of prejudice and discrimination. The present article suggests that there are limitations to applying this model to understanding bias toward other groups and proposes that a comprehensive view of the dynamics of the Anglos' bias toward Latinos requires consideration of the distinctive elements of this form of intergroup relations. In four empirical studies, we experimentally document discrimination against Latinos (Study 1), explore the potential dimensions that underlie bias against Latinos (Study 2), and examine the effect of a particular social identity cue, accentedness, on perceptions of acceptance and belongingness of Latinos and members of other groups (Studies 3 and 4). These studies consider general processes of prejudice and identify how particular facets of bias against Latinos can shape their experiences and, taken together, illustrate how understanding bias against Latinos can reciprocally inform contemporary theories of prejudice.

T1  - Reclaiming nonracialism: reading The Threat of Race from South Africa
AN  - 743067141; 201043256
AB  - Gillespie challenges David Theo Goldberg's critique of the project of nonracialism (antiracialism) in The Threat of Race. Goldberg's critique understands nonracialism to forbid the racial terms that would allow for racism to be named and dismantled, and thus sees nonracialism as a variation on white privilege. She tests the book's most general claim by looking carefully at how this claim is substantiated in the chapter on South Africa. She argues that Goldberg's critique of nonracialism relies on a historiography of South Africa that excludes radical traditions of anti-apartheid nonracialism that would complicate the ease with which nonracialism might be seen as an ally to racism. The history of the Unity Movement is drawn on to illustrate a radical organization in the anti-apartheid tradition that explicitly advocated the principle of nonracialism. Gillespie looks at the Unity Movement as an example of radical experimentation with nonracialism as a way of dismantling race-class oppression under white supremacy. She advocates nonracialism as a practice that attempts to contend with oppression in the present while at the same time employing future-oriented principles that prevent the terms of anti-oppression from becoming mired in a dangerous redeployment of the categories of race.

T1  - Capitalizing on Multiple Social Identities to Prevent Stereotype Threat: The Moderating Role of Self-Esteem
AN  - 1928308573
AB  - One troubling aspect of membership in a stigmatized group is that negative stereotypes about the group's performance affect one's personal performance (i.e., stereotype threat). Women who are made aware of the negative stereotype that "women are bad at math" perform worse than women who are not made aware of this stereotype. However, women can use an "escape hatch" to avoid stereotype threat by identifying with another social identity (i.e., college students) that has positive stereotypes for math performance and having greater feelings of self-worth. This research shows that women who had greater self-esteem and were presented with an alternative, positive social identity were buffered from stereotype threat by eliminating working memory decrements responsible for poor math performance. Women lower in self-esteem, however, did not benefit from a positive, alternative social identity when it was available and thus fell prey to stereotype-based working memory and performance decrements.
