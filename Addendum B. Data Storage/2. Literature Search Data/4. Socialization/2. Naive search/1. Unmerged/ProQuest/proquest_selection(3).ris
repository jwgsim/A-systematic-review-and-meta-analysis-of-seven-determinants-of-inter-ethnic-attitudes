T1  - Value Orientations and Social Differences in the Attitudes Toward Voluntary Childlessness Among Young Adults in Bulgaria
AN  - 2696900168
AB  - The aim of the study is to explore the dynamics of social-demographic differences between young adults in Bulgaria who have negative attitudes, remain neutral toward or accept voluntary childlessness. The analysis is based on data from the European Social Survey (Bulgarian dataset) conducted in 2006 and 2018. A descriptive trend analysis is applied to reveal the dynamics of the attitudes toward male or female voluntary childlessness among different socio-demographic groups. The analysis reveals an increasing trend of neutrality and a slight increase in the affirmative attitudes toward VC among different socio-demographic groups. Applied correlation analysis shows a significant association between the attitudes toward voluntary childlessness, non-marital unions and parenthood in such unions, divorce of parents with small children and mothers' early return to work. The present study also outlines the differences in the general value orientations of the individuals who reject, remain neutral or accept voluntary childlessness. Young adults with neutral or affirmative attitudes support to a lesser degree the traditional norms related to modesty, obedience, and respect for the traditional authorities, and strongly emphasize freedom of self-expression, independence, joy and excitement in life, and trust in others.

T1  - A social virus: Intergroup dehumanization and unwillingness to aid amidst COVID-19 − Who are the main targets?
AN  - 2667854074
AB  - Previous studies have shown that external threats, such as financial crises and natural disasters, might fuel negative attitudes, emotions, and behaviors towards outgroup members. However, it is unclear what types of outgroups are likely to be targeted when an external threat is taking its toll. In this study, we examine two types of outgroups that might be at risk of becoming victims of intergroup hostility. The first is the "ultimate scapegoat" outgroup which has a long history of negative relations with the ingroup. The second is the "context-dependent" outgroup which is viewed as an outgroup only in certain contexts. We utilized the COVID-19 crisis and the highly diverse social makeup of Israeli society to explore the extent to which each type of outgroup would be targeted. Results from our study (N = 664), conducted during the first peak of COVID-19 in Israel, show that higher levels of exposure to COVID-19 predicted lower willingness to aid outgroups and that outgroup dehumanization mediated this association. However, this held true only when the target outgroup was a context-dependent outgroup. When the target group was the ultimate scapegoat, exposure to COVID-19 did not predict ingroup willingness to aid them. Our findings contribute to our theoretical and practical knowledge on how intergroup hostility proliferates during external threats and, as such, are valuable to scholars, practitioners, and policymakers working to reduce intergroup tensions during large-scale crises.

T1  - Development of a Scale of Prejudice toward Bisexual and Transgender Individuals on the Basis of Ambiguity Intolerance
AN  - 2662236777
AB  - Prejudice toward bisexual and transgender individuals is motivated in part by unique (yet similar) negative stereotypes and cognitive rigidity (Huffaker & Kwon, 2016). The current research aimed to create a scale to measure bisexual and transgender prejudice on the basis of two aspects of cognitive rigidity—ambiguity intolerance and essentialist beliefs. In Study 1, scale items were generated from open-ended responses. Study two quantitively tested these items with exploratory factor analyses. In Study 3, we cross-validated our new scale with existing scales of bisexual and transgender prejudice. In Study 4, we cross-validated our scale with a measure of intolerance of ambiguity and a measure of essentialist beliefs. Future research will benefit by developing prejudice reduction strategies that specifically target those who have higher ambiguity intolerance and essentialist beliefs about bisexual and transgender individuals.

T1  - The impact of white space on consumers' perception of and attitude toward advertising
AN  - 2630535811
AB  - This study explored the impact of white space in advertisements on consumers' perception of and attitude toward the advertisement. Participants (N = 333) took part in two studies online. The results show that more (vs. less) white space increased independent self-construal consumers' positive attitudes toward the advertisement by increasing the relative effect of freedom on advertisement attitudes (Study 1). Moreover, print advertisements with more (vs. less) white space increased interdependent self-construal consumers' negative attitudes toward the advertisement by increasing the relative effect of loneliness on advertisement attitudes (Study 2). The findings contribute to the literature on symbolic associations by demonstrating the multiple effects of white space in visual design. Effective visual design can meet consumers' needs and enhance their preference for an advertisement.

T1  - Social dominance orientation in children: The validation of the long and short version of the child SDO<sub>6</sub> scale
AN  - 2628402040
AB  - We aimed to validate a long and a short version of the popular SDO6 scale for children, by testing their reliability and factorial structure, as well as divergent and criterion validity. Italian fourth- and fifth-graders (N = 271; 49.45% female) were administered the Child SDO6 scale, composed of 16 items, along with a series of personality and intergroup relations measures (using foreigners as the minority group). Paralleling results obtained with adults, findings concerning the short version provided evidence for a two-factorial structure, consisting of an SDO-Dominance and an SDO-Anti-egalitarianism dimension. Both for the long and the short version, greater levels of SDO-Dominance and SDO-Anti-egalitarianism were associated with more neuroticism, attitudinal and stereotypic bias, and with less agreeableness, openness to experience, dispositional and intergroup empathy. In conclusions, the two SDO dimensions as assessed by the short Child SDO6 Scale may be relevant variables to consider when testing intergroup relations processes among children.

T1  - Race, Gender, and the U.S. Presidency: A Comparison of Implicit and Explicit Biases in the Electorate
AN  - 2621271238
AB  - Recent U.S. elections have witnessed the Democrats nominating both black and female presidential candidates, as well as a black and female vice president. The increasing diversity of the U.S. political elite heightens the importance of understanding the psychological factors influencing voter support for, or opposition to, candidates of different races and genders. In this study, we investigated the relative strength of the implicit biases for and against hypothetical presidential candidates that varied by gender and race, using an evaluative priming paradigm on a broadly representative sample of U.S. citizens (n = 1076). Our main research question is: Do measures of implicit racial and gender biases predict political attitudes and voting better than measures of explicit prejudice? We find that measures of implicit bias are less strongly associated with political attitudes and voting than are explicit measures of sexist attitudes and modern racism. Moreover, once demographic characteristics and explicit prejudice are controlled statistically, measures of implicit bias provide little incremental predictive validity. Overall, explicit prejudice has a far stronger association with political preferences than does implicit bias.

T1  - How identity influences public attitudes towards the US federal government: lessons from the European Union
AN  - 2616790208
AB  - This study examines why Americans have positive or negative affect towards the US federal government. Specifically, it draws on existing theoretical and empirical research regarding individual attitudes towards the European Union, examining the effect of ethnocentrism on American attitudes towards the federal government. Relying on this existing research regarding the EU, it is hypothesized that those who are more ethnocentric will be more negative towards the US federal government. To test this expectation, we use longitudinal data from the American National Election Study from 1992 to 2012. We find those who are more ethnocentric are significantly more likely to possess negative attitudes towards the federal government. These findings have important implications for policymaking at both the federal and state levels, as well as party positioning both at the time of and between American elections, and the overall stability of multilevel governance in the United States. Additionally, the findings of this study indicate that theories designed to explain phenomena in the European Union are applicable to the US case.

T1  - Islam and Muslims in “non-religious” Japan: caught in between prejudice against Islam and performative tolerance
AN  - 2608426066
AB  - This paper examines how Islam in Japan tends to be tolerated as (foreign) “culture,” especially within the framework of tabunka kyōsei, multicultural coexistence, and cosmetic multiculturalism to circumvent religious apathy, phobia of religion, and prejudice against Islam. In doing so, this paper will: first provide a history of Muslim–Japanese relations and Muslim communities in Japan as well as an overview of the total estimate of the Muslim population in Japan as of 2018; historicize and denaturalize religious apathy, phobia of religion, and prejudice against Islam among the general Japanese public; analyze the rhetoric of tabunka kyōsei and its relation to cosmetic multiculturalism as well as its problematics; investigate the cases of local oppositions to the building projects of mosques and my observations made at events organized by Muslim groups; and conclude with a critical remark on the cosmetic multiculturalist understanding of “Islamic culture” and its approach to tabunka kyōsei.

T1  - Unobtrusive measures of prejudice: Estimating percentages of public beliefs and behaviours
AN  - 2612711883
AB  - This study was concerned with how accurate people are in their knowledge of population norms and statistics concerning such things as the economic, health and religious status of a nation and how those estimates are related to their own demography (e.g age, sex), ideology (political and religious beliefs) and intelligence. Just over 600 adults were asked to make 25 population estimates for Great Britain, including religious (church/mosque attendance) and economic (income, state benefits, car/house ownership) factors as well as estimates like the number of gay people, immigrants, smokers etc. They were reasonably accurate for things like car ownership, criminal record, vegetarianism and voting but seriously overestimated numbers related to minorities such as the prevalence of gay people, muslims and people not born in the UK. Conversely there was a significant underestimation of people receiving state benefits, having a criminal record or a private health insurance. Correlations between select variables and magnitude and absolute accuracy showed religiousness and IQ most significant correlates. Religious people were less, and intelligent people more, accurate in their estimates. A factor analysis of the estimates revealed five interpretable factors. Regressions were calculated onto these factors and showed how these individual differences accounted for as much as 14% of the variance. Implications and limitations are acknowledged.

T1  - Low acceptance of intimate partner violence by pregnant women in Uganda predicts higher uptake of HIV self-testing among their male partners
AN  - 2609871793
AB  - Introduction: Heterosexual couples are at high risk for HIV acquisition in sub-Saharan Africa, and HIV self-testing (HST) is an additional approach to expand access to HIV testing services. However, it is not well known how gender equality is associated with HST.Methods: We used intervention-arm data from a cluster-randomised controlled HST intervention trial (N = 1 618) conducted in Uganda to determine the association between attitudes towards intimate partner violence (IPV), decision-making power and male partner’s uptake of HST among heterosexual couples expecting a child in south-central Uganda. The original study question was to assess the impact of providing pregnant women with HST kits to improve male partner’s HIV testing rates. For this analysis, the primary exposures were gender equality (measured by male partner’s and female partner’s attitudes towards IPV and the female partner’s household decision-making power), and the primary outcome was the male partner’s uptake of HST. Multivariate logistic regression was used for analysis.Results: We found that male partner HST uptake did not vary depending on male partner’s attitudes towards IPV or decision-making power; however, male partner HST uptake did depend on the female partner’s attitude towards IPV, with 1.76 times more testing (95% CI 1.06–2.92) in couples where the woman had “medium” versus “high” acceptance of IPV, and 1.82 times more testing (95% CI 1.08–3.08) in couples where the woman had “low” versus “high” acceptance of IPV.Conclusions: This study shows the importance of appropriate negative attitudes by women to IPV in increasing male partner’s HST uptake to integrate HST into national health care policies.

T1  - Assessing the evidence of perspective taking on stereotyping and negative evaluations: A <i>p</i>-curve analysis: GPIR
AN  - 2609042211
AB  - Perspective taking is conceptualized as the ability to consider or adopt the perspective of another individual who is perceived to be in need; it has shown mixed results in stereotype reduction and intergroup attitude change across many social science disciplines. The inconsistent results raise concerns about the robustness of the perspective-taking phenomenon. The present study uses p-curve analysis to examine whether evidential value existed among two sets of published experimental studies where perspective taking was operationalized in two different paradigms. Despite low statistical power, we found that both sets of studies revealed some evidential value of the effects of perspective taking. The theoretical and methodological implications of perspective-taking studies are discussed as well.

T1  - Social Support in the Transition to Parenthood Among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Persons: A Systematic Review
AN  - 2608260780
AB  - Parenting is a challenging life-cycle transition, particularly for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) persons who have to deal with prejudice and discrimination. Considering this position of social disadvantage and the potential protective role of social support, our aim in this work was to systematize existing knowledge about the role of social support (i.e., social support, family support, community support, LGBT support, support, and engagement) in the transition to parenthood among LGB persons. Through a systematic review process conducted in May 2019 using PRISMA guidelines, the present study identified 22 manuscripts which accomplished all inclusion criteria. Our results suggested closer relationships to the family of origin and a detachment from the LGBT community in this stage of life cycle. Furthermore, the social support received in the transition to parenthood seems to influence not only the psychological well-being of these parents and prospective parents but also the quality of their relationships with different support networks. Thus, we understand that inclusive clinical and human professional interventions aimed at improving the available social support networks of LGB persons and, consequently, enhance their psychosocial well-being and family relations during this life transition.

T1  - Austrian University Hospital Physicians’ Barriers to and Reasons for Assessing Their Patients’ Sexual Orientation
AN  - 2591183178
AB  - The current online-questionnaire study examined physicians’ (N = 135; 51.9% women and 48.1% men) attitudes toward homosexuality and assessed physicians’ barriers to and reasons for asking patients about their sexual orientation at an Austrian university hospital. Only 37.1% of female physicians and 27.7% of male physicians included questions about their patients’ sexual orientation in everyday clinical practice. The most commonly reported barrier was the belief that sexual orientation was irrelevant for healthcare. Reported discomfort or negative attitudes toward homosexuality were low and did not play a role in the frequency of physicians’ everyday assessment of patients’ sexual orientation. Physicians mostly stated concerns for their patients’ sexual health as reasons for assessing sexual orientation. Medical education or training programs need to include more thorough education with regard to sexual orientation, minority stress and health disparities. It is important that physicians recognize the relevance of assessing their patients’ sexual orientation.

T1  - Integrating Canadian Youth: The State of Intergroup Contact, Belonging, and Support for Immigration
AN  - 2620026518
AB  - This paper reports the results of a survey examining 168 immigrant and non-immigrant youth's perspectives of intergroup relations, support for immigration, and feelings of belonging in Canada. Using Allport's (1954) contact theory and the multiculturalism hypothesis (Berry et al., 2021) as a framework, the data is analyzed in the context of relative levels of intergroup contact, friendship, immigration-related knowledgeability, and perceived diversity. This study finds that, overall, the Canadian youth surveyed were more supportive of immigration than older generations and reported high levels of intergroup positivity and frequent intergroup contact. Moreover, intergroup contact and intergroup friendships were positively associated with feelings of belonging, whereas support for immigration was associated with immigration-related knowledgeability and perceptions of diversity.

T1  - Cultivating practices of inclusion towards same‐sex families in Italy: A comparison among educators, social workers, and healthcare professionals
AN  - 2618224056
AB  - LGB+ parented families in recent years are becoming more visible, but limited information exists about how professionals interact with people in these family forms. This study used the framework of intergroup contact theory to investigate whether contact with lesbians and gay men, same‐sex couples, and same‐sex parents respectively increase inclusive practices towards same‐sex families, and whether this association is mediated by professionals' prejudice and endorsement of same‐sex families' rights. A questionnaire with scales on: (a) intergroup contact, (b) professionals' orientation towards same‐sex families' inclusive practices, (c) professionals' prejudices, and (d) support of same‐sex couples' rights was administered to 460 professionals (9.8% males) working in social (N = 103), education (N = 156), and healthcare (N = 201) services in Italy. Path analysis was used to test the prediction that contact increases professionals' intention to embrace inclusive practices towards same‐sex families through the mediation of both prejudice and support to same‐sex couples' rights to have and raise children. Results showed that contact reduced prejudices towards same‐sex families and increased the endorsement of same‐sex families' rights, which in turn favoured professionals' willingness to modify their practices to include these family forms. Implications for the training and development of inclusive models are discussed. Please refer to the Supplementary Material section to find this article's Community and Social Impact Statement.

T1  - "Come and share a story with me": Promoting engagement between Ethiopian and Non-Ethiopian Israelis via joint digital narratives
AN  - 2617692357
AB  - Does building a collaborative digital story lead to reduction of intergroup tension? Studies show that joint storytelling can help reach deeper levels of understanding through exposure to another group's narrative. We hypothesized that engagement in a collaborative digital storytelling task would lead to reductions of negative emotions and attitudes. In our study, dyads of Ethiopian and non-Ethiopian Israelis interacted via a unique digital platform that supports storytelling in a comics-like format aiming to reduce intergroup tension. Their responses to this task were measured before and after the joint activity. Findings showed a decrease in negative emotional states in intergroup contexts (STAI) between pre-and post-intervention for members of both groups, and a slight decrease in negative attitudes toward the out-group. In other words, joint-digital storytelling sessions lead groups in complex relations to be more likely to support engagement. This study has implications for the effect of contact on intergroup tension.

T1  - Bisexual Stereotypes Apply Differently by Body Size: An Assessment of Bisexual Prototypicality, Trait Application, and Body Size
AN  - 2638855867
AB  - We blend person perception work with queer appearance psychology to examine the relationship between body size and bisexuality. In an online survey (N = 472, Mage = 25.15, 63.8% women), we examined the specific traits associated with a range of computer-modeled bodies identified as bisexual. We found that average body sizes were perceived as most prototypical of both bisexual men and bisexual women, skinny, and fat bodies were more associated with clusters of traits that contrast with common stereotypes about bisexuality. Additionally, we found that bisexual men were associated with increased masculinity and decreased femininity relative to bisexual women, and found a general, though nonsignificant trend such that bisexual men were perceived as having heightened androcentric desire relative to women. Finally, we found evidence for the role of typicality as a mediator of perceived prejudice; less prototypical bodies tended to be perceived as experiencing greater prejudice based on body size.

T1  - Xenophobia in the Time of a Pandemic: Social Media Use, Stereotypes, and Prejudice against Immigrants during the COVID-19 Crisis
AN  - 2631532354
AB  - This study examines the relationship between social media use, disease risk perception, social and political trust, and out-group stereotyping and prejudice during a social upheaval. Analyses of primary data collected during the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore found that disease risk perception is positively related to stereotyping and prejudice against Chinese immigrants. Individuals who used social media for news were more likely to stereotype and express prejudice. However, those who engaged in frequent heterogenous discussions, and had more extensive social networks, were less likely to stereotype and express prejudice. Higher social and political trust was also associated with lower stereotyping and prejudice. Finally, moderation effects of network characteristics on the relationship between risk perception, social trust, and prejudice were observed.

T1  - Divided by the Vote: Affective Polarization in the Wake of the Brexit Referendum
AN  - 2571853683
AB  - A well-functioning democracy requires a degree of mutual respect and a willingness to talk across political divides. Yet numerous studies have shown that many electorates are polarized along partisan lines, with animosity towards the partisan out-group. This article further develops the idea of affective polarization, not by partisanship, but instead by identification with opinion-based groups. Examining social identities formed during Britain's 2016 referendum on European Union membership, the study uses surveys and experiments to measure the intensity of partisan and Brexit-related affective polarization. The results show that Brexit identities are prevalent, felt to be personally important and cut across traditional party lines. These identities generate affective polarization as intense as that of partisanship in terms of stereotyping, prejudice and various evaluative biases, convincingly demonstrating that affective polarization can emerge from identities beyond partisanship.

T1  - Lesbian mothers' perceptions and experiences of their school involvement
AN  - 2570370092
AB  - Lesbian‐parented families challenge the heteronormative dominant discourse of family in major social institutions such as schools. This study explores Greek lesbian mothers' experiences and perceptions of their interaction with the school personnel and other parents. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to analyse the data obtained through in‐person interviews with 14 lesbian mothers. The study revealed three overarching themes: (a) anticipating teachers' rejection, (b) non‐traditional family models are not addressed in school curricula, and (c) Managing disclosure. Participants' experiences of anticipated rejection, of hiding and concealing their family structure and sexual identity confirm that LGBTQ+ individuals live in a macro‐ and micro‐environmental context which adds to minority stress and produces essential new challenges. The findings of this study are discussed in the light of the institutional sources of minority stress that affect lesbian mothers.

T1  - Pediatric Healthcare Providers’, College Students’, and Community Adults’ Moral Condemnation Beliefs Toward Sexual and Gender Minority Individuals
AN  - 2564698678
AB  - IntroductionPrejudice toward sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals plays a significant role in SGM youth healthcare. This study examines relations between psychosocial predictors (spirituality, religiosity, SGM education, experience with SGM individuals) and SGM moral condemnation among three distinct samples.MethodsThis study utilized online questionnaires to assess moral condemnation toward SGM individuals, religiosity, spirituality, SGM experience, and education/training about SGM individuals. The questionnaires were distributed to a college sample, community sample, and pediatric healthcare provider sample. Data were collected in years 2016–2019.ResultsReligiosity positively predicted moral condemnation in all three samples. Spirituality positively predicted moral condemnation in the community and college samples, but not the provider sample. Education about SGM individuals, previous experience with SGM individuals, having a close SGM friend/family member, and self-reporting previous personal discrimination experiences, as a set, significantly explained additional variance in SGM moral condemnation within the community and college sample, but not within the healthcare provider sample.ConclusionThis study lays groundwork for innovative research to further improve pediatric SGM healthcare and to increase the extent to which SGM youth disclose and discuss specific healthcare risks with their medical providers.Policy ImplicationsThere is a significant need for social policy focused on decreasing SGM stigmatization and discrimination within the healthcare environment.

T1  - Between Mainstream and Marginality: The Case of Men and Women of Mixed-Orientation Relationships
AN  - 2557315716
AB  - The literature regarding mixed-orientation relationships (MORs) focuses on individual and relationship aspects. Our study, informed by the social construction of reality theory, illuminates social aspects by examining social attitudes toward MORs as they are experienced and perceived by individuals of MOR. Within the scope of this study, we focused on self-identified non-straight men (gays, bisexuals, or men who have sex with men) who are in a relationship with self-identified straight women. Based on the phenomenological paradigm, we conducted 38 interviews with men and eight with women currently in MOR. The findings show that individuals of MOR primarily encounter negative attitudes from people in society regarding themselves and the nature of their relationship. Participants perceived that others viewed their relationships in terms of conflict, impossibility, or transitional stage. Social attitudes individuals of MOR encounter affect the degree of closeness of these couples to others in their social environment, resulting in constant tension between the participants’ desire to be open to and close to others and the need to conceal and keep a distance. We argue that the dialectical tensions between disclosure-concealment and autonomy-closeness are related to the marginalization of these couples as a social category.

T1  - Vaccine hesitancy, state bias, and Covid-19: Evidence from a survey experiment using Phase-3 results announcement by BioNTech and Pfizer
AN  - 2561105239
AB  - Background: Past survey studies document that people strongly prefer Covid-19 vaccines developed domestically over those developed abroad. Available evidence suggests that this preference for domestic vaccines over foreign ones may stem from prejudice against foreign countries, but identifying prejudice-based vaccine preferences is difficult because people also draw inferences about the quality of vaccines based on country of origin. We exploit a unique opportunity provided by the announcement of a viable vaccine by a bi-national venture, BioNTech and Pfizer, to examine the effect of such prejudice on vaccination intentions while controlling for beliefs about the vaccine quality. Methods: We implemented a survey experiment in Germany and the United States (n = 582, 661 respectively) a few days after the BioNTech/Pfizer announcement of a viable vaccine. We randomized the identified company (and country) responsible for the vaccine development between BioNTech (Germany) and Pfizer (U.S.) and asked respondents when they would take said vaccine. Results: In either the German and U.S. samples, we find little evidence that a country of origin of the vaccine makes a difference in when respondents intend to get vaccinated. We also see no evidence that those with a general animus toward the other foreign country would be more biased against a foreign vaccine. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that prejudice against foreign countries may be less of a concern for vaccine hesitancy and that its effect may be highly context specific.

T1  - Are emotionally intelligent people less prejudiced? The importance of emotion management skills for outgroup attitudes
AN  - 2559690634
AB  - People vary in their ability to understand, process, and manage information about one's own and others’ emotions, a construct known as Emotional Intelligence (EI). Past research highlighted the importance of EI in interpersonal relations as well as the key role of emotions underlying outgroup prejudice. Remarkably, hardly any research has investigated the associations between EI and outgroup prejudice. In three studies (total N = 922) conducted in Spain and the United Kingdom, we measured emotional intelligence using self‐report and performance tests and prejudice toward a variety of outgroups. Results showed that those with stronger performance‐based emotion management skills expressed lower generalized ethnic prejudice (Studies 1–3), more positive attitudes toward immigrants (Study 2a) and refugees (Study 2b), and less homophobic attitudes (Study 3). This negative association between emotion management and prejudice was found with different performance‐based EI measures and held after controlling for self‐perceived EI (Study 1) and self‐reported abilities to regulate emotions (Study 3). Study 3 further demonstrated that higher empathy partly accounted for the association between emotion management and prejudice. The findings suggest that emotion management abilities play an important, but so far largely neglected role in generalized prejudice.

T1  - Individual factors and cisgender college students' attitudes and behaviors toward transgender individuals
AN  - 2555199761
AB  - The present study is one of few to investigate both anti‐trans discrimination and anti‐trans prejudice. It examined four individual factors (religiosity; political beliefs; affiliation with LGBTQ [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer] people; gender role beliefs) through a lens of hetero‐cis‐normativity to understand their association with anti‐trans attitudes and reported behaviors. Using a sample of 302 cisgender college students from across the United States, hierarchical multiple regressions on bootstrap samples were used to analyze how these factors are associated with anti‐trans attitudes and behaviors. More liberal political beliefs, affiliation with more LGBTQ friends and family members, and less traditional gender role beliefs were related to more positive attitudes toward transgender people. Less traditional gender role beliefs and more positive attitudes were associated with more positive reported behaviors toward transgender individuals. Interventions designed to challenge traditional gender role beliefs and approximate affiliation with LGBTQ persons may be most effective to reduce pervasive hetero‐cis‐normative prejudice and discrimination within schools.

T1  - Does the Black/White Wage Gap Widen During Recessions?
AN  - 2548837363
AB  - Researchers have long documented a significant wage gap between White and Black workers, at least some of which is attributable to discrimination. Drawing on research suggesting that discrimination increases during recessions, we test whether the racial wage gap expands during economic downturns. Using longitudinal wage data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics over a 40-year time period (N = 18,954), we find that the wage gap between Black and White workers increases with the unemployment rate. Moreover, we find that the cyclical wage gap is more pronounced in states in which Whites hold more negative attitudes about Blacks and in states with larger Black populations, suggesting that the racial wage gap expansion during recessions is at least partially driven by discrimination. Finally, we find evidence for at least two mechanisms by which the wage gap expands during recessions. First, we find that Black workers are more likely to lose their jobs during downturns and earn lower wages upon reemployment than comparable Whites. Second, we find that Black hourly workers are slightly more likely to have their hours reduced during recessions than White hourly workers, thereby resulting in lower earnings. These findings suggest that the racial wage gap widens during recessions and that discrimination accounts for at least some of this expansion.

T1  - Sex Differences in the Attitudes of Australian and Indian Heterosexual Individuals toward Gay Men, Lesbians, Bisexual Men and Bisexual Women
AN  - 2601155972
AB  - In the present study, the attitudes of heterosexual individuals toward same-sex attracted individuals were investigated. Heterosexual Indian and Australian participants (n = 472; 254 males) completed a series of measures indexing participants’ attitudes toward lesbians, gay men and bisexual individuals. Overall, compared to Australians, Indians held attitudes that were more negative and less favorable toward same-sex attracted individuals. Australians held more negative attitudes toward bisexual than toward lesbian/gay individuals, a difference that did not occur for Indian participants. Additionally, male participants from Australia and India reported attitudes that were more negative and less favorable toward men who were gay or bisexual in comparison to women of either sexual orientation. These results suggest that cultural context may shape heterosexual attitudes toward lesbian/gay and bisexual individuals and highlight the importance of examining cross-cultural differences in sexual prejudice. Keywords: attitudes, sex differences, sexual orientation, cross-cultural differences.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/15299716.2021.1992328 .

T1  - Explaining Support for Post-Secondary Educational Funding for Indigenous Students
AN  - 2594716911
AB  - Il existe un fossé entre les peuples autochtones et non-autochtones au Canada en ce qui concerne l'éducation post-secondaire. Un programme conçu pour aider a régler ce probleme, le Programme d'aide aux étudiants de niveau postsecondaire (PSSSP), offre aux étudiants admissibles des Premieres nations du financement pour l'éducation postsecondaire. Bien que ces programmes soient bénéfiques, on ne sait pas exactement dans quelle mesure les Canadiens soutiennent le financement public de l'éducation des Autochtones et si la recherche psychologique peut aider a expliquer pourquoi certains l'approuvent ou s'y opposent. Ainsi, en utilisant le PSSSP comme exemple, nous avons examiné cinq prédicteurs psychologiques possibles du soutien public : les préjugés personnels envers les peuples autochtones, la mobilité sociale perçue, les croyances méritocratiques, les croyances de groupe a somme nulle et le conservatisme politique. Sur la base de recherches antérieures, nous avons émis l'hypothese que tout serait lié négativement au soutien du PSSSP. Dans un échantillon d'adultes canadiens non autochtones, nous avons constaté que seuls les taux plus élevés de préjugés personnels, de croyances de groupe a somme nulle et de conservatisme politique expliquaient de maniere unique une baisse de soutien du programme (ou inversement, un taux moins élevé de préjugés, de croyances de groupe a somme nulle et de libéralisme politique étaient liés a une hausse du soutien du programme). Bien que corrélative, cette étude fournit un aperçu des facteurs qui peuvent influencer les attitudes des Canadiens a l'égard d'un programme visant a s'attaquer a une inégalité sociétale conséquente. Nous discutons des implications de ces résultats en ce qui concerne le soutien aux programmes et politiques destinés aux groupes marginalisés.Alternate abstract:A concerning post-secondary education gap exists between Indigenous and non-Indigenous individuals in Canada. One program designed to help address this issue, the Post-Secondary Student Support Program (PSSSP), provides eligible First Nations students with post-secondary education funding. Although such programs are beneficial, it is unclear how much Canadians support public funding of Indigenous education and whether psychological research can help explain why some may endorse or oppose it. Thus, using the PSSSP as an example, we examined five possible psychological predictors of public support: personal prejudice toward Indigenous Peoples, perceived social mobility, meritocratic beliefs, group zero-sum beliefs, and political conservatism. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that all would negatively relate to support for the PSSSP. In a sample of non-Indigenous Canadian adults, we found that only higher personal prejudice, group zero-sum beliefs, and political conservatism uniquely explained lower support for the program (or conversely, lower prejudice, group zero-sum beliefs, and political liberalism were related to higher program support). Although correlational, this study provides insight into factors that may influence Canadians' attitudes toward a program aimed at addressing a consequential societal inequality. We discuss the implications of these findings in regard to support for programs and policies targeted at marginalized groups.

T1  - CAN WE HAVE TRUST IN HOST GOVERNMENT? SELF-ESTEEM, WORK ATTITUDES AND PREJUDICE OF LOW-STATUS EXPATRIATES LIVING IN CHINA
AN  - 2581018966
AB  - The paper aims to investigate whether trust in a host government can mitigate the negative effects caused by the social complexities facing low-status expatriates (LSEs) living in China. It models trust in host government as a mediator in the relationship between expatriates' perception of status-based prejudice and their work attitudes; it further outlines the role of self-esteem in this relationship. The study seeks to expand knowledge in the domain of expatriate management by explaining the prejudicial behavior of host country towards low-status expatriates. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze responses from LSEs in China. The results provide the evidence that perceived discrimination negatively affects expatriates' work attitudes and suggest that trust in the host government can mediate such effects. Self-esteem is found to be a significant moderator in the relationship. With this, the study empirically affirms social categorization theory, showing it to be a powerful lens through which LSE adaptability can be the behavior of host nationals towards low-status expatriates and can be further developed with regard to the adaptability of low-status expatriates.

T1  - Forty Years of HIV: The Intersection of Laws, Stigma, and Sexual Behavior and Identity
AN  - 2561528727
AB  - Forty years after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's)June 1981 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report about five gay men with a syndrome that came to be called AIDS, both the impact of HIV and the legal landscape in the United States for the most affected population have changed dramatically. The CDC's HIV surveillance reports show that, throughout the epidemic, MSM have constituted the majority of annual and prevalent cases, and the burden on racial or ethnic minority MSM has increased disproportionately since the early 1990s. It is timely to reflect on the intertwining of HIV, laws, stigma, and inequity in the United States and their intersection with the lives of gay and bisexual men (both cisgender and transgender). Since its beginnings, the US legal framework defined homosexual sex or relationships as criminal, inferior, aberrant, and worthy of discrimination.2 Throughout most of the 20th century, sexual stigma kept homosexual and bisexual persons hidden and legitimized their abuse, but this stigma began to be challenged in the 1970s, after the Stonewall riots and the removal of homosexuality from the psychiatric manual of mental disorders.2,3Whenthe AIDS crisis rapidly emerged, government action was slow and muted partly because of broad stigma against who was most affected.4 Despite growing resistance to and activism against society's stigmatization of sexual minorities, HIV emerged in a bleak legal environment of widespread prejudice and discrimination reflected by individuals and most of society's institutions.2,5 In the 1980s, almost 20 states, many in the South, still had sodomy laws on the books that criminalized sex between members of the same sex or all nonprocreative sex.5 In 1986, in Bowers v. Hardwick (478 US 186), the Supreme Court reinforced stigma when it narrowly upheld the right of Georgia to enforce a sodomy law that prohibited homosexual conduct, even when it occurred in a private home.5 Although seldom enforced, sodomy laws often were used to justify discrimination in other laws and institutions.5Thus, as HIV took hold in the United States, same-sex behaviors and relationships had no legal protections, gay parents often lost their parental rights during divorce, violence and victimization was too common, and, in almost all circumstances, discrimination was legal in employment (including the military), housing, and social services.2,5 In addition, during HIV's first decade, intense fear and stigma led to new HIVspecific criminal laws. States with Medicaid expansion (approximately 38 in 2019) show large increases in insurance coverage, diagnoses and ongoing treatment of chronic conditions, and HIV testing.11 Similarly, a recent study found that MSM in expansion states were more likely to have insurance (87.9% vs 71.6%), have Medicaid (21.3% vs 3.8%), discuss pre-exposure prophylaxis with a provider (58.8% vs 44.3%), and use pre-exposure prophylaxis (31.1% vs 17.5%).12 Over the past decade, public health has increased its focus on addressing stigma and the social determinants of health to improve disparities in HIV care and prevention and among gay and bisexual men.

T1  - Black British female managers—The silent catastrophe
AN  - 2552827194
AB  - The researcher examined the experiences of Black British female managers (BBFM) who worked for Children and Young People's Services (CYPS) operating in the UK. The following research questions guided this study: How do Black British female managers experience racial microaggressions and how do they cope with it? Purposive and theoretical sampling were used to recruit 10 BBFM who worked for CYPS and who had similar demographic characteristics (i.e., racial/ethnic background and managerial experience). Interview transcripts were analyzed using constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006a). Over 200 codes were identified and extracted from individual interview transcripts. Organizing the codes into categories resulted in five themes that highlighted the challenging practices that BBFM perceived thwarted their careers (i.e., The Organizational Culture, On the Outside Looking In, Stereotype Threat, Prejudice, and Discrimination and Institutional Racism and Espoused Practice vs. Reality), and one theme that described their coping strategies (i.e., The Silent Catastrophe). Although the study is centered on a multisectorial sample, two main conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, gendered racism curtails the career development of BBFM in ways that are not experienced by their White counterparts. Second, BBFM perceive that their experiences in CYPS was fundamentally negatively disproportionate and aversive. The implication is that CYPS leaders must give racial and gender equality, diversity and inclusion greater priority.

T1  - Pathways to prejudice and outgroup hostility: Group alignment and intergroup conflict among football fans
AN  - 2550671028
AB  - How do different forms of group alignment influence our attitudes toward outgroups? To answer this, the current fieldwork study explored how identification and identity fusion differentially impact outgroup anxiety, prejudice, and hostility toward rival football fan supporter groups in Australia. The community participants (N = 100) were members of two active fan groups who had experienced a history of intergroup tensions. The findings from the full path model confirmed that the predictor group alignment variables of identification and fusion were correlated, and the two outcome variables of outgroup prejudice and hostility were correlated, as predicted. The findings also revealed that fusion with one's club predicted outgroup hostility, but not prejudice, whereas identification with one's club predicted outgroup prejudice, but not hostility. Additionally, outgroup anxiety was found to significantly mediate the relationship between ingroup identification and outgroup prejudice, whereas a similar relationship was not found for fusion. These findings highlight the differential impact of group alignment (i.e., identification and identity fusion) on social constructs of outgroup anxiety, prejudice, and hostility. Empirically, this is the first study to demonstrate the workings of these distinct group alignment pathways in an applied setting involving hard‐core football fans. We discuss the broader implications of these findings for a fuller understanding of the drivers of intergroup tensions and conflict.

T1  - Ethnic Marginalization and (Non)Compliance in Public Health Emergencies
AN  - 2546972628
AB  - Health crises can reveal the inability of governments to induce compliance with policy interventions. While lack of compliance is conventionally attributed to individual mistrust in government, resistance to such interventions is often found clustered among entire communities, particularly in ethnically divided societies. We account for such patterns by explaining how citizens adjust their responses to state authority according to their shared ethnicity with those in power. We assess the effect of ethnicity on citizen compliance with a public health advisory on HIV/AIDS issued by different authority types through a survey-based field experiment in the West African country of Guinea. Members of a politically marginalized ethnic group, the Peul, are significantly less likely to comply with a public health advisory from a national government representative, the president, when compared to local or religious leaders. We show that perceived ethnic discrimination conditions both trust in and compliance with different authority types.

T1  - Racial Attitudes Through a Partisan Lens
AN  - 2543258360
AB  - The conventional wisdom is that racial attitudes, by forming through early socialization processes, are causally prior to most things political, including whites' party identifications. Yet a broad literature demonstrates that partisanship can shape mass attitudes. The author argues that this influence extends even to presumptively fundamental predispositions like racial attitudes. The study applies cross-lagged models to panel data from the 1990s and 2000s to demonstrate that whites align their racial attitudes with their party loyalties. The results demonstrate that partisanship has a more pronounced influence in the latter time period, which is consistent with a view that changes in the political context can make partisanship a more likely causal force on other attitudes. Racial concerns not only provide a foundation for political conflict: my results reveal that political processes can increase or decrease racial animus.

T1  - Gender, Media, and Contraceptive Use in Nigeria: Men Need Help, Not Women
AN  - 2551250469
AB  - Nigeria's annual population growth and fertility rates are fueling the popular postulation that by 2050, the nation will rank after India and China in population size. Increasing population growth amid poor economic and health statistics in Nigeria point to family planning as one of the long-term effective solutions to this issue. After years of raising awareness and knowledge building, there still exists a huge gap between knowledge of contraceptives and the application of the knowledge in Nigerian society. This gap has initiated a myriad of behavior change communication campaigns on the use of contraceptives. This study goes beyond considering the influences of both spousal communication and mass media on family planning awareness and usage of contraceptives; it examines the response of each gender to family planning campaigns and contraceptive use in Osun and Ogun states, Nigeria. In spite of awareness raising, knowledge building, and persuasion for adoption, how does each gender respond to social marketing of contraceptives usage? A comparative descriptive survey was conducted among ninety men in Iwo, Osun State, and ninety-five women in General Hospital, Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State. The purposive sampling method was adopted in selecting men and women with previous exposure to social marketing campaigns on family planning. The findings revealed that television and radio, social media, and interactions with doctors/nurses are prominent means through which family planning communication takes place. Through mass and social media, barriers and myths relating to family planning are being eradicated, and access to family planning knowledge and resources is increasing. The media has been able to successfully persuade and change negative attitudes toward contraceptive usage. Findings also showed that while men respondents were not using contraceptives, almost all the women respondents were. Some of the factors that could contribute to the varying responses to behavior change communication on the use of contraceptives between genders have been identified to be individual differences, as well as socio-cultural and religious barriers. The study calls for a new wave of social marketing on contraceptives usage, specifically targeted at transforming the positive attitudes of a proportionate number of men, to actual usage of contraceptives.

T1  - Emotional Turmoil or Peaceful Agreements? A Phenomenological Study on Coping with Reforms in Higher Education Institution
AN  - 2547616288
AB  - Promoting changes in an organisation is never an easy task. Coping with changes is an individual process and affects our individual physical and psychological well-being. This study attempted to analyse how university reforms were experienced by academic staff. It is framed by Self-Determination Theory, according to which there are three basic psychological needs that affect all people: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. I conducted Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA; Smith et al., 2009) to gain insight into participants' experiences during the period of 4 years, 2014-2018. The participants came from two academic staff communities of the same institution. The data collection methods were observations, diary notes, and interviews. The data were analysed according IPA. The results reveal the important role of the sense of community and belongingness between academic peers and colleagues within broader academic staff communities. In fact, it may influence the individual's experience of reforms in both directions-peaceful confidence or alarming apprehension. The findings suggest that lack of autonomy about one's work life increases negative attitudes towards the reforms and alludes to emotion-focused coping strategies, whilst autonomy supportive and open working environment supports coping with reforms in an academic institution.

T1  - Warmth, Competence, and Blame: Examining Mothers of Sexually Abused Children Within the Stereotype Content Model
AN  - 2539852041
AB  - Research shows that nonoffending mothers are frequently held at fault for child sexual abuse (CSA), by both society and professionals, with contradictory explanations for the fault. For example, the same maternal characteristic can be used to assign blame or alleviate blame (i.e., single mothers have been held more at fault for their child’s CSA and less at fault). The purpose of this study was to assess a theoretically based model that could account for these different reasons. We tested the stereotype content model (SCM), which examines the content of stereotypes toward target groups, by focusing on perceptions of that group’s levels of warmth and competence. We sampled 136 undergraduate participants who read a vignette describing CSA, and completed the SCM with the mother of the victim as the target, and measures of mother fault. Our results showed that participants fell into three SCM groups of mother fault: (a) Moderate Contemptuous Prejudice (i.e., low competence, low warmth); (b) Admiration (i.e., moderate competence, high warmth); and (c) Very Contemptuous Prejudice (i.e., very low competence, very low warmth). Each cluster also held unique emotions toward the mother, as predicted by the SCM. Results further showed that assigned levels of fault were significant, but that fault did not vary by SCM group, lending support to the ideas that the SCM can be applied to this group and that different participants assign fault for different reasons.

T1  - Intercultural learning in the home environment: children’s experiences as part of a homestay host family
AN  - 2521843376
AB  - This paper explores how immersion and engagement with different cultures in the home environment impacts Korean children’s intercultural learning. More specific attention is given to the experience of nine Korean children whose families have voluntarily served as homestay host families and hosted foreign guests for more than seven years. This qualitative inquiry is drawn from data including participant observations, semi-structured interviews with children and their parents, and the collection of artefacts and documents. Four themes were identified regarding the impact of homestay hosting experiences on the focal children: (1) experiencing intercultural encounters in the home environment; (2) building close, long-lasting intercultural relationships; (3) recognising preconceived prejudices and undoing cultural stereotypes; and (4) challenging a singular and oversimplified representation of cultures. Given the modern, global context in which children engage in frequent contacts with individuals from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds, the findings demonstrate the necessity of fostering intercultural learning among school-aged children and suggest homestay programmes are a potential means for developing students’ intercultural learning in a local context.

T1  - Whiteness, Anti-Blackness, and Trauma: A Grounded Theory of White Racial Meaning Making
AN  - 2547567729
AB  - This constructivist grounded theory study reveals nine interrelated components that describe white undergraduates' processes for making meaning of issues of race and racism in their environments. Findings also reveal how these processes perpetuate whiteness and anti-blackness. I present the theory as a composite counternarrative that draws upon data from 31 white undergraduate students and foregrounds Black students' experiences with racism on campus. The resulting juxtaposition highlights how whiteness and anti-blackness, on a spiritual level, function as pathologies that perpetuate trauma.

T1  - Troubling Atticus: Letting the Mockingbird Fly Away
AN  - 2540553207
AB  - Tom Robinson, falsely accused of rape, is being held at the county courthouse when an angry, drunken mob shows up to interrupt due process and administer violence masquerading as vigilante justice.

Practical reasons contributed, too; TKAM was school board-approved for eighth grade, the approval process for new texts was cumbersome, and book budgets were tight.

[...]reflecting on this point reveals a missed opportunity I most regret.

Unswayed by that critique, which seemed dismissive of children's literature as a whole as much as TKAM individually, I next read Gladwell's (2009) appraisal of Atticus as a metonym for a Jim Crow liberal who'd ask jurors to swap prejudices against Black defendants for prejudices against white trash and against believing women.

T1  - Measured and manipulated effects of value similarity on prejudice and well-being
AN  - 2522250136
AB  - We review recent research investigating the effect of shared human values on personal and social outcomes. Using more precise methods than past research, cross-sectional and experimental evidence suggests that well-being and prejudice are predicted by the extent to which people’s values align (or are perceived to align) with those of other people around them. Importantly, this research shows that these effects depend on the type of values being considered and are more nuanced than prior research suggests. For example, well-being is higher among individuals who perceive their fellow citizens to share their values of power and achievement. Prejudice against immigrants is higher among individuals who value conservation more but perceive immigrants to value openness. Moreover, experimentally highlighting actual value similarities rather than mean differences improves attitudes towards outgroups. We discuss how future studies can improve our understanding of value similarity effects and their underlying mechanisms.

T1  - Procedural justice, compliance with the law and police stop-and-search: a study of young people in England and Scotland
AN  - 2516085096
AB  - The policing of young people, especially through stop-and-search, has been rigorously debated in the context of rising violence in the UK. While concepts based on procedural justice theory and perceptions of police fairness are directly relevant to these debates, these have rarely been tested on young people, nor have they taken account of the impact of stop-and-search. This paper examines young people’s experiences of stop-and-search in two Scottish and two English cities, and tests the relationship between these experiences, their trust in the police, their perceptions of police legitimacy and their compliance with the law. The study finds that Scottish adolescents, who experienced higher volume stop-and-search, had more negative attitudes to the police and perceived them to be less procedurally fair than English adolescents. Structural equation modelling confirms that principles of procedural justice theory do apply to young people in this UK sample. However, our findings suggest that stop-and-search may damage trust in the police and perceptions of police legitimacy, regardless of the volume of police stop-and-search, and this may result in increased offending behaviour. With ongoing calls to increase the use of stop-and-search in response to recent increases in knife crime in England, we argue that its use needs to be carefully balanced against the, as yet poorly evidenced, benefits of the use of the tactic.

T1  - Between cultural relativism and liberal ethnocentrism: What does Saudi Arabia tell us about cultural variation in moral identity and prejudice?
AN  - 2513964569
AB  - Cultural conceptions of morality are grounded in diverse moral foundations, but moral identity research often assumes that individualizing concerns are the universal basis for morality. Moral identity scales grounded only in individualizing foundations risk liberal ethnocentrism, to the extent that binding foundations emphasized in collectivist cultures are overlooked. Three hundred and ninety‐five Saudi Arabian and UK participants completed prejudice and moral identity measures, which either narrowly measured only individualizing foundations or broadly measured both binding and individualizing foundations. The broader measure had greater power to predict prejudice scores in both countries, particularly in Saudi Arabia. Generally, moral identities grounded in individualizing foundations predicted less prejudice, while moral identities grounded in binding foundations predicted higher prejudice in both countries. Individualizing measures of moral identity may assess ethnocentric concepts, but recognizing morality grounded in binding considerations may taint the category of moral identity with self‐concepts that are associated with greater—not less—ethnocentrism.

T1  - The Role of Masculinity Threat in Homonegativity and Transphobia
AN  - 2495193063
AB  - According to the precarious manhood perspective, masculinity threat triggers various compensatory mechanisms and heightens motivation to restore and reaffirm masculinity via typically masculine attitudes and behaviors. Four experiments aiming to examine the effect of masculinity threat on prejudices toward sexual and gender minorities were undertaken, controlling for adherence to sex role stereotypes. Our studies showed that Polish men representing university and high school students exposed to gender threat experienced increased negative affect (Experiment 1) and expressed higher prejudices toward gay people (Experiment 2) and transgender individuals (Experiments 3a and 3b). Furthermore, Experiment 2 revealed an effect of masculinity threat on modern prejudices predominantly toward gay people but not old-fashioned homonegativity. The results are discussed in terms of the role of masculinity threat as the mechanism responsible for gender differences in the attitudes toward sexual and gender minorities.

T1  - Allport meets internet: A meta-analytical investigation of online intergroup contact and prejudice reduction
AN  - 2549948763
AB  - Since Allport's optimal conditions for reducing prejudice by interpersonal contact were defined, numerous empirical studies have confirmed the efficacy of intergroup contact in reducing prejudice towards outgroups. Given that the Internet is changing the way people communicate and interact daily, it is very possible that the Web plays an important role in reducing prejudice. Assuming that the virtual environment fits Allport boundary conditions for effective contact that reduces prejudice, we undertook this meta-analysis. Our aim was to demonstrate that online intergroup contact is a successful means of improving intergroup relations. Results from 23 studies (20 journal articles and 3 unpublished records) showed that the effect is significant. Effect size was independent of the characteristics of samples, including their countries. There were stronger effects when the induced contact focused on cooperation but not for support of the interaction by an authority figure or the presence of common goals.

AN  - 2516239131
AB  - Objectives The 'Black Lives Matter' (BLM) movement in 2020 exemplifies efforts to counter prejudices and the colourist narrative. Harmful use of topical skin lightening agents continues worldwide despite interdiction or restricted use under domestic, European and international regulations. Study design Commentary. Methods Narrative review. Results In this Short Communication, we consider the significance of societal perspectives of skin colour, glocalized whiteness, efforts to attain self-esteem and social mobility through skin lightening practices, and the role of cosmetic products in fuelling this phenomenon. Conclusions Addressing the inadvertent (or indeed conscious) vehicles of systematic racism and sustaining of skin colour prejudices and stereotypes of fair skin beauty by cosmetic companies is warranted. Targeted health messaging is an imperative.

T1  - Put yourself in my wheelchair: Perspective‐taking can reduce prejudice toward people with disabilities and other stigmatized groups
AN  - 2509282386
AB  - This study aimed to compare perspective‐taking with a hypothetical target and perspective‐taking occurring during a real interaction with an outgroup member in reducing prejudice toward people with disabilities and other groups (e.g., immigrants, homosexual people), via increased empathy. We adopted an experimental design with two treatment groups (Hypothetical target vs. Real target) and one control group (no intervention), one pretest and two posttest measures. Participants, who were 437 students aged 11–17 years (M = 14.28; SD = 1.17), were randomly assigned to the various conditions on a classroom basis. Perspective‐taking was facilitated asking participants to travel in a wheelchair on a path that simulated a real pavement in the presence (or not) of an individual with a motor disability. Findings showed that perspective‐taking in the presence of a real target was more effective in reducing prejudice toward people with disabilities than perspective‐taking task without encountering an outgroup member. Perspective‐taking with a hypothetical target was not sufficient to increase participants' empathy toward people with disabilities, which instead was enhanced when the task was performed at the presence of a real member of that group. Positive effects produced by perspective‐taking (with both a hypothetical and a real target) were transferred to immigrants and homosexuals. These findings suggest that, when possible, perspective‐taking in the presence of the target, which can improve empathy by favoring a two‐way exchange process, is highly recommended to improve attitudes toward different stigmatized groups, not necessarily targeted by the intervention.

T1  - Friendship and romance across the U.S. political divide: Hindrance or help for outgroup political attitudes?
AN  - 2509281679
AB  - Consistent with the intergroup contact literature, cross‐political relationships (e.g., friendships or romantic relationships between different partisans) may help reduce inter‐political group prejudice. Given that unfavorable attitudes based on the political group membership are particularly heightened at present in the United States, we explored whether having cross‐political friendships (Study 1) or romantic relationships (Study 2) predict more positive interpersonal or intergroup attitudes among American Democrats and Republicans. In Study 1, using a social network measure (N = 301), where participants reported on their closest friends, cross‐political (versus same‐political) friendship was associated with less positive interpersonal attitudes when this relationship was unsatisfying. Having any (versus no) or more (versus less) cross‐political group friendships was not associated with holding more positive intergroup attitudes. In Study 2, cross‐political romantic relationships were examined (N = 392). Having a cross‐ (versus same‐) political romantic relationship was associated with relatively less positive attitudes toward the political outgroup via lower empathy when relationship satisfaction was low. Study findings highlight the potential limitations of the beneficial effects of intergroup contact.

T1  - Responding to hate incidents on university campuses: benefits and barriers to establishing a restorative justice programme
AN  - 2503528570
AB  - This study examines staff and student perspectives of the use of restorative justice approaches to respond to student-on-student hate crime, hate incidents, and hate speech on university campuses. It draws on qualitative data collated over a one-year period, during the design and establishment of a restorative programme entitled ‘Restore Respect’ at two UK universities. Highlighting examples of students’ experiences of prejudice and hate across the two universities, we outline some of the key barriers to reporting associated with conventional university responses, as well as staff and student views of establishing a new restorative approach to addressing incidents. While early-stage evaluation revealed certain cultural and institutional barriers and limitations to the establishment and operation of a restorative programme, the majority of staff and students viewed it as an effective way of addressing hate-based conduct that would provide greater opportunity for more positive interventions and outcomes. The paper concludes by arguing for a renewed effort to move beyond standard institutional responses to student experiences of hate and prejudice at university through the adoption of restorative, needs-centred approaches.

T1  - Understanding the effectiveness of advertisements about the long-term harms of alcohol and low-risk drinking guidelines: A mediation analysis
AN  - 2528237057
AB  - Rationale: Many people overestimate the amount of alcohol that increases their risk of harm and so may not perceive any need to change their drinking behaviour. Several countries have developed low-risk drinking guidelines, yet awareness of these guidelines remains low. Furthermore, mass media campaigns about alcohol-related harms may have limited impact if people do not perceive their current consumption as potentially harmful. Integrating drinking guidelines into media campaigns about alcohol's harms can concurrently provide drinkers with information about low-risk drinking levels and compelling reasons to comply. Objective: Our aim was to build understanding of the effectiveness of messages about the long-term harms of drinking and low-risk drinking guidelines, by testing the mediating effects of estimates of harmful drinking levels and attitudes towards drinking alcohol on subsequent intentions and behaviours. Method: In an online experiment conducted in 2016, n = 1156 Australian adult monthly drinkers were randomly assigned to view advertisements for non-alcohol products (NON-ALC; control), advertisements featuring long-term harms of alcohol (LTH), or LTH advertisements plus a guideline message (LTH + G). Immediately following exposure, we measured estimates of harmful drinking levels and attitudes towards drinking alcohol. One week later, we measured intentions to drink less and behavioural compliance with the guideline. Results: Compared to NON-ALC advertisements, exposure to LTH + G advertisements increased (i) the proportion of respondents who correctly estimated harmful drinking levels, which in turn, strengthened intentions to drink less (42% of the total effect was mediated), and (ii) negative attitudes, which in turn, also increased intentions to drink less (35% mediated) and behavioural compliance (24% mediated). Compared to NON-ALC, LTH advertisements increased negative attitudes, which in turn strengthened intentions to drink less (53% mediated). Conclusions: When paired with effective alcohol harm reduction television advertisements, messages promoting low-risk drinking guidelines can increase drinkers' intentions to reduce their alcohol consumption and compliance with low-risk drinking guidelines.

T1  - Elite stigmatization of the unemployed: The association between framing and public attitudes
AN  - 2495956832
AB  - This paper uses a multi‐methods approach to explore the social psychological construction of stigma towards the unemployed. Study 1a uses thematic analysis to explore frames used by political elites in speeches at U.K. national party conferences between 1996 and 2016 (n = 43); in study 1b, we track the usage of these frames in six national newspapers (n = 167,723 articles) over the same period showing an increase in the use of negative frames. Study 1c shows that these are associated with national attitudes towards welfare recipients using the British Social Attitude Survey. We find the ‘Othering’ frame is correlated with negative attitudes towards the unemployed, even when controlling for the unemployment rate. This finding supports the claim that social attitudes are related to frames produced in the political and media spheres. We provide theoretical integration between social representations theory and framing which affords development in both domains.

T1  - May the odds be ever in your favor: The Hunger Games and the fight for a more equal society. (Negative) Media vicarious contact and collective action
AN  - 2492897155
AB  - Various studies have found that reading books about positive interactions between ingroup and outgroup characters, known as media vicarious contact, can reduce prejudice. Focusing on the fantasy saga of The Hunger Games, we examined the effects of negative vicarious contact on collective action across two studies. Specifically, we tested whether reading about fantasy characters living in a postapocalyptic conflictual society with large social disparities between advantaged and disadvantaged groups leads advantaged group members to display greater willingness to engage in collective action on behalf of the disadvantaged group. Results from Study 1 (correlational survey in the United Kingdom and United States) and Study 2 (experimental intervention in Italy) revealed that reading The Hunger Games is indirectly associated with greater collective action intentions via increased anger toward injustice. In both studies social dominance orientation (SDO) acted as a moderator, but in opposite directions: mediation was significant for low‐SDOs in Study 1, and for high‐SDOs in Study 2. Results are discussed in relation to the importance of media vicarious contact via book reading for social change, and to the need to identify the contextual conditions allowing to anticipate the specific moderation pattern that is more likely to emerge.

[...]several theoretical perspectives (e.g., cognitive dissonance) suggest that engaging in behaviors inconsistent with attitudes may lead to attitude change [17].

[...]in the current study, we examined whether the prevention behaviors of mask usage, social distancing, handwashing, and stocking up on food/supplies were associated with COVID-19 vaccine intentions as a positive association could both help guide the development of interventions to improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake as well as predict individuals and potentially geographic regions to target based on current levels of COVID-19 prevention behaviors.

Individuals who responded, “no, I will not get a coronavirus vaccine,” were also asked, “Which of the following are reasons you would not get a coronavirus vaccine?” Respondents could select multiple reasons and response options included “I am allergic to vaccines,” “I don’t like needles,” “I’m not concerned about getting seriously ill from the coronavirus,” “I won’t have time to get vaccinated,” “I would be concerned about getting infected with the coronavirus from the vaccine,” “I would be concerned about side effects from the vaccine,” “I don’t think vaccines work very well,” and “the coronavirus outbreak is not as serious as some people say it is.”

T1  - Be careful what you say! – Evaluative change based on instructional learning generalizes to other similar stimuli and to the wider category
AN  - 2483610951
AB  - In evaluative conditioning, a conditional stimulus (CS; e.g. a neutral picture) acquires positive/negative valence if it is paired with a pleasant/unpleasant unconditional stimulus (US; e.g. a positive/negative picture). This valence generalises to other stimuli similar to the CS and to the wider CS category. Being informed that the CS will be paired with the US induces a similar change in valence (instructional learning), but it is not clear whether instructional learning would also generalise. In Experiment 1, participants were informed that one shape would be paired with pleasant and another with unpleasant images. These instructions instilled conditional valence to the CSs which generalised to different shapes from the same category (generalisation stimuli). In Experiment 2, we replicated this finding in an implicit measure using stimuli varying in perceptual features. Participants were informed that three CSs from one category (e.g. vegetables) would be paired with pleasant images and three CSs from a second category (e.g. office supplies) would be paired with unpleasant images. This instruction instilled conditional valence to the CSs which generalised to novel exemplars from the same categories. This suggests that conditional valence instilled via instructions generalises to other stimuli – a finding with implications for prejudice and racism.

T1  - Early Maternal Employment Status and Attachment Quality: An Investigation of a Conditional Process Model
AN  - 2476109000
AB  - This study examined how maternal employment status during the first year of a child’s life influenced later attachment quality. A sample of 1,364 mothers participated in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development was categorized into five groups including consistent working, transition to working, transition to nonworking, consistent nonworking, and multiple transitions. Results supported the hypothesized model by showing two interrelated mediating mechanisms of depressive symptoms and maternal sensitivity. Mothers who have not worked consistently and experienced transition to nonworking showed higher levels of depressive symptoms when compared with mothers who have worked consistently, which in turn negatively influenced maternal sensitivity. Tests of moderated mediation indicated that among nonworking mothers, only those with negative attitudes toward employment showed lower levels of depressive symptoms compared with the consistent working group. Findings suggest different mechanisms involved in the relationship between early maternal employment and the development of secure attachment.

T1  - Looking in and looking out: Effects of (in)congruent corporate social responsibility on organizational cynicism
AN  - 2608509939
AB  - Corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts targeting both internal stakeholders (i.e., employees) and external stakeholders (i.e., environment, community, consumers) can mitigate employees' negative attitudes and behavior. However, the effects of (in)congruence between internal CSR (ICSR) and external CSR (ECSR) perceptions have not yet been examined. We used social comparison theory to investigate the joint effects of ICSR and ECSR perceptions on organizational cynicism, by conducting a polynomial regression analysis of 342 employees with data from a two-wave survey. The results show that employees experienced higher cynicism when ICSR and ECSR perceptions were incongruent, with high ECSR-low ICSR causing greater cynicism. Thus, there was an inverted U-shaped relationship between congruent CSR perceptions and organizational cynicism. Our findings have implications for research and practice.

T1  - Positioning Religion in International Relations: The Performative, Discursive, and Relational Dimension of Religious Soft Power
AN  - 2602171788
AB  - Amidst the global religious resurgence in the post-secular world, the field of international relations finds itself unwilling or unable to situate religion back to theoretical paradigms subject to the Westphalian–Enlightenment prejudice. Advocates of religion’s theoretical and empirical significance often turn to religious soft power, a burgeoning theory that gradually becomes the anchorage of discussion but still suffers from conceptual ambiguity and limited explanatory capacity. This essay endeavors to fill in this lacuna by presenting the interdisciplinary attempt to integrate soft power in IR with the three dimensions of power in sociology, which results in a typology of performative, discursive, and relational dimensions of religious soft power. The explanatory and predictive capacity of this model is tested in the empirical case of the evangelical group’s influence on US foreign policy of the post 9/11 Global War on Terror. A process-level historical account based on archival sources furthers scholars’ knowledge of transnational religious actors’ ability to seize both systematic transformations at the international level and contentious dynamics in the domestic environment, which generates a reorientation in norms, identities, and values that contributes to the outcome of foreign policy, thereby answering the un-addressed question of how religion influences domestic and international politics. The bridging of IR, sociology, and historical sociology, three fields often intertwined, suggests a future direction for not only the religious return to IR but also the overcoming of the “intellectual autism” of this discipline, which needs to be better prepared for continuous challenges of soaring populism, nationalism, and clash of civilizations in the twenty-first century.

T1  - New Paradigm in Addressing Islamophobia: An Analytical Study Based on the Life of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)
AN  - 2575924345
AB  - Sebilangan besar kajian telah mengakui kewujudan Islamofobia. Walaubagaimanapun, hanya beberapa kajian sahaja yang cuba untuk membongkar dan memahami konsepnya. Kajian ini akan membincangkan elemen-elemen yang membentuk Islamofobia; iaitu elemen kebencian, permusuhan, dan perkauman yang berlaku terhadap Islam dan umat Islam. Selain itu, iajuga bertujuan untuk menjelaskan beberapa kaedah yang digunakan oleh Nabi Muhammad (PBUH) dalam menangani isu-isu yang menyebabkan berlakunya kebencian, perkauman, dan stereotaip, yang seterusnya mendorong masyarakat untuk mempraktikkan pelbagai bentuk permusuhan berdasarkan agama, bangsa, warna kulit dan lain-lain. Analisis kaj ian ini mengesahkan biografi kenabian serta keberkesananya untuk menyediakan dunia moden dengan kaedah yang sistematik dalam menangai cabaran dan masalah Islamfobia yang semakin serius. Berdasarkan biografi tersebut, beberapa cadangan untuk menagani masalah Islamofobia dikemukakan; terutamanya dari segi penglibatan dan kerjasama umat Islam dalam berinteraksi dengan masyarakat serantau dan antarabangsa untuk kepentingan sejagat.Alternate abstract:A vast number of studies have acknowledged the existence of Islamophobia, but few have attempted to deconstruct the concept. This study deconstructs Islamophobia into its constituent elements: hatred, hostility, and racism against Islam and Muslims. The study seeks to shed light on some methods applied by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in dealing with the roots of hatred, racism, and stereotypes. This can lead members of society to practice different forms of animosity between people based on religion, race, color, etc. In this context, the study confirms the depth of the prophetic biography and its ability to provide the modern world with systematic methods in dealing with its growing problems and challenges. Based on this biography, the study proposes solutions to the matter of Islamophobia, including the need for Muslims to interact with the regional and international societies from a standpoint of collaboration and engagement. This would be for the universal benefit of all societies and humanity in general.

T1  - Nurses’ Knowledge and Attitudes toward Lesbians Seeking Perinatal Care in Israel
AN  - 2466209919
AB  - In recent decades, there has been an increasing tendency among lesbians to realize their desire to become parents. Nurses provide perinatal care to lesbians at women’s healthcare centres from the pregnancy planning stage until childbirth, serving as a source of information, advice and support. However, little is known about nurses’ personal and professional characteristics, including knowledge and attitudes concerning perinatal care of lesbians at women’s health centres. The current study was a cross sectional study that assessed a convenience sample of 184 nurses who provide perinatal care to lesbians at women’s health centres belonging to the two largest health organizations in Israel. The average score received by participants on a homosexuality knowledge questionnaire was 10.4 on a scale of 0–17, indicating moderate levels of factual knowledge about homosexuality. Of all nurses surveyed, 83.2% had negative attitudes with regard to the treatment of lesbians. Nurses’ personal and professional characteristics were found to be associated with these attitudes.

T1  - The Measurement and Structure of Microaggressive Communications by White People Against Black People
AN  - 2655924932
AB  - Previous research on microaggressions has emphasized the frequency of and distress produced by microaggressions as reported by people of color. The current research supplements the existing literature by developing a self-report measure of White individuals’ microaggressive likelihood against Black people, the Cultural Cognitions and Actions Scale (CCAS). Study 1 developed the CCAS through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of responses to CCAS items from a sample of 978 non-Hispanic White undergraduate students. The final scale comprised four factors (Negative Attitudes, Colorblindness, Objectifying, and Avoidance) assessing microaggressive likelihood, and CCAS total and factor scores were significantly related to several other indicators of racism and bias. Study 2 involved 31 of the previous participants in a lab-based discussion of race-related issues with a confederate and provided initial support for the predictive validity of the measure. Overall, this report supports a growing literature that microaggressions are more than innocuous, harmless behaviors, unrelated to racism, and instead represent relevant processes within the science of racism and bias. It also provides a potential means of testing the effectiveness of interventions intended to reduce the commission of microaggressions.

T1  - What Determines End-of-Life Attitudes? Revisiting the Dutch Experience
AN  - 2509630639
AB  - Societal attitudes and behaviours of suicide and euthanasia often cannot be compared leaving policy makers without informative understanding of how social indicators such as social norms, attitudes, behaviours, identity and culture shape the relationships held to socio-demographic indicators of pro end-of-life attitudes. Applying social indicator principals from behavioural economic theory, we assess attitudes to suicide and euthanasia using the Netherlands as a quasi-experiment. We analysed data extracted from the European Values Study (EVS) from 1981 to 2008 in the Netherlands. This timeframe encompasses the Supreme Court ruling: ‘The Right to Die—1984’ and the ‘Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide (Review Procedures) Act of 2002’. Adopting a pooled ordered logit cross-sectional analysis, we assessed indicators of attitude change towards suicide and euthanasia as a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences estimation across socio-demographic indicators through 1981–1990 and 1999–2008. We find through these periods, only employment status and religiosity remain consistent and significant indicators for suicide. Whereas age, employment status, marital status and having a religious denomination remain consistent and significant indicators for euthanasia throughout both periods. Our findings provide a revised socio-demographic indicator model and extend psycho-social indicator factors from behavioural economics to approach research of end-of-life attitudes of suicide and euthanasia.

T1  - Attitudes Toward Separating Immigrant Families at the United States–Mexico Border
AN  - 2472327759
AB  - The primary aims of this project were to estimate levels of agreement or opposition with immigrant family separation at the U.S.–Mexico border and to identify psychological variables that account for variability in attitudes toward immigrant family separation. In Study 1, a sample designed to be representative of Americans in the United States responded to a question about the zero‐tolerance policy that resulted in immigrant family separation. In Study 2, participants in two convenience samples completed online surveys with measures of perceived threat posed by immigrants, dehumanization, social dominance, political ideology, religiosity, and immigrant family separation. Across samples, the majority of respondents opposed separating immigrant families. Conservative political ideology was a consistent correlate of support for immigrant family separation. Dehumanization of immigrants and social dominance orientation also accounted for unique variability in support for immigrant family separation. Given the potentially harmful effects of extended parent‐child separation caused by the zero‐tolerance policy, it is important to understand the roles of dehumanization, social dominance, and ideology in attitudes toward immigration policies. Predictors of support for restrictive policies could be targets of individual or community‐level interventions designed to reduce immigrant prejudice. Directions for future research and implications for U.S. communities and policies affecting immigrants are discussed.

T1  - Attitudes and beliefs of immigrants regarding HIV and AIDS in Mopani district, South Africa
AN  - 2472285344
AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa faces and is severely affected by many conflicts. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) threaten both the physical and financial well-being of individuals in these struggling countries. This research aims to investigate the immigrants’ attitudes and beliefs regarding HIV/AIDS in the Mopani district, Limpopo Province. Qualitative and quantitative designs were used, and 200 immigrants were sampled. Data was collected using a questionnaire with closed and open-ended questions. Ethical standards were maintained. The study revealed that many respondents expressed discriminatory practices towards individuals infected by HIV. Many viewed promiscuity and the disease called Makhume (meaning illness caused by the omission of purification rites following the death of a family member) as causes of HIV/AIDS. These attitudes could hinder the achievement of healthy lives and the promotion of well-being at all ages if not addressed appropriately. The collaboration of various departments in the Mopani district is required to change these negative attitudes and beliefs that influence immigrants’ behaviours. Also, the use of audio-visuals and peer teaching is most successful in changing attitudes and beliefs.

T1  - The Effect of Gender Role on Attitudes Towards Inequitable Gender Norms Among Malaysian Men
AN  - 2471558300
AB  - The Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) measure is the most frequently tested gender role instrument and one of the most investigated psychometric constructs in general. However, its application to the Malaysian setting as well as its relation to gender equality attitudes is rarely explored. Therefore, this research guided by the social constructionist perspective aims to examine the relationship between gender role (masculinity and femininity) and attitudes towards inequitable gender norms. A sample of 168 Malaysian men completed the two measures of Gender Equitable Men scale and the BSRI. Results showed that there was a significant relationship between gender role and attitudes towards inequitable gender norms. In contrast to the femininity gender role, masculinity gender role in men contributes to gender inequality attitudes. The findings in this study are largely supporting the theory that masculinity may be a key construct in the men’s negative attitudes about gender equality, which has been shown to be an important predictor of achieving women’s right and empowerment. In this article, we highlight the importance of socialization processes in context and consider how the social construction of gender affects attitudes about sexuality, reproductive health, gender roles and violence against women.

T1  - The Effect of Affect: Friendship, Education and Prejudice in India
AN  - 2468581251
AB  - Intergroup relations are fundamentally based on the idea of ‘us’ and ‘them’, and this categorization has driven political loyalties and social ties in India, particularly the relations between Hindus and Muslims. Contemporary nationalist politics have often combined patriotic love for the country along with suspicion of minorities, particularly the Muslims. Given the history of tense relations between the Hindus and Muslims, the role of positive intergroup relations becomes paramount in sustaining peace among the groups. Based on Allport’s intergroup contact hypothesis, this article tests whether having a Muslim friend reduces prejudicial attitude among Hindus. Additionally, the article also tests the notion of education being a harbinger of liberal values and its role in reducing prejudice. The results indicate that having a Muslim friend is significantly correlated with a more positive outlook towards the Muslim community, but education does not reduce prejudice.

T1  - The romantic imperative: discourses of romance and heterosexual marriage
AN  - 2465703031
AB  - The contact hypothesis predicts that positive contact will reform attitudes towards the out-group and lead to less prejudice as a result. In contexts facing ongoing gender inequality – such as South Africa – romance is usually seen as a beneficial point of contact between unequal groups (heterosexual men and women), because of the sense of intimacy it brings. We investigated romantic practices in a discursive-ethnographic study, by recruiting five young, westernised, middleclass South African couples and interviewing them a number of times about romance and their relationships. We found that these couples positioned being-romantic extremely positively, as a means of sustaining intimacy in marriage. However, we also found that they positioned one version of romance as something they needed to engage in, in order to do relationship-work. We have called this the romantic imperative and suggested that it appears to channel these couples into being romantic in a particular way; one which is restrictive in the way it may be performed and which carries a high cost in terms of the effort, time and financial resources required to perform it successfully. This links to critiques of the contact hypothesis, in that positive contact does not always equate to positive outcomes.

T1  - Rejecting Muslim or Christian religious practices in five West European countries: a case of discriminatory rejection?
AN  - 2452377642
AB  - Rejection of Muslim religious practices in West European societies is typically explained by prejudicial feelings towards Muslims as a group. However, although people can oppose Muslim religious practices because they feel negatively towards Muslims as a group, they might also have more general reasons for doing so. By simultaneously considering multiple religious acts (wearing religious symbols and following religious education in public schools) and multiple religious actors (Muslims and Christians), we theoretically differentiate between individuals who apply a double-standard by rejecting Muslim but not Christian religious practices (discriminatory rejection) and those who reject practices independently of the religious group engaged in them (equal rejection). Among majority members in five West European countries, the findings support the existence of equal rejection next to discriminatory rejection with both patterns of responses having different associations with people's prejudices towards Muslim, their endorsement of civil liberties and secular values, and their religious affiliation.

T1  - Humility and Bridging Differences: A Systematic Literature Review of Humility in Relation to Diversity
AN  - 2499393062
AB  - Psychologists' interest in humility has increased in recent years. This paper provides the first review on the role of humility in the context of diversity. The results of the nine studies reviewed here, which were identified through a systematic literature search, show a lack of agreement among researchers on the conceptualisation of humility and how it can be measured. Additionally, humility has been found to be associated with less prejudice towards Syrian refuges, sexual minorities and religious groups. It also seems to play a positive role in the context of religious conflicts, disagreements and conflicting views. These promising findings on humility in relation to various domains of diversity are discussed, and the limitations of this review and recommendations for future research are provided.

T1  - The short or long end of the stick? Mothers’ social position and self‐employment status from a comparative perspective
AN  - 2464333438
AB  - Women with dependent children have repeatedly been shown to be more likely to be self‐employed than other women. The mumpreneurship thesis explains this motherhood effect as a preference‐based strategy to meet both good worker and good mother norms. The disadvantaged worker thesis argues that mothers in weak labour market positions are pushed into self‐employment because of work–family conflict. Exploring patterns of motherhood effects across 23 high‐ and middle‐income countries, I argue that the mumpreneurship and disadvantaged worker theses should not be considered as conflicting hypotheses, but rather as addressing separate social position groups. I identify four clusters of countries where either one, both or neither of the two hypotheses can be confirmed. Country‐level analyses indicate that more negative attitudes towards housewives are associated with larger motherhood premiums for women in high social positions, whereas higher enrolment and smaller classes in pre‐primary education increase the motherhood premium for all groups.

T1  - Hate Crimes Against Trans People: Assessing Emotions, Behaviors, and Attitudes Toward Criminal Justice Agencies
AN  - 2435507165
AB  - Based on a survey of 593 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in the United Kingdom, this study shows that direct anti-LGBT hate crimes (measured by direct experiences of victimization) and indirect anti-LGBT hate crimes (measured by personally knowing other victims of hate crime) are highly prolific and frequent experiences for LGBT people. Our findings show that trans people are particularly susceptible to hate crimes, both in terms of prevalence and frequency. This article additionally highlights the negative emotional and (intended) behavioral reactions that were correlated with an imagined hate crime scenario, showing that trans people are more likely to experience heightened levels of threat, vulnerability, and anxiety compared with non-trans LGB people. The study found that trans people are also more likely to feel unsupported by family, friends, and society for being LGBT, which was correlated with the frequency of direct (verbal) abuse they had previously endured. The final part of this study explores trans people’s confidence levels in the Government, the police, and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in relation to addressing hate crime. In general, trans people felt that the police are not effective at policing anti-LGBT hate crime, and they are not respectful toward them as victims; this was especially true where individuals had previous contact with the police. Respondents were also less confident in the CPS to prosecute anti-LGBT hate crimes, though the level of confidence was slightly higher when respondents had direct experience with the CPS. The empirical evidence presented here supports the assertion that all LGBT people, but particularly trans individuals, continue to be denied equal participation in society due to individual, social, and structural experiences of prejudice. The article concludes by arguing for a renewed policy focus that must address this issue as a public health problem.

T1  - Implementing Evidence-Based Practice in a Dutch Social Work Organisation: A Shared Responsibility
AN  - 2476185022
AB  - This article presents the findings from a case study, exploring the factors that support and impede implementation of evidence-based practice (EBP) in a Dutch social work organisation that has recently committed to EBP. Qualitative data were gathered from semi-structured interviews with ten staff members and twelve social workers (service providers for adults and families). The organisational model for EBP implementation, recently developed by Plath, was used to examine how EBP was implemented and the factors that support and impede it. Findings revealed that EBP occurs predominantly at the organisational level. Research & Development (R&D) staff take responsibility for the key steps of gathering, appraising and translating research insights into practice activities, whilst social workers are primarily involved in implementing interventions. R&D is also involved in the internal evaluation of interventions in order to support ongoing practice development. Several factors affecting EBP implementation and facilitative strategies have been identified. Most of these are congruent with the organisational model for EBP implementation, with the exception of two impacting factors (negative attitudes about EBP and an organisational culture that values and encourages innovation and learning) and one facilitative strategy (research partnerships). These findings were used to develop the model further.

T1  - Prejudice, friendship and the abuse of disabled people: an exploration into the concept of exploitative familiarity (‘mate crime’)
AN  - 2451348307
AB  - Exploitative familiarity (‘mate crime’) is a recently-identified phenomenon. Available evidence suggests that exploitative familiarity has a significant impact on the lives of some disabled people, not only in terms of the breadth of offences committed using this form of insidious exploitation but also because of the potential grave consequences. Often, isolated disabled people are victimised in their homes by locals who may use the effects of victims’ impairments to manipulate and betray purported friendships. Exploitation can continue unchecked, particularly where there is lack of institutional involvement. Based on a case study of police records and drawing upon the fields of hate crime and disability studies, this article provides an explanation of how and why exploitative familiarity occurs. The evidence appears to suggest that oppression and stigmatisation of disabled people lead to relational disadvantages such as poverty and isolation. However, it is the ‘individual vulnerability’ of victims which directly influences targeting.

T1  - Outgroup morality perceptions mediate secondary transfer effects from direct and extended contact: Evidence from majority and minority group members: GPIR
AN  - 2451091727
AB  - The secondary transfer effect (STE), defined as contact with a primary outgroup improving attitudes towards a secondary outgroup uninvolved in contact, has mainly been studied with reference to direct contact and considering attitude generalization as the main mediating mechanism. Using a majority (422 Italians) and minority (130 immigrants) adolescent sample from high schools in Italy, we examined outgroup morality perceptions as a new mediating mechanism, and tested for the first time whether the STE emerges for extended contact. Results revealed that the STE emerged for direct contact among the majority group and for extended contact among the minority group, and it was sequentially mediated by perceptions of morality towards the primary outgroup, and by attitudes towards the primary outgroup and perceptions of morality towards the secondary outgroup. The STE also emerged for direct contact among the minority group, with morality perceptions towards the secondary outgroup and attitudes towards the primary outgroup being parallel mediators. We discuss the theoretical implications of the findings, arguing that it is important to identify the conditions and underlying processes of the STE in order to reduce prejudice in the case of both majority and minority groups.

T1  - How Can the Arts Influence the Attitudes of Dementia Caregivers? A Mixed-Methods Longitudinal Investigation
AN  - 2451553525
AB  - Background and Objectives Arts activities can improve social connectedness and foster reciprocity between people living with dementia and their caregivers. The extent to which the arts can help shape attitudes towards dementia remains unclear. This paper explores the impact of a 12-week visual arts program "Dementia and Imagination" on the attitudes of family and professional caregivers through a mixed-methods longitudinal investigation, underpinned by a conceptual framework of the arts in dementia care. Research Design and Methods One hundred and forty-six family and professional caregivers were recruited across three settings in England and Wales (residential care homes, a county hospital, and community venues). Quantitative and qualitative data on caregivers' attitudes and perceptions of the impact of the arts program were collected through interviews at three time points. Results Thematic analysis identified four themes shared across the caregivers: (1) Recognizing capabilities, (2) Social connectedness, (3) Improvements to well-being, and (4) Equality and personhood. Two further themes were distinct to family caregivers: (5) Duration of the effects of the art program, and (6) Enriched perspective. The final theme Inspiring professional development was distinct to the professional caregivers. The quantitative analysis found no effect for caregivers' attitude change over time. Family caregivers scored significantly lower than professional caregivers at each of the three time points. Discussion and Implications Art programs have the potential to make visible the capabilities of the people living with dementia, enabling caregivers to see the person behind the condition. This study highlights practice implications for future implementation, such as the role of the arts in dementia care education.

T1  - Male rape in context: measures of intolerance and support for male rape myths (MRMs)
AN  - 2439261944
AB  - Research on myths about male rape victims and offenders indicates that men and heterosexual individuals tend to believe myths about male rape (MRMs), as do individuals with negative attitudes toward gay men. Many who support male rape myths assume that both male victims of rape and offenders are usually gay, or that straight men cannot be raped. Studies on MRM have portrayed male rape in an ‘everyday life’ context, but myths about male rape are likely shaped by its portrayal in film, television and popular culture. For example, respondents may attribute more blame to victims who are incarcerated as opposed to a victim raped by a stranger near their home. In this study, we assess support for myths about male rape victims and whether the context of the situation and various indicators of intolerance play a role in their beliefs. Specifically, we present four fictional scenarios of male rape to respondents: prison, in the military, during a conflict situation, and on a college campus. We find that respondents are less likely to support MRMs in the context of the military, and that race and gender also explain support for MRMs. Measures of intolerance are positively related to support for MRMs, with sexism having the strongest relationship with support.

T1  - Neighbourhood-scale public spaces, inter-group attitudes and migrant integration in Beijing, China
AN  - 2434432745
AB  - Cities worldwide face the challenge of persistent social polarisation that is exacerbated by the mass migration of populations. Scholars have debated whether the planning of public spaces, which presumably fosters inter-group encounter, potentially reduces prejudice against minorities such as migrants, and eventually promotes social inclusiveness. This research uses a large-scale questionnaire survey conducted in 36 neighbourhoods (estates) in Beijing, China, combined with field observations and interviews, to investigate whether the presence, perception and use of neighbourhood-scale spaces of encounter are relevant in predicting residents’ attitudes towards migrant social inclusion, particularly with respect to equal access to citizenship and government welfare. Qualitative and quantitative analyses found that residents’ inclusiveness attitude is less associated with the physical presence of public spaces and facilities in the neighbourhood, and more with actually using such spaces for neighbourly encounters in daily life. The findings echo recent critiques of the romanticised view of public spaces for urban encounters, and suggest that neighbourhood planning of public spaces should incorporate elements from social projects that facilitate meaningful interaction between native and migrant residents to achieve the goal of building an inclusive city.

T1  - Party affiliation and support for Muslim newcomers: masked opposition in the Norwegian context
AN  - 2427338778
AB  - This work considers how anti-immigrant sentiment is selectively revealed, offering a new perspective on the role stigma plays in defining the political mainstream. By way of a survey experiment in Norway, we measure the gap between what people express and the beliefs they hold anonymously, assessing how supporters of distinct political parties situationally conform to expectations about the expression of intolerance. Using three frames, we contrast attitudes toward immigrants, refugees and more general types of new entrants to Norway. We conclude that the intolerance is more widespread than openly expressed sentiment would suggest due to the systematic masking of targeted opposition to Muslim newcomers. Covert expression, under conditions of absolute and permanent anonymity, demonstrate hardened sentiment among the mainstream right. In other words, a large shift in covert attitudes is best understood as a shift in deference to norms about the expression of targeted bias – in this case toward Muslim newcomers – rather than a large change in underlying, anonymously expressed attitudes.

T1  - You don’t want kids?!: Exploring evaluations of those without children
AN  - 2416185929
AB  - We examined perceptions of those without children in a pre-registered study. Women who made a conscious decision not to have children (i.e., childfree) and women without children for unknown reasons were evaluated more negatively than mothers and those unable to have children (i.e., childless). Few differences were observed in evaluations of male targets as a function of parental status. Although we expected gender differences whereby childfree women would be evaluated more negatively than childfree men, this was not observed. Evaluations also did not vary as a function of perceiver gender. Those higher in social dominance orientation had more negative evaluations of childfree and childless women operating through ascription to traditional gender roles. The same pattern existed for male targets but was no longer supported when statistically controlling for singlism.

T1  - Towards an Integration of Models of Discrimination of Immigrants: from Ultimate (Functional) to Proximate (Sociofunctional) Explanations
AN  - 2229809169
AB  - We integrated models of discrimination of immigrants by combining established approaches to prejudice and discrimination towards immigrants (proximate explanations) using assumptions of Evolutionary-Coalitional Theory (ultimate explanations). Based on this perspective, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and multicultural ideology (MCI) were considered as sociofunctional motives for attitudes towards immigrants. We examined relationships between individual differences in beliefs about the social world (dangerous worldview and competitive worldview) as more distal antecedents, and RWA, SDO, and MCI as more proximal antecedents, and the endorsement of discrimination of immigrants in the socioeconomic domain by Russian majority group members as the outcome. Data were collected among 576 participants from 33 regions in Russia, using online social media. MCI predicted endorsement of discrimination of immigrants by Russian majority group members better than did RWA and SDO. SDO predicted only economic aspects of the endorsement of discrimination. The results are discussed within the Russian context, with its ethnically diverse composition of the population and high migration rates.

T1  - Straight, LGB, Married, Living in Sin, Children Out of Wedlock: A Comparison of Attitudes Towards ‘Different’ Family Structures
AN  - 2362743078
AB  - Australia is one of the last Western countries to legalize marriage between same-sex couples. Research suggests that the delay in marriage equality may be a consequence of societies’ conceptual connection between marriage and family being an ultimately heterosexual experience. The aim of this study was to investigate attitudes toward same-sex parenting within the marriage equality debate. Members of an Australian sample (n = 436) were randomly allocated to 1 of 9 conditions, where they received a vignette of either a heterosexual couple, a male same-sex couple, or female same-sex couple in 1 of 3 family structures (marriage/no children; marriage/children; no marriage/children). Participants rated their level of acceptance toward their allocated vignette, deciding whether the couple deserved the same rights as anyone else. Results demonstrated a significant division between acceptance of same-sex couples and heterosexual couples getting married and having children, with more negative attitudes toward same-sex couples present. Findings also highlighted a prejudice toward couples having children out of wedlock, regardless of sexual orientation of the couple. The implication for marriage equality advocates is challenging society attitudes toward marriage and family, by educating the community about same-sex parenting as well as parenting beyond marriage.

T1  - Bias Awareness Predicts Color Conscious Racial Socialization Methods among White Parents
AN  - 2325243592
AB  - The majority of White parents in the United States are uncomfortable discussing race with their children and tend to avoid it. When they do discuss race with their children, they often take a color blind approach—in which they emphasize a belief that race does not matter—instead of a color conscious approach—in which they acknowledge race‐related issues. In the current study, we sought to explore the individual difference factors that may be associated with White American parents’ racial socialization practices. Results indicated that parents’ racial bias awareness was associated with greater willingness to discuss race with their children, increased color consciousness, and decreased color blindness; when statistically controlling for their racial attitudes, motivations to respond without prejudice, and interracial contact. The potential impacts of bias awareness interventions on White parents’ racial socialization behaviors are discussed.

T1  - Immigrant Children, Educational Performance and Public Policy: a Capability Approach
AN  - 2125116425
AB  - This article reports on the relationship between the educational performance of second-generation students, the attitude of majority society towards immigrants and integration policy in the destination country. It argues that the educational underperformance of second-generation students is to some extent a product of an inequality in different students’ abilities to materialise educational opportunities provided by the destination country’s education system. This inequality in abilities is generated by the human diversity of the different groups: immigrants vs. non-immigrants; voluntary immigrants vs. refugees. Depending on the integration context, the human diversity may exacerbate the inequality and cause the performance gap to get wider. The article uses data from two qualitative studies with the Somali community in Finland and employs the capability approach. Due to their background as the children of refugees from Somalia and the attitude of people in mainstream society, Finnish-Somali students face more challenges in materialising educational opportunities. The Finnish context in which they find themselves puts these students in a less encouraging position for two reasons. First, prejudice and discrimination may weaken their will and confidence to learn and reduces their parents’ will to cooperate with their schools. Second, their parents—due to their lack of knowledge of the school system and proficiency in the Finnish language—are also relatively less effective in the Finnish schooling system. To deal with the performance gap between immigrant and native children in schooling, public policy should focus on how the integration context is shaping diverse students’ abilities (capability sets) to succeed.

T1  - Community-level prejudice and mortality among immigrant groups
AN  - 2070444352
AB  - This study assesses whether anti-immigrant prejudice at the community level is prospectively associated with mortality. We used 10 waves of data from the General Social Survey (GSS) that were linked to mortality data via the National Death Index (NDI) for the period between 1993 and 2014 (n = 13,242). The 2014 GSS-NDI dataset is a nationally representative sample reporting social characteristics and attitudes in the United States that was prospectively linked to mortality data. Community-level prejudice was measured with 5 questions regarding anti-immigrant sentiments across 123 communities, defined using primary sampling units. Cox proportional hazards models tested the association between anti-immigrant prejudice and mortality hazard, controlling for covariates at the individual and community levels. Findings showed that among “other race” respondents, those born in the US had higher risk of mortality in communities with greater anti-immigrant prejudice, whereas foreign-born “other race” respondents had lower risk of mortality in communities with greater anti-immigrant prejudice. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the “other race” category was comprised largely of Asians and Hispanics, and that these results were similar for both groups. In contrast, anti-immigrant prejudice was not associated with mortality for foreign-born immigrants who self-report as white or black. We provide various hypotheses for why US-born immigrant groups seem to suffer higher mortality risk, while foreign-born immigrant groups do not, when they live in communities with high levels of prejudice.

T1  - Examining the role of positive and negative intergroup contact and anti‐immigrant prejudice in Brexit
AN  - 2008939843
AB  - This study examined the interplay of anti‐immigrant prejudice and intergroup contact experience on voting intentions within Britain's 2016 referendum on its membership in the European Union. In the days before the referendum, we asked more than 400 British people how they planned to vote. We measured a number of demographic factors expected to predict voting intentions as well as individuals’ prejudice towards and intergroup contact experience (positive and negative) with EU immigrants. Anti‐immigrant prejudice was a strong correlate of support for Brexit. Negative intergroup contact experience was associated with higher anti‐immigrant prejudice and, in turn, increased support for ‘Leave’. Positive intergroup contact, on the other hand, seemed to play a reparative role, predicting lower prejudice and increasing support for ‘Remain’.

T1  - On implicit racial prejudice against infants: GPIR
AN  - 1943423269
AB  - Because of the innocence and dependence of children, it would be reassuring to believe that implicit racial prejudice against out-group children is lower than implicit prejudice against out-group adults. Yet, prior research has not directly tested whether or not adults exhibit less spontaneous prejudice toward child targets than adult targets. Three studies addressed this issue, contrasting adults with very young child targets. Studies 1A and B revealed that participants belonging to an ethnic majority group (White Europeans) showed greater spontaneous favorability toward their ethnic in-group than toward an ethnic out-group (South Asians), and this prejudice emerged equally for infant and adult targets. Study 2 found that this pattern occurred even when race was not a salient dimension of categorization in the implicit measure. Thus, there was a robust preference for in-group children over out-group children, and there was no evidence that this prejudice is weaker than that exhibited toward adults.

T1  - Adolescents' Legal Socialization: Effects of Interrogation and Miranda Knowledge on Legitimacy, Cynicism, and Procedural Justice
AN  - 1932222194
AB  - This study examined how detained youths' (N = 98) actual experiences with the law, including frequency of contact with the police and knowledge about the Miranda warning and interrogation practices, relate to their perceptions of support, fairness, and trust toward the police. Results show that more police contacts were associated with lower perceived obligation to obey the law and higher cynicism toward the law and also moderated the relationships between age and police legitimacy and race/ethnicity and police legitimacy and procedural justice. Comprehension of the Miranda warning was associated with lower perceived obligation to obey the law and procedural justice, and knowledge about police interrogation practices was associated with lower perceived police legitimacy. These findings suggest the potential of legal socialization as a mechanism for intervention among offending adolescents; programs that promote positive youth-police interactions may help minimize negative attitudes and foster perceptions of trust and fairness toward the police.

T1  - Gender differences among Czech youth in prejudice towards minorities
AN  - 1886293218
AB  - Using a large survey of Czech high school students (n = 1103), aged 15-20 years, this paper explores youth prejudice to a wide range of minority groups (n = 21) where family, school, and community contexts are taken into account. General Structural Equation Models are used to explore the determinants of prejudice for 21 minorities using a comparative explanatory framework where the focus is gender differences in prejudice to minorities are examined using three social theories: Social Dominance Theory (SDT), the Theory of Gendered Prejudice (TGP), and Gender Role Beliefs (GRB). This research shows that gender plays a strong role in expressing prejudiced attitudes where females express (a) less prejudiced attitudes toward the Roma, black Africans, Gays and those with mental or physical disabilities, and (b) more prejudiced attitudes towards the homeless, Vietnamese, Muslims, and lesbians. This gendered pattern is explained in terms of insights from SDT, TGP, and GRB.

T1  - County-level racial prejudice and the black-white gap in infant health outcomes
AN  - 1914203497
AB  - Objective: Black mothers are 60 percent more likely than white mothers to have preterm births and twice as likely to have a baby with low birth weight. We examine whether these black-white gaps in birth outcomes are larger in counties with higher levels of racial prejudice. Method: We use data from the restricted-use natality files in the United States, which provide information on birth weight, gestation, and maternal characteristics for over 31 million births from 2002 to 2012, combined with county-level data measures of both explicit and implicit racial prejudice from Project Implicit from over a million individuals who took the Implicit Association Test during this same period. We compare counties that are one standard deviation above the mean (high prejudice) with those that are one standard deviation below the mean (low prejudice) in terms of their average level of racial prejudice. Results: The black-white gap in low birth weight is 14 percent larger in counties with high implicit racial prejudice compared to counties with low prejudice. The black-white gap in preterm births is 29 percent larger in the high prejudice counties. The gaps are even larger when we use explicit measures of racial prejudice with high prejudice counties having a black-white gap that is 22 percent larger for low birth weight and 36 percent larger for preterm births. These relationships do not appear to be biased by the way the prejudice sample is constructed, since the racial gap in birth outcomes is unrelated to other county-level biases such as those based on gender or sexual orientation. Conclusion: The black-white gap in United States' birth outcomes is larger in those counties that have the highest levels of racial prejudice. This is true for both implicit and explicit racial prejudice, though the strength of the relationship is strongest for explicit racial prejudice.

T1  - Can Caring Create Prejudice? An Investigation of Positive and Negative Intergenerational Contact in Care Settings and the Generalisation of Blatant and Subtle Age Prejudice to Other Older People
AN  - 1855255674
AB  - Caring is a positive social act, but can it result in negative attitudes towards those cared for, and towards others from their wider social group? Based on intergroup contact theory, we tested whether care workers' (CWs) positive and negative contact with old-age care home residents (CHRs) predicts prejudiced attitudes towards that group, and whether this generalises to other older people. Fifty-six CWs were surveyed about their positive and negative contact with CHRs and their blatant and subtle attitudes (humanness attributions) towards CHRs and older adults. We tested indirect paths from contact with CHRs to attitudes towards older adults via attitudes towards CHRs. Results showed that neither positive nor negative contact generalised blatant ageism. However, the effect of negative, but not positive, contact on the denial of humanness to CHRs generalised to subtle ageism towards older adults. This evidence has practical implications for management of CWs' work experiences and theoretical implications, suggesting that negative contact with a subgroup generalises the attribution of humanness to superordinate groups. Because it is difficult to identify and challenge subtle prejudices such as dehumanisation, it may be especially important to reduce negative contact. © 2016 The Authors.

T1  - A Comparison of Adolescents in Foster Care and Their Peers in High School: A Study of Substance Use Behaviors and Attitudes
AN  - 1829513558
AB  - While adolescents in foster care are known to be more at risk for substance abuse, existing studies have significant limitations in their methodology, making it challenging to gauge the extent of current use of drugs, tobacco, and alcohol compared with their same-age peers not in care. This article examined data collected from adolescents currently in foster care alongside their same-aged peers within the same high schools in California, in order to learn more about existing rates of and attitudes toward substance use. California is the most populous state in the country with the highest number of children in foster care. Data were drawn from 166,521 students who were both in and out of foster care and were currently in the ninth and eleventh grades; this sample was comprised of 165,815 non-foster youths and 706 students in foster care. The adolescents completed the 2012-2013 administration of the California Health Kids Survey (CHKS). This study provides a clearer picture of current substance usage, finding that California adolescents in care are more likely to use substances than their same-aged peers, even after controlling for their demographic background characteristics. It was also found that attitudes regarding potential harm in using substances (2.29 versus 2.11), difficulty in obtaining substances (3.17 versus 3.24), and negative attitudes toward substance users (1.93 versus 2.18) were stronger for youths in foster care compared to their peers with similar demographic backgrounds who are not in care. Suggestions for interventions are discussed.

T1  - Predicting Portuguese Psychology Students' Attitudes Toward the Psychological Development of Children Adopted by Lesbians and Gay Men
AN  - 1827659554
AB  - The present study seeks to ascertain the attitudes of Portuguese psychology students (future psychologists) toward the development of children adopted by lesbian and gay parents. Each participant (N = 182) read a vignette describing an adoption of a child by lesbian and gay persons. After reading the vignette, participants rated four different aspects of the future development of the adopted child (psychosocial adjustment, victimization, psychological disturbance, and normative sexuality). Furthermore, participants were asked about their gender, interpersonal contact with lesbians and gay men, gender role attitudes, and attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. Future psychologists' attitudes toward the developmental outcomes of children adopted by lesbians and gay men were associated with negative attitudes toward non-heterosexuals, which in turn correlated to interpersonal contact with lesbians and gay men and adherence to gender conservative values. These results clearly highlight the central role of social attitudes and the need for cultural competence training of future psychologists that encourages interpersonal contact with non-heterosexuals and discourages traditional gender roles and negative attitudes toward lesbian and gay men.

T1  - Keeping it in the family: Parental influences on young people's attitudes to police
AN  - 1752183164
AB  - Prior research finds young people are less satisfied with police than their older counterparts. Despite this, our understanding of youth attitudes to police is limited, as most research has focused on adult attitudes to police. This study adds to our understanding by examining the influence of parent-child dynamics on youth attitudes to police. We predict that youth attitudes to police will be influenced by their parents' attitudes. A survey of 540 school students in South East Queensland reveals that perceived parental attitudes to police are associated with youth attitudes to police. However, this effect is partially mediated by maternal, but not paternal attachment. These findings suggest that youth attitudes to police are not simply influenced by contact with police and delinquency, but that familial context is important. Consequently, our theoretical understanding of youth attitudes to police must move beyond a focus upon police contact and delinquency. [web URL: http://jos.sagepub.com/content/51/4/917.abstract]

T1  - Friendships Fighting Prejudice: A Longitudinal Perspective on Adolescents' Cross-Group Friendships with Immigrants
AN  - 1679664501
AB  - Increasingly, adolescents are growing up in multiethnic multicultural societies. While intergroup prejudice can threaten the multicultural societal cohesion, intergroup friendships are strong predictors of reduced prejudice. Thus, more research is needed to fully understand the development of intergroup friendships and their relations to less prejudicial attitudes. This study addressed two major developmental research questions: first, whether longitudinal patterns of intergroup friendships of native adolescents (i.e., whether or not a native German adolescent has a friendship with an immigrant at different points in time) relate to changes in rates of prejudice about immigrants. Second, whether these friendship patterns that unfold over time can be predicted by contact opportunities, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control assessed at the beginning of the study. The sample included 372 native German adolescents (14.7 years of age at first assessment, 62.3 % girls) who showed one of four friendship trajectories over the three annual assessments: they either maintained, gained, never had, or lost a friendship with an outgroup peer. In particular, results showed that adolescents who gained an intergroup friendship over the three time points showed a significant decrease in negative prejudice over the study. All four theorized predictors contributed to explain friendship trajectory membership. Generally, adolescents with many opportunities for contact, positive attitudes about contact, perceived positive social norms for contact, and high levels of behavioral control (self-efficacy) were more likely to maintain a friendship with an outgroup member than to follow any of the three other friendship trajectories (gain, lost, or never had). The pattern of predictions differed, however, depending on the specific pairs of friendship trajectories compared.

T1  - Prejudice-reduction in Culturally Mixed Classrooms: The Development and Assessment of a Theory-driven Intervention Among Majority and Minority Youth in Finland
AN  - 1559006453; 201431839
AB  - The aim of this field experiment was to develop and assess an intervention promoting positive intergroup relations in culturally diverse schools. The intervention was based on extended contact and social learning and utilized behavioural journalism as its method. Intervention effects were assessed on out-group attitudes, perceived importance of future contact, perceived peer norms and intergroup anxiety among ethnic majority (N = 583) and minority (N = 214) youth in grades 7-9 in Finnish secondary schools (total N experimental = 388; total N control = 409). As a result of the intervention, both groups showed a tendency to perceive future intergroup contact as more important, and this effect was most notable for younger participants and girls. Prototypicality of in-group and out-group peer models contributed positively to intervention effects. However, unexpectedly, the intervention also increased experiences of intergroup anxiety among the oldest participants. The results are discussed taking into account the developmental stage of the youth studied. Besides critically assessing the effectiveness of the intervention, recommendations for improving theory-driven prejudice-reduction and for the development of future interventions in culturally diverse contexts are given.

T1  - The Role of Perceived Peer Prejudice and Teacher Discrimination on Adolescent Substance Use: A Social Determinants Approach
AN  - 1504423407; 201407585
AB  - Although Black adolescents have reported a lower prevalence of substance use relative to non-Hispanic Whites, Black youth are disproportionately affected by adverse social outcomes. Social scientists have highlighted that using a framework that includes perceived peer prejudice and teacher discrimination as social determinants of adolescent risk behaviors is essential to fully understanding substance use behaviors in adolescents. However, this area of research remains underdeveloped. This study examined whether and to what extent perceived peer prejudice and teacher discrimination affect binge drinking and marijuana use by Black (n = 514) and non-Hispanic White (n = 2,818) adolescents using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, Wave 2, Public Use dataset. Findings suggest that peer prejudice increased the risk of substance use in non-Hispanic White youth only, whereas experiences of teacher discrimination increased the risk of substance use in both Black and non-Hispanic White youth. The study's limitations are noted, and implications for future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnicity, Gender Socialization, and Children's Attitudes Toward Gay Men and Lesbian Women
AN  - 1115694151
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess whether children's attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women differ in relation to their ethnic backgrounds and whether ethnic differences are a result of perceived differential gender socialization practices. Data were collected from children in eight Dutch elementary schools by means of a paper-and-pencil questionnaire administered in the classroom. All children (mean age 11.47; N = 229) lived in the Netherlands; 50.2% had non-Western and 49.8% Western ethnic backgrounds. Children with non-Western ethnic backgrounds reported more negative attitudes toward gays and lesbians. These children perceived more parental pressure to behave in accordance with their gender and showed more negative attitudes toward gender-nonconforming behavior by peers. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that cultural differences in attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women are partly mediated by differentially perceived parental pressure to behave in accordance with their gender.

T1  - School Belonging and School Misconduct: The Differing Role of Teacher and Peer Attachment
AN  - 927125444; 21567214
AB  - The schools-as-communities perspective provides a popular explanation for school-disruptive behavior, stating that interpersonal bonding at school and feelings of school belonging prevent misconduct. In this article, we build on this perspective in three ways. First, we test whether the preventive influence of school belonging acts at the individual or school level. Secondly, we test whether a distinction should be made between the different actors with whom students bond at school, by assessing whether perceived teacher support, school belonging, and peer attachment relate differently to school misconduct. Lastly, the present study investigates whether the associations of bonding with teachers, peers and the school with school misconduct differ by socio-ethnic school context. Multilevel analyses were performed on data from the Flemish Educational Assessment. The sample consisted of 11,872 students (51.4% female) in 85 schools, most of whom were natives (88.8%), with immigrants (11.2%) mostly having Turkish or Moroccan backgrounds (both about 30% of immigrants in the sample), and others Southern-European (16%), Eastern-European (8%), North-African (5%), or other (17%) backgrounds. Results showed that the students' individual feelings of bonding with peers, teachers and school associate with school misconduct, rather than the overall school cohesion. Results further showed that, while higher perceived teacher support and school belonging related to less school misconduct, higher peer attachment was associated with higher rates of school misconduct. No differences were found by socio-ethnic context. Implications are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Discrimination and Mexican-Origin Adolescents' Adjustment: The Moderating Roles of Adolescents', Mothers', and Fathers' Cultural Orientations and Values
AN  - 847003500; 19882238
AB  - Drawing on García Coll et al.'s integrative framework and the risk and resilience model, this study examined the relationships between adolescents' perceived discrimination and psychosocial adjustment and the moderating roles of adolescents', mothers', and fathers' cultural orientations and values, and adolescent gender in a sample of 246 Mexican-origin families. Using multilevel modeling with data from mothers, fathers, seventh graders (M^sub age^ = 12.8 years; SD = .57 year) and older siblings (M^sub age^ = 15.7 years; SD = 1.5 years), findings revealed that perceived discrimination was positively related to depression, risky behaviors, and deviant peer affiliations. In addition, parents' cultural orientations and values and adolescent gender moderated the relationships between perceived discrimination and some indicators of adjustment. These findings suggest that parents' cultural orientations and values can serve as protective and vulnerability factors in the associations between Mexican-origin adolescents' perceived discrimination and their psychosocial adjustment.

T1  - Do the ideological beliefs of peers predict the prejudiced attitudes of other individuals in the group?
AN  - 754039410; 201049576
AB  - The authors used multilevel modeling to examine whether peer group ideological beliefs (n = 109 friendship groups) predicted the homophobic and racist attitudes of other individuals within the group (n = 395 college students). Results indicated that the social dominance orientation (SDO), right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), and universal-diverse orientation (UDO) ideological beliefs of peers predicted the prejudiced attitudes of other group members, over and above individuals' own ideological views. Additionally, the strength with which individuals' own ideological beliefs predicted their prejudiced attitudes varied systematically across peer groups. Affiliations with high-RWA peers strengthened the extent to which individuals' own SDO and RWA predicted their prejudiced attitudes. Results suggest the ideological beliefs of peers are relevant to predicting the prejudiced attitudes of the individuals with whom they affiliate. Although specific peer ideologies differentially predicted forms of prejudice, the overall contribution of these peer ideology beliefs to the prediction of individuals' prejudiced attitudes was comparable for both homophobic and racist attitudes. Attention to proximal social networks and the social dynamics within these networks can contribute to better explanations of individual differences in prejudiced attitudes.

T1  - Culturally Distinctive and Academic Socialization: Direct and Interactive Relationships with African American Adolescents' Academic Adjustment
AN  - 204636738; 20084565
AB  - Theories of ethnic minority development have largely suggested that African American parents engage in a combination of practices that include culturally distinctive socialization as well as behaviors that are characteristic of more universal forms of academic socialization. However, few studies have examined how these socialization dimensions interact to influence the academic adjustment of African American adolescents. The current study explored the independent and interactive roles of parental academic and culturally distinctive socialization on the academic adjustment of African American adolescents. The sample was comprised 144 African American adolescents (M = 12.4; SD = 1.14; 56% female). Findings provided partial support that cultural and academic socialization were independently associated with indicators of academic adjustment. However, the interaction between these dimensions also was associated with youths' adjustment in the academic domain. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]
