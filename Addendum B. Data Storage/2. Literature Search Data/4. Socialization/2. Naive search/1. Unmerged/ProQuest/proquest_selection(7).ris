T1  - What children want to know about in‐ and out‐groups, and how knowledge affects their intergroup attitudes
AN  - 2388834772
AB  - One of the key factors contributing to the development of negative attitudes toward out‐groups is lack of knowledge about them. The present study investigated what type of information 3‐ to 4‐ and 5‐ to 6‐ year‐old Jewish Israeli children (N = 82) are interested in acquiring about unfamiliar in‐ and out‐group individuals, and how providing children with the requested information affects their intergroup attitudes. Children were shown pictures of individuals from three groups—an in‐group (“Jews”), a “conflict” out‐group (“Arabs”), and a “neutral” out‐group (“Scots”)—and were asked what they would like to know about them. The experimenter responded by either answering all of children's questions, half of the questions, or none. Children's attitudes toward the groups were also assessed. It was found that children asked the most questions in regard to conflict out‐group individuals. Moreover, the older age group asked more questions regarding the psychological characteristics, and fewer questions regarding the social identity, of the conflict out‐group than of the other two groups. Finally, full provision of information improved attitudes toward the groups, especially among 3‐ to 4‐year olds, and especially regarding the conflict out‐group. These findings have implications for understanding the sources of intergroup biases, and for developing interventions to reduce them.

T1  - Change in school ethnic diversity and intergroup relations: The transition from segregated elementary to mixed secondary school for majority and minority students
AN  - 2341199309
AB  - This research examined the impact of a change in school diversity on school children's intergroup relations. A longitudinal survey tracked 551 White British and Asian British students (Mage = 11.32) transitioning from elementary (time 1) to secondary (time 2) school in an ethnically segregated town in the United Kingdom. We estimated a multivariate, multilevel model. A cross‐sectional comparison of segregated schools and a mixed elementary school at time 1 revealed that both Asian and White British in the mixed school reported more positive intergroup relations. A longitudinal analysis found that the transition from segregated elementary to mixed secondary schools was associated with Asian British developing more positive intergroup relations. White British reported overall less positive intergroup relations, although only trust decreased; evidence from other measures remains inconclusive. The findings are important for understanding early stages of diversity exposure, and the impact of changing diversity levels on majority and minority groups.

T1  - Chapter 3: Racialized Tensions in the Multimodal Literacies of Black Immigrant Youth
AN  - 2507952098
AB  - Background: The chapter explores the intersection of multimodal and digital literacies and racial identities of Black Caribbean immigrant youth in the United States (U.S.). Drawing on ethnographic research on the ways in which adolescent students embody their identities online, the chapter details some of the tensions that arise when these adolescents attempt to navigate a new home country that racializes their cultural and national identities and literacy practices. Context: The chapter offers a meta-analysis of case studies five Black Caribbean immigrant adolescents' multimodal and digital literacy practices in response to the racialized category "Black." Looking across four ethnographic case studies, and through the thematic meta-analysis of data, the chapter presents data snapshots of pivotal events that reflect issues of race. These events highlight the dialogic ways that these youth make use of literacy practices to understand what it means to be Black and immigrant, and to challenge these dominant, racialized representations that negate their cultural identities. Purpose: The purpose of the chapter is to explore the tensions that arise when these adolescents attempt to navigate a new home country that racializes their cultural and national identities and literacy practices. In the case of Black Caribbean immigrant youth, part of this newcomer experience involves negotiating what "race" and "blackness" mean in terms of their academic, social, and personal lives. Thus, the chapter illustrates how young people use their modally and digitally mediated practices to negotiate racialized positionings across physical and virtual spaces, affinity groups, and the school and social contexts of their adopted U.S. homes. Findings: As Black Caribbean immigrants, these young persons engage in emotional identity work in their talk about and/or experiences of race. The adolescents' emotional response to racialized categories was defined by contesting feelings of pride, shame, and resilience. Two salient themes that characterized these tensions are the conflicting sense of 1) national pride versus the racial prejudice, and 2) deficit versus worthy. Their feelings of self-worth were intrinsically connected to racialized identity labels "Black" and "immigrant." However, the modal tools and spaces they used and created serve as sites of resilience and identity (re)framing. Conclusions: Adolescents developed their own personal and/or public voice that allowed them to reevaluate their self-worth, importance of social status, opportunities for advocacy, and their redefinitions of identity labels. Modal spaces and tools offered these adolescents alternative frames of reference within which they could evaluate and reposition Self. The intentional responses of these Black immigrant youth offered positive ways to see and present themselves while challenging deficit narratives of persons of color. Recommendation: Explore immigrant adolescents' use of modal and digital tools and literacies as spaces for socially reconstructing notions of race and identity. Consider modal and virtual digital spaces and tools (e.g., social networks, blogs, photographs/images, talk/stories) as a way to create opportunities for youth to air and share their experiences and ideas, as well as have their stories and positionalities become a part of the broader educational and societal narrative.

T1  - A Study of Cultural Empathy and Attitude toward Diversity: The Case of Australian Church Attenders
AN  - 2477270660
AB  - Australia's context is one of increasing ethnic and religious diversity. Intercultural communication is an everyday reality, with cultural empathy fostering intercultural competence. Yet ideas about belonging to Australia are complex and contested. This study addresses a paradox within the context of Christian churches. Church attenders have a high sense of belonging to Australia, which has been found in other studies to be negatively related to empathy. Yet, individuals have opportunities for intercultural contact within church settings, which is associated with positive intercultural relations and reduced prejudice. This study examines data from 1,700 participants (aged 15 years and over) in the 2016 National Church Life Survey to test relationships between empathy, attitude to diversity, and belonging to Australia, taking into account congregational ethnic diversity, levels of bonding, and country of birth. Results provide some evidence that culturally diverse congregations provide opportunities to foster cultural empathy. There was also an interaction between country of birth and belonging. Belonging and attitude to diversity were not related amongst attenders born in non-English speaking countries, but were negatively related amongst those born in English-speaking countries, despite opportunity for regular contact with outgroup members. Future work would benefit from improved measures of ethnicity and further understanding of how belonging and identity operates for different groups of Australians. Implications for church leaders are that while intercultural proximity alone may not be sufficient to foster positive attitudes towards diversity, positive interactions among perceived peers with shared goals may be more effective.

T1  - Italian With an Accent: The Case of “Chinese Italian” in Tuscan High Schools
AN  - 2325826576
AB  - Two experiments test the existence of prejudicial attitudes toward nonnative Italian speech (specifically Chinese-accented Italian) within Tuscany’s high schools, among teachers and student samples. The research explores and integrates different methodologies: explicit inquiry (overt questionnaires) as well as implicit tests (Implicit Association Test protocol). The results outlined the existence of significant implicit negative attitudes toward Chinese-accented Italian and established the discrepancy between explicit and implicit attitudes. The discussion focuses on the sociolinguistic implications of these results, with respect to educational aspects and to future directions for research.

T1  - The ethnic prejudice of Flemish pupils: the roles of school gender composition and laddish culture
AN  - 2311526550
AB  - This study examines whether secondary schools' gender composition and levels of laddish attitudes influence the degree of ethnic prejudice among Flemish pupils. We hypothesize that in addition to pupil-level predictors of prejudice, the school's gender composition and its laddish culture play roles in pupils' attitudes toward ethnic minorities. We use multilevel analysis with data obtained in 2014-2015 from 2250 Flemish pupils in 48 secondary schools in Flanders. Both girls' and boys' ethnic prejudice is related to their laddish attitudes. Boys' levels of ethnic prejudice are associated with the gender composition and the laddish culture of their school, while girls' ethnic prejudice is more likely to be influenced by the laddish culture of the school when the proportion of male pupils in the school increases. The findings suggest that in order to reduce ethnic prejudice it might be fruitful to focus on macro-level factors, such as tackling laddish cultures at school.

T1  - Somehow Familiar but Still a Stranger: Syrian Students in Turkish Higher Education
AN  - 2163555099
AB  - The number of Syrian students attending higher education institutions in Turkey in 2016–2017 academic year is nearly 15,000. Mersin is a city in the southern part of Turkey, and the number of registered Syrians in Mersin is around 150,000. With rapid increase in the number of Syrians at education age, research on Syrian youth attending higher education has become significant. Mersin University has the 4th highest number of Syrian students among 182 universities in Turkey. This paper examines individual, environmental, and structural problems experienced by Syrian students attending Mersin University. The paper utilizes the conceptual tools of micro-sociology by analyzing the experiences of both Syrian students and their Turkish classmates. The analysis focuses on whether Syrian students are seen as “strangers” or not, both from their own experiences and from those of Turkish students interacting with them. In this context, in-depth interviews are conducted with 15 Syrian and 8 Turkish students. The narratives of Syrian and Turkish students are analyzed via the themes of avoidance of contact, spatial discrimination, interacting with the unknown, and prejudice. Findings reveal that both groups of students keep a distance from each other; they prefer to be spatially separate at campus and at classrooms. Moreover, Syrian students state that they could communicate more easily if they overcome the problems with their use of Turkish language. The last but not the least, Syrian students are sometimes subjected to different kinds of prejudice, especially about the university entrance process, and also exposed to negative behaviors.

T1  - The Impact of Facilitation on the Quality of Deliberation and Attitude Change
AN  - 2281055174
AB  - Many researchers claim that facilitation is a determining factor, if not a necessary condition, for successful deliberative discussion, but little research has applied randomized experimental designs to empirically test such claim. This article analyzes the effect of professionally facilitated versus non-facilitated discussions in a real-life context on participants’ attitudes and the perceived quality of group deliberation, controlling for various individual- and group-level variables. We conducted 26 deliberative discussions with 226 teachers from 13 primary schools on the topic of school discipline measures. We assessed the teachers’ post-discussion perceptions of the perceived quality of the group deliberation and their attitudes toward school discipline measures pre- and post-discussion. The results show the facilitation’s significant influences on attitude change and the perceived quality of the group deliberation. Quality of deliberation is also influenced by heterogeneity of restorative attitudes in discussion groups, whereas attitude change is to a large extent determined also by pre-discussion attitudes.

AN  - 2226628523
AB  - ObjectiveTo describe the issues associated with heightened levels of discriminatory behaviors and their effects on children and youth. We then describe efforts to ameliorate discriminatory behaviors at the school level, placing emphasis on practices that can be implemented within current school initiatives.MethodWe employed a thematic review approach to examine the effects of discriminatory behaviors on children and youth, as well as on school-based practices employed to redress such behaviors.ResultsSchools can act as change agents to curb the negative experiences youth have with discrimination, hateful speech and actions, and harassment. Many schools are successfully addressing these issues through their use of positive behavioral interventions and supports, social and emotional learning programs, bullying prevention programs, and interventions, which are designed to positively influence discriminatory behaviors and biased attitudes.ConclusionSchools should address issues like harassment, bullying, racism, and discrimination through the use of programs or interventions designed to reduce them, in order to provide more equitable schooling experiences and more equitable educational outcomes for all.

T1  - Promoting Resilience During Adolescence: Voices of Latino Youth and Parents
AN  - 2268978466
AB  - Difficult social circumstances contribute to numerous problems among Latino youth, which can include risky behaviors, school disengagement, health disparities, and relatively high rates of unintended pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and HIV/AIDS. To promote health and healthy development in spite of exposure to substantial social challenge, it is important to identify factors that contribute to resilience among Latino youth. We examine focus group data from the ¡Encuentro! study (10 youth groups, four parent groups) to learn elements identified by Latino youth and parents that support adolescents in reaching their goals. Honoring principles of community-based participatory research, a community–university analysis team coded data for emerging themes and identified protective factors within Masten’s resilience framework. All individual, social, and sociocultural protective factors in Masten’s framework were evident, including positive cultural standards, rituals, relationships, and supports. Challenges to resilience specific to Latino youth included prejudice and discrimination related to race/ethnicity and immigration.

T1  - Perceived Men’s Feminization and Attitudes Toward Homosexuality: Heterosexual Men’s Reactions to the Decline of the Anti-Femininity Norm of Masculinity
AN  - 2163551984
AB  - One of the central dimensions of traditional masculinity is men’s renunciation of the feminine (i.e., the anti-femininity norm), and men’s endorsement of this norm constitutes one of the strongest predictors of negative attitudes toward homosexuality. However, egalitarian societies are undergoing a significant change: Gendered roles, stereotypes, and norms are evolving. Accordingly, many believe that men are becoming more feminine than before, and this change might have consequential effects. Across two studies conducted in Western countries, we investigated heterosexual men’s reaction to the perceived decline of the anti-femininity norm of masculinity on their attitudes toward homosexuality. The results consistently showed that perceived men’s feminization increased negative attitudes toward homosexuality (Study 1, n = 220), specifically among those participants who most strongly endorsed the anti-femininity norm (Study 2, n = 156). Furthermore, this pattern was driven by participants’ discomfort with homosexuality rather than by their motivation to reinstate the challenged gender dichotomy. We discuss the relevance of these findings for both the gender and sexual prejudice literatures.

T1  - Homosexuality as <i>Haram</i>: Relations among Gender, Contact, Religiosity, and Sexual Prejudice in Muslim Individuals
AN  - 2135410243
AB  - Most research on sexual prejudice has focused on Western and Christian samples. Using the framework of social identity theory, we investigated the relations among gender, contact, religiosity, and sexual prejudice in a sample of 166 heterosexual Muslim individuals (70.7% from Saudi Arabia) residing in the United States. Consistent with prior research, men reported higher levels of prejudice than women did, especially toward gay men. Higher levels of religiosity predicted higher levels of sexual prejudice for both men and women, but the association was stronger for women. Additionally, more frequent and positive contact with friends and/or family members who were lesbian or gay predicted less sexual prejudice. However, contact was more strongly associated with less sexual prejudice in women than in men. Exploratory analyses revealed that more time spent in the United Sates predicted lower levels of sexual prejudice, and participants from Saudi Arabia reported more sexual prejudice than Muslims from other countries. The current research contributes to the understanding of factors that influence sexual prejudice within Islam and sheds light on the heterogeneity of attitudes within this group of individuals. Furthermore, our findings may help inform efforts to decrease sexual prejudice and increase awareness, advocacy, and future research within Islamic cultures.

T1  - Plural Belongings: Mothering Co-resident Children Post-migration in the USA
AN  - 2266690833
AB  - Immigrant mothers to the USA skillfully negotiate a sense of belonging that is local, global and in-between, as members of multiple spaces for themselves and their children. However, popular conceptions of migrant mothers paint them as traditionalists at best, expected to be grateful for their new ‘here’. This research is based on a small qualitative study of middle-class migrant mothers from multiple parts of the world living in North America. It exposes the differential impact of race and ethnicity on the mothers’ experiences, despite the relative socioeconomic privilege in the backgrounds and life trajectories of the women and their families. The mothers build flexible concepts of home that transcend single countries, raise children who have multiple homes and ideas of identity and strategize to confront prejudices and build ties to their new communities. By focusing on questions enmeshed with women’s mothering acts, we gain insights into notions of identity and belonging. As the mothers in this study negotiate the double transition into motherhood and into a new sociocultural experience, this article explores how they make intentional choices to negotiate, renegotiate and work around migration in ways that are reflective of their senses of self pre- and post-migration. In understanding migrant mothers’ experiences, we also see how policy makers may meet migrant’s needs and by extension, the needs of communities in a world shaped by internationalisms.

T1  - Love and Justice: African American Women, Education, and Protest in Antebellum New England
AN  - 2180882669
AB  - African Americans who pursued higher education in antebellum America often faced harassment and violence. Historians link the struggle over African American education with broader protest strategies, with African American men taking center stage. This essay enlarges the narrative on African American education and social protest by examining how young African American women students contested racism and white supremacy. Focusing on the controversy that surrounded the first high school for young African American women in New England, this essay argues that young African American women deployed an ethic of Christian love as a form of social protest. These women named racial prejudice as anti-Christian while also advocating for a just and loving nation inclusive of African Americans. Though white opposition eventually shuttered the school, this essay shows how African American women’s activism in the antebellum era is part of a longer genealogy of social protest.

T1  - Attitudes toward Same-Sex Marriage and Parenting, Ideologies, and Social Contacts: the Mediation Role of Sexual Prejudice Moderated by Gender
AN  - 2033531692
AB  - Recognition of same-sex marriage and parenting has increased in the last two decades but remains a controversial issue in which public opinion plays a role, as it can influence political leaders but also determine the immediate environment of same-sex families. The literature highlights the effect of religiosity, political orientation, beliefs about etiology of homosexuality, and social contacts with gay men and lesbians on attitudes toward same-sex marriage and parenting (ASSMP). The aim of this study was to explore the under-studied mediation role of sexual prejudice in this process and how participants’ gender moderated the mediation effects. Data were collected from 1416 heterosexual French students and analyzed with moderated mediation models in accordance with recent recommendations from Hayes (2013). Sexual prejudice mediated the effects of religiosity, political orientation, and etiological beliefs on ASSMP more strongly in men than in women. It also mediated the effect of contact with gay and lesbian persons and same-sex couples on ASSMP in men but not in women. The results highlight the need to explicitly deconstruct negative beliefs about homosexuality during debates about same-sex marriage and same-sex parenting, even when prejudice against homosexuality itself is not explicit in opponents’ discourse.

T1  - Attitudes towards same-sex parenting in Italy: the influence of traditional gender ideology
AN  - 2180535952
AB  - This study aimed to examine the role of gender ideology, religiosity and political conservatism on attitudes toward same-sex parenting in Italy at a time when same-sex parent families are undergoing attacks from ideological campaigns opposing non-traditional gender roles and families. We collected data from 4,187 heterosexual respondents about attitudes towards two-father and two-mother parenting, homonegativity, attitudes toward traditional masculinity and femininity, religious involvement and political conservatism. We conducted multiple group structural equation model analyses to test whether sex moderated any of the estimated associations among variables. Results showed that traditional beliefs about femininity were directly associated with negative attitudes towards two-mother and two-father parenting, while traditional beliefs about masculinity had a significant direct effect only on two-father parenting. Homonegativity partially mediated the association between religiosity, political conservatism and traditional beliefs about masculinity and femininity on negative attitudes toward both types of same-sex parenting. Gender differences were found for the indirect effects of political conservatism and religiosity on attitudes towards same-sex parenting. The theoretical contributions and implications of the findings are discussed.

This change is particularly marked in attitudes towards homosexuality and racial diversity which, as public opinion surveys have regularly shown, have become more accepting over time. This change is often attributed to older, less tolerant generations being replaced by young cohorts who are more inclusive and open minded in their attitudes to cultural others. The paper explores this argument by examining trends in people’s attitudes towards a variety of minorities, including the said groups, but also immigrants and foreign workers. It starts with a discussion of several perspectives predicting different trends with regards to these attitudes. A distinction is made between optimistic ones (i.e. those anticipating rising levels of tolerance) and pessimistic ones (i.e. those expecting stable or declining levels of tolerance). Subsequently, the paper presents trend analyses and an analysis of age, cohort and period effects to broadly assess the explanatory power of these perspectives. Using these approaches, we find that tolerance towards racial minorities and homosexuality has indeed risen across the board, and that young people are also more accepting of these groups than their parents or grandparents and previous generations of young people. These trends broadly support the optimistic perspectives. However, we also find that prejudice has not disappeared from youth attitudes altogether; for a sizeable minority of youth, it has merely shifted its focus to immigration. Not only have unwelcoming attitudes towards immigrants generally become stronger, young people are not always the most tolerant age group regarding this social group. These findings are thus more in line with the expectations of the pessimistic perspectives.

T1  - Young adults’ sibling relationships: Italian adaptation and validation of the Lifespan Sibling Relationship Scale
AN  - 2163565728
AB  - To deepen our understanding of young adults’ sibling relationships in the Italian context, this study examines the psychometric properties of the Italian adaptation and validation of the Lifespan Sibling Relationship Scale (LSRS) in a sample of 350 Italian university students (68.6% females, 31.4% males; ages 19–30 year, M = 23.6, SD = 3.2). Confirmatory factor analysis showed the expected six-factor structure and a close correlation between factors and scales. Internal consistency was adequate and correlation analysis with the Adult Sibling Relationship Questionnaire (ASRQ) confirmed the theoretical relations among the constructs. The findings confirm the transcultural validity of the LSRS. Moreover, results are consistent with research findings, indicating that women show a more positive attitude toward sibling relationships, especially when reporting their relationship with sisters, older siblings show a more positive attitude toward sibling relationships, and perception of current maternal and paternal partiality is related to negative attitudes toward sibling relationships.

T1  - A Comparative Study of Attitudes Toward Same-Gender Parenting and Gay and Lesbian Rights in Portugal and in Mexico
AN  - 2307554928
AB  - The belief that gay men and lesbians are unable to provide a stable environment in which to raise children fuels manifestations of sexual prejudice that are still highly prevalent in Portugal and Mexico. The aim of this study was to assess attitudes toward same-gender parenting and gay and lesbian rights, as well as beliefs about the controllability of homosexuality among a sample of 531 university students. A further aim was to assess the predictors of attitudes toward same-gender parenting. Results revealed the existence of ambivalent attitudes toward same-gender parenting. The belief that homosexuality is a choice and thus controllable in particular explained over 50% of the total variance of attitudes toward same-gender parenting. Being a man, older, and highly religious predicted higher levels of sexual prejudice regarding same-gender parenting. Comparative cross-cultural studies have the potential to highlight common features but also specificities of sexual prejudice.

T1  - Sexual minority women's attitudes toward infants, children, and parenthood
AN  - 2303793125
AB  - Little is known about the experiences of lesbian and bisexual women with infants or children or about their views on trade-offs required by parenthood. In this study, we examined how reactions to experiences with infants/children, perceived trade-offs of parenthood, and self-reported nurturance vary as a function of women's sexual orientation. Two hundred cisgender childless women (53 lesbian, 57 plurisexual, 90 heterosexual) from the United States, recruited via social media, participated in this study. Results showed that lesbian women reported more negative attitudes toward infants/children and parenthood than did heterosexual women. Self-reported nurturance did not differ as a function of sexual orientation. Overall, lesbian women reported that they had less favorable experiences with infants and/or children and that they anticipated more social and economic costs involved with parenthood than did heterosexual women. Lesbian women also reported lower aspirations for parenthood than heterosexual women, and this was largely accounted for by differences in perceptions of the trade-offs involved with parenthood. Plurisexual women did not differ from lesbian or heterosexual women on any outcome. These results contribute to our understanding of why lesbian women are, on average, less likely than heterosexual women to aspire to parenthood.

T1  - Quite an encumbrance? Work-related obstacles to Finnish fathers' take-up of parental leave
AN  - 2159997027
AB  - An ideal of involved fatherhood has become popular in the developed countries, but even countries like Finland that have introduced an individual father's quota to parental leave are far from gender equality in parents' leave practices. Lack of support and negative attitudes at workplaces or pressure at work are among the obstacles to fathers' leave take-up. The study used survey data from fathers and interviews at workplaces to explore the role of work and workplaces among the many aspects related to fathers' possibilities of taking leave. The results showed that fathers' income and workplace characteristics were associated with taking leave. Few fathers mentioned employers' objection as a hinder. Father's recent unemployment and anticipated difficulty of taking a long time off played a more important role. At workplaces, the obstacles to taking long leave were related to fathers' ideals about a committed worker and to the nature and organizing of work. Additionally, the leave exceeding fathers' quota might not be understood as 'for fathers'. The spouse's situation and fathers' gendered perceptions about parental responsibilities were also important for leave practices. The findings suggest that policy development towards a longer father's quota could make fathers' care responsibilities visible also at workplaces.

T1  - Asian Americans: Eurogamy by Asian Women: PROD
AN  - 2158088509
AB  - In the diverse American population, racial prejudice still remains a disturbing actuality. With the ever-increasing rate of Asians in the United States having better jobs, better income, and better education, Asian American women have never been at a better bargaining point to move their social standing in the society at a higher rank and aspire toward true assimilation. Intermarriage via selective desired traits that can help the Asian American woman trump their racial limitations, hence disadvantages. Okamoto’s theoretical perspective to develop a boundary approach to the conventional winnowing hypothesis, intermarriage becomes an indicator of integration. Hall’s eurogamy premise posits that most important of such desirable traits of prospective men being Euro-American can help Asian women blur the racial differences, hence bring them to the mainstream. This study suggests that in United States, there exists still substantial homogamy and in the absence of homogamy there is a similar pattern of exogamy, or more specifically eurogamy among Asian American women depicting and showing a clear tendency to marry up. It suggested that eurogamy is likely to continue as a means to marry up. Thus, there will be a continuation of said increase as the population of younger, better educated, independent Asian American women expands, hence resulting in the perfect marital assimilation.

T1  - Systematic Development of a Dutch School-Based Sexual Prejudice Reduction Program: an Intervention Mapping Approach
AN  - 2126770953
AB  - Experiences of sexual prejudice threaten the quality of life and psychological well-being of sexual minority youth. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of how we developed a theory- and evidence-based sexual prejudice reduction program suitable for the Dutch high school context, guided by the intervention mapping approach (IM). In line with IM, six steps were followed: an initial needs assessment in which empirical, theoretical, and new data were gathered to acquire a thorough understanding of the problem (step 1); the formulation of program objectives for both students and teachers (step 2); the selection of theory-based methods and applications (step 3); program development (step 4); the provision of an adoption and implementation plan (step 5); and the development of an evaluation plan (step 6). In conclusion, developing a sexual prejudice reduction program for schools is a challenging but feasible process. IM is an effective tool for the systematic (theory- and evidence-driven) development of such a program.

T1  - Prejudices and discrimination as goal activated and threat driven: The affordance management approach applied to sexual prejudice
AN  - 2138607364
AB  - Stereotypes, prejudices, and discriminatory behaviors directed toward people based on their sexual orientation vary broadly. Existing perspectives on sexual prejudice argue for different underlying causes, sometimes provide disparate or conflicting evidence for its roots, and typically fail to account for variances observed across studies. We propose an affordance management approach to understanding sexual prejudice, which weds the fundamental motives theory with the sociofunctional threat-based approach to prejudice to provide a broader explanation for the causes and outcomes of sexual prejudice and to explain inter- and intragroup prejudices more broadly. Prejudices arise as specific emotions designed to engage functional behavioral responses to perceived threats and opportunities (i.e., affordances) posed by different sexual orientation groups, and interact with the perceiver’s chronic or temporarily activated fundamental motives (e.g., parenting, mating), which determine the relevance of certain target affordances. Our perspective predicts what stereotype content is likely to direct specific affective and behavioral reactions (i.e., the stereotypes that relay threat- and opportunity-relevant information) and when the affordance-emotion-behavior link is likely to engage (i.e., when those threats and opportunities are directly relevant to the perceiver’s current fundamental goal). This article synthesizes the extant sexual prejudice literature from an affordance management approach to demonstrate how fundamental goals interact with preexisting perceptions to drive perceptual, affective, and behavioral responses toward sexual orientation groups, and provides a degree of explanatory power heretofore missing from the prejudice literature.

T1  - Is racism the new sectarianism? Negativity towards immigrants and ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland from 2004 to 2015
AN  - 2103357901
AB  - Negativity towards ethnic minorities is a serious problem in Northern Ireland. Its history of the Troubles around religious identities makes Northern Ireland a special case in Europe. This paper examines negativity towards Muslims, Eastern Europeans and immigrants in Northern Ireland using data from the Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey and the British Social Attitudes Survey. The results from regressions show that anti-immigrant negativity is no more prevalent in Northern Ireland than elsewhere in the UK. However, levels of negativity towards Muslims and Eastern Europeans are significantly higher than in Great Britain and have increased in recent years, particularly among young adults aged 18-24 years, although older cohorts are more intolerant on average. Our regression analyses found strong positive relationships between anti-immigrant negativity, sectarianism and perceived neighbourhood segregation. Higher education, contacts with minority members and (religiously) mixed schooling are negatively related to negativity towards immigrants.

T1  - Online Gamers, Lived Experiences, and Sense of Belonging: Students at the University of the Free State, Bloemfontein
AN  - 2139622802
AB  - Individuals who partake in video games are often regarded with prejudice. It is an activity that is perceived to be mainly related to senseless leisure and teenage entertainment. However, many diverse people make video games such an important part of their lives that they become passionately engaged in it. Video games and online video gaming offer the player immersive experiences unlike any other forms of media. A phenomenological and interpretive exploration is undertaken in order to gain a deeper understanding of the narratives of online gamers and their experiences of a sense of belonging to the associated online communities. Through the use of in-depth interviews, the article explores various aspects of the life stories of a group of eight South African university students. It attempts to show how online gaming has become a part of their lifeworlds. The aim of this article is to present the narratives of online gamers as rich and descriptive accounts that maintain the voices of the participants. Various aspects of the lifeworlds of online gamers are explored. Firstly, an exploration is undertaken to gain an understanding of what it means to be a gamer. It focuses on how a person can become involved with gaming and how it can evolve into something that a person is engaged with on a daily basis. Secondly, it explores how video games influence the perception of reality of gamers. Immersion in video games can transfer a player into an alternative reality and can take the focus away from the real world. This can lead to feelings of joy and excitement, but can also lead to escapism. Lastly, the article shifts attention towards how online video gamers experience online communities. Players can have positive experiences with random strangers online, but because of the anonymous nature of the online environment, it can also lead to negative and isolating experiences.

T1  - Intercultural communication within a Chinese subsidiary of a Western MNC: Expatriate perspectives on language and communication issues
AN  - 2125430891
AB  - This study investigates Polish expatriates’ stories of encounters with local personnel in a Chinese subsidiary of a Western multinational company. A narrative analysis of the stories produced important insights into Polish-Chinese communication in an intra-subsidiary context. Low proficiency in the host language was a serious obstacle to expatriate socialization and a source of expatriates’ exclusion and social isolation in the workplace, which often led to stress, frustration, and negative attitudes toward collaboration with local personnel. Language-related issues prevented the expatriates from acquiring information from Chinese superiors, learning about problems within a team, and participating in decision-making. The findings of this case study relate to communication challenges in the Chinese subsidiary, expatriates’ accounts of how they overcame communication difficulties, and their reflections on what fostered and hampered intercultural communication.

T1  - Are people more prejudiced towards groups that are perceived as coherent? A meta‐analysis of the relationship between out‐group entitativity and prejudice
AN  - 2115989388
AB  - A meta‐analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between out‐group entitativity and prejudice. A quantitative analysis of 85 effect sizes from 33 independent samples showed a significant positive relationship between entitativity and prejudice (Fisher's z = .414, 95% CI [0.272, 0.557], p < .0001). Three possible moderators of the relationship between entitativity and prejudice were tested: conceptualization of the entitativity (essence‐based entitativity scale, agency‐based entitativity scale, common entitativity scale), the target of the prejudice, and the measures of prejudice (attitudes, emotions, behaviour towards out‐group). Results demonstrated that out‐group entitativity correlated with prejudice only when entitativity was conceptualized as an essence‐based or common‐based scale, and prejudice was measured as the attitude to the out‐group. The target of prejudice does not moderate the relationship between entitativity and prejudice.

T1  - Linguistic Cultural Capital among Descendants of Mixed Couples in Catalonia, Spain: Realities and Inequalities
AN  - 2081349727
AB  - Spain, along with the region of Catalonia in particular, has seen a significant increase in mixed unions between immigrants and natives, which, in turn, has given rise to a growing number of young people with mixed origins. Yet little is known about how these mixed families and individuals negotiate cultural differences and view their 'mixed cultural capital.' Drawing on 29 in-depth interviews with youth of diverse mixed cultural, racial, and religious backgrounds residing in Catalonia and 58 in-depth interviews with immigrants in mixed unions, this paper focuses on the role of language as a form of cultural capital. Do mixed families use a number of languages in their everyday lives? Which languages are transmitted, preferred, and used, and why? We find that mixed families are generally multilingual, as the knowledge of different languages is thought to contribute to communication with relatives, social integration, and social mobility. However, children and youth of mixed descent who belong to minoritized ethnic or racial groups may resist learning or actively using the language of their immigrant parent to avoid stigmatization and socially imposed categories of 'foreignness.' Therefore, stigmatization and prejudice may be limiting linguistic cultural capital - a key benefit of mixedness - in Catalonia.

T1  - Individual differences in social control: Who ‘speaks up’ when witnessing uncivil, discriminatory, and immoral behaviours?
AN  - 2064682910
AB  - This research examined the personality characteristics of individuals who ‘speak up’ and confront perpetrators of norm transgressions. We tested whether those who intervene tend to be ‘bitter complainers’ or ‘well‐adjusted leaders’. In four studies (total N = 1,003), we measured several individual differences that are directly implicated by at least one of the two concepts. We also presented participants with uncivil, discriminatory, and immoral behaviours and asked them how likely they would be to intervene if they were to witness each of these behaviours as a bystander. The results confirmed the well‐adjusted leader hypothesis: Participants’ self‐reported tendency to confront perpetrators correlated positively with altruism, extraversion, social responsibility, acceptance by peers, independent self‐construal, emotion regulation, persistence, self‐directedness, age, occupation, and monthly salary, but not with aggressiveness or low self‐esteem. Individuals who confront prejudice also speak up against other immoral and uncivil behaviours. We discuss the implications of these findings for the perpetuation and change of social norms.

T1  - Why there is less supportive evidence for contact theory than they say there is: A quantitative cultural–sociological critique
AN  - 2043991145
AB  - The finding that ethnic prejudice is particularly weakly developed among those with interethnic friendships is often construed as confirming the so-called ‘contact theory,’ which holds that interethnic contact reduces racial prejudice. This theory raises cultural–sociological suspicions, however, because of its tendency to reduce culture to an allegedly ‘more fundamental’ realm of social interaction. Analyzing data from the first wave of the European Social Survey, we therefore test the theory alongside an alternative cultural–sociological theory about culturally driven processes of contact selection. We find that whereas interethnic friendships are indeed culturally driven, which confirms our cultural–sociological theory, contacts with neighbors and colleagues do indeed affect ethnic prejudice. They do so in a manner that is more complex and more culturally sensitive than contact theory suggests, however: while positive cultural stances vis-à-vis ethnic diversity lead interethnic contact to decrease ethnic prejudice, negative ones rather lead the former to increase the latter.

T1  - Women’s Decision-Making Autonomy and their Attitude towards Wife-Beating: Findings from the 2011 Ethiopia’s Demographic and Health Survey
AN  - 2034157358
AB  - The study examined the extent of wife-beating acceptance and factors that influence women’s attitude towards wife-beating in Ethiopia from a nationally representative sample of 11,658 participants in the 2011 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey. Multivariate logistic regressions were fitted to investigate the relationships between women’s attitude towards wife-beating and women’s decision-making autonomy after controlling for socio-demographic factors. The majority (56%) of women agreed that wife-beating is justified when wife neglects children, 53% when wife burns the food, 50% when wife argues with husband, 48% when wife goes out without telling husband, and nearly 45% when wife refuses to have sex with husband. Overall, 51% of women had shown highly favorable attitude towards wife-beating. Women’s place of residence, household wealth quintiles, educational levels, marital status, and husband/partner’s employment status have shown significant association with women’s attitude towards wife-beating. Women’s decision-making autonomy was also a significant predictor of women’s attitude towards wife-beating. The odds of having highly favorable attitude towards wife-beating deceased significantly as the level of decision-making autonomy of women improved. Given the widespread acceptance of wife-beating among Ethiopian women, social policies that empower women could serve as a positive force in changing attitudes towards wife-beating and violence against women.

T1  - White Nationalism in Congress and Gatsby
AN  - 2491993285
AB  - Now, more than ever, we need to find a way to be sure that all of the diverse students we teach can engage in difficult conversations in our classrooms about racism, religious prejudice, and white nationalism. These conversations, however, can be risky work in our current political climate, particularly as higher education is identified by critics like AttorneyGeneral Jeff Sessions as an "echo chamber of political correctness" (Ruiz 2017). We would argue that many of our great canonical American texts offer us remarkably interesting material with which to enable conversations about inequality and injustice in the United States and that teachers must seize the opportunity to use these texts to foster these conversations in our classrooms.1 We offer the following discussion of The Great Gatsby as a model for undertaking this important work.

T1  - Parental documentation status and academic attitudes and expectations among early adolescent latinos
AN  - 2070442276
AB  - Many Latino youth are U.S. citizens but live with parents whose immigration status is unauthorized. The association between parental documentation status and early adolescent academic attitudes and expectations is unclear. Using a general population sample of urban 7th grade students who self-identified as Latino in the South Central U.S. (n = 514), we examine the associations between parental documentation status and youth attitudes about the importance of graduating high school and college and expectations of the likelihood of completing high school and attending college. Findings suggest that parent documentation status is not associated with attitudes toward the importance of high school and college among Latino early adolescents, but it is significantly associated with perceptions of the likelihood of achievement. Thus, parent immigration status may be an educational barrier that needs to be addressed early for Latino youth, as efforts in high school may be too late for some students.

T1  - Rethinking HIV-prevention for school-going young people based on current behaviour patterns
AN  - 2296133609
AB  - The aim of the research was to gain increased knowledge regarding the sexual risk behaviour of school-going young people in South Africa after two decades of HIV-education in schools, to contribute to the development of improved HIV prevention strategies. In collaboration with the Department of Education, a sample of 5305 learners (between 10 and 18 years in Grades 5–12) from high-risk communities were identified. They completed a survey that assessed self-reported sexual risk behaviour and variables that potentially underlie sexual risk, such as attitudes towards preventive behaviour, perceived social norms and self-efficacy (based on the theory of planned behaviour [TPB]) and social factors like caregiver relationships and gender norms (based on the social ecological theory). Lifetime sex was reported by 49.4% of boys and 30.5% of girls in Grades 8–12, while 56% of the sexually active young people reported consistent condom use. Accurate knowledge about HIV transmission was low (37.8%). Regression analysis showed that risk behaviour was more prominent among older male youths, who perceived social norms as encouraging sexual activity, who use alcohol excessively, and who have negative attitudes towards abstinence. Perceived traditional community gender norms and negative relationships with caregivers were also associated with sexual risk behaviour. This research showed that the TPB can be used in planning HIV prevention interventions for young people. It also revealed that HIV-prevention strategies should focus beyond educating the individual, to address community factors such as improving caregiver relationships, the culture of substance abuse, peer group norms and inequality in community gender norms. These community processes influence young people's behaviour and need to be addressed to allow the youth to make healthy behavioural choices.

T1  - U.S. Children's Stereotypes and Prejudicial Attitudes toward Arab Muslims
AN  - 1980069351
AB  - The current study examined whether children in elementary school in the United States held stereotypes and prejudicial attitudes about Arab Muslims relative to other groups. Children (n = 136), ages 6-11 (55 boys, 81 girls), were read three counterbalanced vignettes about different immigrant families who moved to the United States: one family from the Middle East with clothing markers indicating they are Muslim (e.g., hijab), one family from the Middle East without clothing markers indicating religion, and one White family from Ireland. Children's responses indicated stereotypes associating the Arab Muslim male target as more anti-American and hostile and the Arab Muslim female target as more oppressed than others, both consistent with prevalent media stereotypes. Children's positive and negative affective intergroup attitudes were also measured, along with their attitudes about who can be an "American," with children showing both a positivity and negativity bias against Arab Muslims. Children who had some contact with Muslims or were familiar with Islam felt more positively toward Arab Muslims than less informed children. In addition, if children perceived Arab Muslims to be prototypical "Americans," and identified as very American themselves, they also held positive attitudes toward Arab Muslims. Implications for prejudice reduction interventions are discussed.

T1  - Re-examining Socialization Theory: How Does Democracy Influence the Impact of Education on Anti-Foreigner Sentiment?
AN  - 1938319769
AB  - Socialization theory claims that the ability of education to reduce anti-foreigner sentiment varies cross-nationally because state authorities are not equally committed to accepting ethnic minorities: higher educated persons harbor less anti-foreigner sentiment because they spend longer in educational institutions that impose official democratic values, which forbid negative reactions toward ethnic minorities. Consequently, higher educated persons ought to diverge from the lower educated as democratic institutions progress. Analyses support these claims: the impact of education on reducing anti-foreigner sentiment is strongest in the oldest democracies, moderate among the medium-aged (e.g., South European) democracies and weakest among the youngest (East European) democracies; and higher educated persons are disproportionately influenced by the maturation of democratic institutions. Analyses utilize data from the 28-country 2008 European Social Survey.

T1  - Resilience in the face of peer victimisation and discrimination: The who, when and why in five patterns of adjustment
AN  - 2046625062
AB  - Victimisation has a negative effect on psychosocial functioning. Based on the resilience theory, and with a sample of 2975 Portuguese students, the present study aims to: i) identify patterns of adjustment in the face of peer victimisation and perceptions of discrimination; ii) explore the association between the patterns of adjustment and the characteristics of participants (the who) and of the victimisation (the when and why). Cluster analysis revealed five patterns of adjustment: Unchallenged; Externally Maladjusted; Internally Maladjusted; Resilient, and At-Risk. The results suggest that there is no complete resilience in the face of social victimisation. Group differences were found regarding: i) gender, type of course, sexual orientation, ethnicity, nationality, parental educational level and religious beliefs; ii) the age at which peer victimisation was more frequent, and; iii) the motives underlying discrimination. Globally considered, peer victimisation is representative of the wider cultural environment and interventions should also target social prejudices.

T1  - Welland Ontario's Springfield Plan: Post-War Canadian Citizenship Training, American Style?
AN  - 2032478903
AB  - After World War II, minority activists and their Anglo-Canadian allies convinced the Ontario Ministry of Education to bring the Springfield Plan to Welland, Ontario, as a pilot project to combat racist and religious prejudice through the public school system. Pioneered in Springfield, Massachusetts, the Plan taught children the importance of tolerance by stressing that minority groups had made important contributions to the local community, the nation, and the world beyond. In Welland, however, the Plan only lasted for a few years because many influential Canadians failed to recognize the pervasiveness of discrimination, while non-British immigrants tended to see new industrial unions as better vehicles for claiming their rights. In addition, the Plan was unsuited to the understanding of Canada as a “bi-racial” country founded by the English and French.Alternate abstract:Après la Deuxième Guerre mondiale, des militants issus des minorités et leurs alliés anglo-canadiens convainquirent le ministère de l’Éducation de l’Ontario d’introduire le Plan de Springfield à Welland (Ontario), à titre de projet pilote destiné à combattre le racisme et les préjugés religieux par l’intermédiaire du réseau d’écoles publiques. Lancé à Springfield (Massachusetts), celui-ci enseignait aux enfants l’importance de la tolérance en soulignant que les groupes minoritaires avaient apporté d’importantes contributions à la collectivité locale, au pays et au monde extérieur. À Welland, toutefois, le Plan ne dura que quelques années parce que bon nombre de Canadiens influents refusèrent de reconnaître l’omniprésence de la discrimination et que, de leur côté, les immigrants non britanniques eurent tendance à voir les nouveaux syndicats industriels comme de meilleurs outils pour faire valoir leurs droits. De plus, le Plan n’était pas conçu pour faire comprendre le Canada comme étant un pays « biracial », fondé par les Anglais et les Français.

T1  - When school meets the Other: intercultural policies in the Basque inclusive school
AN  - 1862143788
AB  - Gatti, Irazuzta and Martinez address the intercultural public policies implemented in the education system of the Autonomous Region of the Basque Country (Spain). Focusing on the education system allows them to reconstruct the historicity of identity-alterity production in a region in which language has been central for the establishment of ethnic frontiers. More specifically, they examine the implementation of these policies in three pre-school and primary educational institutions in a multicultural neighbourhood of the city of Bilbao. They look at Euskara-the Basque language-as a key element of the us-them distinction. The various education models regarding language and the teaching in/of Euskara or Spanish pave the way for the specialization and spatialization of the schools analysed. 'Integration' policies are implemented in ethnically marked schools only, based on a rhetoric of interculturality that assumes that any 'racial or ethnic discrimination' can be overcome through knowledge of the Other. Moreover, the assessment of public policies through 'interculturality figures and best practice' developed to address the so-called 'immigration issue' promotes a protectionist intervention on behalf of the assumed social vulnerabilities of immigrant schoolchildren and their families, which are read as 'problematic characteristics'. The article argues that, as a result of the approach based on the social conditions of immigrant children and their families in the Basque Country, the race issue evaporates.

T1  - “Oil and Water”? Latino-white Relations and Symbolic Integration in a Changing California
AN  - 2406943817
AB  - Existing research on race relations between racial/ethnic groups in the United States highlights how personal contact can lead to increased harmony or conflict between groups and may reduce intergroup prejudice. This study engages this literature and draws from more than 20 months of ethnography and 66 interviews in a Spanish/English dual-language school in Los Angeles to qualitatively examine Latino-white relations in diverse settings. Interactions between Latino and white adults of varying class statuses are characterized by politeness and civility, yet parents segregate within the school and rarely form meaningful cross-racial relationships that transcend the campus. Despite regular interpersonal contact, a shared goal of bilingualism, and shared class status for some, divisions between Latino and white parents persist, and interactions between them are characterized by what the author terms symbolic integration. Symbolic integration refers to polite, but surface-level, interactions between racial/ethnic groups that are enjoyable, voluntary, and additive. This type of integration nuances our understanding of race relations and elucidates how sustained regular contact and the absence of negative racial stereotypes do not ensure lessened racial stratification between racial/ethnic groups.

T1  - Parenting Transgender Children in PFLAG
AN  - 1835699965
AB  - Parents of transgender children (N = 14) recounted four ways in which their parenting experiences were more difficult and isolating than those of other parents of a national GLBT support organization: the physical changes their children undergo, the lack of media representations of transgender lives, the effect of their child's gender transition on their identity as a parent, and the tensions involved in their child's successful transition in public settings. Parental isolation may be alleviated, however, by recognizing four unrecognized similarities shared among parents of GLBT children: adjusting to changes in their child's appearance, the process of grief and mourning, the tendency to hierarchically rank parental difficulties, and fears of being a bad parent. The isolation faced by parents of transgender children is imposed not only by antitrans prejudice and lack of information, but also by the unacknowledged and undiscussed ways in which a child's gender transition affects parental gender identities.

T1  - The Impact of Victimization and Neuroticism on Mental Health in Young Men Who Have Sex with Men: Internalized Homophobia as an Underlying Mechanism
AN  - 1802422313
AB  - Sexual minorities experience greater mental health issues compared with heterosexuals due to minority stressors. This study focused on the impact of victimization and neuroticism on mental health in young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and the mediating role of internalized homophobia (IH). IH refers to when a sexual minority person internalizes social bias and develops a negative view of themselves, which is a likely process through which victimization and neuroticism impact mental health. Data were collected over three time points across 12 months, with 450 YMSM (mean age=18.9) and an 80.7 % retention rate. Two mediation analyses with bias-corrected bootstrapping using 1000 samples were conducted, controlling for age, race, and sexual orientation. Results revealed that victimization [F (9, 440)=4.83, p<0.001, R 
 
  2
 =0.09] and neuroticism [F (9, 440)=12.23, p<0.001, R 
 
  2
 =0.20] had a significant indirect effect on mental health via increased levels of IH. These findings show how external experiences of stigma and personality-level characteristics may impact YMSM in terms of their sense of self. Furthermore, these results support addressing social conditions that marginalize YMSM in order to promote better mental health through decreasing IH.

T1  - At the University but Not of the University: The Benching of Willis Ward and the Rise of Northern Racial Liberalism
AN  - 1924609775
AB  - "2 Kean's observation exposed the racial marginalization that black students confronted at the University of Michigan. Segregation and stratification withstood racial liberalism and the pro-integration ethos that accompanied it.3 At Michigan, lodging restrictions, institutionalized racial quotas, and racist ridicule from professors in the classroom, among other forms of racial prejudice, stood as salient reminders to the school's small black population of the gulf between their integration into a northern white institution and their attainment of full equality.4 Inclusion had its limits. Whereas Kean summed the experiences of all black students at the University of Michigan, nowhere was the battle for full inclusion more fraught than in sport. In other sports like swimming, gymnastics, and wrestling, they were unable to start joining those teams until the late 1950s and early 1960s when a newer wave of Michigan coaches began to discard the unwritten quota system for African Americans. In baseball, though Michigan's door was swung wide open by Moses "Fleetwood" Walker in 1882, only seven black men lettered in the sport, while no black athlete was permitted to play golf.6 In tennis, Kean became the second of only two African Americans to earn a letter in the sport in the university's history when he did so in 1934, following behind Henry Graham, who first achieved the honor in 1928. Nowhere was this gap between integration and inclusion more visible to Kean than during his senior season in 1934 when the university experienced its most embarrassing racial incident-the benching of Willis Ward,...

T1  - Factorial Validity and Psychometric Properties of the Marital Scales-The Persian Version
AN  - 1787540809
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the factor structure, convergent validity, and reliability of the Persian version of the Marital Scales. A sample of 627 participants (62.8% female, 37.2% male) were selected to participate from the available population. They completed the Socio-Demographic Characteristics Form and the Marital Scales. Results showed that internal consistency of this scale using Cronbach's alpha was .88 and the split-half coefficient was .86. Also, internal consistency of 3 main subscales (Intent to Marry, General Attitudes Toward Marriage, and Aspects of Marriage) was .80, .84 and .88, respectively, using Cronbach's alpha. The results of the factor analysis revealed that the Marital Scales is a multidimensional instrument with 10 distinct and related factors: intent to marry, positive attitudes, negative attitudes, fears and doubts, romance, respect, trust, finances, meaning, and physical intimacy. In general, the Marital Scales are a reliable and suitable instrument for assessing marital attitudes and expectations in Iran and other Persian-speaking countries.

T1  - The Enduring Significance of Skin Tone: Linking Skin Tone, Attitudes Toward Marriage and Cohabitation, and Sexual Behavior
AN  - 1779612959
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Understanding Wanted and Unwanted Relationships 
Past evidence has documented that attitudes toward marriage and cohabitation are related to sexual behavior in adolescence and young adulthood. This study extends prior research by longitudinally testing these associations across racial/ethnic groups and investigating whether culturally relevant variations within racial/ethnic minority groups, such as skin tone (i.e., lightness/darkness of skin color), are linked to attitudes toward marriage and cohabitation and sex. Drawing on family and public health literatures and theories, as well as burgeoning skin tone literature, it was hypothesized that more positive attitudes toward marriage and negative attitudes toward cohabitation would be associated with less risky sex, and that links differed for lighter and darker skin individuals. The sample included 6872 respondents (49.6 % female; 70.0 % White; 15.8 % African American; 3.3 % Asian; 10.9 % Hispanic) from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. The results revealed that marital attitudes had a significantly stronger dampening effect on risky sexual behavior of lighter skin African Americans and Asians compared with their darker skin counterparts. Skin tone also directly predicted number of partners and concurrent partners among African American males and Asian females. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of these findings for adolescence and young adulthood.

T1  - The Effects of Vignette Placement on Attitudes Toward Supporting Family Members
AN  - 1812251538
AB  - Vignettes are useful for measuring norms and beliefs, but little is known about how vignette placement affects responses to subsequent attitude questions. We investigate how the placement of a vignette about parents and adult children living together affects answers to subsequent questions about family obligations in a survey of the U.S. population. We randomly assigned the order of the vignette and three single-statement attitude questions. For the single-statement question about family members living together, the effect of vignette placement depended on respondents' original attitudes. For individuals with ambivalent or positive attitudes, asking the vignette before the attitude questions doubled reports of favorable attitudes. Vignette placement had no effect for those with negative attitudes. For the single-statement attitude questions about financial support between parents and adult children, vignette placement had no effect, suggesting that vignette placement may only influence subsequent questions about the same topic.

T1  - The denial of racism in Latina/o students' narratives about discrimination in the classroom
AN  - 1763751075
AB  - This study examines how Latina/o students perceive and frame experiences of prejudice against them in the classroom through narratives told in informal interviews in Spanish. This project started as an inquiry about these students' general perceptions and experiences in their Advanced Spanish-language classes and how these compared to their experiences in other classes on campus. Narratives are essential to understanding how speakers perceive and evaluate the experiences narrated and how they position themselves in relation to their group as well as to outsiders. The results show that, in most cases, when recounting narratives of discrimination or situations that can be considered instances of prejudice, students were hesitant to recognize that they were the subjects of discrimination or to qualify the story as an occurrence of racism. Different strategies were used to avoid this recognition, including assigning others the role of recognizing the situation as discriminatory and also using narrative evaluations or introductions to justify or mitigate the reasons that motivated these incidents. Discourses of prejudice and racism denial have been broadly documented, yet most studies focus on those who deny being racist themselves or being part of a racist group. This study shows how the underrepresented group might incorporate these discourses of denial and also how their discourses support or, at least, do not challenge the ideologies of majority groups about race, language, and immigration.

T1  - Lesbian Mother Families and Gay Father Families in Italy: Family Functioning, Dyadic Satisfaction, and Child Well-Being
AN  - 1698327019
AB  - The literature underlines that lesbian mother and gay father families are similar to those with heterosexual parents, regarding family functioning, dyadic satisfaction, and child development. This paper compares 40 same-sex families and 40 heterosexual parents in the Italian context. In Italy, it is impossible for same-sex couples or single lesbians and gay men to adopt a child, become married, or enter civil partnerships. The participants were administered self-reports, in order to investigate the dyadic relationships, family functioning, and emotional and social adjustment of their children. Lesbian and gay parents reported higher levels of dyadic adjustment, flexibility, and communication in their family than heterosexual parents. Data from the present study demonstrated that children raised by lesbian and gay parents showed a similar level of emotion regulation and psychological well-being than children raised by heterosexual parents. In Italy, negative attitudes towards same-sex families persist, and educational programs should be developed to deconstruct stereotypes regarding gay and lesbian parent families. These results have important implications in both clinical and social fields.

T1  - Intergroup Contact is Related to Evaluations of Interracial Peer Exclusion in African American Students
AN  - 1679664462
AB  - There are few published studies on the influence of intergroup contact on ethnic minority public school students' evaluations of interracial exclusion. In this study, African American children and adolescents (N = 158, 4th, 7th, and 10th grade; 67.1 %) were individually interviewed regarding peer exclusion for scenarios depicting cross-race peer exclusion in various contexts. The level of positive intergroup contact, attribution of motives for exclusion, wrongfulness ratings, reasoning about exclusion, estimations of the frequency of exclusion, and awareness of the use of stereotypes to justify racial exclusion were assessed. Intergroup contact was significantly related to attributions of racial motives, higher ratings of wrongfulness, greater use of moral reasoning, and higher estimations of the frequency of exclusion. In addition to context effects, with increasing grade participants were more likely to refer to the historical and social circumstances contributing to the manifestation of racial stereotypes used to justify exclusion. The findings are discussed in terms of the existing research on intergroup relations and evaluations of social exclusion.

T1  - The greatest magic of Harry Potter: Reducing prejudice
AN  - 1654892806
AB  - Recent research shows that extended contact via story reading is a powerful strategy to improve out-group attitudes. We conducted three studies to test whether extended contact through reading the popular best-selling books of Harry Potter improves attitudes toward stigmatized groups (immigrants, homosexuals, refugees). Results from one experimental intervention with elementary school children and from two cross-sectional studies with high school and university students (in Italy and United Kingdom) supported our main hypothesis. Identification with the main character (i.e., Harry Potter) and disidentification from the negative character (i.e., Voldemort) moderated the effect. Perspective taking emerged as the process allowing attitude improvement. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed in the context of extended intergroup contact and social cognitive theory.

T1  - Pride and Prejudice: Factors Affecting School Attachment Among Lesbian, Bisexual, and Heterosexual Girls
AN  - 1700673129; 201525285
AB  - School attachment is often regarded as a key measure in gauging the integration and wellbeing of students. Previous research suggests that levels of school attachment are generally lower among sexual minority students, but most studies focus on between-gender comparisons and do not conduct within-gender analyses. Using data from the First National Climate Survey on Homophobia and Transphobia in Canadian schools, this study set out to empirically analyze what, if any, differences exist among lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual female students when assessing the relationship between homophobic and gender-negative language, feelings of safety, harassment/direct victimization, and school climate on school attachment. Bivariate and multivariate findings suggest that there are key differences among female students in terms of school attachment. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Strivers vs skivers: Class prejudice and the demonisation of dependency in everyday life
AN  - 1551000734; 201429131
AB  - This paper focuses on the moral dimension of everyday lives, using original empirical material about the judgments we make about others to explore and understand the contemporary nature of class prejudice. In doing so, we pay attention to the relationship between class prejudice and other forms of stigma and discrimination by exploring the complex (re)alignment of associations between different social groups (including working class people, disabled people, asylum seekers) in processes of 'othering' and exclusion. The research highlights the potential shared interest of groups who are demonised for being 'in need' to challenge the contemporary hegemony of the individualised ethic of self-interest which is producing a process of de-socialisation in which the importance of values such as care, compassion and social responsibility risk becoming casualties with inevitable consequences for social cohesion. Rather, the paper concludes by arguing for a re-socialisation of politics that recognises the structural causes of inequalities and which values and promotes understandings across, instead of moral judgements of, difference and our social obligations towards each other.

T1  - Moderators of the Relationship Between Masculinity and Sexual Prejudice in Men: Friendship, Gender Self-Esteem, Same-Sex Attraction, and Religious Fundamentalism
AN  - 1680152144; 201517805
AB  - Masculinity has been found to predict the sexual prejudice of heterosexual men against gay men. The present study investigated the role of four variables as moderators of the relationships between two masculinity constructs (endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology and gender role conflict) and sexual prejudice in men. The hypothesized moderators were: direct and indirect friendships with gay men, gender self-esteem, acknowledged same-sex attraction, and religious fundamentalism. A total of 383 men completed 8 scales plus a demographic questionnaire. Direct friendship strengthened the positive relationship between masculinity ideology and sexual prejudice, contrary to hypothesis. This finding could mean that high masculinity ideology scores reduced the likelihood that a man with many gay friends would let go of his prejudice. Direct friendship did not moderate the relationship between gender role conflict and sexual prejudice nor did indirect friendship moderate either relationship; however, both forms of friendship predicted prejudice, as hypothesized. Gender self-esteem strengthened the positive relationships between both masculinity variables and sexual prejudice as hypothesized. Same-sex attraction weakened the relationship between gender role conflict and sexual prejudice as hypothesized, but contrary to hypothesis did not moderate the relationship between masculinity ideology and sexual prejudice. Religious fundamentalism predicted prejudice, but showed no significant moderation. The results were discussed in terms of limitations and suggestions for future research and application. In conclusion, this line of investigation appears promising and should be continued and the present findings can be utilized in anti-prejudice social marketing campaigns and in counseling.

T1  - Social Exclusion of Children: Developmental Origins of Prejudice
AN  - 1543801910
AB  - Over the past decade, developmental and social psychological research has explicitly adopted a developmental intergroup framework, integrating social and developmental psychology fields to understand the origins of social exclusion and prejudice. This article argues that a social developmental analysis of how groups and individuals experience, evaluate, and understand exclusion is essential for a complete picture of the human experience, interpretation, and consequences of exclusion. What has been missing in much of the social psychological research on exclusion is an incorporation of developmental perspectives; likewise, what has been missing in development psychological research is a focus on group identity and group dynamics for understanding the basis for exclusionary behavior in childhood. Yet, the roots of adult forms of exclusion can be documented in childhood, and children who experience exclusion are particularly at risk for negative outcomes, and especially when exclusion is based on group membership. Moreover, interventions designed to ameliorate social problems associated with exclusion need to be based on an understanding of how, why, and under what conditions, children and groups make decisions to exclude others, how they experience this exclusion, and how exclusion originates and changes over the course of the lifespan. Thus, a growing body of psychological work, exemplified in this issue of the Journal of Social Issues (2014), highlights implications for theory in psychology and related social sciences, and for interventions and policies to tackle social exclusion.

T1  - The Gay Second Generation: Sexual Identity and Family Relations of Filipino and Latino Gay Men
AN  - 1520342905; 201413358
AB  - While studies have considered how race has reshaped how children of immigrants adapt to US life, studies have not thoroughly considered how sexual identity affects their assimilation. With a focus on familial incorporation, this study draws from the narratives of second-generation Filipino and Latino gay men to show that sexual identity deeply shapes the degree to which gay children of immigrants are able to secure social support and moral acceptance from their parents. These men employ strategies to maintain rapport with their families before and after coming out of the closet, a process I term moral management. While this study focuses on a unique population, the findings have greater implications for uncovering the mechanisms of intergenerational conflict and consensus among immigrant populations, as well as the dynamics of overcoming social prejudices within minority communities.

T1  - A meta-analytic test of the imagined contact hypothesis
AN  - 1512219580; 201408606
AB  - Imagined intergroup contact (Crisp & Turner, 2009) is a new indirect contact strategy for promoting tolerance and more positive intergroup relations. Despite its relatively recent inception, there have now been over 70 studies showing that imagining a positive interaction with an outgroup member can reduce prejudice and encourage positive intergroup behavior. With this meta-analysis, we provide the first quantitative review of imagined contact effects on four key measures of intergroup bias: attitudes, emotions, intentions, and behavior. We also test for moderators arising from both group and study design characteristics. The analysis found that imagined contact resulted in significantly reduced intergroup bias across all four dependent variables (overall d+ = 0.35). The effect was significant for both published and unpublished studies, and emerged across a broad range of target outgroups and contexts. The effect was equally strong for explicit and implicit attitude measures, but was stronger on behavioral intentions than on attitudes, supporting the direct link between imagery and action proposedly underlying mental simulation effects. Most design characteristics had no significant impact, including valence of the imagined interaction, type of control condition, and time spent imagining contact. However, the more participants were instructed to elaborate on the context within which the imagined interaction took place, the stronger the effect. The imagined contact effect was also stronger for children than for adults, supporting the proposition that imagined contact is a potentially key component of educational strategies aiming to promote positive social change.

T1  - Changing the ideological roots of prejudice: Longitudinal effects of ethnic intergroup contact on social dominance orientation
AN  - 1512218304; 201408603
AB  - Social dominance orientation (SDO) has been reported to be strongly related to a multitude of intergroup phenomena, but little is known about situational experiences that may influence SDO. Drawing from research on intergroup contact theory, we argue that positive intergroup contact is able to reduce SDO-levels. The results of an intergroup contact intervention study among high school students (Study 1, N = 71) demonstrated that SDO levels were indeed attenuated after the intervention. Furthermore, this intervention effect on SDO was especially pronounced among students reporting a higher quality of contact. A cross-lagged longitudinal survey among adults (Study 2, N = 363) extended these findings by demonstrating that positive intergroup contact is able to decrease SDO over time. Moreover, we did not obtain evidence for the idea that people high in SDO would engage less in intergroup contact. These findings indicate that intergroup contact erodes one of the important socio-ideological bases of generalized prejudice and discrimination.

T1  - Witnesses to History: Children's Views of Race and the 2008 United States Presidential Election
AN  - 1504424052; 201407966
AB  - The 2008 presidential election presented a unique opportunity to examine children's attention to racial issues in politics. We conducted interviews with 6- to 11-year-old children (70 boys, 60 girls; 29 African Americans, 58 European Americans, 43 Latinos) within 3 weeks prior to and after the election. Interview questions concerned knowledge, preferences, and perceptions of others' attitudes concerning the election, views of the implications of the election for race relations, and personal aspirations to become president. Results indicated that children were highly knowledgeable about Obama's status as the first African American president. Most children felt positively about the presence of an African American candidate for president, although a few children showed clear racial prejudice. Overall, children expected others to show racial ingroup preferences but simultaneously endorsed the optimistic view that Obama's race was a slight asset in his bid for the presidency. Older children were somewhat more likely to view Obama's race as negatively impacting his chances of being elected than younger children. African American and Latino children were more interested in becoming president than European American children; aspiration rates did not change from pre- to post-election.

T1  - Don't Bi-Negative: Reduction of Negative Attitudes Toward Bisexuals by Blurring the Gender Dichotomy
AN  - 1463011648; 201347136
AB  - Bisexual people suffer from stereotypes and negative attitudes. The authors investigated one possible explanation for this bi-negativity: that bisexuality, being nonmonosexual, challenges the deep-rooted dichotomous gender construct. Sixty-two participants were randomly assigned to read one of two vignettes: One blurred gender differences, the other emphasized them. Results showed first that there was greater bi-negativity among men compared to women. Among participants who were not personally acquainted with bisexuals, those in the blurring condition displayed less bi-negativity than those in the emphasizing condition. Findings suggest that the binary gender construct can indeed interfere with acceptance of bisexuals. This, in turn, suggests a way to reduce bi-negativity and thus may prove beneficial in improving the well-being of the bisexual community. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Explicit and implicit attitudes of Scottish and Maltese children to national identity
AN  - 1373430246; 201329751
AB  - This paper utilised a combination of explicit and implicit techniques to investigate the ways in which children aged 5-16 from two small European nation-states develop in-group favouritism, and positive and/or negative attitudes towards other nation-states. The study adopted a combination of data collection approaches to gain greater evaluation of variability in the responses obtained. Data were analysed statistically for both quantitative and qualitative data. The findings show self-regulation of overt negativity and clearly demonstrate some disquieting outcomes. It poses questions of the extent to which social norms of xenophobia and racism disseminated to children through access to an adult directed media; and what interventions might diminish out-group negativity and prejudice whilst maintaining a level of in-group favouritism that delivers personal self-esteem, and provides the basis for national regard that does not compromise the rights of others.

T1  - Race, Ideology, and the Tea Party: A Longitudinal Study
AN  - 1371428234
AB  - The Tea Party movement, which rose to prominence in the United States after the election of President Barack Obama, provides an ideal context in which to examine the roles of racial concerns and ideology in politics. A three-wave longitudinal study tracked changes in White Americans’ self-identification with the Tea Party, racial concerns (prejudice and racial identification), and ideologies (libertarianism and social conservatism) over nine months. Latent Growth Modeling (LGM) was used to evaluate potential causal relationships between Tea Party identification and these factors. Across time points, racial prejudice was indirectly associated with movement identification through Whites’ assertions of national decline. Although initial levels of White identity did not predict change in Tea Party identification, initial levels of Tea Party identification predicted increases in White identity over the study period. Across the three assessments, support for the Tea Party fell among libertarians, but rose among social conservatives. Results are discussed in terms of legitimation theories of prejudice, the “racializing” power of political judgments, and the ideological dynamics of the Tea Party.

T1  - Demographic group differences in adolescents' time attitudes
AN  - 1364702938; 201326312
AB  - In the present study, we examined demographic differences in time attitudes in a sample of 293 adolescents. Time attitudes were measured using the Adolescent Time Attitude Scale (Mello & Worrell, 2007; Worrell, Mello, & Buhl, 2011), which assesses positive and negative attitudes toward the past, the present, and the future. Generally, African Americans and Asian Americans reported higher scores for negative time attitudes and lower scores for positive time attitudes than European Americans and Latinos, with medium sizes. Adolescents in the low socioeconomic status group reported a less favorable evaluation of their past than middle and high SES peers, but there were no meaningful differences in time attitudes by gender. Findings indicate that middle SES adolescents, high school juniors and seniors, Latinos, and European Americans had higher representation in positive time attitude clusters (i.e., Positives and Balanced) than high SES adolescents, high school freshmen and sophomores, and African Americans.

T1  - Corporal Punishment: Examining Attitudes Toward the Law and Factors Influencing Attitude Change
AN  - 1356867569
AB  - There remains considerable societal support for child corporal punishment, despite much research about its ineffectiveness and potential harm to children. We examined attitudes toward Section 43 of the Canadian Criminal Code which gives parents the right to use reasonable physical force for discipline purposes. We also examined attitude change and predictors of this change. Participants (Nâ[euro][per thousand]=â[euro][per thousand]212) completed an on-line study, which found that 39.2Â % disagreed with ending Section 43. Upon presentation of corporal punishment-related information, the majority (63.8â[euro]"70.5Â %) now indicated being in favor of ending Section 43. Attitude change was highest for information on the potential for child abuse. Socio-demographics (ethnicity, religion), childhood disciplinary experiences (non-punitive discipline), and discipline perceptions (parental warmth/involvement) predicted attitude change. Results indicate that providing information about corporal punishment is key to changing attitudes toward parentsâ[euro](TM) legal right to its use. Also, parental background and childhood discipline characteristics may differentially influence the amount of attitude change.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

This study examined associations between perpetration or victimization and attitudes toward IPV with data from a longitudinal randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an HIV prevention intervention among school students in three sites in South Africa and Tanzania. Data analyses were confined to students from the control group only, and to those with experience with romantic relationships. Boys and those more involved with violence reported more violence-supportive attitudes. For Cape Town (and to some extent Mankweng), the results of prospective prediction are consistent with the notion of a bidirectional attitudes-behavior interrelationship. For Dar es Salaam attitudes predicted behavior prospectively; however, prediction in the opposite direction was not confirmed. These results indicate that attitude change strategies may be useful complementary to structural approaches also in global South settings, although their effectiveness may vary.

T1  - Budding Multiculturalism or Veiled Indifference? Inter-Group Contact Among Immigrant and Native-Born Adolescents in Small-Town Canada
AN  - 1492600180; 201401039
AB  - Drawing on qualitative research examining the integration experiences of immigrant adolescents in a small city (Fredericton population 50,535) and rural town (Florenceville-Bristol population 1,500) in New Brunswick, Canada, this article presents daily encounters between young immigrants and their native-born peers. It argues the citizens of Florenceville-Bristol are able to compensate for the absence of formal programming for immigrant youth by finding creative ways to communicate with the immigrant adolescents, recognizing their strengths and abilities, and including them in activities and structures where they would have the best fit. It concludes that cross-cultural interaction in our daily lives brings a more positive multicultural experience to communities when Allport's (1954) four necessary conditions for contact to result in the reduction of prejudice are met.

T1  - Public duty and private prejudice: sexualities equalities and local government
AN  - 1364702415; 201326421
AB  - Rather than critiquing social institutions and practices that have historically excluded lesbians and gay men, as did earlier social movements in the 1960s and 1970s, since the 1990s the politics of sexuality has increasingly been about demanding equal rights of citizenship. These citizenship demands have, at least to a degree, been answered via a raft of recent legislation in the UK including the Adoption and Children Act 2002, Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003, Gender Recognition Act 2004 and the Civil Partnership Act 2004, and by associated changes in policy making and practice that emphasize 'Equality and Diversity'. In this article we consider how the implementation of sexualities equalities policies is related to processes of privatization and individualization. This is illustrated by using sexualities equalities work in local government as a case study to indicate how processes of change and resistance are aided by these processes. The article draws on findings from a study of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) equalities initiatives in local government in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which examined the views of those who now have a public duty to implement recent legislative and policy shifts and are obliged to develop equalities initiatives concerning 'sexual orientation' and 'gender reassignment'.

T1  - HETERONORMATIVITY IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN ZAGREB: YOUNG MEN WEARING MAKE-UP, KISSING AND WALKING PROUDLY
AN  - 1504421991; 201407222
AB  - This paper analyses the presence and characteristics of heteronormativity in the context of the Croatian school system by focusing on secondary schools in the capital of Zagreb. We base our analysis on the results of a survey on opinions and attitudes regarding homosexuality conducted on a sample of 322 students and 117 teachers in nine secondary schools. The research reveals that stereotypes and prejudice towards lesbians and gays are omnipresent and widespread. Both students and teachers hold highly discriminatory attitudes concerning the visible/public expression of non-heteronormative gender and sexual identities. In addition, almost one-third of all students reported having resorted to verbal/physical violence against a person because of their alleged homosexual orientation. Moreover, we explore the research findings in relation to the (non)existence and (in)visibility of LGBT issues in school curricula and textbooks. In addition, we consider the recent (September 2012) introduction of a Health Education curriculum which for the first time introduces into Croatian schooling the topics of 'acceptance of sexual diversity' and 'stigmatisation and discrimination of sexual minorities'. Finally, we outline public debates and reactions to this 'introduction of homosexuality to Croatian schools' coming from the Croatian Catholic Church and faith-based organisations.

T1  - AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN AND SELF-ESTEEM: THE VARIOUS SOURCES
AN  - 1464753692
AB  - As a result of prejudice and discrimination, African American women are likely to experience adversity. We examined possible sources of self-esteem among 16 African American Women utilizing a mixed design (i.e., quantitative and qualitative). Quantitative data was gathered through objective measures (i.e., Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, Reflected Appraisal Scale, Revised African American Identity Scale, Womanist Identity Attitude Scale, and Feminist Identity Scale). Qualitative data was obtained through an unstructured interview. Results indicated that religion, specifically, having a good relationship with God influenced self-esteem. Family closeness related to self-esteem and role models enhanced identity development as well as self-esteem. Based on these findings, socialization factors may assist in maintaining self-esteem in dealing with adversity for African American women. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Elder care as 'frustrating' and 'boring': Understanding the persistence of negative attitudes toward older patients among physicians-in-training
AN  - 1738476543; 201539283
AB  - Objectives This study explores the attitudes of physicians-in-training toward older patients. Specifically, we examine why, despite increasing exposure to geriatrics in medical school curricula, medical students and residents continue to have negative attitudes toward caring for older patients. Methods This study used ethnography, a technique used by anthropologists that includes participant-observation, semi-structured interviews, and facilitated group discussions. Research was conducted at two tertiary-care academic hospitals in urban Northern California, and focused on eliciting the opinions, beliefs, and practices of physicians-in-training toward geriatrics. Results We found that the majority of physicians-in-training in this study expressed a mix of positive and negative views about caring for older patients. We argue that physicians-in-trainings' attitudes toward older patients are shaped by a number of heterogeneous and frequently conflicting factors, including both the formal and so-called 'hidden' curricula in medical education, institutional demands on physicians to encourage speed and efficiency of care, and portrayals of the process of aging as simultaneously as a 'problem' of inevitable biological decay and an opportunity for medical intervention. Discussion Efforts to educate medical students and residents about appropriate geriatric care tend to reproduce the paradoxes and uncertainties surrounding aging in biomedicine. These ambiguities contribute to the tendency of physicians-in-training to develop moralizing attitudes about older patients and other patient groups labeled 'frustrating' or 'boring'.

T1  - Older people and sexuality: Double jeopardy of ageism and sexism in youth-dominated societies
AN  - 1559004025; 201433590
AB  - Sexuality is an important determinant of health and wellbeing for all ages. The capacity and desire for emotional and sexual intimacy and pleasure is important for people throughout their lives. The issue of older people and sexuality has largely been ignored with the focus being almost entirely on fertility and reproductive aspects of sexuality, thus favouring the young and reproductive individuals. Various historical and cultural contexts shape the practices and perception of older people's sexuality in Africa. What is evident is the existence of myths and prejudices that sexuality is unimportant for older people, and this concern draws our attention to the presence of ageism in this sphere of life. Further, it is crucial to underscore the double jeopardy faced by older women where they not only face prejudice due to age, but are confronted with sexism as well where sexuality of older men is more tolerated than for their female age counterparts. The ageist and sexist attitude towards older people's sexuality need to be addressed across multi-disciplinary perspectives. Negative attitudes towards older people's sexuality is not only disempowering as it is likely to inhibit open expressions of sexuality, but it can prevent healthy sexuality.

T1  - Prejudicial behavior: More closely linked to homophilic peer preferences than to trait bigotry
AN  - 1417524791; 201332089
AB  - We disagree with Dixon et al. by maintaining that prejudice is primarily rooted in aversive reactions toward out-group members. However, these reactions are not indicative of negative attributes, such as trait bigotry, but rather normative homophily for peers with similar perceived attributes. Cognitive biases such as stereotype threat perpetuate perceptions of inequipotential and subsequent discrimination, irrespective of individuals' personality characteristics.

T1  - Homosexuality, Religion, and Science: Moral Authority and the Persistence of Negative Attitudes
AN  - 1559006307; 201433612
AB  - The liberalization of attitudes toward homosexuality in the United States over the past 30 years is well documented. Despite these changes, substantial resistance to equality for gay men and lesbians remains. Previous studies indicate that beliefs about the etiology of homosexuality are central to this discussion. Those who believe homosexuality is innate are more favorable, while those who believe it is the result of a choice are more negative. Moreover, experimental research indicates that those with negative views actually become more opposed when a natural explanation is proposed. This study highlights the importance of perceived sources of epistemic and moral authority for understanding views of homosexuality. Using stances on culturally controversial issues involving 'science and religion' as indicators of where individuals place authority, we outline the connection between perceptions of moral authority and attributions about homosexuality. Analyses of a national survey of American adults show that, net of controls, one's stance on moral authority is the strongest predictor of attributions about whether homosexuality is chosen or innate.

T1  - How Do U.S. Students Perceive Trans Persons
AN  - 1364703922; 201327807
AB  - This study explored undergraduate students' interpersonal responses, namely general feelings toward and desire for further social interaction with trans persons in a helping context. Secondarily, this study explored the relationship between participants' intrinsic empathy, interpersonal curiosity and interest in further interaction. Two hundred fifty-one undergraduates at a moderate sized university in the southeastern United States served as participants. In order to assess baseline levels of empathy and curiosity, participants in session 1 completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Scale (Davis 1983) and the Interpersonal Curiosity Scale (Litman and Pezzo 2007). One week later, during session 2, the same students assumed the role of a peer counselor and read 1 of 4 (male, female, male-to-female, female-to-male) randomly assigned versions of an intake form completed by a fictitious peer client. Each version was identical, with the exception of the gender identity of the peer client. Participants completed various measures of affect and interest in further interaction. Male participants reported less willingness to interact with, and the strongest negative feelings toward the FTM peer client. Men reported highest willingness to interact with the MTF client and showed the lowest negative reactions towards the MTF client. Female participants' scores on willingness to interact and on negative reactions were similar across all four intake form versions. Contrary to expectations, baseline levels of empathy and curiosity did not impact responses to gender expression. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the factors associated with anti-transgender prejudice particularly in the context of helping relationships. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Does Higher Education Expansion Reduce Credentialism and Gender Discrimination in Education
AN  - 1322719147; 201313774
AB  - This paper investigates the effects of higher education expansion on the phenomena of credentialism and gender discrimination in education. Using the survey data of Family Income and Expenditure by DGBAS, Taiwan from 1980 to 2009, we examine the time path of the effect of higher education expansion on household expenditures for children's education in Taiwan for five sub-periods: 1980-1990, 1991-1995, 1996-2000, 2001-2005, and 2006-2009. We show that, surprisingly, although the higher education expansion during the 1990s lowers the requirement of college entrance, credentialism seems to continue to prevail in the Taiwanese society. However, the higher education expansion does change parents' attitude on female children's education and increase the possibility for female children to attain higher education.

T1  - 'Subutex is safe': Perceptions of risk in using illicit drugs during pregnancy
AN  - 1680150972; 201516010
AB  - Background The dominant biomedical discourse stresses the physiological risks to the foetus or newborn posed by the prenatal use of illicit drugs. There is also a strong moral incentive for pregnant women to abstain from drugs. Yet few researchers have explored how pregnant, drug-using women themselves perceive the risks involved. The present paper investigates the reasoning by women about risks involved in prenatal drug use. Theoretically, a socio-cultural approach to risk is taken. Methods The paper is based on fourteen ethnographic interviews with women who had used illicit drugs during pregnancy (mainly buprenorphine), had recently given birth and had regularly used prenatal services during pregnancy. The interviews were informal, semi-structured and focused on the women's experiences of pregnancy and service use. Each interview lasted about an hour. The interviews were transcribed and inductively analysed using thematic coding. Risk perceptions were identified in the interviewees' expressions and understanding of fears, dangers, threats and worries. Results The women were not primarily concerned about health risks: their greatest fears in connection with the prenatal use of illicit drugs were giving birth to a child with withdrawal symptoms, child protection interventions and child removal, encountering negative attitudes in seeking professional help as well as terminating drug use. The interviewees did not see abstaining from drugs as a risk-free option. On the contrary, the prospect of a drug-free life was filled with fears linked to physical and mental pain and disruptions in significant social bonds. The women made use of biomedical and nonprofessional understandings of risks. The women's friends and acquaintances played a central role as providers of knowledge about risks. Conclusion When providing health education to pregnant women with drug problems, professionals should take women's perceptions of risk seriously, treat the women respectfully and engage them in dialogue about the risks involved. Further studies on pregnant women's perceptions of risk in using illicit drugs would be highly valuable. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

T1  - Caring for Grandparents With Alzheimer's Disease: Help From the "Forgotten" Generation
AN  - 1347783967; 201321416
AB  - This study examined adolescent grandchildren's contributions to caregiving for grandparents with Alzheimer's disease. It was predicted that grandchildren would provide more care when parents experienced greater burden, and when adolescents had higher quality relationships with parents and grandparents. It was also hypothesized that these factors would predict higher levels of social commitment and more positive attitudes toward the provision of long-term care. Twenty-nine adolescents and their parents participated in the telephone interview study. Adolescents rated the amount of care they provided to grandparents, relationship quality with grandparents and parents, social responsibility, and attitudes toward the provision of long-term care. Parents reported levels of caregiver burden. Results indicated that grandchildren provided more help when parents provided more care and when grandchildren had greater affection for grandparents. Adolescent grandchildren exhibited lower levels of social responsibility and more negative attitudes toward the provision of long-term care when fathers experienced higher subjective burden.

T1  - When the direct route is blocked: The extended contact pathway to improving intergroup relations
AN  - 1283642022; 201303583
AB  - Direct intergroup contact can be described as the "royal road" to reducing prejudice and intergroup conflict. Although direct contact with an outgroup member may be limited, a promising alternative route is that of extended (indirect) contact. According to extended contact theory, awareness that ingroup members have outgroup friends can improve people's relations with the outgroup. A key issue that has not been addressed is how the amount of direct and extended contact interact to affect intergroup relations. Three field-based studies demonstrated that when direct contact is low, higher levels of extended contact predict lower prejudice and higher voluntary engagement with outgroup culture, both cross-sectionally (Studies 1 and 2) and longitudinally (Study 3). However, when direct contact is high, extended contact does not affect intergroup relations. These findings show that only when there is limited opportunity for direct contact, awareness of larger numbers of ingroup-outgroup friendships can be very effective for improving intergroup relations.

T1  - Foreign Wars and Domestic Prejudice: How Media Exposure to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Predicts Ethnic Stereotyping by Jewish and Arab American Adolescents
AN  - 1283637696; 201305725
AB  - This study was based on the theory that adolescents view scenes of violent ethnic conflicts in the mass media through the lens of their own ethnicity, and that the resulting social-cognitive reactions influence their negative stereotypes about similar ethnic groups in their own country. We interviewed 89 Jewish and 180 Arab American high school students about their exposure to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, their social cognitive reactions to it, and their stereotypes toward ethnic groups. Beyond the effects of ethnic identity, the degree to which adolescents identified with Israelis and Palestinians in the media was a key variable linking exposure to media depictions of the conflict and the implicit ethnic stereotypes they displayed about Jewish Americans and Arab Americans.

T1  - Gender, Religion and an Immigrant Minority: Jewish women and the suffrage movement in Britain c.1900-1920
AN  - 2115202247
AB  - Middle- and upper-class Jewish women enjoyed less equality within their faith communities than Christian counterparts. They were represented in every strand of the suffrage movement, and in 1912 formed the Jewish League for Woman Suffrage (JLWS), modelled on similar Christian leagues. A study of the origins of the JLWS, and its relations with parallel organisations, shows religious difference to have been no barrier, and even conducive to, cross-denominational collaboration. The JLWS confounded (largely male) communal expectations that it would not influence London's East End, and would exacerbate prejudice against Jews. Post-1918, Jewish women were denied the level of equality within their faith congregations achieved by their Christian peers.

T1  - Authoritarianism, Social Dominance, and Prejudice Among Junior Police Officers: The Role of the Normative Context
AN  - 1221411901; 201243923
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the respective impact of group socialization and social projection to explain prejudice among newly recruited police officers (N = 301). The first approach predicts that both Eight-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO), two fundamental determinants of prejudice, should be driven by specific norm. The second approach predicts that the perceived norms of the reference group reflect the social projection of our own altitudes and norms. These two models were tested with structural equation modeling. Emphasizing the determinant role of social norms and social influence, the results provide stronger support for the group socialization model (GSM) than the social projection model (SPM).

T1  - THE EFFECT OF WOMEN'S STATUS AND COMMUNITY ON THE GENDER DIFFERENTIAL IN CHILDREN'S NUTRITION IN INDIA
AN  - 899273924; 21401977
AB  - Summary              This study uses the third National Family Health Survey (2005-06) in India to investigate whether differences in women's status, both at the individual and community levels, can explain the persistent gender differential in nutritional allocation among children. The results show that girls are less likely than boys to receive supplemental food and more likely to be malnourished. In general it appears that higher women's status within a community, as well as higher maternal status, have beneficial effects on a daughter's nutritional status. Further, the moderating effects of community appear to be more consistent and stronger than the individual-level characteristics. A positive relationship between the percentage of literate women in a community and the gender differential in malnutrition appears to be an exception to the general findings regarding the beneficial nature of women's status on a daughter's well-being, showing the need for more than just basic adult literacy drives in communities to overcome the problem of daughter neglect.

T1  - Has the Child Welfare Profession Discovered Nepotistic Biases?
AN  - 893390025; 22388880
AB  - A major trend in foster care in developed countries over the past quarter century has been a shift toward placing children with "kin" rather than with unrelated foster parents. This change in practice is widely backed by legislation and is routinely justified as being in the best interests of the child. It is tempting to interpret this change as indicating that the child welfare profession has belatedly discovered that human social sentiments are nepotistic in their design, such that kin tend to be the most nurturant alloparents. Arguably, however, the change in practice has been driven by demographic, economic, and political forces rather than by discovery of its benefits. More and better research is needed before we can be sure that children have actually benefitted.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Factors Associated with Attributions About Child Health Conditions and Social Distance Preference
AN  - 896167249; 201121305
AB  - In order to better understand factors that account for the emergence and persistence of negative attitudes towards mental health problems, attributions about and stigma towards children's mental and physical illnesses were examined using National Stigma Study-Children data. Parent blame attributions were most strongly associated with attention deficit disorder, environmental causes with depression, and biology with asthma. Parent blame was more frequent for mental than physical health conditions. Child blame was associated with higher preferred social distance from the child, but no clear links were observed between social distance and attributions about genetic/biology, environment, or parent blame. Rurality was not significantly associated with attributions or social distance preference. Higher educational achievement was associated with increased endorsement of environmental stress factors and reduced odds of child blaming. The general public holds complex explanatory models of and nuanced responses to children's mental disorders that need further investigation, including effects on parents' and children's help-seeking.

T1  - Language diversity in the classroom
AN  - 868337965
AB  - Edwards notes that the empirical findings of sociolinguistics have not permeated teacher education deeply enough to radically change teachers' beliefs about deficit model explanations; however, the book's straightforward dismissal of deficit explanations as scientifically indefensible--essentially the approach Edwards notes has not succeeded--is also not likely to change teachers' negative attitudes about nonstandard dialects.

Edwards cites, among other examples, Brown v. Board of Education, the Oakland Ebonics controversy, and Bill Cosby as evidence that educators and the public often fail to understand covert prestige and react negatively to nonstandard dialects.

First discussed are the unfair practices that were once common in North American education that, among other things, encouraged children to abandon foreign languages in an attempt to assimilate to English as quickly as possible, which, as Edwards astutely notes, reduced the cultural resources in a classroom/school.

Edwards suggests it is more appropriate to think of English language learners (ELLs) not as academic liabilities but instead as an academic resource for non-ELL students: "the value of learning about one's own groups seems reasonable, but it may also be valuable to require all pupils to learn the same things" (186).

T1  - Urban Career Women and Stress in Southeast Asia
AN  - 1429636589; 201336299
AB  - A theoretical and conceptual review of stressors facing urban career women in southeast Asian countries is presented within a chronological age-bracket framework. Similarities and distinguishing differences from findings in the United States, Europe, and Australia are discussed. Younger attractive women were more likely to encounter sexual harassment and be taken less seriously at work. In the middle years, family demands with young children pose more of a distraction for the women. Southeast Asian career women have an edge compared to their Western counterparts in better access to support for household duties and child-minding from live-in maids and parents. However, they are expected to care for elderly parents and be responsible for efficient home management. In higher management appointments, they face similar stressors in critical perceptions of their authority and leadership by both men and women subordinates. Management initiatives to inculcate attitude change and transparency in addressing convoluted and irrelevant gender-role expectations can yield substantial organizational benefits.

T1  - An Examination of Gender Role Attitude Change Patterns Among Continuously Married, Divorced, and Remarried Individuals
AN  - 902082699; 201123645
AB  - Gender role attitudes influence marital satisfaction and stability and are typically treated as stable traits in adulthood. Theory and retrospective studies suggest changes in the life course based on relationship histories; however, tests of these assumptions are virtually nonexistent. Analyses from a longitudinal, nationally representative U.S. sample of 590 married individuals who vary in their marital experiences revealed both period effects and distinct within-group change patterns. Over a 20-year time period all demonstrate a shift toward more egalitarian attitudes. However, contrary to retrospective accounts asserting a steep increase in egalitarian attitudes in remarriages, prospective data from men and women indicate a curvilinear pattern over time that is distinct from patterns observed for continuously married and divorced/not remarried individuals.

T1  - When support for language revitalization is not enough: the end of indigenous language classes at Warm Springs Elementary School
AN  - 896199787; 201120847
AB  - This paper examines the termination of indigenous language classes at a small public elementary school in the United States, from the perspective of both nonindigenous school teachers whose classrooms were used to conduct the classes and the parents whose children participated in the classes. Interviews with both groups reveal general support for language teaching, but opposing views about the inclusion of such classes in the public school setting. I argue that their differing perspectives do not reflect negative attitudes on the part of the teachers about the language itself, but rather that teachers experience both national and local factors that do not favor indigenous language teaching. These factors include differences in expectations about student behavior and language class results, as well as federal and statewide pressure to produce improvement in student performance in English reading and math. This research demonstrates that general support for indigenous language teaching is not sufficient for the successful incorporation of classes into schools. A number of issues pertaining to national and local educational goals must also be considered. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Professional Rugby League Players As Reading Mentors For Primary School Boys
AN  - 919902832; 201202940
AB  - This paper reports on case studies spanning four consecutive years (2005- 2008)focused on addressing and challenging Australian primary school boys' disengagement with English, particularly reading, using an action research process informed by both quantitative and qualitative data. Primary participants were all male and ranged from 8 to 11 years of age. Boys were identified and selected for each case study based on the questionnaire and interview results from whole grade surveys of both males and females. The data results identified the boys with negative views of literacy and boys who identified reading as being a feminine activity, thereby narrowing their perceptions of masculinity. These boys were involved in a reading/mentoring program with high profile professional Rugby League players. The celebrity rugby league players were involved in ten weekly mentoring and reading sessions with male participants each year. These sessions focused on building positive male identity, shifting negative attitudes to reading and challenging negative stereotypes of both professional sportsmen and boys as readers. After each of the case studies, quantitative and qualitative data indicated a positive change in the participants' attitudes towards reading as well as their perceived stereotypes of males as readers and increased involvement in voluntary reading.

T1  - Age and Skin Tone as Predictors of Positive and Negative Racial Attitudes in Hispanic Children
AN  - 862596043; 201109727
AB  - Past research suggests that both White children and minority children, including Hispanics, hold pro-White biases. Although doll studies have been a popular way of assessing racial attitudes among children, several methodological issues have made it challenging to interpret the results from these studies. Furthermore, past research has failed to consider the independence of positive and negative attitudes. The present study utilized a revised doll technique to look at racial attitude development in 116 Hispanic children aged 3 to 10. Results contradict past findings, as the vast majority of the children showed no in-group bias (preference for Hispanics over other groups) or out-group bias (preference for other groups over Hispanics). Nonetheless, Hispanic children showed a slight preference for Whites over Blacks and Asians, and racial attitudes differed as a function of age and skin tone. Results from this study suggest that positive and negative attitudes are influenced by different factors. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

Although doll studies have been a popular way of assessing racial attitudes among children, several methodological issues have made it challenging to interpret the results from these studies. Furthermore, past research has failed to consider the independence of positive and negative attitudes. The present study utilized a revised doll technique to look at racial attitude development in 116 Hispanic children aged 3 to 10. Results contradict past findings, as the vast majority of the children showed no in-group bias (preference for Hispanics over other groups) or out-group bias (preference for other groups over Hispanics). Nonetheless, Hispanic children showed a slight preference for Whites over Blacks and Asians, and racial attitudes differed as a function of age and skin tone. Results from this study suggest that positive and negative attitudes are influenced by different factors.

T1  - The Level of Knowledge about Islam and Perception of Islam among Czech and Slovak University Students: does Ignorance Determine Subjective Attitudes?
AN  - 1417526802; 201333990
AB  - In this article, we examine existing levels of knowledge about Islam and other characteristics of respondents in regard to attitudes towards Islam and anti-Muslim prejudice. The analysis uses expectations derived from the integrated threat theory and inter-group contact theory when drawing on a questionnaire survey conducted among 716 university students interviewed in seven Czech and Slovak cities. Our results showed that the level of knowledge about Islam is negatively associated with perceived threats (such as fears of Islamic terrorism, and perception of problems with integration of Muslims into Czech/Slovak society) and, indirectly through the latter, with prejudice against Muslims. The analysis also confirmed some other (statistically more important) correlates of both perceived threats and anti-Muslim prejudice. These are personal contacts with Muslims and the Islamic world that are associated with more positive attitudes and affiliation to a church which is associated with more negative attitudes towards Islam.

T1  - Intergenerational attitude change regarding Female Genital Cutting in Yoruba speaking ethnic group of Southwest Nigeria: A qualitative and quantitative enquiry.
AN  - 1221407630; 201243971
AB  - The practice of female genital cutting is widespread in Nigeria and varies from one ethnic group to another. In 1994 Nigeria joined members of the 47th World Health Assembly in a resolution to eliminate the practice and since then several steps have been taken to achieve this objective. Sixteen years later, this study uses data from 420 women aged 15-49 years, who had at least one living daughter and who were systematically selected through stratified random sampling across the six states of southwest Nigeria. There were seven focused group discussions and in-depth interviews with fourteen women considered as specialist in female genital cutting to investigate the changes in female genital cutting prevalence among daughters and mothers; attitudes and beliefs of mothers towards female genital cutting and how the menace can be eradicated. The analysis indicated a prevalence rate of 75% and 71% for mothers and daughters respectively. It further indicated that the practice is rooted in tradition despite the fact that 52% of the respondents are aware of the health hazards of female genital cutting. Educated mothers were found to be less likely to favour the cutting of their daughters. It is suggested that educational campaigns towards parents should be intensified. Legal recourse, prohibition of operations, improvement in women's status and sex education is also suggested as means of eradicating the practice. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Can friendships be bipartisan? The effects of political ideology on peer relationships
AN  - 1018356361; 201212750
AB  - Although political ideology has been examined extensively as a predictor of individual differences, it has been absent in the interpersonal relationships literature. Political ideology may have strong effects on friendship patterns because of its polarizing nature. Findings among actual friendship groups (Study 1) indicated a degree of similarity in peers' political ideology alignments, but also suggested that liberals and conservatives were comfortable with some level of bipartisanship among their friends. In an experimental condition with hypothetical peers (Study 2), individuals' political ideology predicted their reported friendship potential (perceived similarity and desire for friendship) with gay-affirming and gay-disapproving peers whose ideologies were not explicitly indicated. This effect of political ideology on friendship potential was significant over and above the effect predicted by individuals' similarity or dissimilarity on sexual minority attitudes with these peers. Findings highlight the overarching relevance of political ideology as a factor that contributes to friendship patterns. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Eastern European Transformation and Youth Attitudes toward Violence
AN  - 1010631920; 201212340
AB  - This cross-national examination of the motives behind adolescent approval of violence in major cities in Germany and four Eastern European transformation societies (Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, Slovenia) draws on Institutional Anomie Theory (IAT), which leads us to expect higher instrumental motivation for violence among adolescents in the transforming societies. Differences in institutional structure and cultural orientations between Germany and the Eastern European societies are assessed using data from ILO and ESS. Analysis of the different motives for violence is based on data collected by the Criminological Research Institute of Lower Saxony (KFN) in Krakow, Volgograd, Ljubljana, Plzen, and Hamburg. Comparability and cross-cultural interpretability of the violence attitude measure is assessed by applying confirmatory factor analyses in multi-group comparisons. A lack of sufficient data meant that specific assumed linkages as implied by IAT could not be established, but the results for a specific instrumental/utilitarian motive for violence and for institutional structure and cultural orientations point to the utility of applying insights from IAT to understanding the dynamics of violence within the Eastern European context of transformation. We find empirical indications that specific features of the family mediate the "Eastern effect" on the instrumental/utilitarian motive. Further research is needed to discover whether economic dominance affects motives for youth violence indirectly via the socialization provided by non-economic institutions rather than directly via cultural orientations.

T1  - Essentialist theory of 'hybrids': From animal kinds to ethnic categories and race
AN  - 835111524; 201100426
AB  - This article presents a theory of the perception of hybrids, resulting from cross-breeding natural animals that pertain to different species and of children parented by couples with a mixed ethnic or racial background. The theory states that natural living beings, including humans, are perceived as possessing a deeply ingrained characteristic that is called 'essence' or 'blood' or 'genes' in everyday discourse and that uniquely determines their category membership. If, by whatever means, the genes or essences of two animals of different species are combined in a hybrid, the two incompatible essences collapse, leaving the hybrid in a state of non-identity and non-belonging. People despise this state and reject the hybrid (Study 1). This devaluation effect holds with cross-kind hybrids and with hybrids that arise from genetically combining animals from incompatible habitats across three cultures: Austria, India and Japan (Study 2). In the social world, groups and ethnic or racial categories frequently are essentialized in an analogue way. When people with an essentialist mindset judge ethnically or racially mixed offspring, they perceive a collapse of ethnic or racial essence and, consequently, denigrate these children, as compared to children from 'pure' in-group or out-group parents (Study 3). The findings are discussed in terms of the widespread 'yuck factor' against genetically modified animals, in terms of the cultural concepts of monstrosity and of racism and prejudice.

T1  - Abused and neglected children in court: Knowledge and attitudes
AN  - 758122954; 201059017
AB  - After maltreated children are taken into protective custody, dependency courts determine the children's placements. Many, if not most, maltreated children never attend their dependency court hearings. We had the rare opportunity to interview children in a jurisdiction where children regularly attend their detention hearings in dependency court. Our main goals were to assess maltreated children's knowledge and attitudes about their court experiences and identify predictors thereof. We also examined if the maltreated children desired greater participation in dependency court decisions. Immediately after attending their dependency court hearings, 7- to 10-year-olds were interviewed about their knowledge of, attitudes concerning, and participation in dependency court. Information was also extracted from the children's dependency court files. Lack of understanding and negative attitudes were common. Age predicted court knowledge, and age, anxiety, court knowledge, abuse type, and criminal court referral predicted attitudes. Qualitative findings included that a substantial minority of children did not feel believed or listened to, and most children wanted to return home. This research is relevant to current debates about the extent to which children should be involved in legal decisions. The results suggest that maltreated children may profit from greater understanding of dependency court. Moreover, the findings indicate that children often wish to have greater influence in dependency court decisions. Professionals should consider providing children involved in dependency court hearings with age-appropriate information about the legal proceedings. Children may also benefit in dependency hearings from the opportunity, directly or indirectly (through their attorneys), to give voice to their wishes and needs. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Cultural Orientation as a Moderator of the Relationship Between Chinese American Adolescents' Discrimination Experiences and Delinquent Behaviors
AN  - 734378301; 19834795
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among Chinese American adolescents' discrimination experiences, cultural orientations, and delinquent behaviors. Data were collected from three hundred and eleven Chinese American adolescents (58% girls) and their parents when the adolescents were 7th or 8th graders and again 4 years later. The data analyses demonstrated that adolescents' perceptions of discrimination and victimization experiences were significantly related to their delinquent behaviors conditionally based upon their cultural orientation. Specifically, adolescents' high Chinese cultural orientation amplified the negative impact of discriminatory experiences on delinquent behaviors whereas high Western cultural orientation protected them against that impact. The significance of both ethnic and mainstream cultural orientations for understanding ethnic minority adolescents' adjustment and improving their adjustment outcomes is discussed.
