AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the relationships between self-sacrifice and hope as well as the possible intervening roles of perceived family support and attitudes to aging in this relationship among Chinese older adults. A total of 475 older adults participated in the current study. They completed measures related to self-sacrifice, hope, perceived family support, and attitudes to aging. Attitudes to aging measured the extent to which older adults hold positive and negative attitudes toward aging in three domains of physical change, psychological growth, and psychosocial loss. The results showed that self-sacrifice was positively associated with older adults' hope. Mediation analyses revealed that perceived family support mediated the relationship between self-sacrifice and older adults' hope. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that attitudes to physical change moderated the relationship between self-sacrifice and older adults' hope, and attitudes to psychological growth moderated the relationship between perceived family support and older adults' hope. Specifically, the association between self-sacrifice and hope was stronger for older adults with less positive attitudes to physical change than for those with more positive attitudes to physical change. The association between perceived family support and hope was stronger for older adults with more positive attitudes to psychological growth than for those with less positive attitudes to psychological growth. The findings can contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between self-sacrifice and hope and can aid in designing effective interventions aimed at improving older adults' hope.

AB  - Although different types of teams increasingly employ embodied physical action (EPA) robots as a collaborative technology to accomplish their work, we know very little about what makes such teams successful. This paper has two objectives: the first is to examine whether a team's emotional attachment to its robots can lead to better team performance and viability; the second is to determine whether robot and team identification can promote a team's emotional attachment to its robots. To achieve these objectives, we conducted a between-subjects experiment with 57 teams working with robots. Teams performed better and were more viable when they were emotionally attached to their robots. Both robot and team identification increased a team's emotional attachment to its robots. Results of this study have implications for collaboration using EPA robots specifically and for collaboration technology in general.

AB  - The Global Trust Inventory (GTI), conceptually assessing trust in others ranging from close interpersonal relationships to relationships with government and financial institutions as a whole, was administered to representative online samples in 11 democratic states (N = 11,917 from Europe, the Americas, and New Zealand). A seven-factor solution had configural, metric, and reasonable scalar invariance in multi-group confirmatory factor analysis. Using latent profile analysis, individual-level measures of trust were derived that complement existing measures of social capital in their impact and implications. Western societies had proportionately more people with high propensity to trust, Catholic/European intermediate, and Latin American societies the least. A High Trust Profile had virtues associated with social capital: greater participation in political discussion, greater elaboration of political thinking, more community engagement, less prejudice, and greater participation in elections. A Low Trust Profile exhibited opposite tendencies. Demographically, high trust was associated with higher self-reported social status, home ownership, older age, and political conservatism. A more complex set of relationships differentiated two intermediate profiles, dubbed Moderate and Low Institutional Trust. Conceptually, the GTI operationalizes a holistic view of trust as a synthetic force that holds various aspects of society together, ranging from interpersonal to institutionalized relationships.

AB  - Purpose: To use mini-ethnographies narrating patient illness to improve the cultural competence of the medical students.
   Methods: Between September 2013 and June 2015, all sixth-year medical students doing their internship at a medical center in eastern Taiwan were trained to write mini-ethnographies for one of the patients in their care. The mini-ethnographies were analyzed by authors with focus on the various aspects of cultural sensitivity and a holistic care approach.
   Results: Ninety-one students handed in mini-ethnographies, of whom 56 were male (61.5%) and 35 were female (38.5%). From the mini-ethnographies, three core aspects were derived: 1) the explanatory models and perceptions of illness, 2) culture and health care, and 3) society, resources, and health care. Based on the qualities of each aspect, nine secondary nodes were classified: expectations and attitude about illness/treatment, perceptions about their own prognosis in particular, knowledge and feelings regarding illness, cause of illness, choice of treatment method (including traditional medical treatments), prejudice and discrimination, influences of traditional culture and language, social support and resources, and inequality in health care.
   Conclusions: Mini-ethnography is an effective teaching method that can help students to develop cultural competence. It also serves as an effective instrument to assess the cultural competence of medical students.

AB  - Introduction: The underutilization of kidney transplant as the preferred treatment for end-stage kidney disease is influenced by a lack of knowledge, poor attitudes, and various socio-demographic characteristics. Negative attitudes toward renal transplant disengage patients from the evaluation process and often hinder their likelihood of receiving a transplant. Purpose: Determine whether a standardized educational session successfully improves knowledge and attitudes toward kidney transplant. Explore which socio-demographic variables are associated with more negative baseline attitude scores. Design: The program evaluation utilized a pre-test/post-test design to assess attitudes and knowledge toward renal transplant before and after an educational session. The pre- and post-surveys were distributed to a convenience sample of 341 and 115 patients, respectively, between the months of September and December 2019. Results: Exposure to a kidney transplant education program resulted in greater levels of knowledge (P = 0.019, d = 0.334). Individuals with no college education were found to have more negative baseline attitudes toward renal transplantation (P = 0.048, d = 0.382). Conclusion: More research is needed to explore how knowledge, attitudes, and certain socio-demographic characteristics impact a patient's intention to pursue kidney transplant. Uncovering reasons as to why certain populations of individuals have more negative baseline attitudes toward kidney transplant may also provide clinicians and transplant programs with valuable information on how pre-transplant education can be tailored to meet the needs of specific populations.

AB  - Introduction: the phenomenon of unintended adolescent pregnancy continues to be a reproductive and public health concern in sub-Saharan Africa. Healthcare providers play an important role in influencing the use of contraceptives among adolescent girls. This study assessed knowledge and perceptions of healthcare providers regarding the use of modern contraceptives among adolescent girls in tfmlazi township, KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. Methods: this was a descriptive study involving 35 healthcare providers covering all 10 primary healthcare clinics in Umlazi township. Data collected through a structured questionnaire were coded, entered into Epi data manager (version 4.6) and exported to STATA (version 15.0) for analysis. Results: of the thirty-five healthcare providers that participated in this study, professional nurses (54.3%) and enrolled nurses (17.1%) constituted the majority. The mean age of the participants was 42.11 years, with 88.6% being females. More than a third (37.1%) of healthcare providers did not know whether or not modern contraceptives make users promiscuous, while more than half (57%) had negative attitudes towards adolescents exploring contraceptive methods. Healthcare providers viewed health systems challenges, such as poor working conditions, long queues, and contraceptives stock-outs, as deterrents towards the provision of quality sexual behaviour counselling and modern contraceptive education to users. Conclusion: poor health systems and negative behaviours by healthcare providers influences the delivery of family planning services in primary healthcare clinics and serve as barriers to quality family planning services provided to younger women.

AB  - Students recruited from psychology undergraduate university populations are commonly used in psychology research, including gambling studies. However, the extent to which the use of this subpopulation produces findings that can be extrapolated to other groups is questionable. The present study was designed to compare results from university-recruited psychology student gamblers to those obtained from a sample of gamblers recruited from the general population that also included students. An online survey measuring gambling behavior and Internet gambling, attitudes and knowledge about gambling and problem gambling severity was posted on websites accessed by gamblers. Participants were recruited from two sources, a psychology undergraduate university population (n = 461) and online websites (n = 4,801). Results showed university-recruited students differed significantly from both adults and students recruited from the general population in respect to demographic variables and gambling behavior. Psychology undergraduate students were younger, more likely to be female, and had lower incomes. When relevant demographic variables were controlled, psychology undergraduate students were found to gamble less frequently, at different times, and to be at lower-risk for gambling-related problems, but had more irrational beliefs and more negative attitudes towards gambling than gamblers recruited from the general population. Results suggest that caution should be used in extrapolating findings from research using university-recruited psychology student gamblers to wide community populations due to differences related to gambling thoughts, attitudes and behaviors.

AB  - Genomic Sequencing (GS) to identify high cancer risk will soon enter clinical practice at significant cost to the health system. This study aimed to quantify perceived value of GS to Australian cancer patients and their first-degree relatives participating in a genomic sequencing study, and factors associated with value. Participants were recruited upon consent to the genomics study. Eligible participants (with cancer of likely genetic etiology, or a first-degree relative) completed a questionnaire prior to GS. Willingness to pay was assessed via hypothetical trade-off scenarios of actionable result return rates of 1%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% or 50%. Of 348 probands and 213 relatives (92% and 93% response rate), 81% would consistently have GS for as little as a 1% actionable return rate. Participants would pay a median of $1,000 for return rates of at least 20% (probands) or 30% (relatives), and $300 for lower return rates. Probands with common cancers and negative attitudes to uncertainty were more likely to have GS; those with higher education were more willing to pay $1,000 and $3,000 for lower return rates. This study found high interest in, but lower willingness to pay for GS in cancer patients and their first-degree relatives, possibly due to inability to pay. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of how individuals in different risk circumstances, trade-off the risks, harms, and benefits of GS.

AB  - Background: Elderly patients are especially vulnerable to influenza and its complications but their vaccination coverage remains unsatisfactory.
   Design: Prospective study of hospitalized or ambulatory patients >= 65 years of age. A questionnaire on influenza vaccination was followed by short physician-administered verbal instruction on risk of 'heartattack and stroke' following influenza, ameliorated by vaccination.
   Results: Most patients (n = 100) had cardiovascular risk-factors, many had prior vascular disease. In 2018, 53 % did not intend to be vaccinated. None were aware of the association between influenza and risk of vascular events but when asked again <= 7 days after the intervention 34/53 (64 %) stated they will shortly get vaccinated. Charts of 27/34 recorded actual influenza vaccination when examined six weeks later (51 % of 'unwilling' patients). Together with the patients already planning to be vaccinated (47 + 27/100) the current target of 70 % vaccinated can be surpassed.
   Conclusion: Pending confirmation by a larger RCT, informing elderly patients of the substantial risk of vascular events following influenza and its modification by vaccination may constitute a simple, effective, costless and time-frugal method of changing many patients' often-negative attitudes towards seasonal influenza vaccination. The resulting increased vaccine uptake in vulnerable elderly patients, may improve their influenza-associated morbidity and mortality.
   Practice implications: Providers discussing seasonal influenza vaccination with their patients could inform them of the substantially increased risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke associated with acute influenza to overcome vaccine hesitancy.

AB  - Social media technologies have been widely adopted by governments to increase civic engagement, promote openness, and extend services. Previous research finds that public managers' attitudes are important predictors of social media adoption and successful implementation. Managers' attitudes may vary due to different organizational structures, functions, and operations based on department type or because departments vary along with key dimensions. This research investigates the following questions: (1) Does department type significantly predict public managers' attitudes toward social media, (2) does department type moderate the effect of predictors of managers' attitudes toward social media found in previous research, and (3) do the predictors of managers' attitudes toward social media found in previous research mediate attitude differences observed across different kinds of departments. Using data collected from a 2014 national web survey in the United States on technology in city government, we find department type is an important predictor of managers' attitudes toward social media use. The effects of other predictors of attitudes toward social media use were not moderated by department type. Instead, those predictors had similar effects regardless of department type. Some of the variables related to organizational characteristics and culture (e.g., social media use, innovativeness, and use of e-services) helped to explain differences between the attitudes of managers from different departments. Our findings are important for developing strategies to target managers' negative attitudes toward using social media, thus removing one of the barriers to successful technology implementation.

AB  - Implicit attitudes can be activated by the mere presence of the attitude object. They are assumed to guide behavior in demanding situations, including the educational context. Implicit attitudes toward racial minority students could be important in contributing to the disadvantages those students experience in school. This study employed three different measures to investigate implicit attitudes toward racial minority students among preservice teachers. The IAT and the AMP showed more negative implicit attitudes toward racial minority than toward racial majority students; the affective priming task revealed that implicit attitudes toward racial majority students were positive, while those toward racial minority students were neutral. Results are discussed in their implications for preservice teachers' judgments and behaviors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many studies have investigated university students' attitudes to people with mental disorder (PMD) but most have used medical student participants. No Scottish studies were found on this topic where students of a broad range of subjects had participated. A mixed methods research design was employed where the topic was qualitatively explored (n = 3) prior to quantification of perspectives via questionnaire use (n = 642). Only 10.3% of questionnaire respondents agreed that PMD tended to be more violent than others and only 3.7% believed keeping PMD in psychiatric hospitals made the campus safer. Over 94% disagreed that PMD caused their problems, but 20.3% disagreed that PMD often improved with treatment. Almost 4% reported unwillingness to work on a class project with PMD. Science students were significantly more likely than arts students to view PMD as: violent, unpredictable, blameworthy for their condition, people who should be kept away from campus, causing them to feel unsafe. International students were more likely to 'strongly agree' than European Union (EU) students that PMD should be kept off the campus. EU students were more willing to work on a class project with PMD than international students were. Postgraduate students exhibited several more negative attitudes than undergraduates; being more likely to see PMD as violent and less likely to work on a class project with PMD. The need for mental disorder stigma related education among students at Scottish universities should be assessed.

AB  - Aims. To examine factors associated with healthcare professionals' experiences and attitudes towards adult family-witnessed resuscitation in the emergency and intensive care units.
   Background. Family-witnessed resuscitation offers the option for patients' families to be present during in-hospital resuscitation. It is important to understand healthcare professionals' views about this practice to determine why, despite its benefits and general recommendation, this practice has not been widely implemented.
   Design. A descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional survey.
   Methods. A total of 390 Finnish and Polish Registered Nurses and physicians from six university hospitals took part in the study. A structured questionnaire that examined nurses' and physicians' experiences and attitudes was used. Data, collected between July December 2013, were analysed with descriptive statistics, logistic and multiple linear regression analyses.
   Results. The results indicated that healthcare professionals are not well experienced in family-witnessed resuscitation. The general attitude towards this practice is somewhat negative. Physicians seem more confident about overcoming process-related barriers than nurses. Having previous positive experiences of family-witnessed resuscitation was associated with a more positive attitude towards this practice. Consequently a previous negative experience was associated with more negative attitudes.
   Conclusion. Family-witnessed resuscitation awareness should be increased in daily clinical practice. It is important to find a way to improve experiences and attitudes of healthcare professionals related to this phenomenon. Furthermore, developing local guidelines and multidisciplinary training plans is needed to respond to the needs of patients and their families.

AB  - Recent changes in the sociopolitical US landscape calls for the examination of the level of quantitative misperception about undocumented immigration and its connection with immigration attitudes. Nationally representative survey data are used to analyze whether being misinformed about the proportion of US immigrants that are undocumented in 2015 is linked with abstract immigration attitudes and four immigration policy options in 2016. The results reveal that people who overestimated undocumented immigration-a common misperception-are more likely to report that all immigrants present symbolic threats to the country than are their accurately informed peers. Consistent with the especially high salience of the US-Mexico wall in this period, overestimators also place more importance on building the wall but not on other policy options. These findings have important theoretical and real-world implications, given the current social and political context and spillover effects on Latinx and other racialized communities.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study examine the social identity of Ultra-Orthodox students enrolled in institutions of higher learning in Israel, and specifically the ways in which the identity of Ultra-Orthodox students who interact with other groups on campus compares to the identity of self-segregated Ultra-Orthodox students. Traditionally, Ultra-Orthodox students have preferred self-segregated educational institutions. Today, however increasing numbers of Ultra-Orthodox Jews are enrolling in regular academic institutions. Although they study in separate, homogeneous classrooms, they interact with secular students within the framework of the institution.
   Design/methodology/approach A four-part questionnaire dealing with attributions, feelings, personal identities, and social proximity was administered to the Ultra-Orthodox students.
   Findings As hypothesized, the students in self-segregated institutions exhibited a different identity than the students in secular institutions. Contrary to the hypotheses, the self-segregated students had positive feelings toward secular Israeli students and a greater desire for social proximity than the more integrated group. Explanations center on structural identity theory.
   Originality/value In this naturalistic study, the encounters between Ultra-Orthodox students and other students in their academic institution were random, unplanned, and unmonitored, unlike previous studies of intergroup relations in institutions of higher education. These students were not involved in cooperative tasks, which theoretically could help improve the relationships between Ultra-Orthodox and secular students.

AB  - Aim: One of the major barriers in making a diagnosis and managing dementia in the Chinese American population is the stigma surrounding the disease. The goal of the present study was to examine differences in the stigma and perceptions of dementia and diabetes among Chinese Americans.
   Methods: A total of 449 Chinese Americans answered one survey with two self-administered, true/false questionnaires assessing stigma and perceptions toward dementia and diabetes. Higher total scores were associated with increased stigma and negative perceptions. The results of the two questionnaires were compared to assess for any differences in attitudes.
   Results: For the dementia questionnaire, the mean score was 5.58 (95% CI 5.37-5.79) with a standard deviation of 2.31. For the diabetes questionnaire, the mean score was 2.01 (95% CI 1.85-2.18) with a standard deviation of 1.76. Statistical analysis showed that Chinese Americans were more likely to hold stigmatized views toward dementia than diabetes (t=33.9, d.f.=448, P<0.01).
   Conclusions: The higher average score in the dementia questionnaire shows that there are greater stigma and negative perceptions of dementia in comparison with diabetes among Chinese Americans. Considering that stigma delays access to healthcare for dementia-related symptoms, efforts should be taken to minimize negative attitudes associated with dementia.

AB  - Modelling data have provided good evidence to support the efficacy of a minimum pricing policy for alcoholic beverages as a means to reduce alcohol consumption and risky and harmful drinking. The aim of the present study was to investigate attitudes and beliefs towards a minimum price policy for alcohol among members of the general public in Western Australia (WA). The study also explored what factors might promote acceptance of the policy. Eleven focus groups, comprising participants from a broad range of backgrounds in WA, were conducted. Using a facilitator-administered semistructured interview schedule participants discussed their beliefs about the policy and how its acceptability might be promoted. Transcriptions of discussions were analysed using qualitative inductive content analysis for emergent themes. Three major themes emerged: attitudes towards the policy, beliefs about effectiveness and strategies to increase acceptability. Participants expressed negative attitudes towards the policy and thought that it would lead to increased crime, drug use and financial strain. Participants identified the policy as unfair on disadvantaged groups, and suggested that individuals would find a way to procure alcohol regardless of minimum pricing policies. Suggestions to make the policy more acceptable included increasing alcohol education and directing the revenue towards alcohol reduction initiatives. Participants' negative views and perceived lack of effectiveness corroborate research conducted in the UK. Information and education campaigns aimed at reducing misunderstanding of the policy and highlighting its effectiveness may help to promote greater acceptability.

AB  - Purpose - Organizations are increasingly investing in disability-specific sensitization workshops. Yet, there is limited understanding about their hoped outcomes, that is, increased knowledge about disability-related issues and behavioral changes with respect to those with a disability. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effectiveness and boundaries of disability-specific sensitization training in organizations.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is an interview-based study where 33 employees from five industries across India were interviewed over the span of a year.
   Findings - The findings suggest that sensitization workshops are successful with regard to awareness generation. Paradoxically, the same awareness also reinforced group boundaries through "othering." Further, workshops resonated more so with individuals who already had some prior experience with disability, implying that voluntary sensitization is likely attracting those who have the least need of such sensitization. The findings also suggest that non-mandated interventions may not necessarily influence organizational level outcomes, especially if workshops are conducted in isolation from a broader organizational culture of inclusion.
   Originality/value - The present study helps outline effects of sensitization training initiatives and enhances our understanding about how negative attitudes toward persons with a disability can be overcome. The study also indicates how such training initiatives may inadvertently lead to "othering." Finally, this study offers suggestions to human resource managers for designing impactful disability sensitization workshops.

AB  - Evidence to inform rehabilitation service delivery for individuals with deafblindness, especially in the Indian context, is inadequate. Rehabilitation professionals often find it challenging to design rehabilitation interventions that promote participation for those with deafblindness. Therefore, our purpose was to understand the contextual factors that influence the participation of individuals with deafblindness in India from the perspectives of those who are involved in providing rehabilitation services to them. Using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) as a framework, we conducted two focus group discussions with 16 rehabilitation service providers in India. We used a content analysis approach to examine the data. Rehabilitation service providers perceived participation barriers to be linked primarily to the social environment. Specifically, participants identified four major factors acting as barriers, including (a) lack of awareness about deafblindness; (b) negative attitudes and stigma associated with disability; (c) lack of access to resources such as assistive technology and interpreter support; and (d) communication challenges associated with severe impairments. Facilitators include accessibility of the built environment for multisensory impairments, affordable technology, provision of an interpreter and personal support worker, and training on deafblindness for professionals. The participation of individuals with deafblindness could be enhanced by identifying and removing environmental barriers and improving knowledge about deafblindness among rehabilitation professionals for proper identification, assessment, and access to rehabilitation services.

AB  - Background: Negative attitudes toward breastfeeding in public have consistently been identified as a key barrier to breastfeeding continuation. In order to design effective social marketing campaigns to improve public attitude toward breastfeeding in public, it is critical to identify segments of the population who are less likely to support this activity, their underlying reasons, and the medium through which they can be reached. Research aim: The aims were to (a) identify the underlying dimensions that drive acceptance or opposition to breastfeeding in public, (b) test whether specific population segments were more or less likely to support breastfeeding in public, and (c) identify suitable media outlets to reach them. Methods: A cross-sectional survey testing agreement with 60 statements was administered online between May 2016 and May 2017 and was completed by 7190 respondents. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify 12 dimensions driving acceptance or opposition to breastfeeding in public. The influence of demographics and media consumption on attitudes toward breastfeeding in public was tested using Welch's t tests and one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Results: Acceptance of breastfeeding in public was found to differ with gender, age, religion, and parental and breastfeeding status, but not household income. Support for breastfeeding in public also varied with media consumption habits. Conclusions: This work lays the foundation to design effective social marketing campaigns aimed at increasing public support for breastfeeding in public.

AB  - Men who have sex with men (MSM) are often exposed to unequal treatment in societies worldwide as well as to various forms of stigma and discrimination in healthcare services. Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H) is a postconflict developing country located in Southeast Europe and the Western Balkans, where little is known about the experiences of MSM regarding their communities and interactions with healthcare services. The aim of this study was to explore the types of experiences MSM face and to assess the level of stigma and discrimination they are exposed to in this setting. We conducted twelve in-depth face-to-face interviews with MSM who were 16 to 45 years old and residing in B&H. The main findings indicated that they all experienced various levels of stigma, discrimination, prejudice and inequities in treatment and attitudes from different segments of society, including the health care sector, that prevented them from fully developing their human and health potential. Additionally, these experiences were adversely related to opportunities to receive good quality health care services due to the insufficiently educated and old-fashioned health professionals who sometimes believed in black magic practices. The findings present numerous opportunities for educational trainings and structural reform to create a society that provides and guarantees equal opportunities for all.

AB  - Throughout American history, formal laws and social norms have discouraged interracial romantic relationships. Interracial relationships blur the boundaries between racial groups, challenging the essentialized racial categories that define Whiteness as an exclusive, high status identity. Whites, who are the most resistant to interracial marriage of any racial group, have used their dominant position in American society to enforce norms against interracial relationships. Despite the importance of racial homogamy to White identity and status, we argue that gender roles make violating norms against intimate intergroup contact more costly for women than men, leading to Whites' greater resistance to interracial relationships involving White women. In a representative American sample using a natural quasi-experiment, as well as 3 follow-up lab experiments, we find that White women face differential social penalties for intimate intergroup contact-being perceived as gender deviant and low status within the group. By contrast, having a racial out-group partner did not influence status perceptions of men or Black women. Status perceptions of both individuals in the couple predicted attitudes toward the couple as a unit, leading to greater prejudice toward interracial relationships involving White women than White men. This research demonstrates the existence of a gendered double standard for intimate intergroup contact among Whites, revealing that gender norms play a critical role in the maintenance of American racial boundaries.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that intergroup contact, psychology's most-researched paradigm for reducing prejudice, has the "ironic" effect of reducing support for social change in disadvantaged groups. We conducted a preregistered meta-analytic test of this effect across 98 studies with 140 samples of 213,085 disadvantaged-group members. As predicted, intergroup contact was, on average, associated with less perceived injustice (r = -.07), collective action (r = -.06), and support for reparative policies (r = -.07). However, these associations were small, variable, and consistent with alternative explanations. Across outcomes, 25%-36% of studies found positive associations with intergroup contact. Moderator analyses explained about a third of the between-sample variance, showing that, at least for perceived injustice, associations with intergroup contact were most consistently negative in studies that measured direct, qualitatively positive contact among adults. We also found evidence for an alternative explanation for the apparent "ironic" effects of intergroup contact as, after controlling for the positive association of negative contact with support for social change, positive contact was no longer associated with any of the outcomes. We close by discussing the strengths and limitations of the available evidence and by highlighting open questions about the relationship between intergroup contact and support for social change in disadvantaged groups.

AB  - As individuals who use their privilege to reduce prejudice, educate others about social justice, and actively stop discrimination, faculty allies can play a vital role in transforming universities to be more equitable, diverse, and inclusive. However, discrepancies persist in how faculty define privilege and communicate allyship. Drawing from standpoint theory, we examined discursive divergences in how 105 full-time faculty defined and experienced privilege and how they enacted allyship in the workplace. Participants tended to conceptualize privilege as a set of advantages and lack of structural barriers for people based on their group membership(s). Discursive differences emerged regarding the degree to which faculty participants perceived privilege to be un/earned and rooted in structural power, and some participants took ownership of their social privilege while others discursively elided it. When asked to identify specific ally actions, participants often described broad behaviors that aimed to help individuals in interpersonal contexts but did not address actions aimed at dismantling inequitable power structures, revising biased policies, and transforming toxic organizational cultures. Our findings highlight the need for trainings that clarify conceptualizations of privilege and help faculty translate their understanding of allyship into communicative actions that stop discrimination at interpersonal and institutional levels.

AB  - Psychologists' attempts to define and measure religion reveal substantial variability, a lack of consensus, cultural variation and differences between religions. A discursive psychology approach can address variability in meanings and the inferential issues that may inform claims to be religious. This paper identifies strategies used by Syrian Muslims and Christians to affirm, reformulate or deny religiousness. The analysis is based on a corpus of data generated through semi-structured interviews with 158 men and women. It shows how some speakers affirm that they are religious and treat this as a non-accountable matter. When asked to describe the basis of being religious, they produced descriptions of their own practices or a set of general criteria. Other speakers denied or modified 'being religious', using an 'x but not y' formulation to reject one meaning (for example, conformist) in favour of another (for example, believer). Some speakers' self-ascriptions were reinforced by characterizing their own views of religion as morals and good behaviour. Thus speakers deploy multiple meanings of religion for different purposes. Moreover their accounts address inferential and interpersonal problems that arise when claiming to be religious: specifically that others may infer extremism or conformity, or prejudice against members of other religions. The implications of these observations for social psychological studies of religion are discussed. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Stigma associated with HIV has been documented as a barrier for accessing quality health-related services. When the stigma manifests in the healthcare setting, people living with HIV receive substandard services or even be denied care altogether. Although the consequences of HIV stigma have been documented extensively, efforts to reduce these negative attitudes have been scarce. Interventions to reduce HIV stigma should be implemented as part of the formal training of future healthcare professionals. The interventions that have been tested with healthcare professionals and published have several limitations that must be surpassed (i.e., lack of comparison groups in research designs and longitudinal follow-up data). Furthermore, Latino healthcare professionals have been absent from these intervention efforts even though the epidemic has affected this population disproportionately.
   Methods: In this article, we describe an intervention developed to reduce HIV stigma among medical students in Puerto Rico. A total of 507 medical students were randomly introduced into our intervention and control conditions.
   Results: The results show statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups; intervention group participants had lower HIV stigma levels than control participants after the intervention. In addition, differences in HIV stigma levels between the groups were sustained for a 12-month period.
   Conclusions: The results of our study demonstrate the efficacy of the modes of intervention developed by us and serve as a new training tool for future healthcare professionals with regard to stigma reduction.

AB  - This study compared public versus private affection-sharing experiences of individuals in mixed-sex (N = 1018), same-sex (N = 561), and gender-diverse (N = 96) relationships. Private affection-sharing was similar across groups, except those in mixed-sex relationships reported somewhat less comfort doing so. Despite having a stronger desire to engage in public affection-sharing, those in same-sex and gender-diverse relationships shared public affection less frequently, were less comfortable doing so, refrained from doing so more often, and experienced much higher levels of vigilance related to public affection-sharing, compared to those in mixed-sex relationships. Heightened PDA-related vigilance may have health consequences, as higher levels were associated with worse psychological and physical well-being in all groups. However, individuals in same-sex relationships showed weaker associations between vigilance and well-being than those in mixed-sex relationships, suggesting possible resilience. Still, engaging in vigilance may take its toll, potentially serving as a mechanism through which minority stress works its effects. When we controlled for PDA-related vigilance, psychological and physical well-being levels in same-sex relationships increased relative to mixed-sex peers.

AB  - With the worldwide implementation of students' evaluation of teaching (SET), faculty attitudes and trust in students' feedback as well as possible defensive (i.e., self-protective) motivations seem most relevant to the facilitation of the primary organizational goal of SET, namely, teaching improvement. A questionnaire-administered to 2241 faculty members of all ranks in two dozen varied institutions-measured positive attitudes and trust, on the one hand, and beliefs in salient negative faculty SET myths, on the other hand. The most widely-held negative attitudes concerned student fallibilities: vindictiveness; lack of maturity; and negative evaluations of low-achieving students. Despite believing in myths, more than half of the respondents reported trusting SET, thought that it accurately reflected their teaching performance, and considered SET-based feedback useful. A derived index comparing self-evaluations to reported students' evaluations demonstrated that more than a third of the participants rated their own quality of teaching higher than the ratings they reported typically receiving from their students. This 'underestimated' group believed more intensely in SET myths and mistrusted it, which suggests a possible self-protective motivation underlying faculty attitudes. A subgroup of 9% felt strongly underestimated by their students, and a series of comparisons gave clear indications that, for this group of hard-core disgruntled faculty members, the administration of SET questionnaires and the provision of SET feedback are counter-productive. Insights from this research might encourage academic administrations to improve the implementation of SET measurement to increase faculty receptiveness and trust.

AB  - Ageism is one of the most socially condoned and institutionalized forms of prejudice in the United States. Older adults are discriminated against in employment, health care, and other domains. Exposure to unfavorable stereotypes adversely affects the attitudes, cognitions, and behavior of older adults. Recurrent experiences with negative stereotypes combined with discrimination may make ageism a chronic stressor in the lives of older adults. The way stress influences physical health is gaining increasing support. The weathering hypothesis (Geronimus, A. T. (1992). The weathering hypothesis and the health of African-American women and infants: Evidence and speculations. Ethnicity and Disease, 2, 207-221) posits that the cumulative effects of chronic objective and subjective stressors and high-effort coping cause deterioration of the body, premature aging, and associated health problems such as chronic diseases. Researchers have found empirical support for the weathering hypothesis as well as its theorized contribution to racial and ethnic health disparities. Although ageism is not experienced over the entire life course, as racism typically is, repeated exposure to chronic stressors associated with age stereotypes and discrimination may increase the risk of chronic disease, mortality, and other adverse health outcomes. I conclude with implications for practice in the helping professions and recommendations for future research. Ageism warrants greater recognition, social condemnation, and scientific study as a possible social determinant of chronic disease.

AB  - Despite legislative attempts to eliminate gender stereotyping from society, the propensity to evaluate people on the basis of their sex remains a pernicious social problem. Noting the critical interplay between cultural and cognitive factors in the establishment of stereotypical beliefs, the current investigation explored the extent to which culturally transmitted colour gender associations (i.e., pink is for girls, blue is for boys) set the stage for the automatic activation and expression of gender stereotypes. Across six experiments, the results demonstrated that (1) consumer choice for children's goods is dominated by gender-stereotyped colours (Experiment I); (2) colour-based stereotypic associations guide young children's behaviour (Experiment 2); (3) colour gender associations automatically activate associated stereotypes in adulthood (Experiments 3-5); and (4) colour-based stereotypic associations bias impressions of male and female targets (Experiment 6). These findings indicate that, despite prohibitions against stereotyping, seemingly innocuous societal practices may continue to promote this mode of thought.

AB  - Although conspiracy theories are endorsed by about half the population and occasionally turn out to be true, they are more typically false beliefs that, by definition, have a paranoid theme. Consequently, psychological research to date has focused on determining whether there are traits that account for belief in conspiracy theories (BCT) within a deficit model. Alternatively, a two-component, socio-epistemic model of BCT is proposed that seeks to account for the ubiquity of conspiracy theories, their variance along a continuum, and the inconsistency of research findings likening them to psychopathology. Within this model, epistemic mistrust is the core component underlying conspiracist ideation that manifests as the rejection of authoritative information, focuses the specificity of conspiracy theory beliefs, and can sometimes be understood as a sociocultural response to breaches of trust, inequities of power, and existing racial prejudices. Once voices of authority are negated due to mistrust, the resulting epistemic vacuum can send individuals "down the rabbit hole" looking for answers where they are vulnerable to the biased processing of information and misinformation within an increasingly "post-truth" world. The two-component, socio-epistemic model of BCT argues for mitigation strategies that address both mistrust and misinformation processing, with interventions for individuals, institutions of authority, and society as a whole.

AB  - Background: Overuse and misuse of antibiotics have been reported in Hajj. However, little is known about Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) of pilgrims themselves in relation to these agents.
   Methods: Adult pilgrims from seven countries attending the 2015 Hajj were interviewed using a structured KAP questionnaire.
   Results: KAP information was collected from 1476 pilgrims. Misconceptions regarding antibiotics included that they: cure all diseases (24.6%); cure common cold and flu (63.0%); are used to stop fever (47.3%); have no side effects (43.2%). Negative attitudes included prophylactic use (50%), self-medication (43.2%), non-compliance with therapy (63.5%) and storage of left-overs for future use (54.1%). In practice, 87.3% of pilgrims admitted to using non-prescribed antibiotics, only 19.3% use antibiotic as directed by their doctor and 54% do not usually check the expiry date of antibiotics before use. Over 60% brought antibiotics from their home country to KSA and 39.2% acquired non-prescribed antibiotics in Saudi Arabia. KAP scores were higher among the younger age group (<= 43 years old) and among those with healthcare-related work or education and increased with increasing levels of education.
   Conclusions: Multifaceted and multidisciplinary approaches, both in KSA and in pilgrims' countries of origin, are needed to address antibiotic misuse during Hajj.

AB  - Pervasive stereotypes linking Black men with violence and criminality can lead to implicit cognitive biases, including the misidentification of harmless objects as weapons. In four experiments, we investigated whether these biases extend even to young Black boys (5-year-olds). White participants completed sequential priming tasks in which they categorized threatening and nonthreatening objects and words after brief presentations of faces of various races (Black and White) and ages (children and adults). Results consistently revealed that participants had less difficulty (i.e., faster response times, fewer errors) identifying threatening stimuli and more difficulty identifying nonthreatening stimuli after seeing Black faces than after seeing White faces, and this racial bias was equally strong following adult and child faces. Process-dissociation-procedure analyses further revealed that these effects were driven entirely by automatic (i.e., unintentional) racial biases. The collective findings suggest that the perceived threat commonly associated with Black men may generalize even to young Black boys.

AB  - How to allocate advertising impressions under budget constraint is one of the leading research issues in Real-Time Bidding (RTB). Traditional methods are mostly grounded on 'the highest bidder rule' to optimize revenues of AD Exchange (ADX), which causes Demand Side Platforms (DSPs) to over-consume budget in the early stage and eventually lead to bad revenue of all trading parties. In addition, the long auction sequence in large-scale RTB environments may also bring challenges to existing algorithms. To those problems, we propose a Multi-Level Budget Constraint DQN (MLBC-DQN) framework, which divides the long sequence in RTB environment into several short sequence environments with different budgets' level and use a deep Q network (DQN) to learn optimal strategy for environments of each level. The final strategy to interact with the original RTB environment of MLBC-DQN is weighted by strategies of all DQNs mentioned above. By weighing various strategies from different perspectives, an MLBC-DQN agent can quickly learn effective strategies to overcome the over-consume budget problem. We evaluate MLBC-DQN in two datasets comparing with traditional allocation strategies and DQN. Results show that the MLBC-DQN can achieve higher revenues of DSPs without prejudice to the income of ADX, and promote the marketing effect of advertising resources. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - CONTEXT: It is generally believed that women's lack of decision-making power may restrict their use of modern contraceptives. However, few studies have examined the different dimensions of women's empowerment and contraceptive use in African countries.
   METHODS: Data came from the latest round of Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 2006 and 2008 in Namibia, Zambia, Ghana and Uganda. Responses from married or cohabiting women aged 15-49 were analyzed for six dimensions of empowerment and the current use of female-only methods or couple methods. Bivariate and multivariate multinomial regressions were used to identify associations between the empowerment dimensions and method use.
   RESULTS: Positive associations were found between the overall empowerment score and method use in all countries (relative risk ratios, 1.1-1.3). In multivariate analysis, household economic decision making was associated with the use of either female-only or couple methods (1.1 for all), as was agreement on fertility preferences (1.3-1.6) and the ability to negotiate sexual activity (1.1-1.2). In Namibia, women's negative attitudes toward domestic violence were correlated with the use of couple methods (1.1).
   CONCLUSIONS: Intervention programs aimed at increasing contraceptive use may need to involve different approaches, including promoting couples' discussion of fertility preferences and family planning, improving women's self-efficacy in negotiating sexual activity and increasing their economic independence.

AB  - Context
   Many medical schools have initiated care internships to familiarize their students with older persons and to instil a professional attitude.
   Objective
   To examine the impact of care internships on the image that first-year medical students have of older persons and to explore the underlying concepts that may play a role in shaping this image.
   Design
   Survey before and after a two-week compulsory care internship using the Aging Semantic Differential (ASD; 32 adjectives) and the Attitudes toward Old People (AOP; 34 positions) questionnaires.
   Participants
   Before and after a care internship involving interpersonal contact, 252 and 244 first-year medical students at the Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC) in the academic year 2012-2013 participated.
   Method
   Descriptive statistics, analyses of variance, and principal component analysis were used; clusters of adjectives and positions were reduced into concepts to examine dominant patterns of views. Changes in image were investigated as mean differences of the total and concept scores.
   Results
   Both the ASD and the AOP questionnaires showed a poor general image of older persons that significantly worsened after the care internship (p < 0.01). The percentage of students considering over 75 years as being old increased from 17.2% to 31.2% (p < 0.01) and those who thought they would find as much satisfaction in care for older as for younger patients decreased from 78.5% to 62.1% (p < 0.001). Exploratory principal component analysis showed particularly low scores on `comportment' and `pleasurable interaction' whereas the scores on `personality traits' and `habitual behaviour' significantly deteriorated (both p < 0.001). These patterns were irrespective of the student's gender and previous contact experience.
   Conclusion
   Medical schools should carefully consider care internships to ensure that students do not worsen their views on older patients, which may occur due to inadequate contact depth and quality within a rather unsupportive context.

AB  - Background: Studies indicate that the attitudes of nurses, nursing students, and other health care professionals towards Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) patients are affected by cultural differences and the fear of HIV/AIDS infection, resulting in both negative attitudes and reluctance to care for these patients. Empathy is critical for all health professionals in the delivery of effective care. Research indicates that as empathic tendencies develop, so do better communication skills, better attitudes, and better quality of care.
   Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among demographic factors, familiarity with HIV/AIDS, attitudes towards HIV/AIDS, and empathic tendencies in a Turkish sample of nursing students.
   Design and Methods: Using a non-experimental, correlational design, data on demographics, HIV/AIDS Attitude Scale (AAS) and the Scale of Empathic Tendency (SET) were collected.
   Participants: The study sample consisted of 614 undergraduate nursing students in two universities located in different geographic regions of Turkey.
   Results: The results of this study indicated that attitudes and empathic tendencies are related to knowledge and exposure to patients. As well, those students with more positive attitudes had higher empathic tendencies towards HIV/AIDS patients.
   Conclusions: It is important to adopt strategies to improve the empathic tendencies and attitudes of nursing students. These strategic changes would increase the quality of care provided to all patients. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Millions of homeless Americans have lower cancer screening and higher cancer mortality rates. We explored perspectives and perceptions regarding cancer and cancer screening among homeless.
   Using random and criteria sampling, we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 50 homeless adults from New York City's (NYC) shelters and shelter-based clinics.
   Mean age was 51.66 years with average 2.03 years of homelessness; 33/50 were older than 50. Only a small number of participants had their recommended cancer screening. Contrary to general assumptions and despite significant barriers, the homeless were concerned about cancer, believed their risk of cancer is higher compared to the general population, and generally considered screening a high priority during homelessness. While they acknowledged several individual- and systems-level barriers, they welcomed targeted measures to address their multi-level barriers. Suggested strategies included active counseling by providers, health education or reminders via mHealth strategies or face-to-face in shelters, addressing potential providers' prejudice and biases regarding their priorities, incentives, and patient navigators or coach to help navigating the complex cancer screening process.
   There are gaps in effective cancer screening despite adequate attitude and perceptions among homeless. The health system needs to shift from addressing only basic care to a more equitable approach with accessible and acceptable opportunities for preventive cancer care for the homeless.

AB  - The number of people with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been increasing worldwide. Anxiety about potential infection, fear of severe illness, death, economic problems, and loneliness and isolation brought on by social distancing are increasingly being experienced by people. Therefore, it is imperative to address and improve such mental health-related problems during COVID-19. We aimed to investigate the current mental health care and psychological intervention statuses related to COVID-19 in Japan. In a questionnaire survey, 55 of 69 (80%) mental health and welfare centers and 194 of 931 (21%) psychiatric institutions across Japan responded. COVID-19 patients, their family members, and the general public often consulted the mental health and welfare institutions through telephone. The questionnaire included various information of mental health difficulties related to COVID-19 such as the numbers and contents of the consultations, and the type of the interventions. The contents of consultation included psychological symptoms (anxiety, depression, insomnia, and alcohol problems) and psychosocial problems (interpersonal problems, prejudice, and discrimination). Overall, 9% of mental health and welfare centers provided psychological first aid as psychological intervention and 28% of consultations involved cases requiring urgent care. In Japan, consultations about COVID-19-related mental health problems occurred mainly in mental health and welfare centers. There is urgent need to establish a system that enables mental health triage and brief psychological interventions that are feasible in the centers.

AB  - Background: Research on discrimination in healthcare settings has primarily focused on health implications of race-based discrimination among ethno-racial minority groups. Little is known about discrimination experiences of other marginalized populations, particularly groups facing multiple disadvantages who may be subjected to other/multiple forms of discrimination. Objectives: (1) To examine the prevalence of perceived discrimination due to homelessness/poverty, mental illness/alcohol/drug related problems, and race/ethnicity/skin color while seeking healthcare in the past year among racially diverse homeless adults with mental illness; (2) To identify whether perceiving certain types of discrimination is associated with increased likelihood of perceiving other kinds of discrimination; and (3) To examine association of these perceived discrimination experiences with socio-demographic characteristics, self-reported measures of psychiatric symptomatology and substance use, and Emergency Department utilization.
   Methods: We used baseline data from the Toronto site of the At Home/Chez Soi randomized controlled trial of Housing First for homeless adults with mental illness (n = 550). Bivariate statistics and multivariable logistic regression models were used for the analysis.
   Results: Perceived discrimination related to homelessness/poverty (30.4%) and mental illness/alcohol/substance use (32.5%) is prevalent among ethnically diverse homeless adults with mental illness in healthcare settings. Only 15% of the total participants reported discrimination due to race/ethnicity/skin color. After controlling for relevant confounders and presence of psychosis, all types of discrimination in healthcare settings were associated with more frequent ED use, a greater -3 - severity of lifetime substance abuse, and mental health problems. Perceiving discrimination of one type was associated with increased likelihood of perceiving other kinds of discrimination.
   Conclusions: Understanding the experience of discrimination in healthcare settings and associated healthcare utilization is the first step towards designing policies and interventions to address health disparities among vulnerable populations. This study contributes to the knowledge base in this important area.

AB  - Negative attitudes of resident communities towards conservation are associated with resource decline in developing countries. In Botswana, Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) was adopted to address this challenge. CBNRM links rural development and conservation. However, the impact of CBNRM on changes of resident attitudes towards conservation and tourism is not adequately researched. This paper, therefore, assesses the impacts of CBNRM on resident attitudes towards tourism development and conservation in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. The study purposively sampled villages of Khwai, Mababe and Sankoyo. Household data using variables like: economic benefits from CBNRM; level of satisfaction with CBNRM; co-management of natural resources between resident communities and government agencies; and collective action was collected. This data was supplemented by secondary and ethnographic data. Using qualitative and quantitative analysis, results indicate changes in resident attitudes from being negative to positive towards tourism and conservation. These changes are triggered by economic benefits residents derived from CBNRM, co-management in resource management; and, collective action of communities in CBNRM development. Positive attitudes towards conservation and tourism are the first building blocks towards achieving conservation in nature-based tourism destinations. As a result, decision-makers should give priority to CBNRM and use it as a tool to achieve conservation and improved livelihoods in nature-based tourism destinations of developing countries.

AB  - The remanufacturing of used products reduces the consumption of raw materials and environmental pollution. How to improve the recovery efficiency has been capturing a global interest in both academics and business. Focusing on a closed-loop supply chain with competitive collection, we investigate the recovery efficiency, as well as the customer behaviour, under the inconvenience-perception in collection. First, we analyse the recovery efficiency of a two-echelon decentralized model consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer and contrast its performance with a centralized model. Second, we propose two coordination mechanisms (contract and authorization mechanisms) to ameliorate the decentralized model. Finally, we examine the influence of the intuitive impression of customer on different collection channels through a numerical study. We find that the retailer will always join the collection competition, which does dent the cost vantage of remanufacturing, but the competition fails to enhance the recovery efficiency. The contract mechanism can achieve the optimal recovery efficiency, whereas the authorization mechanism cannot. In addition, the middle-range fluctuation of the customers' intuitive impression has a very limited influence on both the collection rate and decision strategies, and the non-obvious prejudice will enhance the retailer's collection activities but reduce the manufacturers' collections.

AB  - Since the Stonewall uprisings, there has been greater social acceptance of homosexuality within Western contexts. Nevertheless, those who are at the intersection of more than one minority identity continue to face prejudice and discrimination, including homophobia and racism. Though there has been increasing work regarding the experiences of sexual minority people of colour (POC), a lacuna remains regarding the experiences of sexual minority British Muslim South Asian men and the integration of sexual minority and religious identities, particularly within a context of increased societal acceptance towards sexual minorities and societal Islamophobia. In this study, 38 sexual minority British Muslim South Asian men were recruited via snowball sampling and interviewed. Data were examined via reflexive thematic analysis. Five themes were identified: degrees of "outness", hegemonic Whiteness and the LGBTQ+ community, internalisation of White hegemony, distancing from the sexual minority religio-cultural ingroup, and attempting to reconcile potential identity conflict between sexual orientation identity and religious and cultural identities. Respondents' experiences highlighted substantial social exclusion due to intersectional disadvantage as well as a lack of intra-community social support, suggesting substantial isolation, psychological implications and a general eschewing of identity affiliation based on sexual attraction. This has implications on services predicated on identity affiliation which may potentially exclude the needs of hidden and intersectionally disadvantaged populations.

AB  - Background and Objectives Despite overwhelming evidence of benefit, medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) remain stigmatizing and more efforts are needed to educate health care professionals and the general public. Methods We developed and evaluated an educational program for graduate students studying health sciences, teaching them to deliver 1 h presentations to the community on the opioid crisis and the usefulness of MOUD. Results To date, 120 graduate students have participated in this training experience on substance use disorders and delivered 59 presentations to more than 1065 community members. We found a significant increase in knowledge among students following the training. In addition, although attitudes and beliefs were generally positive at baseline, we also found significant increases in positives attitudes about the treatment of addiction and working with patients with addictions. Almost all students believed the course enhanced their professional expertise and would recommend it to others. We compared our students' baseline knowledge and attitudes to a large sample of other graduate students and did not find significant differences indicating good external validity of our results. Finally, we evaluated change in community members' knowledge and attitudes (N = 315) following student presentations and found significant increases in knowledge and positive attitude change toward MOUD. Discussion and Conclusions Overall our program was feasible, enjoyable, and effective in meeting its goals of increasing knowledge acquisition and improving attitudes among students and the greater community. Scientific Significance Graduate students in health sciences can be trained to successfully teach the public about the opioid crisis and the usefulness of MOUD.

AB  - AimThis study explored the attitudes of patients with advanced cancer towards MTP and return of results, prior to undergoing genomic testing within a research program.MethodsParticipants were recruited as part of the longitudinal PiGeOn (Psychosocial Issues in Genomics in Oncology) study involving patients with advanced/metastatic solid cancer who had exhausted therapeutic options and who were offered MTP in order to identify cognate therapies. Twenty patients, selected by purposive sampling, were interviewed around the time they gave consent to MTP. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. Themes identified in the transcripts were cross-validated via qualitative responses to the PiGeOn study survey (n=569; 63%).ResultsAll interviewed participants gave consent to MTP without reservation. Three themes were identified and further supported via the survey responses: (1) Obvious agreement to participate, primarily because of desire for new treatments and altruism. (2) The black box - while participant knowledge of genomics was generally poor, faith in their oncologists and the scientific process encouraged them to proceed with testing; and (3) Survival is the priority - receiving treatment to prolong life was the priority for all participants, and other issues such as identification of a germline variant were generally seen as ancillary.ConclusionHaving advanced cancer seemed to abrogate any potential concerns about MTP. Participants valued the research for varied reasons, but this was secondary to their priority to survive. While no negative attitudes toward MTP emerged, limitations in understanding of genomics were evident.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGSs) play a major role in enhancing the well-being and recreation areas for the urban dwellers; however, there is a very limited study of this field in Cambodia. In response to an increasing demand for recreational areas among urban dwellers, this study investigated the behavioral intention to the use of the UGSs from the perspective of the young residents of Phnom Penh using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The perceived safety, accessibility, and usefulness and the core constructs of TPB were conceptualized to predict their effects on behavioral intention. In all, 554 completed samples were collected from both online and face-to-face interviews among the respondents. Data were empirically analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach and SmartPLS 3.0 software. The results revealed that the behavioral intention to the use of the UGSs was significantly associated with the perceived safety and personal attitudes, but it was not significantly associated with perceived accessibility and usefulness. The safety of the UGSs is a critical concern that recoils the behavioral intention while a lack of basic knowledge regarding the usefulness and roles of the UGSs makes negative attitudes toward the behavioral intention. It is, therefore, the safety of the UGSs that should be ensured so as to foster a livable city as well as to promote the use of the UGSs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Nowadays, cosmetic surgery is one of the most common types of surgeries all around the world including Iran and those demanding such surgeries are also growing in number. The present study is an attempt to determine the factors in the tendency towards cosmetic surgery in Iranian students.
   METHODS
   In a descriptive-analytical study, all students at Guilan University of Medical Sciences related to health issues were enrolled. The participants (n=314) were selected through census sampling. Data was garnered using a multi-section questionnaire including socio-demographic variables, body image, body satisfaction, and cosmetic surgery intention. The questionnaires were completed as self-statement.
   RESULTS
   The age range of the students was 18-55 years and the mean age was 25.07 +/- 7.41 years. Body mass index (BMI) of the participants was 23 +/- 3.82. Among socio-demographic variables, BMI, gender, family revenue, father's job, marital status, mother's job, and fathers' literacy level were the predictors of intention for cosmetic surgery. In addition, among psychological variables, body satisfaction and image, and attitudes were predictors of intention for cosmetic surgery.
   CONCLUSION
   Educational and psychological interventions are recommended to create body satisfaction, to develop positive attitudes toward one's body, and to develop negative attitudes toward cosmetic surgery and the side effects. Apparently, providing an environment for physical activity and exercise, especially for girls would help the students in losing weight, remaining in shape and attenuating the tendency toward cosmetic surgery.

AB  - Introduction: The optimal performance of a healthcare organization is one of the effective factors in increasing the efficiency and productivity of nurses and thus reducing their burnout. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of organizational management on nurse burnout based on experiences from Iranian nurses working in psychiatric wards. Materials and Methods: This qualitative study was conducted on 15 nurses working in psychiatric wards selected through purposive sampling. Data collection was done through in-depth semi-structured interviews in psychiatric wards in Ahvaz (southwest of Iran) and Tehran. Data analysis was done through conventional content analysis. Results: The findings included one main category and three subcategories. The main category was "Providing care at an inadequate organization," and the three sub-classes namely "Shortages of human resources," "Shortage of physical resources," and "Impact of management approaches to care provision" were extracted. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that inadequate supply of equipment and human resources along with ineffective managerial approaches in the organization could lead to mental and emotional exhaustion, negative attitudes toward the profession, decreased and poor service quality, employee turnover, and early retirement of nurses in psychiatric wards. Therefore, by adopting appropriate policies in their programs, paying special attention to the physical and mental health of nurses, and addressing their problems, managers of healthcare organizations can motivate and sustain the human resources within the organization.

AB  - Pornography and attitude change studies most often adopt a sexual scripting (SS) perspective. The moral incongruence (MI) perspective on pornography has gained prominence in recent years, however, and may lead to differential predictions from the SS approach. Specifically, a detailed reading of MI and SS papers reveals the potential for discrepant predictions about the effect of pornography on sexual permissiveness, one of the most studied outcomes in pornography research. From an SS perspective, pornography use increases sexual permissiveness, but the preexisting traditional sexual scripts of the religious lessen the magnitude of this effect. Alternatively, the MI perspective implies the possibility that religious persons become more opposed to permissive sexuality as a result of their pornography use, as a way to mitigate the cognitive dissonance they feel for engaging in a sexual behavior proscribed by their faith tradition. The present study explored these divergent possibilities using nationally representative U.S. data. Across four meta-samples and four indicators of sexual permissiveness, religious nonviewers of pornography were the least sexually permissive, followed by religious viewers, nonreligious nonviewers, and nonreligious viewers. These results were robust over time and maintained after adjusting for demographics. For theorizing about pornography, religiosity, and sexual permissiveness, these results suggest that an SS approach may be preferable to an MI approach. The importance of continued research using both the SS and MI perspectives is discussed, however, emphasizing that the present study extrapolated a potential prediction from MI rather than a formal postulate put forth by the model's creators.

AB  - Background Based on the Stereotype Embodiment Theory (SET), this study aims to examine the mechanism of ageism on frailty through the proposed framework of "Experiences of Ageism (EA) -> Age Stereotypes (AS) -> Attitudes to Ageing (AA) -> Frailty" using a structural equation model (SEM). Methods A community-based study involving 630 participants aged 60 years and older was conducted in Shanghai. EA, AS, AA and frailty status were assessed by validated scales. In particular, EA included three parts in this study, as the first part was the experiences of explicit prejudice or discrimination because of age, another two parts were the experiences of witnessed and encountered implicit negative age-based stereotypes. A SEM was performed to examine whether the proposed paths from EA to frailty were supported. Results EA had a significant indirect effect (beta' = .360*-.456*-.576 = .095, p < .001) on frailty through the path of "EA -> AS -> AA -> Frailty" after controlling for covariates. AA had a direct effect (beta = -.576, p < .001) on frailty; AS fully mediated the association between EA and AA (indirect effect = .360*-.456 = -.164, p < .001), and AA fully mediated the association between AS and frailty (indirect effect = -.456*-.576 = .263, p < .001). Conclusions These findings demonstrated a mechanism from ageism to frailty, and highlighted the potential threat of negative AS on health. Ageism and frailty are both great challenges for the process of healthy ageing.

AB  - Fermented milk beverage is a product containing milk, whey and/or other ingredients, fermented by specific microorganisms and/or added with fermented milks. Fat determination in this product is important to quality control and inspection. The Gerber method is used worldwide as a simple and rapid method for fat content analysis in raw and processed milks. In Brazil, Roese-Gottlieb is the official method for analysis of fat content in milk beverages. However, the use of Gerber method for fat content determination in fermented milk beverages is widespread throughout the industry in the country. Several authors have tested the use of Gerber method for some dairy products, but there is no report on this evaluation for fermented milk beverages. In this context, the objectives of this work were to determine the fat content of fermented milk beverages by the Gerber method and evaluate the performance of this test, using Roese-Gottlieb as a reference method. Thirty samples of fermented milk beverages were analyzed by both methods. The fat contents ranged from 1.25 to 2.40% by the Gerber method and from 1.24 to 2.50% by the Roese-Gottlieb method. There was no difference (p > 0.05) between the methods. The Gerber method can be used to determine the fat content of fermented milk beverages, without prejudice to the results obtained.

AB  - In a series of experiments we examined heterosexuals' reactions to the timing of disclosure of a gender-matched confederate's same-sex dating partner. Disclosure occurred in a naturalistic context-that is, it occurred when meeting, or expecting to soon meet, a same-sex attracted individual, who voluntarily shared this information with the participant as a natural part of a broader topic of discussion. The confederate, when disclosing early rather than later, was approached more closely (Prestudy) and liked more (Studies 1-2). Those experiencing early disclosure, compared with later, were less drawn to topics of lower intimacy (Study 1), were happier and more excited about meeting the confederate, and more likely to choose to be alone with the confederate for a one-on-one discussion (Study 2). Further, women experiencing early disclosure were more willing to introduce the same-gender confederate to their friends (Study 2). The benefits of knowing sooner, rather than later, continued to apply even when participants were given further time to process the disclosure. To explore the underlying reasons for the more favorable experiences of upfront disclosure, we examined participants' memory of the information shared by the confederate (Study 3). Results revealed that those who experienced delayed disclosure were more likely to incorrectly recall and negatively embellish information related to the confederate's sexual orientation, suggesting that early disclosure resulted in a reduced tendency to focus on the confederate's sexuality as a defining feature. These positive findings for early timing are discussed in light of previous studies that have found benefits for delayed disclosure and those that have failed to investigate the effects of timing of 'coming out' under conditions of contact.

AB  - To be able to describe more complex fuzzy uncertainty information effectively, the concept of q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) was first proposed by Yager. The q-ROFSs can dynamically adjust the range of indication of decision information by changing a parameter q based on the different hesitation degree from the decision-makers, where q >= 1, so they outperform the traditional intuitionistic fuzzy sets and Pythagorean fuzzy sets. In real decision-making problems, there is often an interaction phenomenon between attributes. For aggregating these complex fuzzy information, the Maclaurin symmetric mean (MSM) operator is more superior by considering interrelationships among attributes. In addition, the power average (PA) operator can reduce the effects of extreme evaluating data from some experts with prejudice. In this paper, we introduce the PA operator and the MSM operator based on q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (q-ROFNs). Then, we put forward the q-rung orthopair fuzzy power MSM (q-ROFPMSM) operator and the q-rung orthopair fuzzy power weighed MSM (q-ROFPWMSM) operator of q-ROFNs and present some of their properties. Finally, we present a novel multiple-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) method based on the q-ROFPWA and the q-ROFPWMSM operators. The experimental results show that the novel MAGDM method outperforms the existing MAGDM methods for dealing with MAGDM problems.

AB  - Ambroise Pare was celebrated surgeon of the 16th century whose practical accomplishments, books, and ideas transformed surgery and was a precursor for the later development of neurosurgery. He developed many surgical innovations related to wound management, arterial ligation for the prevention of hemorrhage during limb amputations, and the treatment of war-related head and spine injuries. He maintained that a surgeon should operate gently to reduce pain and improve outcome, and he dedicated his career to the wounded, sick, and poor. He also served 4 consecutive French monarchs-Henri II and his 3 sons Francois II, Charles IX, and Henri III. As a Huguenot (a Reformed Protestant) by faith, he lived in an environment dominated by Catholicism. Hence, his practice and life were sometimes hindered by political circumstances and religious prejudice. In this historical vignette, we will discuss the professional accomplishments of Ambroise Pare that influenced the future development of neurosurgery, including his descriptions of phantom-limb pain and peripheral nerve injury, his innovations in neurotraumatology, and the saws he invented for use in skull surgery. We will also highlight Pare's broad neurosurgical contributions to the field. Finally, we will discuss his personal life during the difficult and dangerous political circumstances of 16th century France.

AB  - Introduction: Stigma associated with HIV has been documented as a barrier for accessing quality health-related services. When the stigma manifests in the healthcare setting, people living with HIV receive substandard services or even be denied care altogether. Although the consequences of HIV stigma have been documented extensively, efforts to reduce these negative attitudes have been scarce. Interventions to reduce HIV stigma should be implemented as part of the formal training of future healthcare professionals. The interventions that have been tested with healthcare professionals and published have several limitations that must be surpassed (i.e., lack of comparison groups in research designs and longitudinal follow-up data). Furthermore, Latino healthcare professionals have been absent from these intervention efforts even though the epidemic has affected this population disproportionately.
   Methods: In this article, we describe an intervention developed to reduce HIV stigma among medical students in Puerto Rico. A total of 507 medical students were randomly introduced into our intervention and control conditions.
   Results: The results show statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups; intervention group participants had lower HIV stigma levels than control participants after the intervention. In addition, differences in HIV stigma levels between the groups were sustained for a 12-month period.
   Conclusions: The results of our study demonstrate the efficacy of the modes of intervention developed by us and serve as a new training tool for future healthcare professionals with regard to stigma reduction.

AB  - Purpose of investigation: To understand the sexual healthcare needs among cervical cancer survivors and identify important pre-disposing factors that may potentially influence their willingness to seek healthcare for sexual problems.
   Material and methods: Patients with cervical cancer attending Gynecological oncology clinic in a tertiary-care hospital for post-treatment examinations were consecutively recruited between January 2014 and December 2015. Participants were assessed for their interest in sexual healthcare services and likelihood of visiting physicians for sexual problems.
   Results: Among 173 consenting adult patients, 92 (53.2%) expressed interest in sexual healthcare services. However, 43 (24.9%) subjects were likely to see physicians to resolve sexual problems and only 5 (2.9%) did that in recent years. Older and diagnosed with advanced stage cancer patients had relatively less interest and willingness for seeking care for sexual problems compared to those younger and early-stage patients. Intention for seeking sexual healthcare was positively associated with time since last treatment. Social aspects expressed as 'feeling embarrassment or shame' and ` worrying about prejudices or stigma' appeared to be the commonest barriers for care-seeking for sexual issues.
   Conclusions: Among cervical cancer patients, there may be remained an unmet and needed regarding healthcare-seeking for sexual problems. Urgent interventions incorporating psychosocial support appeared to be the need of the hour.

AB  - Y With the growth in political, ethnic, and religious conflicts across the globe, intolerance is manifested across different societies especially in the context of (forced) migration and refugees. The purpose of this study is to examine intolerance as a complex social problem. Specifically, this research seeks to explore the perceptions and conceptions of (in)tolerance between refugees from Syria and host communities in Lebanon identifying the degree and the different forms in which tolerance and intolerance materialize. This will allow different agents such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), policymakers, and relevant authorities to develop adequate interventions to tackle this phenomenon through a social marketing approach and improve (refugee) crisis response plans. The situation has emerged following the Syrian conflict (2011-present) and the arrival of 1.5 million refugees into Lebanon. This number thus constitutes a challenge to both the hosts and the refugees in Lebanon, a small country. A qualitative study was conducted based on semi-structured interviews to investigate the perceptions and conceptions of the target audiences, citizens, refugees, leaders, and NGO staff/volunteers. Results show the existence of a phenomenon of intolerance; its relevant aspects, namely discrimination, prejudice, stereotypes, racism, and scapegoating; and the rise of violence-tension and fear as emerging themes of intolerance manifestations in the context of the Syrian refugee crisis in Lebanon.

AB  - Background: This research deals with the way people create discourses around disability, which shape the community's concept of disability.
   Objective: The purpose of this article is to find out how the community configures "disability", in particular by understanding the ideas, needs and strategies that the community uses towards people with disabilities. Specifically, different roles have been involved, such as professionals, volunteers, family members and citizens. The final aim is intervening on the discourses that can contrast the full personal fulfilment of people with disabilities and social inclusion.
   Methods: This paper relates to discursive psychology's theoretical references and makes use of the Methodology of Textual Analysis. The tools we used include investigation protocols specially designed to detect text both through manual "pencil and paper" and computerized denominations.
   Results: The results show that those who are in direct contact with people with disabilities (volunteers and family members) are more exposed to treating them as disabled, making the deficit coincide with the person and also have a more judgemental approach.
   Conclusions: From the results obtained we can see which practices can be activated to facilitate the network between the various roles in order to implement inclusive interventions and help those more exposed to prejudices. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims: Opioid substitution therapy (OST) is an evidence-based HIV prevention strategy for people who inject drugs (PWIDs). Yet, only 2.7% of Ukraine's estimated 310,000 PWIDs receive it despite free treatment since 2004. The multi-level barriers to entering OST among opioid-dependent PWIDs have not been examined in Ukraine. Methods: A multi-year mixed methods implementation science project included focus group discussions with 199 PWIDs in five major Ukrainian cities in 2013 covering drug treatment attitudes, beliefs, knowledge and experiences with OST. Data were transcribed, translated into English and coded. Coded segments related to OST access, entry, knowledge, beliefs and attitudes were analyzed among 41 PWIDs who were eligible for but had never received OST. Findings: A number of programmatic and structural barriers were mentioned by participants as barriers to entry to OST, including compulsory drug user registration, waiting lists and limited number of treatment slots. Participants also voiced strong negative attitudes and beliefs about OST, especially methadone. Their perceptions about methadone's side effects as well as the stigma of being a methadone client were expressed as obstacles to treatment. Conclusions: Despite expressed interest in treatment, Ukrainian OST-naive PWIDs evade OST for reasons that can be addressed through changes in program-level and governmental policies and social-marketing campaigns. Voiced OST barriers can effectively inform public health and policy directives related to HIV prevention and treatment in Ukraine to improve evidence-based treatment access and availability.

AB  - ObjectiveMethodsTo explore the factors that influence risk tolerance among women from different racial/ethnic groups.
   In-depth individual interviews of non-Hispanic African American, non-Hispanic white, and Hispanic women ages 20-45 years were conducted by a trained interviewer using a semi-structured interview guide to elicit the factors that influence risk tolerance among minority women. The interviews were audiotaped and professionally transcribed, with a final sample size of 36 determined by thematic saturation. The members of the research team used open coding to review and develop a list of codes, which was modified as new codes emerged. A final list of 35 codes was applied to the transcripts and combined into broader themes.
   ResultsConclusionThe study included 30.6% non-Hispanic African American, 33.3% non-Hispanic white, and 36.1% Hispanic women, with a mean SD age of 34.8 +/- 6.8 years. Several major themes explaining risk aversion among minority women emerged: discrepancies in quality of health care, perceived prejudice, lack of knowledge and education, medication beliefs, risk perception, and constrained resources. The latter was discussed most frequently.
   While our findings identify several concerns that may be addressed through implementation of more effective communication strategies by medical providers, they also highlight that disparities are strongly influenced by the complex ways financial and social constraints impact health care decisions of minority women.

TI  - Wild harvesting declines as pesticides and imports rise: the collection and consumption of insects in contemporary rural Japan
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECTS AS FOOD AND FEED
LA  - English
AB  - Entomophagy is a traditional element of the Japanese diet. This is also the case in other Asian countries, where there is an increase in demand for edible insects. However, in Westernised countries in a similar economic position to contemporary Japan, cultural prejudices against traditional entomophagy remain strong. This article offers an overview of the current situation regarding entomophagy in rural Japan, a country with a high gross domestic product per capita that has undergone a degree of Westernisation in recent decades. Data collected during 12 months of fieldwork in rural central Japan shows that traditional entomophagy is still present, but the diversity of species consumed has seen a marked decrease when compared to studies undertaken in the 1980s. Grasshoppers (Oxya spp.) and wasp larvae (Vespula spp.) are the main insects consumed in Japan today. Insects hold some negative connotations, especially among younger Japanese. Elderly people are more likely to have consumed edible insects, and contend that the availability of wild insects, particularly grasshoppers, has declined considerably since their childhood. Sellers of edible insects also report a decrease in availability within Japan, and now turn to imported insects to meet domestic demand, which is increasing. Both sellers and consumers attribute this trend to the use of pesticides in the final quarter of the twentieth century. Further research is required to evaluate the potential of domestic insects to meet the rising demand for edible insects in contemporary Japan.

AB  - Objective: This analysis explores the effects of relaying information about the genetic and behavioral causes of obesity (vs. control) on physician trainees' verbal communication behavior with a virtual patient with obesity. Moderation by physician trainees' gender and BMI was also assessed.
   Methods: 119 physician trainees' verbal responses were recorded and coded using a close-ended content analytic approach.
   Results: Physician trainees in the behavioral and genetic information conditions were more likely to discuss weight (behavioral: AOR= 5.40; genetic: AOR= 6.58,) and provide lifestyle counseling (behavioral: AOR= 10.92; genetic: AOR= 3.50). Those in the behavioral condition were more likely to make assumptions about the patient's lifestyle behavior (AOR= 5.53) and use stigmatizing language (AOR= 4.69). Heavier physician trainees in the genetic condition had shorter interactions (beta = -0.53, p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: Emphasizing the genetic causes of overweight offers a potential avenue for encouraging clinical communication with patients with obesity, without also increasing prejudice and bias. Additional efforts may be needed to reap the benefits of genetic information for providers with higher weight.
   Practice Implications: For providers, considering genetic factors underlying patient body weight and obesity risk may serve to reduce stigmatizing communication with patients. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives: To quickly understand rural-to-urban migrants knowledge and acceptance of voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) for HIV/AIDS and community attitudes to providing VCT service to migrants in Shanghai, China.
   Study design: A rapid assessment consisting of in-depth interviews and focus group discussions was conducted.
   Methods: A total of 101 in-depth individual interviews and four focus group discussions were administered in 2008. The interviews were audiotaped or taken note and then transcribed. Collected data were analysed according four impact domains on VCT uptake among rural-to-urban migrants: knowledge of HIV/AIDS and VCT (Impact domain I), self-perceived risk of HIV infection (Impact domain II), accessibility and confidential of VCT service (Impact domain III), and social environment (Impact domain IV).
   Results: Current barriers to getting VCT among rural-to-urban migrants included misconceptions about HIV/AIDS, limited to no knowledge about VCT, extremely low self-perception of HIV risks, limited accessibility of VCT service for rural migrants, worrying about disclosure of HIV infection status, and community leaders' or stakeholders' negative attitudes to rural migrants living with HIV and even those attending VCT.
   Conclusions: It indicates that much greater effort is needed to remove barriers to accessing VCT for rural-to-urban migrants. Community mobilizations, mass media programs to improve HIV/AIDS and VCT knowledge and awareness, and anti-stigma associated with taking VCT or HIV infection are among the priorities.

AB  - Objective: Compare the immediate affective and cognitive reactions to cancer survivor stories about mammography and breast cancer vs. a didactic, informational approach.
   Methods: Participants (N = 489) were African American women age 40 years and older (mean = 61). Most had <= high school education (67%), annual household income <=$20,000 (77%), and a prior mammogram (89%). Participants completed surveys before and after watching the narrative or informational video. We used structural equation modeling to examine the large number of inter-related latent constructs.
   Results: Women who watched the narrative video experienced more positive and negative emotions, found it easier to understand the video, had more positive evaluations of the video, reported stronger identification with the message source (i.e., perceived similarity, trust, liking), and were more engaged with the video.
   Conclusion: Narratives elicited immediate reactions consistent with theorized pathways of how communication affects behavior. Future studies should examine whether and how these immediate outcomes act as mediators of the longer term effects of narratives on affect, cognitions, and behavior.
   Practice implications: Stories of other women's experiences may be more powerful than a didactic presentation when encouraging African American women to get a mammogram. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective. This study examines the determinants of patients' side effects from arthritis medication. Proposed predictors were patients' beliefs about medications, objective disease activity, treatment regimen, and psychiatric and rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.
   Methods. In a longitudinal design, 100 rheumatoid arthritis outpatients were investigated at baseline and again at 6 months after receiving both pharmacologic and psychosocial treatment.
   Results. Multivariate analyses showed no influence of disease status, type of treatment, or psychiatric or arthritis symptoms on side effects. Heightened concerns about arthritis medication at baseline predicted side effects at baseline (partial correlation r = 0.37, P < 0.001) and at 6 months (partial correlation r = 0.25, P < 0.001) after controlling for relevant disease- and treatment-related variables. In a cross-lagged panel analysis, prior experience with side effects from arthritis medication was ruled out as a cause of heightened concerns, indicating that negative beliefs genuinely contribute to side effects. A comparison of patients who did and did not start new medications showed no difference in side effects in patients with positive beliefs about medications, but led to significantly more side effects in patients with negative beliefs.
   Conclusion. Patients' beliefs about arthritis medications were stable and consistently associated with side effects. Patients with greater concerns about their arthritis medications are at higher risk for developing side effects, especially when starting new drugs. Identifying those patients is important to avoid premature drug discontinuation. Research into cause and preventability of negative attitudes to prescribed medicines is needed.

AB  - In recent years there has been a distinguishable trend towards user involvement in ageing research. Researchers and policy makers both are increasingly convinced that user involvement is necessary to adapt research questions and methods to meet the needs of older people. Little is known, however, about the quality of collaborations between older people and researchers. This study systematically evaluates a collaboration undertaken between two academic researchers and three older people acting as co-researchers in an effort to identify the conditions required for equal collaboration. To evaluate the collaboration the co-researchers and academic researchers took part in individual in-depth interviews (after six months) and two reflection meetings (after six and.. months). Throughout the collaboration, field notes were taken by both academic researchers and co-researchers. A detailed description of the collaboration is provided here, using the metaphor of a journey to illustrate the dynamics and the learning process of the participants. Interim reflection meetings - at which mutual expectations were expressed along with a frank discussion of prejudices, tasks and role divisions, and the sharing of personal and project-related needs and information - were found to be fruitful in achieving a positive working relationship and fostering an effective collaboration. We conclude that a learning perspective on participation can be a resource for learning and adaptive change.

AB  - Trust is central to the therapeutic relationship, but the epistemic asymmetries between the expert healthcare provider and the patient make the patient, the trustor, vulnerable to the provider, the trustee. The narratives of pain sufferers provide helpful insights into the experience of pain at the juncture of trust, expert knowledge, and the therapeutic relationship. While stories of pain sufferers having their testimonies dismissed are well documented, pain sufferers continue to experience their testimonies as being epistemically downgraded. This kind of epistemic injustice has received limited treatment in bioethics. In this paper, we examine how a climate of distrust in pain management may facilitate what Fricker calls epistemic injustice. We critically interrogate the processes through which pain sufferers are vulnerable to specific kinds of epistemic injustice, such as testimonial injustice. We also examine how healthcare institutions and practices privilege some kinds of evidence and ways of knowing while excluding certain patient testimonies from epistemic consideration. We argue that providers ought to avoid epistemic injustice in pain management by striving toward epistemic humility. Epistemic humility, as a form of epistemic justice, may be the kind disposition required to correct the harmful prejudices that may arise through testimonial exchange in chronic pain management.

AB  - There is no consensus on the antibiotic therapy for bone infection due to the heterogeneous spectrum of diseases. Most authors suggest different durations of treatment based on pathophysiological considerations. However, adverse effects are related, at least in part, to the duration of treatment. We, therefore, investigated a 6 weeks antibiotic combination therapy for all cases of bone infection. Herewith, we report the results of this therapeutic approach. This is a cohort study including all patients presenting with bone infection, regardless of the mechanism involved. The diagnosis was based on bone biopsy obtained through invasive procedures. Chronic bone infection was defined as a history of disease of over 1 month duration. The duration of clinical follow-up following treatment discontinuation was at least 6 months. Cured bone infection was defined as the absence of relapse after antibiotic discontinuation. One hundred and eighteen patients were included between July 2005 and March 2009; 61 presented with bone infection following prosthetic implant (52%) and the 57 remaining patients had bone infection without foreign material (48%). Surgery was required for 80 patients (68%). Microbial agents were identified in 116/118 patients, with 24 patients presenting with polymicrobial sepsis (20%). The mean duration of antibiotic treatment was 42 +/- 0.2 days and the mean clinical follow-up was 27 +/- 14 months. The treatment success rate was 91.5% (108/118). Six weeks of antimicrobial therapy appears to be effective for nearly all bone infections, regardless of the pathophysiology. These results encourage us to pursue attempts to simplify the management of bone infection without obvious prejudice to the patient.

AB  - Transplantation is the favored therapy for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Unfortunately, demand for available organs far outpaces the supply. African Americans are disproportionately affected by the ever-widening gap between organ supply and demand. Additionally, structural, biological, and social factors contribute to feelings of unease some African Americans may feel regarding living donor transplant (LDT). The present research examines the relationship between trust in health care and attitudes toward LDT among African American ESRD patients. We hypothesized that lower trust in health care would be significantly associated with negative attitudes toward LDT, and that this relationship would be moderated by patient attitudes toward dialysis. Data were collected from August 2011 to April 2012 as part of a larger study. Measures included trust (of doctors, racial equity of treatment, and hospitals) and attitudes toward both LDT and dialysis. Bivariate analysis revealed that trust in one's doctor, hospital, and in racial equity in health care was significantly correlated with attitudes toward LDT (r=0.265; r=0.131; and r=0.202, respectively). Additionally, attitudes toward dialysis moderated the relationships between Trust in Doctors/Attitudes toward LDT and Trust in Racial equity of treatment/Attitudes toward LDT. Findings suggest a strong relationship between trust in health care and attitudes toward LDT. These findings also shed light on how dialysis experiences are related to the relationship between trust in health care and attitudes toward LDT.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand how organisational culture influences the intentions of primary care staff members (PCSM) to engage in research and development (R&D).
   Design/methodology/approach - The participants (n = 30) were PCSM employed in a care centre in south-western Sweden. The study had an observational design with an ethnographic approach. The data were collected by means of observations, interviews and analysis of documents.
   Findings - The results revealed the perceptions of PCSM in two domains, research and clinical practice, both of which existed at three different cultural levels: visible (structures and policy), semivisible (norms and values) and invisible (taken-for-granted attitudes).
   Research limitations/implications - It is difficult to conduct a purely objective ethnographic study because the investigation is controlled by its context. However, it is necessary to highlight and discuss the invisible level to improve understanding of negative attitudes and preconceptions related to the implementation of R&D in the clinical setting.
   Practical implications - By highlighting the invisible level of culture, the management of an organisation has the opportunity to initiate discussion of issues related to concealed norms and values as well as attitudes towards new thinking and change in the primary health context.
   Originality/value - This paper is one of the very few studies to investigate the influence of organisational culture on the intentions of PCSM to engage in R&D.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify quantitative data on the use of seclusion and restraint in different countries and on initiatives to reduce these interventions.
   Combined literature review on initiatives to reduce seclusion and restraint, and epidemiological data on the frequency and means of use in the 21st century in different countries. Unpublished study was detected by contacting authors of conference presentations. Minimum requirements for the inclusion of data were reporting the incidence of coercive measures in complete hospital populations for defined periods and related to defined catchment areas.
   There are initiatives to gather data and to develop new clinical practice in several countries. However, data on the use of seclusion and restraint are scarcely available so far. Data fulfilling the inclusion criteria could be detected from 12 different countries, covering single or multiple hospitals in most counties and complete national figures for two countries (Norway, Finland). Both mechanical restraint and seclusion are forbidden in some countries for ethical reasons. Available data suggest that there are huge differences in the percentage of patients subject to and the duration of coercive interventions between countries.
   Databases on the use of seclusion and restraint should be established using comparable key indicators. Comparisons between countries and different practices can help to overcome prejudice and improve clinical practice.

AB  - Background: Weight loss does not necessarily decrease the negative appraisal of a formerly overweight individual. Since past weight history tends to be disclosed in several contexts, this study aims to investigate whether negative appraisals are gender-specific and if they are modulated by the evaluators' own BMI. Methods: 202 young adults (106 male and 96 female) viewed a picture of a young attractive female (target) accompanied by one of two statements about her past weight (overweight (OW) or always kept a normal weight (NW)), and then rated her using the Fat Phobia Scale (FPS). Results: Female evaluators rated the target with the OW statement more negatively than the target with the NW statement. In contrast, males exposed to the OW statement rated the target as having fewer emotional/psychological problems and being less stupid/uncreative. BMI only influenced ratings in males, where those with higher BMI ascribed more negative attributes to the target with the NW statement than the OW statement. Conclusion: Information on weight history impacts upon the appraisal of peers. These effects are dependent on gender and BMI. Knowing that a young female was overweight triggered negative evaluations from females but did not appear to impact the judgment of males. (C) 2013 S. Karger GmbH, Freiburg

AB  - Aims and objectives. With a focus on sexual health and rights, this study describes how transgender people experience meetings with health care professionals.
   Background. Transgender people face prejudice and discrimination worldwide. Little is known of their experiences in sexual health-promoting settings.
   Method. Within a descriptive design, 20 persons aged 18-74 and identifying as transgender and nonbinary were interviewed. The results were analysed with constructivist grounded theory.
   Results. Disrespect among health care professionals is the core category connected to the experiences in the result; transgender people experience estrangement, expectations and eviction in different sexual health-promoting settings.
   Conclusion. Transgender knowledge needs to be increased in general, in both specialised transgender health care and many other health care settings, to prevent transgender peoples' experiences of estrangement. Moreover, an increased knowledge of, and respect for, sexual health and rights is needed to prevent transgender peoples' exposure to gender binary, cis- and heteronormative expectations. In addition, access to sexual health care is essential following gender-confirmatory care as well to avoid transgender peoples' experiences of eviction from the health care system.
   Relevance to clinical practice. Nurses have an important role to play in striving for equity and justice within health care. This study describes how health care professionals appear to be disrespectful and suggestions of how this can be avoided are made.

AB  - There are a variety of trends that are enabling and forcing organizational change. A crucial trend that has implications for a changing and growing demographic workforce includes Millennials and in particular Latinos/Hispanics as the world and particularly the U.S. workplace continues to have an increased aging workforce. Yet, while Latinos are members of the largest and also the fastest growing minority group in the United States, they are disproportionately underrepresented in more highly compensated professional and leadership roles across corporate America. The majority of existing career development and acculturation literature in the United States has focused narrowly on Anglo-oriented acculturation as a linear process. Unfortunately, as society has evolved so has the form of prejudices and biases. This is supported by the fact that well more than 50% of Hispanics experience discrimination through a variety of means including micro-aggressions. We believe that developing and maintaining an overlapping and compatible bicultural identity might not be enough and that we need to rethink what acculturation and biculturalism means for millennials and broaden our thinking to include cosmopolitanism as more encompassing of the millennials and their place in the world. We believe this article begins the dialogue for more research into this growing part of the U.S. workforce along with practical implications and applications.

AB  - According to an understanding of casual conversation articulated by various theories of discourse analysis including Conversation Analysis (Sacks et al., 1974), pragmatics (Levinson, 1983) and politeness theory (Brown and Levinson, 1987), it is extremely unlikely that silence would ever be regarded as an appropriate response to a question or accusation. Yet, in the specialised institutional setting of a police interview, it is expected by the legislators in many jurisdictions that ordinary people will be able to access this interactional resource unproblematically, and presumably without any assumption of listener prejudice.
   An analysis of the interactional strategies of police interview participants in 13 police interviews recorded in Victoria, Australia demonstrates that the contributions of the suspect are highly constrained in a number of ways, including allowable turn types and the management of topic initiations. If assumptions about 'preferred responses' based on ordinary conversation are used to interpret non-response in this particular institutional setting, then these interactionally restricted contributions, which will be presented as evidence, may be susceptible to adverse inference in a way that is unlikely to be addressed by the judicial system. This paper concludes that by applying principles of pragmatics, and in particular the use of preference, it is possible to present a case against the erosion of the defendant's right to silence.

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is a worldwide fatal cancer among females. Efforts fighting against this disease should start with females at younger ages. This study evaluated the effectiveness a BC educational program in promoting female university students' knowledge and attitudes towards BC and practices of breast self-examination (BSE). A pre- and post-test design was used in two phases; pre- and post-intervention phase. A 1-day educational program was conducted with theoretical and practical educational sessions. Participants were evaluated twice (before and 2 weeks after the intervention) for the following variables: knowledge regarding BC warning signs, BC risk factors and knowledge in regard to BSE, in addition to their attitudes and practices of BSE. A total of 110 participants were randomized into either intervention (n = 64, 58.2%) or control group (n = 46, 41.8%). Analysis revealed that participants in both groups had relatively low level of knowledge, negative attitudes, and poor practice towards BC and BSE before attending the intervention. Analysis of the post test revealed that participants in the interventional group had significant improvement in knowledge, positive attitudes, and more practice of BSE compared to participants in the control group. The implementation of a BC awareness program had positive effects on the female university students' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding BC and BSE. Findings from this study strengthen and reinforce the importance of conducting such awareness programs for this young age group.

AB  - Background: Although the number of adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has increased considerably in recent years, there are few qualitative investigations of the experiences of adults with adult-diagnosed ADHD in Japan. This study aimed to explore in depth the diagnosis-related experiences and needs of such adults.
   Methods: Participants were 12 psychiatric outpatients aged 23-55years diagnosed with ADHD during adulthood. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted to examine participants' experiences of receiving, and subsequently coping with, an ADHD diagnosis. A thematic analysis of the interview data was performed.
   Results: Six themes emerged: difficulties in accepting the diagnosis, interest in ADHD, feelings of relief, identity concerns, dealing with symptoms, and acceptance of ADHD. Despite initial negative reactions, participants were willing to learn about the disorder, spending time seeking ADHD-related information and sharing it with loved ones. Participants felt relieved after the diagnosis, as they realized why they had experienced long-term problems and incorrect labeling. However, participants also had identity concerns. They gradually began to accept their ADHD symptoms and deal with them better.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that, when treating individuals with adult-diagnosed ADHD, it is important to promote self-understanding and reduce negative attitudes toward ADHD; to provide appropriate, brief, evidence-based information about ADHD; and to give individuals sufficient time to think about their ADHD symptoms, how they have affected their daily lives, and how to cope with them in the future.

AB  - The global world's financial crisis of 2008-2009 caused a global recession that greatly affected the economy of Greece. Since then, Greece faces a severe financial crisis and governments announced, among other measures to tackle this crisis, the implementation of green growth strategies. The aim of this study is the investigation of public's perceptions of green growth strategies that have been implemented so far, the investigation of the effect of the socioeconomic characteristics on these perceptions and the identification of patterns of attitudes toward the concept of green growth. For this purpose, a questionnaire was constructed and addressed to 500 inhabitants of Athens. The majority of the respondents believe that economic growth can be enhanced by green growth. On the other hand, most of the respondents, mainly younger and more educated people, express a strong prejudice for its adoption by enterprises and its implementation by the state. Overall, results reveal that despite the announcements of the political parties concerning green growth policy, the majority of the respondents accepts and applauds green growth as a theoretical concept rather than counting its benefits as an already implemented policy. These findings consist an important assessment tool for policy makers that can be used to redesign policies in order to achieve the goals of green growth and to meet the real needs of the citizens in a period of economic crisis.

AB  - Background: Health is an important aspect of individuals' lives as they age. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship of sociodemographic factors, diagnosed chronic health conditions, and current depression with attitudes to aging in midlife.
   Methods: A cross-sectional baseline analysis was conducted on the first 300 participants from the Canterbury Health, Ageing and Life Course study in New Zealand, a stratified randomized community longitudinal study of adults recruited between 49 and 51 years. Attitudes were measured using the Attitudes to Aging Questionnaire (AAQ) and analyzed with a range of prevalent diagnosed chronic conditions, current depression, and sociodemographic variables.
   Results: Individuals perceived their physical aging more negatively after a diagnosis of hypertension, arthritis or asthma. Diagnosed lifetime depression and anxiety, and current depression, showed strong relationships with attitudes to aging across domains. After controlling for sociodemographic factors and current depression, individuals with diagnosed hypertension, arthritis, asthma, lifetime depression or anxiety continued to report significantly more negative attitudes to aging. Current depression showed the strongest associations with attitudes to aging and mediated relationships of health on attitudes to aging.
   Conclusions: Physical and mental health are related to attitudes to aging. Most chronic conditions examined are significantly associated with attitudes toward aging in the physical change domain. Diagnosed lifetime depression and anxiety, and current depression, are negatively related across attitudinal domains. Individuals can feel positive about aging while experiencing poorer health, but this is more difficult in the presence of low mood.

AB  - Hijra is a distinctive South Asia known for their gender and sexual difference and associated with their transgender and intersex identities. Otherwise known as transwomen, they are traditionally subjected to prejudices and embedded within narratives of exclusion, discrimination, and the subculture. As a result, Hijras are typically perceived as isolated, abject, and passive victims who remain social and economic peripheries. Concerning the stereotypical image of hijras, this study explores Arundhati Roy's The Ministry of Utmost Happiness (2017) to examine the novel's problematization of hijras in India. In this novel, sexual and gender non-conformity are addressed within characters desiring to be neither a man nor a woman. Drawing on Helene Cixous's theories of inherent bisexuality and ecriture feminine, this study examines characters' contestations and alterations of existing definitions of sex and gender. This framework allows for a manifestation of gender flexibility and feminine writing as a tool for self-emancipation. Both protagonists Anjum and Tilo, illustrate that hijras are not predetermined but are formulated in a complex process of a conscious rewriting of the self. While the former character resists heteropatriarchal normativity through her conscious alterations of the phallogocentric structure of her Urdu language, the latter defies societal conventions of family and marriage with unorthodox views and actions that are materialized in the writing of her story.

AB  - Divergence in land carbon cycle simulation is persistent and widespread. Regardless of model intercomparison project, results from individual models diverge significantly from each other and, in consequence, from reference datasets. Here we link model spread to structure using a 15-member ensemble of land surface models from the Multi-scale synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP) as a test case. Our analysis uses functional benchmarks and model structure as predicted by model skill in a machine learning framework to isolate discrete aspects of model structure associated with divergence. Wealso quantify how initial conditions prejudice present-day model outcomes after centennial-scale transient simulations. Overall, the functional benchmark and machine learning exercises emphasize the importance of ecosystem structure in correctly simulating carbon and water cycling, highlight uncertainties in the structure of carbon pools, and advise against hard parametric limits on ecosystem function. Wealso find that initial conditions explain 90% of variation in global satellite-era values-initial conditions largely predetermine transient endpoints, historical environmental change not withstanding. As MsTMIP prescribes forcing data and spin-up protocol, the range in initial conditions and high levels of predetermination are also structural. Our results suggest that methodological tools linking divergence to discrete aspects of model structure would complement current community best practices in model development.

AB  - In prior work, we proposed that the related processes of status differentiation and stigmatization both diminish the status of negatively labeled groups, but that only stigma also engenders social rejection, in part via appraisals of abnormality (Lucas & Phelan, 2012, Phelan, Lucas, Ridgeway, & Taylor, 2014). We found support for this model using behavioral measures of influence and social distance. In this article, we compare status and stigma processes using both explicit (self-reported, consciously controlled) and implicit (relatively less consciously controlled) associations in a large, online volunteer sample (N = 1,348) based on appraisals of "uneducated people" (low status) and "mentally ill people" (high stigma). As expected, we found that both uneducated and mentally ill people elicited negative explicit and implicit appraisals on the dimension of incompetence, and that mentally ill people elicited explicit and implicit appraisals of abnormality. Contrary to our prediction, uneducated people were also viewed, explicitly and implicitly, as abnormal, suggesting pervasive bias across two very disparate groups (uneducated and mentally ill), appraisal types (explicit and implicit), and appraisal dimensions (incompetent and abnormal). Notably, in follow-up manipulation checks to better understand the impact of the uneducated people category label, using independent samples, we showed that the term uneducated tends to elicit representation of individuals who did not complete high school, and we replicated the original findings that uneducated people (especially those with less than a high school education) are appraised as both incompetent and abnormal.

AB  - Objective: Patients describe feelings of bias and prejudice in clinical encounters; however, their perspectives on restoring the encounter once bias is perceived are not known. Implicit bias has emerged as a target for curricular interventions. In order to inform the design of novel patient-centered curricular interventions, this study explores patients' perceptions of bias, and suggestions for restoring relationships if bias is perceived.
   Methods: The authors conducted bilingual focus groups with purposive sampling of self-identified Black and Latino community members in the US. Data were analyzed using grounded theory.
   Results: Ten focus groups (in English (6) and Spanish (4)) with N = 74 participants occurred. Data analysis revealed multiple influences patients' perception of bias in their physician encounters. The theory emerging from the analysis suggests if bias is perceived, the outcome of the encounter can still be positive. A positive or negative outcome depends on whether the physician acknowledges this perceived bias or not, and his or her subsequent actions.
   Conclusions: Participant lived experience and physician behaviors influence perceptions of bias, however clinical relationships can be restored following perceived bias.
   Practice implications: Providers might benefit from skill development in the recognition and acknowledgement of perceived bias in order to restore patient-provider relationships. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite having safe and efficacious vaccines against COVID-19, vaccine hesitancy is widespread. Although a trusted source of information, vaccine hesitancy has been reported among healthcare professionals, yet few studies have explored this phenomenon in sub-Saharan Africa. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare professionals in Sierra Leone from January to March 2022. Measures included sociodemographic /health-related information and COVID-19-related concerns. From the responses, we constructed a hesitancy (VAX) score, with higher scores implying negative attitudes or unwillingness to vaccinate. Multivariate linear regression was used to access factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. Overall, 592 participants submitted responses (67.2% female, mean age 29 years, 5.6% physicians/pharmacists, 44.3% medical students, 29.2% nurses, 20.9% nursing students). The mean VAX score was 43.27 +/- 8.77, with 60.1% of respondents classified as vaccine hesitant (>50th percentile) and 13.8% as highly hesitant (>75th percentile). Worries about unforeseen future effects (76.3%), a preference for natural immunity (59.5%), and profiteering/mistrust of health authorities (53.1%) were the most common concerns. Being a medical student (beta = 0.105, p = 0.011) and previously refusing a recommended vaccine (beta = 0.177, p < 0.001) were predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Our findings call for addressing vaccine hesitancy among healthcare professionals as an essential component of strategies aimed at increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake in this setting.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to determine whether an inclusive teaching session changes student attitudes towards people with intellectual disabilities (ID). To investigate the impact of an inclusive teaching session in terms of student perceptions. Design/methodology/approach 66 years 4 students at Cardiff University completed the attitudes towards disabled people form B questionnaire (ATDP-B) before and after a communication skills session on ID. Before and after scores were collated and compared using a pairedt-test analysis. Common perceptions were identified using anonymised ATDP-B results to conduct five semi-structured interviews and one focus group with nine students. The common perceptions were discussed, alongside how the teaching session tackled them and suggestions for further improvements. Findings Mean ATDP-B score before the teaching session was 115 (SD = 14.5). Mean ATDP-B score after the teaching session was 122 (SD = 17.2). The teaching session improved scores in the ATDP-B by a mean of 6.92 (4.69, 9.16). A pairedt-test found this to be a statistically significant difference, t(65) = 6.20, p < 0.001. Qualitative data was thematically analysed and three main themes were identified: Student identity, patient contact and curriculum content. Originality/value This is the first study to investigate the origin of the negative attitudes of medical students, and found they stem from a lack of confidence in their abilities and failure to develop a professional identity. The impact of the teaching session stems from its focus on meaningful patient contact and identifying and overcoming communication barriers.

AB  - Background: Tooth filling treatment is utilized at low levels in many low and middle-income countries (LMICs), further, little is known about the prevailing attitudes towards such treatment. This study aimed to assess attitudes towards tooth filling among Tanzanian adults and how previous tooth filling experience is associated with these attitudes.
   Methods: A pretested structured questionnaire was distributed among 1522 out-patients in four regional hospitals in Tanzania in 2015-16. The questionnaire had eight statements on a 6-point Likert scale measuring attitudes towards tooth filling. Responses were analyzed independently and through a constructed attitude sum score. Linear regression analysis was used to assess the association of previous tooth fillings on attitudes towards tooth filling treatment.
   Results: The respondents were mostly female (57.3%), with a mean age of 33.1 years (SD 11.3). About one third of the respondents (36.4%) had primary level of education. Attitudes towards tooth filling treatment were generally negative. Low levels of education and income were associated with more negative attitudes. A small proportion (11.5%) had a previous tooth filling. Having a previous tooth filling was associated with a more positive attitude towards tooth fillings regardless of socioeconomic status.
   Conclusions: This study shows that even in areas with limited resources and availability of services, previous experience of tooth fillings is related to more positive attitudes towards restorative treatment, which should be taken into account when planning oral health care programs.

AB  - Tragic collective events bring about long-term consequences for affected groups. These effects not only affect the immediate victims of trauma, but can also influence subsequent generations. In the present research, we examined the effects of minority language use on historical trauma. In a study of 237 Lemko participants, members of a severely victimized ethnic minority in Poland, we tested the effects of cognitive availability of historical trauma on three categories of trauma-related symptoms: emotional, behavioral, and depressive. The study found that minority language use is positively related to cognitive availability of trauma, but it also limits the effects of such availability on trauma-related symptoms. Based on this finding, we discuss the potential of minority language use to act as a social cure protecting from the negative psychological consequences of historical trauma.

AB  - Insects are a renewable natural food resource, in many regions of the world they are consumed as a food supplement or as a main constituent of the diet of different peoples because they contain considerable amounts of proteins and lipids, however in western countries their consumption is minimal due to cultural resistance, to overcome prejudice, alternative consumption is necessary. The aim of the study was to develop high-protein cookies enriched with silkworm pupae (Bombyx mori). Three (3) formulations were prepared with different pupae concentrations (15%, 20% and 25%) incorporated in a standard biscuit formulation. The influence of pupae incorporation on the technological, nutritional and sensory properties of the biscuit was evaluated. The results obtained in the sensorial evaluation demonstrated that the biscuit formulations with the addition of pupae obtained positive acceptance scores, in most of the evaluated attributes (appearance, aroma, color, residual taste, sweetness, texture and global acceptance), with scores above 6. The standard biscuit received the highest marks in the sensory evaluation. The residual flavor was perceived in the cookies with silkworm pupae compromising the purchase intention. The protein content (17.65%), in the formulation with the addition of 15% of silkworm pupae, resulted in a product classified as a food with a high protein content, which indicates the beneficial nutritional potential of the biscuit.

AB  - Ageism and negative attitudes are said to be institutionally embedded in healthcare during a time when there are unprecedented increases in older population numbers. As nurses care for older people in a range of environments it is important to examine attitudes and perceptions of undergraduate nurses towards older people. A longitudinal mixed methods study in conjunction with a three-year undergraduate UK nursing programme 2009-2012 was conducted with 310 undergraduate nurses. A questionnaire incorporating Kogan's attitude towards older people scale and a drawing of a person aged 75 years was completed three times, once each year. Thurstone scale and photo elicitation were also employed. Comparisons were made between individual participant's attitude score and drawing. The study established 75% of participants had moderately positive attitudes towards older people when the programme began, at the programme end this had increased to 98%. Age, gender, educational qualifications, practice learning, nursing field and contact with older people influenced participants' overall attitude score. Drawings provided a visual narrative of participants' perceptions of older people, appearance was a dominant discourse and the images were socially constructed. The study established the undergraduate nursing programme influenced attitudes and perceptions towards older people and suggests nurse education can influence changing attitudes. To date there is no known study that has advanced this understanding.

AB  - Inulin is a prebiotic carbohydrate widely used in the food industry due to its health-related claims and its ability to modify/improve the technological properties of food products. However, industrial processes such as thermal treatments, can cause structure changes in prebiotic carbohydrates affecting their health benefits and technological properties, but these aspects have received little attention. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of thermal treatments (70-100 degrees C/60 s) on inulin chemical stability in a dairy system, araticum flavoured whey beverage. Compared with untreated whey beverage, the thermally processed whey beverages did not exhibit any changes in pH (5.59), total soluble solids (24.63-25.19 degrees Brix), glucose (16.11-17.97 mg/mL), fructose (17.75-19.49 mg/mL), sucrose (89.00-94.14 mg/mL) and lactose (61.59-67.19 mg/mL). The chromatographic analysis displayed no significant differences in content (GF(2)-GF(4) ranged from 3.04 to 3.28 mg/mL) and profile of inulin (average DP = 10) between untreated and thermally processed beverages, showing that inulin had strong ability to resist thermal degradation in a dairy system. This study has provided consistent and clear results regarding inulin thermal stability, showing that inulin can be successfully added in thermally processed commercial dairy beverages without prejudice to their prebiotic properties.

AB  - Introduction: The incidence of cervical cancer (CC) in eastern European countries is high; however, uptake of available prevention strategies is suboptimal. We explored knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes toward CC prevention strategies in Latvian women.
   Methods: A mixed-methods study of Latvian women, consisting of surveys and semi-structured interviews, was conducted in Riga, Latvia in September and October 2015.
   Results: Altogether, 158 surveys were completed and 10 interviews were conducted. In total, 87% (n = 135) had previously had a smear test, and 67% (n = 105) correctly identified that cervical cytology was performed to identify precancerous changes. The practice of annual gynecological checkups was prevalent, and many believed it to be synonymous with cervical screening. Detailed knowledge of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the HPV vaccine was deficient, although 73% (n = 115) and 70% (n = 90), respectively, claimed to have heard of them. Negative attitudes existed regarding the HPV vaccine due to fear of potential side effects. On learning that HPV was transmitted through sexual contact, the notion of testing positive for HPV was met with shame and embarrassment.
   Conclusions: A small proportion of Latvian women are over-screened, whereas many women remain unscreened. The main contributing factor for this was their poor understanding of the roles that cervical screening and HPV vaccination play in preventing CC.

AB  - Research on the metrological characteristics of linguistic quantitative characteristics (LQCs) based on corpus and metrological linguistic methods has gained wide attention in artificial and online machine translations. Although a support vector machine (SVM) is one of the most widely used machine learning (ML) algorithms in the field of text analysis, its application in the study of translation style is rare. This study compares the translation styles of Pride and Prejudice with ML using different linguistic measurement features. Firstly, the language measurement features of three translations are obtained with the information gain algorithm. Specifically, the corpus can be achieved through human-machine interaction (HCI), i.e., computers can look, hear, touch, smell, taste, and speak using sensors such as cameras and mathematical algorithms. Then a text classifier, i.e., an SVM, is constructed on the basis of these features to automatically classify the translated texts of the three translations. Finally, the validity of the classifier is verified by the tenfold cross-validation method. It is proved that the SVM algorithm has high classification accuracy and a strong predictive function, which is helpful for judging or predicting the translation or translator's style. Compared with the traditional method, this classification method based on an SVM saves time and effort, the process can be repeated, and the result is accurate and reliable.

AB  - This study explored the possibility of applying personalized takeover requests (TORs) in an automated driving system (ADS), which required drivers to regain control when the system reached its limits. A driving simulator experiment was conducted to investigate how speech-based TOR voices impacted driver performance in takeover scenarios with two lead time conditions in conditionally automated driving (level 3). Eighteen participants drove in three sessions, with each session having a different TOR voice (a synthesized male voice, a synthesized female voice, and a significant other voice). Two scenarios with a lead time of 5 s and two scenarios with a lead time of 12 s were provided per session. The driver takeover time and quality data were collected. A follow-up interview was conducted to gain a clearer understanding of the drivers' psychological feelings about each TOR voice during takeovers. Changes in takeover time and takeover quality caused by TOR voices were similar in both lead time conditions, except for the lateral acceleration. The synthesized male voice led to a larger maximum lateral acceleration than the other two voices in the 5 s condition. Interestingly, most drivers preferred choosing the synthesized female voice for future takeovers and showed negative attitudes toward the significant other voice. Our results implied that choosing TOR voices should consider the drivers' daily voice-usage habits as well as specific context of use, and personalized TOR voices should be incorporated into the ADS prudently.

AB  - Research on Asian American educational attainment suggests that a combination of immigrant hyper-selectivity and ethnic capital enables second-generation Asian Americans to succeed according to a narrowly-defined success frame. However, recent quantitative work suggests that ethnoracialized advantages within the educational system do not translate into advantages in the workplace. This study therefore examines second-generation Asian Americans' experiences as they seek work in the labour market. I draw from 30 semi-structured qualitative interviews with 1.5- and second-generation Asian Americans in the New York City area, all of whom had entered the full-time workforce within the previous ten years. I find that these recent labour market entrants faced three major constraints and enacted several strategies in response. Family and community networks no longer provided the same ethnoracialized resources and network ties that might enable educational success; in response, workers mobilised institutional resources and peer networks. Once in the workplace, respondents experienced racialized microaggressions; in response, they minimised the role of race. Finally, they encountered negative stereotyping; in response, they worked to distance themselves from such stereotypes. Overall, these findings shed light on how ethnoracialized processes impact the presumed link between educational and occupational success.

AB  - Primary implant stability is a prerequisite for successful implant osseointegration. The osseodensification technique (OD) is a non-subtractive drilling technique that preserves the bone tissue, increases osteotomy wall density, and improves the primary stability. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that OD, through a wider osteotomy, produces healing chambers (HCs) at the implant-bone interface without impacting low-density bone primary stability. Twenty implants (3.5x10 mm) with a nanohydroxyapatite (nHA) surface were inserted in the ilium of ten sheep. Implant beds were prepared as follows: (i) 2.7-mm-wide using subtractive conventional drilling (SCD) technique (n=10); (ii) 3.8-mm-wide using an OD bur system (n=10). The sheep were randomized to two groups, with samples collected at either 14-(n=5) or 28-days (n=5) post-surgery and processed for histological and histomorphometric evaluation of bone-implant contact (BIC) and bone area fraction occupancy (BAFO). No significant group differences were found with respect to final insertion torque and implant stability quotient (p>0.050). BIC values were higher for SCD after 14 and 28 days (p<0.050); however, BAFO values were similar (p>0.050). It was possible to conclude that the OD technique allowed a wider implant bed preparation without prejudice on primary stability and bone remodeling.

AB  - China has recently put forth an ambitious plan to achieve carbon peak around 2030 and carbon neutrality around 2060. However, there are quite a few differences regarding the public views about China's carbon policy between the Chinese people and the people from other countries, especially concerning the doubt of foreign people about the fidelity of China's carbon policy goals. Based on Twitter data related to China's carbon policy topics from 2008 to 2020, this study shows the inter- and intra-annual trends in the count of tweets about China's carbon policy, conducts sentiment analysis, extracts top frequency words from different attitudes, and analyzes the impact of China's official Twitter accounts on the global view of China's carbon policy. Our results show: (1) the global attention to China's carbon policy gradually rises and occasionally rises suddenly due to important carbon events; (2) the proportion of Twitter users with negative sentiment about China's carbon policy has increased rapidly and has exceeded the proportion of Twitter users with positive sentiment since 2019; (3) people in developing countries hold more positive or neutral attitudes towards China's carbon policy, while developed countries hold more negative attitudes; (4) China's official Twitter accounts serve to improve the global views on China's carbon policy.

AB  - This article focuses on the early stages of an international project on gamifying national identity. It examines the production of the content required for developing a sophisticated and engaging approach to pedagogical innovation in education, through game-based learning. This will encourage individuals to think about both European and national identity, specifically within the context of the European Union (EU). At a time when the EU faces significant challenges, a better understanding and appreciation of the role of national and supra-national identity and belonging in Europe is clear. RU EU? - an Erasmus+ funded project - aims to develop an innovative online game to help students and others enhance their understanding of their own national and European identities and challenge attitudes and prejudices. The content development of the game has brought together experts with socio-political knowledge, pedagogical understanding and technical expertise. This article discusses the early stages in the content development process, during which we amassed material from literature reviews, academic interviews and student focus groups and surveys. We sought to ensure that the content of the game reflected the issues raised within the game development lifecycle and our article describes our engagement with this material and its integration into game content.

AB  - Multilingual speakers' ability to communicate effectively and intelligibly in the language of their country of residence is crucial to their participation. This study explored multilingual speakers' motivations for improving their intelligibility in English and their perceptions of potential barriers and facilitators to enhancing intelligibility. Participants were multilingual students and staff at 14 Australian universities. Extended response data from 137 survey responses were combined with seven semi-structured interviews, thematically analyzed using the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health as a conceptual framework, and coded using NVivo software. Three overarching themes were: motivations, barriers, and facilitators. Themes that emerged under motivations were meeting their own and others' expectations and career aspirations. Themes that emerged under barriers to intelligibility were lack of self-awareness of reduced English intelligibility, use of ineffective strategies (e.g., fast speech rate to disguise pronunciation difficulties), language differences, lack of opportunity to practise English, participants' perceptions of others' negative attitudes to their English skills, and challenging conversational partners. Facilitators to intelligibility were emotional support from others, beneficial strategies (e.g., confirming listener understanding), and opportunities to practice. The results highlight the importance of supporting multilingual speakers' efforts to improve their English intelligibility. An environment with barriers such as lack of opportunity to practise English may restrict an individuals' performance and participation, while facilitators such as support from others may increase participation. This study will inform the understanding of speech-language pathologists engaged in intelligibility enhancement, as well as SLPs working with multilingual speakers in any context.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Depression is a global concern and it is well known that certain segments of the population are at greater risk. Sexual minorities are recognized as being more likely to suffer from depression due to social stigma and prejudice. The aim of this study was to describe the relationship between sexual orientation and depression in the Canadian population.
   METHODS: The study used the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health data. The sample comprised 24,788 Canadians living in the ten provinces. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship of depression and sexual orientation.
   RESULTS: After adjusting for known risk factors for depression, there was no difference in prevalence of past 12-month or lifetime major depressive episode between sexual minorities and heterosexuals. Bisexuals did have a near significant trend towards higher prevalence of both past 12-month and lifetime depression as a combined group, but there were not clear differences when stratified by sex.
   CONCLUSION: This study supports important emerging trends in the relationship between sexual orientation and depression. Research on the mental health of sexual minority people must take into account differences between sexual minority groups and avoid aggregating mental health disorders into broad categories. These findings have implications for public health planning and clinical recommendations.

AB  - Tourism destinations' in Africa continue to experience stereotypes, prejudice and negative images. These are further amplified and reinforced by international media. International business events provide an opportunity to enhance the destination's touristic image and competitiveness. This study investigates the influence of business events experience on international visitors' perceived destination image. The study was carried out at three leading business event venues in Nairobi, Kenya. Convenience sampling method was used to select respondents during the events. A total of 335 questionnaires were successfully completed and used for data analysis. An exploratory factor analysis identified six business event experiences factors important in influencing a destination image including destination's venue facilities, accommodation facilities, destination attractions, destination accessibility, destination safety and security and perceived affordability of services. Structural analysis indicated that business event experiences influenced destination's cognitive image and the overall image. Destination cognitive image influenced destination's affective image and overall image, while the destination's affective image influenced the overall image. However, business event experiences did not have a direct significant influence on destination's affective image. The study findings extend the knowledge on influence of events on the host destination's image using business events perspective. Discussions and implications of the findings are also highlighted.

AB  - (1) Background. The increase in international conflicts and humanitarian crises has led to an increase in the movement of people to Europe. The legal and moral commitments of the European Union require the incorporation and integration of such refugees. In this sense, the school and its teaching staff are a key agent in the challenge of integrating newly arrived students. This research analyses attitudes towards inclusive European citizenship, the recognition of rights, and feelings of threat and affective reactions, experienced by future teachers towards refugees in France and Spain. (2) Methods. The investigation was carried out through a cross-sectional survey. There were 851 participants of Spanish and French nationality. (3) Results. The French future teachers showed a lower perception of any threat, and a better predisposition towards the reception of refugees than their Spanish counterparts. Women are those who show a greater recognition of the rights of refugees, and a better predisposition to their integration in Europe. French women feel less of a threat than Spanish women, and are more affective towards refugees. The main predictor of inclusive European citizenship is a low perception of threat related to refugees. (4) Conclusions. Future teachers showed sensitivity towards the accommodation of refugees, but programs that prevent growing xenophobia and discredit towards the European Union are still necessary.

AB  - This paper aims to explain the characteristics and internal mechanisms of protest activity and solidarity among Russia's industrial workers over the past two decades. Both academic discussions and officials' attitudes toward protests prove contradictory. Even in periods of increase, labor activism has remained limited. Yet authorities continue to show concern about real and potential discontent, while academics puzzle over the dominance of quiescence as well as the reasons for sporadic activism. The research presented in this article advances our understanding of both: the limits of protest, and the causes, forms and goals of Russian labor's periodic collective activism. We rely on a combination of available statistical and recent survey data to try to resolve the paradoxes of labor's quiescence and conflict, as well as elites' neglect and concern.
   The research finds changes in patterns of labor activism over the two decades. During the 1990s, most strikes were limited, defensive, managed, or desperate in character. In Russia's recovered economy, from 2006 a qualitatively different, "classical" pattern of strikes and labor relations emerged. Workers' collective actions mainly affected large, profitable industrial and transnational enterprises and took the form of "normalized" bargaining and conflict between labor and management. With the 2008-09 recession workers returned to the defensive strategies of the 1990s, protesting wage cuts and factory closures. Survey research from 2010 shows workers to be almost evenly divided between groups with positive and negative attitudes toward solidarity and bargaining.

AB  - Antiracism research often examines how stigmatized groups transform the meanings associated with their group. A complementary approach analyses the tactics that dominant and subordinate groups use to defend or advance their 'group positions' in situations that threaten the status quo. A case study of the proposed relocation of an Aboriginal child welfare facility to a rural Ontario township sheds light on both processes. Before rejecting the proposal, white residents and municipal councillors used delaying tactics, searched for race-neutral justifications, offered unsolicited advice, created new rules, and censured 'traitors'. The Native agency (and its few white 'allies'), guided by traditional decision-making practices, initially tried to provide 'neutral' information, stay positive, and emphasize common interests. When these tactics failed, they considered others before foregoing the opportunity to appeal to an independent tribunal. Ultimately, this case shows how laissez-faire frames and small-town dynamics can limit the choice and effectiveness of antiracist tactics.

AB  - We investigated the developmental courses of both implicit and explicit racial biases in relation to the perceived social status of outgroups. We did so by assessing these biases among Chinese participants (N = 200, age range from 4- to 19-year-olds) toward 2 different other-race groups that differ in terms of perceived social status (i.e., Whites and Blacks). At the youngest age, children showed both implicit anti-White and anti-Black bias at similar levels. However, these biases had different patterns of age-related change: implicit anti-Black bias remained strong and stable over time, whereas implicit anti-White bias declined after age 10. For explicit bias, children showed a decline in anti-Black and anti-White bias. Implicit and explicit biases were uncorrelated at all ages. The observed age-related changes demonstrate that it is possible for patterns of biases toward different races to diverge with age, and that perceived social status may contribute to the differential developmental patterns.

AB  - AimTo investigate barriers to patient engagement in the delivery of safe hospital care.
   DesignQualitative exploratory study.
   MethodsA qualitative study with 35 Iranian health professionals was conducted from February to April 2019 using semi-structured interviews to elicit their opinions. MAXQDA 11 software was used for data management, and the data were analysed using framework analysis.
   ResultsBarriers, which potentially have negative impact on patient engagement in the delivery of safer care, were categorized into four themes. The first category included patient-related barriers such as low levels of health literacy, ineffective education, patient unwillingness and cultural barriers. The second category included staff-related barriers such as the existence of negative attitudes towards engaging patients in matters relating to patient safety, ineffective communication, high workload and the reluctance on the part of physicians to engage with patients. Barriers created by limited resources and inadequate training provided by universities and in the workplace formed the third category and community-related barriers such as the inadequate dissemination of information via the mass media and a lack of community-based services formed the fourth category.
   ConclusionResults demonstrate the multilayered nature of the significant barriers to the engagement of patients in the delivery of safe care and reflect the need for a collaborative approach between the recipients of care, researchers, care providers and policy makers if these are to be overcome.

AB  - AimThe human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rate in Japan fell to nearly 0% following widespread coverage of possible adverse events. Developing a next approach to promote the effective prevention of HPV-related diseases including cervical cancer (CC) in Japan requires comprehensive understanding of knowledge and attitudes regarding CC prevention, HPV infection and HPV vaccination among the population including laypersons and medical professions in Japan.
   MethodsA questionnaire survey was administered in a wide variety of settings in Japan. The questionnaire contained items on knowledge about CC, HPV infection and HPV vaccination; awareness of the HPV vaccine's effectiveness and associated adverse events; and attitudes toward the HPV vaccination for their daughters and for men/boys.
   ResultsOf 3033 targeted people, complete survey responses were received from 1182 men and 1602 women (total: 2784). The male laypersons' group had significantly lower knowledge than did the female laypersons' group (adjusted odds ratio, aOR=3.86, P<0.001). Compared with the male laypersons' group, the female laypersons' group tended to have less positive attitudes toward HPV vaccination for their daughters (aOR=0.78, P=0.006), but the female laypersons' group showed more positive attitudes toward vaccinating men/boys (aOR=1.93, P<0.001).
   ConclusionThe survey results indicated that men in Japan generally lacked knowledge and awareness of HPV-related diseases and their prevention. However, women had more negative attitudes toward HPV vaccination for their daughters than did men. Increasing male involvement in HPV prevention and changing women's perceptions of the HPV vaccine are essential steps to increase the HPV vaccination rate.

AB  - Attitudes toward lesbians and gays vary across national populations, and previous research has found relatively more accepting attitudes in the Netherlands as compared to the United States. In this study, we compared beliefs about and attitudes toward lesbians and gays in samples of Dutch and American heterosexual adolescents, utilizing survey data from 1,080 American adolescents (mean age = 15.86 years) attending two schools and from 1,391 Dutch adolescents (mean age = 16.27 years) attending eight schools. Findings indicated the Dutch participants were more tolerant of lesbians and gays, after adjusting for the gender, age, and racial/ethnic minority status of the participants. However, between-country differences were attenuated by accounting for the beliefs about lesbians and gays that participants used to justify their attitudes. American participants were more likely to justify their attitudes using beliefs related to social norms and religious opposition, while the Dutch participants were more likely to justify their attitudes using beliefs related to individual rights and the biological/genetic basis of homosexuality. The results suggest that the relative importance of particular beliefs about lesbians and gays to attitudes at the group level may be context dependent but also that certain beliefs are salient to attitudes across national contexts.

AB  - Background Negative attitudes to smoking are well-established predictors of intentions to quit and quit behaviours, but less attention has been given to whether quitting is influenced by smoking-related thoughts and microbehaviours that reflect a concern about smoking.
   Objectives This paper aimed to describe the occurrence of smoking-related thoughts and microbehaviours among Chinese smokers, and to examine their predictive power for making quit attempts and sustained abstinence.
   Methods The data came from the first three waves of the International Tobacco Control China Survey. Four measures of recent thoughts about smoking and two microbehaviour measures (collectively referred to as microindicators) were examined.
   Results Most smokers (around three-quarters) reported thinking about harms of smoking to themselves or to others at least occasionally, and an increasing minority reported the two microbehaviours of prematurely butting out cigarettes and forgoing them. All microindicators were positively related to subsequent quit attempts in individual predictor analyses, but only serious thoughts about quitting and butting out cigarettes had independent relationships. Overall, there was no clear relationship between these microindicators and sustained abstinence.
   Conclusions There was a moderately high level of occurrence of recent smoking-related thoughts and microbehaviours among the Chinese adult smokers in the six cities studied. Like in the West, microindicators of concern about smoking were positively associated with subsequent quit attempts, but unlike in the West, they were largely unrelated to sustained abstinence.

AB  - Internalized stigma is the adoption of negative attitudes and stereotypes of the society regarding a person's illness. It causes decreased self-esteem and life-satisfaction, increased depression and suicidality, and difficulty in coping with the illness. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the internalized stigma state of psoriatic patients and to identify the factors influencing internalized stigma. The secondary aim was to identify the correlation of internalized stigma with quality of life and perceived health status. This multicentre, cross-sectional study comprised 1485 patients. There was a significant positive correlation between mean values of Psoriasis Internalized Stigma Scale (PISS) and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, Body Surface Area, Dermatological Life Quality Index and General Health Questionnaire-12 (P < 0.001 in all). Lower percieved health score (P = 0.001), early onset psoriasis (P = 0.016), family history of psoriasis (P = 0.0034), being illiterate (P < 0.001) and lower income level (P < 0.001) were determinants of high PISS scores. Mean PISS values were higher in erythrodermic and generalized pustular psoriasis. Involvement of scalp, face, hand, genitalia and finger nails as well as arthropathic and inverse psoriasis were also related to significantly higher PISS scores (P = 0.001). Our findings imply that psoriatic patients experience high levels of internalized stigma which are associated with psoriasis severity, involvement of visible body parts, genital area, folds or joints, poorer quality of life, negative perceptions of general health and psychological illnesses. Therefore, internalized stigma may be one of the major factors responsible from psychosocial burden of the disease.

AB  - Lay Summary The research outlines asexual identity development within the context of a sexualised society. Evidence suggests that while discovering and adopting an asexual identity is a common experience among asexuals, disclosure and how participants navigate their relationships may be subject to other features of identity such as gender and romantic attractions.
   This study aimed to identify components of asexual identity development and internalisation in the context of an allonormative society, with an added focus on the intersection of gender roles and romantic identities. 99 participants between the ages of 18 and 72 (M = 27.97, SD = 10.36) completed an open-ended questionnaire which was analysed using thematic analysis. Four major themes were identified: being asexual; becoming asexual; intimate social expression; and internalisation. Findings suggest that the process of discovering asexuality and identifying with the asexual community is a common experience among asexuals, and is not dependent upon a specific sexual, romantic or gender identity. Moreover, the negative ways in which many participants understand their lack of sexual attraction may be related to allonormativity and the internalisation of negative attitudes towards asexuality. However, participants' approach to disclosure and relationships, as well as their willingness to openly express their asexuality appeared to be dependent upon their gender identities and the nature of their desired relationships. Romantic-identified participants typically sought emotional intimacy and considered their asexuality to hinder their relationships, and female participants experienced greater sexual coercion when coming out. The theoretical implications of each theme within asexual identity development and internalisation are discussed.

AB  - Viral influence of consumer reviews can change the strategic intent of co-branding relationships between minority entrepreneurial startups and established corporations. When social justice positioning is involved, the intent is often to support minority businesses. We acknowledge this strategy as social justice branding. However, such alliances can trigger vitriolic responses. This backlash is an expression of free speech, and social media provides an obscure facilitative environment. The challenges of social justice branding are complex. We examine consumer online reviews of The Honey Pot and Target Corporation partnership, to understand the implications of social justice branding in practice. Using Leximancer analysis, we find that social justice branding elicits multiple emotions that empower action. Some consumers accepted the collaboration while others resisted. Analyzing the basis of the resistance revealed some consumers expressed racist and shameful behaviors displaying disagreement. Backlash reflected willful ignorance releasing pent up prejudices and disseminating viral-like negative information as weapons of retaliation against brands and marginalized communities. We contribute a conceptual model integrating theoretical frames of social justice, social marketing, brand activism and free speech elucidating the impact of consumer response to social justice branding. The findings and model add a lens to further explore race in the marketplace.

AB  - Objective: To qualitatively assess the influence of patient-provider communication on contraceptive choice among HIV-positive women in the context of universal antiretroviral therapy (ART) access.
   Methods: Focus group discussions (FGD; n = 3), in-depth (IDI; n = 15) and freelist interviews (FLI; n = 36) were conducted with HIV-positive women aged 18-40 years recruited from public health units in Rio de Janeiro/Brazil.
   Results: Of 70 participants, 49 used ART and the median time since HIV diagnosis was 6 years (range: 1-18). The majority of participants (71.4%) reported some degree of dissatisfaction with their health providers (usually lack of open dialogue) and a few reported experiences of stigma/prejudice during appointments. Intra, interpersonal and social factors modulated behaviors and reproductive health decisions, and those issues were rarely addressed by providers during HIV clinical care.
   Conclusion: Despite dramatic increases in survival and life quality after universal ART implementation in Brazil, reproductive health issues are neglected by multiple cadres of HIV health providers. Communication on reproductive health issues remains fragmented and potentially contradictory, compromising care in these settings.
   Practice implications: Adequate provider training to address reproductive health-related issues in a comprehensive, culturally sensitive manner and improved integration of HIV and reproductive health care are urgently needed in this setting. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Diabetes self-management education is a cornerstone of diabetes care. However, many diabetics in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) lack sufficient knowledge about their disease due to illiteracy. Thus, before considering any possible intervention it was imperative to assess present knowledge, attitudes, and practices of patients towards the management of diabetes.
   Methods: A random sample of 575 DM patients was selected from diabetes outpatient's clinics of Tawam and Al-Ain hospitals in Al-Ain city (UAE) during 2006-2007, and their knowledge attitude and practice assessed using a questionnaire modified from the Michigan Diabetes Research Training Center instrument.
   Results: Thirty-one percent of patients had poor knowledge of diabetes. Seventy-two had negative attitudes towards having the disease and 57% had HbA(1c) levels reflecting poor glycemic control. Only seventeen percent reported having adequate blood sugar control, while 10% admitted non-compliance with their medications. Knowledge, practice and attitude scores were all statistically significantly positively, but rather weakly, associated, but none of these scores was significantly correlated with HbA1c.
   Conclusions: The study showed low levels of diabetes awareness but positive attitudes towards the importance of DM care and satisfactory diabetes practices in the UAE. Programs to increase patients' awareness about DM are essential for all diabetics in the UAE in order to improve their understanding, compliance and management and, thereby, their ability to cope with the disease.

AB  - This Article provides a comprehensive analysis of awards of "noneconomic" damages for reputational and emotional harm in intellectual property (IP) law, including trademarks, copyright and moral rights, the right of publicity, and patent law. The Article discusses, among other matters, the Second Circuit's recent decision in Castillo v. G&M Realty L.P., affirming a $6.75 million award of statutory damages for the infringement of artists' moral rights in graffiti art; the European Union's Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive and its 2016 Liffers decision, which appear to require member states to award, where warranted, noneconomic ("moral prejudice") damages across the full range of IP cases; and some recent arguments in favor of awarding damages for emotional harm in, even, patent infringement actions. Prompted by these and other developments, I argue that courts should recognize reputational harm as a potentially cognizable injury throughout all of the branches of IP law but that damages for emotional harm should be limited to right of publicity and moral rights matters. In addition, I discuss the various options for providing monetary relief in response to noneconomic harm, including awards of general damages, statutory damages, disgorgement of the infringer's profits, and enhanced or punitive damages; and I conclude with a set of recommendations for crafting awards in a manner that would both vindicate the relevant, cognizable interests of plaintiffs while reducing the risks of arbitrary, uncertain, and potentially overdeterrent relief.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: What are the views, experiences and healthcare needs of infertile women from a minority ethnic or religious background living in Wales?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: Women from ethnic and religious minority backgrounds consider that their communities have highly pronatalistic attitudes and stigmatize infertility, and express the need for more infertility education (for themselves and their communities), as well as more socio-culturally and interpersonally sensitive fertility care.
   WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN: Some people from minority ethnic or religious groups perceive pressure to conceive from their communities, experience social costs when they are unable to have children and stressful interactions with the fertility healthcare system while attempting to conceive.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This study was based on a one-day drawing workshop to collect visual (artwork produced by participants) and textual (all conversations and discussions during the workshop) data about the participants' views and experiences of infertility and their fertility care needs.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants were nine adult women with a minority ethnic or religious status living in Wales, UK, who were experiencing or had experienced infertility in the past. The workshop comprised five activities: (i) small and large group discussion of infertility-related drawings, (ii) lide-based lecture consisting of an introduction to the basics of drawing objects and people and (iii) thoughts and feelings, (iv) free drawing session and (v) group sharing. Audio recordings of the workshop were transcribed verbatim. Textual data was analysed with thematic analysis. Risk for bias was addressed via individual coding by two authors followed by joint presentation and discussion of results with the research team and participants.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Forty-one themes were identified and grouped into eight distinct higher order themes. These themes described the emotional, relational and social burden of infertility experienced by women, which they perceived to result from their communities' highly pronatalistic attitudes and stigmatization of infertility. Themes also captured women's adaptive coping strategies and critical attitude towards pronatalist ideologies. Lastly, themes captured their overall positive evaluation of their fertility health care, their desire for more infertility education (for themselves and their communities) and for culturally competent and interpersonally sensitive care.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our participants were a small, non-random sample recruited in collaboration with a local charity, which may mean that all participants were well integrated in their communities. Analysis focused on capturing commonalities in participants' experiences and this may sometimes result in homogenising diverse experiences.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: More education about the infertility experiences of minority ethnic and religious groups at the community and healthcare delivery level may translate into lessened negative attitudes towards infertility and more culturally competent care, which can be beneficial for women.

AB  - Aim. This study aimed to assess the construct validity of the Community Attitudes towards the Mentally Ill scale in the investigation of European nurses attitudes towards mental illness and mental health patients. Background. The harbouring of negative attitudes by nurses towards any patient can have implications for recovery. To gather robust evidence upon which to base information and education aimed at fostering acceptance, support and general positivity towards people with mental health illness, a valid and reliable system of data collection is required. Method. A confirmatory factor analysis of both the original Community Attitudes towards the Mentally Ill scale and two modified versions of the scale were carried out during May - June 2007 using a data set representing the responses of 858 European nurses to the scale. Data were subjected to three different confirmatory factor analyses using Maximum Likelihood estimation in the software package, Analysis of Moment Structures 7. A number of absolute, relative and incremental fit statistics were used to assess the fit of the original Community Attitudes towards the Mentally Ill scale and two modified versions to the European nursing data. Findings. A modification of the scale was found to be most suitable for use in the investigation of European nurses attitudes towards mental illness and people with mental illness. Conclusion. Further research is recommended to develop a valid and reliable research tool to specifically measure the attitudes of nurses working across different mental healthcare facilities towards this vulnerable patient group.

AB  - Mass media campaigns are a commonly used approach to reduce sugary drink consumption, which is linked to obesity in children and adolescents. The present study investigated the direct and mediated effects of emotional appeals in public service advertisements (PSAs) that aired between 2010 and 2012 on adolescents' intention to reduce their sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption. An online randomized experiment was conducted with a national sample of adolescent respondents ages 13 to 17 years old (N=805). Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions. Three experimental conditions represented PSAs with different emotional appeals: humor, fear, and nurturance, plus a fourth control condition. The outcome was adolescents' intention to cut back on SSBs. The direct effect of fear appeals on intention was mediated through adolescents' perception of the PSAs' argument strength; perceived argument strength was also the key mediator for the indirect effects of humor and nurturance on intention. Several hypothesized mediators influenced by the appeals were not associated with intention. This is the first study to test the effect of persuasive emotional appeals used in SSB-related PSAs. The perceived strength of the PSAs' arguments is important to consider in the communication of messages designed to reduce SSB consumption.

AB  - Iceland's nationwide privatized Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) system is over thirty years old but remains a topic of public and political debate, particularly because of the continued effects on small-scale fisheries. A national survey of small-boat fishermen was distributed to: (1) identify major defining characteristics of participants in ITQ and non-ITQ fisheries, (2) document and examine differences in satisfaction with fisheries management, and (3) evaluate the existing options for newcomers to participate in small-boat fisheries. Survey results indicate that Icelandic small-boat fishermen are engaged in multiple management systems within a wide range of boat sizes. Those who held quota were more satisfied with the current ITQ system compared to those who did not hold quota; however, nearly all fishermen were still critical of fisheries management in Iceland and the two major non-ITQ options of lumpfish and coastal fishing were not perceived to offer significant opportunity for entry-level fishermen. Dissatisfaction stemmed from the lack of decision-making power, a distrust of scientific advice, and the perception that the ITQ system did not serve the purpose of protecting fisheries resources, but was rather oriented only toward economic goals. The dynamic nature of Icelandic small-boat fishing livelihoods and the pervasive negative attitudes thirty years after ITQ implementation demonstrate the need for culturally appropriate and equitable fisheries management schemes where success is measured in social as well as economic and biological terms.

AB  - This study extends the current body of work on dehumanization by evaluating the social, psychological, and demographic correlates of blatant disregard for immigrants. Participants (n = 468) were randomly assigned to read a scenario where 1) an immigrant or 2) an immigrant and their child were caught illegally crossing the southern border of the United States, and then rated how long they should spend in jail if convicted. Participants reported that they would sentence the immigrant to more jail time than the immigrant and child. Those who sent immigrants to jail for more time also viewed them as socially distant and less human, described immigration in impersonal terms, and endorsed other social harms unrelated to immigration (e.g., the death penalty for convicted murderers). Crucially, endorsed social harms accounted for explained variance beyond simply holding conservative views. We position these data within the current literature on dehumanization theory and immigration issues.

AB  - Objectives More than 60% of people with dementia live at home, where assistance is usually provided by informal caregivers. Research on the experiences of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) caregivers is limited. This scoping review of the literature synthesizes international evidence on support provision for the population of LGBT caregivers. Methods Eight electronic databases and Google Scholar were searched using terms including 'Dementia', 'LGBT' and 'Caregiver' for all types of articles, including empirical studies, grey literature and sources from charity/third sector/lobbying organisations. Article selection was performed by two raters. Data were analysed through deductive thematic analysis, and three themes were established a priori: Distinct experiences of LGBT caregivers; current barriers to support; strategies to overcome the current challenges. Results Twenty articles were included. Distinct experiences of LGBT caregivers included a loss of LGBT identity, the impact of historical events, families of choice, and disclosing LGBT identities. Current barriers to support included poor representation of LGBT caregivers in support services, negative attitudes of staff and reluctance of caregivers to seek support. Strategies to overcome the current challenges included staff awareness training and kite-marking inclusion. Conclusion Limited cultural competency of staff and a subsequent reluctance to seek help have an impact on use of support services among LGBT caregivers. Implications for practice include the development of cost-effective, feasible, and acceptable inclusiveness training for services. Implications for policy include implementation in organisations of top-down agendas supporting staff to understand sexuality and non-heteronormative relationships in older age.

AB  - People (selectors) sometimes make choices both for themselves and for others (recipients). We propose that selectors worry about offending recipients with their choices when recipients are stigmatized group members and options in a choice set differ along a stigma-relevant dimension. Accordingly, selectors are more likely to make the same choices for themselves and stigmatized group member recipients Than non-stigmatized group member recipients. We conducted eight studies to study this hypothesis in different choice contexts (food, music, games, books) and with recipients from different stigmatized groups (the obese, Black-Americans, the elderly, students at lower-status schools). We use three different approaches to show that this effect is driven by people's desire to avoid offending stigmatized group members with their choices. Thus, although prior research shows that people often want to avoid being associated with dissociative groups, such as stigmatized groups, we demonstrate that people make the same choices for self and stigmatized other to minimize offense.

AB  - Background: Any approach promoting a culture of safety and the prevention of health care-associated infections (HCAIs) should involve all stakeholders, including by definition the patients themselves. This qualitative study explored the knowledge and attitudes of health care workers toward the concept of patient empowerment focused on improving infection control practices.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 29 staff from a large hospital in Sydney, Australia.
   Results: There was virtually unanimous agreement among the participants that patients should be thought of as a stakeholder and should have a role in the prevention of HCAI. However, the degree of patient responsibility and level of system engagement varied. Although very few had previously been exposed to the concept of empowerment, they were accepting of the idea and were surprised that hospitals had not yet adopted the concept. However, they felt that a lack of support, busy workloads, and negative attitudes would be key barriers to the implementation of any empowerment programs.
   Conclusion: Although the World Health Organization has recommended that patients have a role in encouraging hand hygiene as a means of preventing infection, patient engagement remains an underused method. By extending the concept of patient empowerment to a range of infection prevention opportunities, the positive impact of this intervention will not only extend to the patient but to the system itself.

AB  - Purpose Fear of cancer recurrence/occurrence (FCR/O) is prevalent and associated with poorer psychological outcomes but can also motivate individuals to pursue genomic information about cancer risk. Guided by Protection Motivation Theory, this study investigated FCR/O prevalence and associated factors among probands previously diagnosed with a cancer of likely heritable origin, and their relatives, who had agreed to have germline genome sequencing. Methods Three hundred and forty-eight probands and 167 relatives completed the Concerns about Recurrence Questionnaire (adapted for occurrence for some relatives) within 1 month of agreeing to undertake genome sequencing. Linear regressions investigated demographic, disease, attitude and behavioral associations with FCR/O. Results Probands demonstrated greater FCR compared to relatives. In probands, greater FCR was associated with being female, non-English speaking at home, less time since diagnosis, greater intention to change behavior if gene variant found, lower perceived ability to cope with results, higher perceived susceptibility to having a recurrence, and more negative attitudes towards uncertainty. For relatives with cancer, greater FCR was associated with being male, greater intention to change behavior if a gene variant found, and higher perceived susceptibility to recurrence. In relatives without cancer, greater FCO was associated with not having had genetic testing prior to this study, lower perceived ability to cope with results, and higher perceived susceptibility to developing cancer. Conclusion Current findings on FCR/O prevalence and associated demographic and attitudinal variables in those who pursue genomic risk information might be used to target interventions that can prevent adverse psychological outcomes in vulnerable patients.

AB  - Background: Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is a cultural practice that includes procedures that intentionally alter or cause harm to female genital organs for nonmedical reasons, affecting similar to 200 million women and girls globally. Health care providers in the United States often lack confidence to provide appropriate FGM/C-related care, and experience attitudes that may negatively impact quality of care for FGM/C. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of health care providers to explore the associations between health care provider characteristics, awareness of health complications of FGM/C, attitudes, and confidence for FGM/C care. Results: Factors associated with more Confidence for Clinical FGM/C Care include awareness of health complications, ever cared for a woman with FGM/C, being a woman or person of color, and more than 5 years of clinical practice. Increased Confidence in Communication Skills for FGM/C Care was associated with awareness of more health complications for FGM/C. Women endorsed significantly less Negative Attitudes toward FGM/C compared with men; no other factors were associated with health care provider attitudes. Conclusion: Future research should further investigate factors associated with health care provider attitudes toward FGM/C and those affected by the practice to promote quality care. Health providers require adequate training for clinical FGM/C care and in the communication skills that promote patient/provider communication cross-culturally.

AB  - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have suffered violence and extreme prejudice in every walk of life as a result of the European colonisation of Australia. We acknowledge the ongoing colonial legacy to this suffering and discuss how cultural safety is a solution to overcoming some elements of the disadvantages that still beset Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in terms of accessing health care. Accessible and culturally safe health services are critical in reducing health inequalities for First Nations' people because of the burden of ill-health they experience. 'Cultural safety' in this context refers to approaches that strengthen and respectfully engage with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures in mainstream services. Alongside holistic Indigenous health and primary prevention approaches, a broad range of medical, socio-cultural and allied health support is needed to alleviate these inequalities. In this article, we describe how the working relationship between Aboriginal Hospital Liaison Officers and Social Workers in public hospitals in Victoria, Australia, contributes to cultural safety, and thereby improves the quality of care and a reduction in discharges against medical advice by Aboriginal patients. We conclude that elements of this model may be applicable to improving care for First Nation peoples in other countries.

AB  - The uptake of mobile media with internet connection has increased rapidly in almost every part of the world, and this has significantly changed how public transport passengers use their travel time. Studies have documented that use of mobile information and communication technologies (ICT) while traveling has the potential to enrich use of travel time and in some cases, strengthen positive attitudes towards public transport. The alternative hypothesisthat mobile communication technologies make travelers more critical and demanding, e.g., due to the risk of interferencehas so far hardly been explored through empirical studies. Based on a web-based survey of travelers in two of the largest cities in Norway (Oslo and Trondheim), this paper investigates how use of smart devices are related to general attitudes toward public transportation services. A segmentation of travelers in three clusters based on their mobile use habits, shows that the most active group of mobile media usersa group of younger and middle-aged urban dwellerswere those who bore the most critical attitudes to the public transport services. In contrast, the groups that used their mobile phones rarely, or less actively, on their public transport trips were more satisfied. The findings suggests that a new generation of equipped travelers has developed expectations regarding their public transport journeys that service providers might have problems to fulfill in current times. Thus, there is a risk of the most active smartphone users developing negative attitudes to public transport if (or when) their experiences are not improved.

AB  - The context of healthcare and of healthcare education has radically changed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. To identify positive strategies for midwifery education in this context, five case studies from the UK and beyond were conducted using an appreciative enquiry approach, from the perspectives of students, the maternity services, cross-university collaboration, and digital learning. A health system analysis was used to identify strategies to cope, adapt, and transform for the future, at the levels of individuals, teams, and the whole system.
   Findings showed that the implementation of effective responses was possible. Responding effectively and rapidly to a shock as profound as this pandemic requires courageous, respectful, evidence-based, innovative, collaborative, cross-sectoral working and leadership across education institutions, practice settings, the regulator, government, and with students themselves. Pre-existing trusting relationships and collaborative systems supported rapid responses. Effective digital learning requires a pro-active, student-centred approach, and addressing the problems of inequitable access to equipment and space. Joint problem-solving and focussing on the key outcomes that mat ter contribute to developing successful strategies and robust processes. The pandemic provides an opportunity for student midwives to be re-imagined as essential members of midwifery teams and not 'just students'. Transformative actions identified include whole-system working, tackling longstanding problems including racism, poverty, prejudice, and systemic discrimination, and keeping students at the heart of the education system.

AB  - Research suggests that there is a high prevalence of interpersonal violence and victimisation within the autistic population, and that this accounts for poor mental health outcomes. This study aimed to examine the impact of interpersonal violence and victimisation on autistic adults from their own perspective and explore what helps or hinders their recovery. In total, 102 autistic adults completed either an online survey or a spoken interview about their experiences of interpersonal violence and victimisation. We analysed the data using a thematic analysis, and found four themes: (1) The usual for autism (expectations of victimisation, experiences of othering), (2) Personhood revoked: The cost of living (being part of a neurominority, trauma, masking and burnout), (3) Unpacking the baggage (impact of hermeneutical injustice) and (4) 'If you want to make an apple pie from scratch, you have to invent the universe first' (structural inequality/power dynamics, support and community). Findings highlight the importance of considering the relationship between stigma and victimisation, and the relationship between trauma, masking, and burnout in autistic people. Reducing barriers to support and recovery are contingent on reducing structural inequality and providing better training about autistic people to frontline professionals. Lay abstract Research suggests that autistic people are more likely to be hurt by someone they know (e.g. a friend or a family member) compared to non-autistic people. In this study, we wanted to know how being hurt by someone you know affects autistic people, and what might help them recover. In total, 102 autistic people took part in an interview, where we asked questions like how being hurt by people they know had made them feel and whether anyone they had asked for help had done a good job of supporting them. We analysed what they had said using thematic analysis, which involved reading what everyone said and looking for common themes. Our findings showed that a lot of autistic people think it is normal to be hurt by people you know because it has happened to them so much. This makes many autistic people feel like they need to mask parts of themselves to stay safe, but this also makes them really exhausted. It took some people a long time to realise what had happened to them was wrong, and it was hard to ask for help. People who did ask for help often had bad experiences with professionals (e.g. police) who did not know much about autistic people. They said better support would come from creating more autistic-run support groups and educating people about autism. These findings are important for working out how to help people who have been hurt by people they know.

AB  - Aim. This paper is a report of a study measuring attitudes of primary care nurses towards caring for people with hepatitis C.
   Background. Hepatitis C is a major public health problem. Attitudes to caring for people with hepatitis C vary and can have an impact on nursing care practices. International literature has identified discriminating practices amongst healthcare professionals including nurses. There is limited research examining primary care nurses' attitudes to caring for people with hepatitis C.
   Methods. A cross-sectional postal census survey of 981 nurses working in one health board region in the Republic of Ireland was conducted during the period March 2006 to June 2006.
   Results. A response rate of 57.1% (n = 560) was achieved. Exploratory factor analysis of an attitude scale identified three latent variables: 'infection control behaviour', 'caring' and 'fear'. Attitudes were generally positive towards caring for persons with hepatitis C; however, 51.7% of respondents would use additional infection control precautions if caring for someone with known hepatitis C. Younger nurses and those educated to degree level and above held significantly more positive attitudes to caring. Nurses agreed that they have a central role in managing and treating people with hepatitis C; however, many agreed that they lack the knowledge and skills to care for persons with hepatitis C.
   Conclusions. Negative attitudes can result in discriminatory experiences for persons with hepatitis C or at risk. Nurses require ongoing education on hepatitis C to improve knowledge, to limit concerns and ensure adherence to infection control guidelines.

AB  - Background: Attitudes and knowledge about suicide may influence psychiatrists' management of suicidal patients but there has been little research about this issue in China.
   Methods: We used the Scale of Public Attitudes about Suicide (SPAS) - a 47-item scale developed and validated in China - to assess knowledge about suicide and seven specific attitudes about suicide in a sample of 187 psychiatrists from six psychiatric hospitals in Shanghai. The results were compared to those of 548 urban community members (assessed in a previous study).
   Results: Compared to urban community members, psychiatrists were more likely to believe that suicide can be prevented and that suicide is an important social problem but they had more stigmatizing beliefs about suicidal individuals and felt less empathy for them. The belief that suicide can be prevented was more common among female psychiatrists than male psychiatrists but male psychiatrists felt more empathy for suicidal individuals. Only 37% of the psychiatrists correctly agreed that talking about suicide-related issues with an individual would not precipitate suicidal behavior and only 41% correctly agreed that those who state that they intend to kill themselves may actually do so.
   Conclusions: Many psychiatrists in Shanghai harbor negative attitudes about suicidal individuals and are concerned that directly addressing the issue with patients will increase the risk of suicide. Demographic factors, educational status and work experience are associated with psychiatrists' attitudes about suicide and, thus, need to be considered when training psychiatrists about suicide prevention.

AB  - Background Every person has a persona (or mask) which is the facade that every person shows to the world. Thus, males use facade to reveal or conceal their true feelings and emotions. Also, the male uses mental health facade to protect themselves from prejudice and judgment. Thus, the study aimed to explore the experiences of male Saudi nursing students of mental health. Method Husserl's descriptive phenomenology was used as a guiding lens to explore. Eleven participants were involved in the study by using the referral sampling technique. An unstructured interview was performed to gather information from the participants. The seven steps of the descriptive Colaizzi process were followed to investigate and examine the obtained data. The credibility, dependability, confirmability, transferability, and reflexivity criteria were observed to ensure the rigor of the study. Results The findings have two major themes. The first theme is the unadulterated smile that describes optimism in the family and mutual guarantee. The second theme is the orchestrated smile, which describes avoiding diverting burdens, social responsibility, protection of self, and reputation. Conclusions The findings document that the mental health facade of male Saudi nursing students is associated with the expectation of family optimism, mutual guarantee, the expectation of society, and self-protection.

AB  - In this descriptive study, we aim to show the potential gender differences in academic success, focusing on the top (i.e., most frequently cited) scientists by analyzing the work of more than 94,000 scientists in 21 fields across 43 countries. Our results indicate that female representation in the top tier of scientists strongly varies between countries (11.83%; s.d. = 0.046), with the highest proportion of top women scientists in Finland (20.45%) and the lowest in Saudi Arabia (2.08%). Compared with the total share of females in science, women are underrepresented among the top (i.e., most frequently cited) scholars by 28.52 percentage points. The proportions differ by disciplines, with top women authors best represented in Public Health and Services (36.1%), Communication and Textual Studies (33.7%), Psychology and Cognitive Science (27.5%), and Social Sciences (23%); while the lowest share of women scientists are found in Mathematics and Statistics (6.3%), Engineering (7.2%), and Physics and Astronomy (7.7%). However, despite the low female representation, top women scholars in those three fields conduct (on average) more impactful research than their male colleagues, which is contrary to most other research fields. We also show that female scientific success is positively correlated with a nation's higher gender equity indicators, lower discriminatory values, and less negative attitudes and preferences towards women. Overall, our findings suggest that scientific fields are still struggling with gender inequality that pervades public life.

AB  - Aims: Given the importance of addressing provider attitudes toward individuals with unhealthy alcohol use and the current emphasis on person-centered language to help decrease stigma and mitigate negative attitudes, the aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of a contemporary version of the Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Perception Questionnaire (AAPPQ) that uses person-centered language and addresses the spectrum of alcohol use.
   Methods: The authors created a person-centered version of the AAPPQ (PC-AAPPQ) and conducted a cross-sectional study of its psychometric properties in academic settings in the Northeastern United States. The PC-AAPPQ was administered to 651 nursing students. Reliability analysis of the new instrument was performed using the total sample. Only surveys with complete data (n = 637) were randomly split into two datasets, one used for the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) (n = 310) and the other for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) (n = 327).
   Results: Compared to all the models generated from the EFA, neither the original six-factor structure nor the five-factor structure was superior to any of the other models. The results indicate that a seven-factor structure with all 30 items is the best fit for the PC-AAPPQ.
   Conclusions: The PC-AAPPQ represents a positive effort to modernize the four-decade-old AAPPQ. This 30-item instrument, which adds one additional subscale, offers a means to assess providers' attitudes using respectful wording that avoids perpetuating negative biases and reinforces efforts to affirm the worth and dignity of the population being treated.

AB  - In the scenario of big data, incorporating multiple attribute descriptions of the same subject (i.e., so-called multi-view data analysis) and the developing effective data visualization techniques have been one of the most important topics in the computer vision and machine learning community. In this paper, a multiple view source attributes embedding framework is proposed that can assemble various object attributes together and embed them into a low dimensional space to realize visual data structure demonstration. Classical sole attribute data embedding approaches such as MDS and SHE can be utilized under this framework. The core idea of this framework is to achieve a uniform contribution merging, which means every source attribute will contribute equally to the final embedded output. The underlying reason for this idea is that now that an attribute is input as a source and no prior weight is given beforehand, it should be treated equally. The most exciting advantage of this strategy is that it can avoid prejudice caused by major attributes (exerting due to their evident quantity advantage), which may lead the minor attributes be ignored. In addition, we propose a simple iterating algorithm to implement this framework, and plenty of experiments are conducted under diverse source attribute configurations to validate its effectiveness.

AB  - Falls represent a major cause of burden and death in older adults. The MACVIA-LR (fighting chronic diseases for active and healthy ageing in Languedoc-Roussillon) falls initiative is a cross-cutting Living Lab based on the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing (EIP on AMA) at the regional level. It covers all action plans (A1, A2, A3, B3, C2 and D4) of the EIP on AHA. The Living Lab will: (i) raise awareness, (ii) drive attitude change with respect to falls and falls prevention and (iii) improve access to information on falls prevention. It aims to reduce fall-related hospitalisations by 30% in 2020 in the region Languedoc-Roussillon (LR). It includes: (i) a falls prevention clinic for the assessment of subjects (with a falls risk) in the two teaching hospitals of Montpellier and Mimes, (ii) the Regional Ageing Institute (CARSAT-LR), (iii) the Low Vision Institute of Nimes, (iv) the Lattes Social Welfare Centre, (v) the home automation Institut mediterraneen des metiers de longevite, (vi) teaching, training and coaching as well as (vii) industrial partnership. Two care pathways have been developed (stroke and falls) and are being applied to remote rural areas of the region. The MACVIA-falls prevention initiative is an output of the EIP on AHA.

AB  - The objective of this chapter is to present an overview of how menstruation, a normal bodily function, was and is perceived in various ethnic groups and cultures in the world, from ancient mythology, historical, or traditional practices to contemporary belief systems. Mythical tales about menstruation abound in the legends and prehistory of ancient cultures. These tales characterize menstrual blood variously as sacred, a gift from the gods, or a punishment for sin, but it is almost always magical and powerful. In contrast, most world religions view menstruation, with varying degrees of severity, as a major problem, a sign of impurity and uncleanliness, and therefore, menstruating women are isolated, prohibited from polluting the holy places, and shunned. Many of these myths and cultural misperceptions persist to the present day, reflected in a wide range of negative attitudes toward menstruation, which can have serious and direct implications for reproductive health. In view of the increasingly globalized nature of current clinical practice, it is crucial that health care providers are familiar with existing cultural and social views and attitudes toward the menstrual function. The ultimate goal is to be able to provide women culturally sensitive and medically appropriate therapies for their menstrual disorders. This biocultural approach to menstruation management is desirable in contemporary medical practice. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The study examined the preconditions for multiculturalism in the New Zealand context as enumerated by Berry, Kahn, and Taylor (1977) and Berry and Kalin (1995). Using data from a New Zealand national probability sample (n = 5862), we assessed ethnic group differences in: ethnic equality positioning as an indicator of support for diversity; race-based rejection as a measure of prejudice and intolerance; affective ratings of warmth as an indicator of positive ethnic attitudes; patriotism as an indicator of attachment to New Zealand society; and perceptions of realistic threat and expectations of economic security as indicators of a confident identity. Consistent with the preconditions for achieving a multicultural society, expectations of race-based rejection were uncommon, intergroup feelings were generally warm, perceived threat was moderately low, expectations for future security were moderate and fairly comparable across groups, and all groups expressed high levels of patriotism. However, New Zealanders resisted a resource-specific multicultural ideology that involves race-based interventions to reduce social inequality. There was also evidence that the level of warmth towards Asian New Zealanders, the most recent and rapidly growing immigrant group, was lower than that towards other ethnic groups. The findings are discussed in relation to socio-political issues, including tensions between biculturalism and multiculturalism, and the obstacles to reducing social inequality across ethnic groups.

AB  - Clarification of the concept self-harm is needed in order to enable research and theory development and facilitate the development and evaluation of medical interventions and nursing care for individuals who self-harm. This study presents such a conceptual analysis. Articles from 1997 to 2007 were sought from the Medline, PubMed, Cinahl, and PsychINFO search engines by entering the search words 'self-harm', 'self-harming', and 'psychiatric care'. 25 medicine and 23 nursing science articles were chosen for inclusion and analysed. Rodgers' evolutionary concept analysis process was used to delineate and clarify the concept's context, surrogate terms, antecedents, attributes, and consequences, as well as to determine implications for further research. Attributes of self-harm may include repetitive injury of mouth or exterior body, that is to say the infliction of physical pain to alleviate mental pain, and time spent self-harming. Antecedents may be gender, mental pain, substance abuse and relational problems. Consequences often include the need for medication and help with altering coping behaviour. Some self-harm patients met with negative attitudes from nurses. Individualized care and treatment is recommended. Accordingly, inter-professional collaboration and postgraduate education is needed in order to provide better care and treatment for self-harm patients. Furthermore, better understanding is needed to help enable health care personnel understand why individuals self-harm. The conceptual analysis presented in this study may be helpful as regards theory development within this still rather unexplored field.

AB  - Purpose
   The #MeToo movement against sexual harassment (SH) has sparked a sense of familiarity, and collective anger among women, highlighting it as a pervasive and common experience across the globe. The purpose of this paper is to argue that despite shared experiences and such transnational movements, the ways in which SH is actually understood and combated are likely to be different in disparate National Business Systems (NBS). Through the analysis, the authors unpack these differences by paying specific attention to the multilevel power dynamics shaping how employers and their key stakeholders understand and respond to SH in Lebanon.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Against the backdrop of the complex and inefficient Lebanese NBS, the authors adopt a cross-cultural feminist analytic framework and engage in an iterative qualitative analysis of over 208 pages of transcriptions from relevant multisector, multi-stakeholder interactive sessions. Based on the analysis, the authors propose a series of first- and second-order concepts and themes that help us to trace how power shapes local SH understandings and related efforts.
   Findings
   The findings highlight the simultaneous influence of power through geopolitical forces external to Lebanon (i.e. power over through North-centricism and othering; power to through comparative perspectives and SDG regulations), combined with local forces embedded within the specific NBS (i.e. power over through negative attitudes and NBS specificities; power to through positive business efforts and local multistakeholder mobilizing).
   Originality/value
   The findings demonstrate the importance of paying attention to the interaction between power, contextual embeddedness and geopolitical considerations in attempts to advance SH theorization.

TI  - BACK TO THE FUTURE: PERMITTING HABEAS PETITIONS BASED ON INTERVENING RETROACTIVE CASE LAW TO ALTER CONVICTIONS AND SENTENCES
T2  - FORDHAM LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - CORPUS
AB  - In 1948, Congress enacted 28 U.S.C. 2255, which authorizes a motion for federal prisoners to "vacate, set aside or correct" their sentences, with the goal of improving judicial efficiency in collateral review. Section 2255(e), known as the "savings clause," allows federal inmates to challenge the validity of their imprisonments with writs of habeas corpus if 2255 motions are "inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [their] detention[s]." Due to the U.S. Supreme Court's and Congress's silence regarding what suffices as "inadequate or ineffective," the circuit courts have adopted varied standards.
   The Sixth and Seventh Circuits hold that prisoners can use the savings clause to challenge their convictions or sentences based on new retroactive case law. On the other hand, the Tenth and Eleventh Circuits prejudice prisoners by prohibiting them from challenging their convictions or sentences based on new case law. Recently, the Fourth Circuit expanded the circuit split by agreeing with the Sixth and Seventh Circuits in United States v. Wheeler. A petition for a writ of certiorari in Wheeler is currently pending before the Supreme Court. This Note examines the circuits' different standards and contends that the circuits that foreclose savings clause challenges impermissibly curtail prisoners' rights. Further, this Note argues that the Supreme Court must define the scope of the savings clause to permit prisoners to challenge their convictions and sentences under the provision.

KW  - STIGMA
AB  - Background Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) endure healthcare biases that are partially due to a lack of disease-specific education among healthcare providers. Furthermore, there is a paucity of age-appropriate health education materials for patients with SCD. To address this gap, we created the GRAPES tool (Game to Raise Awareness for Patient/Provider/Public Education of SCD; ) and hypothesized that utilization of the GRAPES tool will improve patient and provider SCD knowledge and mitigate healthcare bias. Procedure The GRAPES tool is an online, single-player trivia game. A feasibility study was conducted in pediatric patients with SCD at age 10 years or older and registered nurses. All participants were assessed for change in SCD-relevant knowledge and satisfaction post-gameplay. Providers were assessed for change in attitudes toward patients with SCD post-gameplay. Results Twenty-five patients and 25 providers were enrolled. All participants (P < 0.001), and specifically within the patient (P = 0.019) and provider (P < 0.001) cohorts, showed increased SCD knowledge post-gameplay. Both patients and providers reported high satisfaction with GRAPES. Provider negative attitudes were reduced (P = 0.007) post-gameplay without change in positive attitudes (P = 0.959). Providers demonstrated post-gameplay reduced (P = 0.001) belief that patients' changing behavior around providers indicates inappropriate drug-seeking behavior. Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of the GRAPES tool as a potential digital, behavioral intervention to provide educational materials for patients and their providers in different clinical settings, improve knowledge about SCD, and decrease stigma against patients with SCD in the healthcare setting.

AB  - The U.S. Supreme Court decisions in U.S. v. Windsor (570 U.S. 307) and Hollingsworth v. Perry (570 U.S. 399) created a focal point for public discussion of marriage equality for same-sex couples. This article reports the results of an exploratory study of the reactions of individuals currently or previously in same-sex couple relationships and a heterosexual sibling who is currently or previously married (N = 371) to the Supreme Court decisions. Thematic content analysis was used to explore participants' responses to an open-ended question on a survey. Reactions of individuals from same-sex couples revealed the following themes: (1) longitudinal perspectives on the advancement of rights for same-sex couples; (2) emotional responses celebrating the decisions or expressing relief; (3) affirmation of their relationship or rights; (4) practical consequences of the extension of rights; and (5) minority stress related to anticipation of future prejudice or discrimination. Themes in the heterosexual siblings' responses were (1) ally support; (2) flat support without emotion or elaboration; (3) indifference to or ignorance about the decisions; and (4) disapproval of the decisions. These themes are compared and discussed in light of prior research on reactions to marriage restriction debates and marriage (in)equality and family relationships.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Arts activities can improve social connectedness and foster reciprocity between people living with dementia and their caregivers. The extent to which the arts can help shape attitudes towards dementia remains unclear. This paper explores the impact of a 12-week visual arts program "Dementia and Imagination" on the attitudes of family and professional caregivers through a mixed-methods longitudinal investigation, underpinned by a conceptual framework of the arts in dementia care.
   Research Design and Methods: One hundred and forty-six family and professional caregivers were recruited across three settings in England and Wales (residential care homes, a county hospital, and community venues). Quantitative and qualitative data on caregivers' attitudes and perceptions of the impact of the arts program were collected through interviews at three time points.
   Results: Thematic analysis identified four themes shared across the caregivers: (1) Recognizing capabilities, (2) Social connectedness, (3) Improvements to well-being, and (4) Equality and personhood. Two further themes were distinct to family caregivers: (5) Duration of the effects of the art program, and (6) Enriched perspective. The final theme Inspiring professional development was distinct to the professional caregivers. The quantitative analysis found no effect for caregivers' attitude change over time. Family caregivers scored significantly lower than professional caregivers at each of the three time points.
   Discussion and Implications: Art programs have the potential to make visible the capabilities of the people living with dementia, enabling caregivers to see the person behind the condition. This study highlights practice implications for future implementation, such as the role of the arts in dementia care education.

AB  - Emotion's twin roles-'unite and divide' our daily life, thus motivating the good and the worst in human behaviour. The way one "feels" does influence the way one "acts" toward others. If this reasoning is correct, then behaviour can never be without motive or "motiveless." Given the importance of emotions in human communication and decision making, the context of intergroup relations, with its themes of prejudice, stereotyping and discrimination against culturally dissimilar was touched on selectively. Using the Differential Emotions Scale and building upon Boyle's (Personality 56:747-750, 1984) work, with students, the present study reports a repeated-measure multiple discriminant function analysis for items across raters. The findings further indicate that most of the DES items are sensitive indicators. The correspondence of some of the results with prior research findings makes facial emotions less the holy grail of the social behaviour field. Likely consequences of emotions are considered, and research needs are discussed vis-a-vis uplifting individual happiness, collective identity and sense of connection to others. Perhaps its implications can be extended to the literature, thus revealing how the different lenses through which human emotions are usually viewed are connected by the incipient/concept attitude and self-identification/labelling that run through each of them.

AB  - Low vegetation cover in cities result in urbanites generally receiving less exposure to nature compared to people living in rural areas. Consequently, childhood experiences in a city tend to be less nature-oriented, leading to a detachment from nature in adulthood. However, some cities may have pockets of green spaces that harbour wildlife, and interactions between people and the wildlife around them may have an influence on wildlife conservation attitudes. To investigate the relationships between childhood nature experience and attitudes towards wildlife, we carried out a survey on 1004 Singapore residents about their attitudes and tolerance towards three types of wildlife commonly encountered in Singapore. Structured equation models (SEMs) were used to model the relationship between childhood experience, attitudes towards wildlife, and tolerance levels in three scenarios of increasing damage severity to humans. We found that most respondents had low childhood nature experience, and had neutral/negative attitudes towards all three types of wildlife. Childhood experience was the strongest predictor of wildlife attitude, which varied with age, gender, education level and type of wildlife. Attitude towards wildlife was the strongest predictor of tolerance in all scenarios, while tolerance decreased with increasing severity of damage. Our findings point to the importance of childhood nature experience in shaping adult perceptions of wildlife and their willingness to coexist with wildlife. Given that Singapore is continually developing on forested land for residential and commercial purposes, wildlife encounters are predicted to increase in the future. With proper planning and education, residents near wildlife habitats can learn to live with and appreciate the wildlife around them.

AB  - Background: Interactive voice response (IVR) systems use computer-based voice recognition and software algorithms to conduct human/computer interactions. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of IVR applications in business and healthcare. The available evidence suggests that older people have negative attitudes towards IVR and experience significant difficulties using these systems. Objective: The goal of this project was to identify areas of difficulties in IVR use by older people and propose strategies for improvement. Materials and Methods: During two focus groups, we examined older people's perceptions of IVR systems and the most common difficulties experienced by seniors in interacting with these systems. We also recorded their suggestions for improvement of IVR. Results: Frequency and chi square analyses were performed on the focus groups data. Some of the difficulties reported by participants in this study were congruent with previous findings, but we also uncovered some additional problems, such as frustration for not being able to reach an operator, being asked to wait too long on hold, being unable to recover from mistakes, and an absence of shortcuts in the systems. In addition, significant number of participants indicated that they prefer a system that adjusts to them automatically as opposed to a system that allows for adjustment. Conclusion: Generally, our findings suggest that the poor acceptability of IVR systems by older people could be improved by designing IVR algorithms that detect difficulties during an ongoing IVR exchange and direct people to different algorithms adapted for each person.

AB  - Purpose Drawing on the dual process model of ideology and prejudice, the purpose of this paper is to examine whether, how and when a supervisor's Machiavellianism leads to subordinates' perceptions of abusive supervision. In doing so, the authors also explore the mediating role of the supervisor's competitive world views and the moderating role of subordinates' performance on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach The theoretical model was tested using three sources of data from supervisors, their subordinates and the organization. Hierarchical linear model analysis was run on supervisor and subordinate dyadic data for testing whether subordinates' performance moderated the mediated relationships or not. Findings The results suggest that the supervisors' competitive worldviews explain the positive link between their Machiavellianism and subordinates' perceptions of abusive supervision. The results highlight that the mediation effect of supervisors' competitive worldviews on the link between their Machiavellianism and their subordinates' perceptions of abusive supervision is more pronounced when subordinates' performance is low than when it is high. Research limitations/implications This research contributes to the authors' knowledge of the link between supervisors' Machiavellianism and abusive supervision, and how the toxic influence of their Machiavellianism is mediated by supervisors' competitive worldviews. Originality/value The study contributes to the literature on abusive supervision and personality by studying the role of personality as an antecedent of abusive supervision. Further, this study used subordinates' performance as a contextual variable for understanding abusive supervision.

AB  - Background Negative attitudes toward persons who use alcohol and other drugs contribute to suboptimal care. Nurses are in key roles to address the needs of this population, yet they lack the education needed to identify persons who may be at risk because of substance use and intervene accordingly. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a substance-use-related curriculum on nursing students' attitudes and therapeutic commitment for working with patients with alcohol- and drug-use-related problems. Methods Data were collected for four cohorts of 169 nursing students enrolled in a Master's Entry into Nursing program. Questionnaires included the Person-Centered Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Perception Questionnaire and the Drug and Drug Problems Perception Questionnaire, completed before and after completing the curriculum. Paired samples t test were used to examine pre/post differences for each measure's subscale. Results Four of the seven Person-Centered Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Perception Questionnaire subscales showing significant increases were role adequacy, role support, role legitimacy, and general perceptions. Four of the five Drug and Drug Problems Perception Questionnaire subscales showing significant increases were role adequacy, role support, job satisfaction, and role legitimacy; there was a significant change in role-related self-esteem, however, in a negative direction. Conclusions This study adds to the growing evidence of the positive impact of providing evidence-based information and skill development, which enhance alcohol- and drug-related knowledge and competence for nurses entering professional practice.

AB  - Depersonalization (DP) is a dissociative phenomenon, characterized by feeling "unreal" or detached from one's own emotions, thoughts, and behavior (APA, 2013). It is considered to be a defense mechanism, employed in response to overwhelming events, whereby thoughts and emotions are suppressed in order to enhance the individual's capacity to function in traumatic environments. DP has been found to co-occur with anxiety and depressive disorders, and childhood emotional maltreatment (EM) has been identified as an important predisposing factor. The study's primary aim was to investigate the mediating role of DP in the relationship between childhood EM and psychological distress in young adults. Additionally, it aimed to confirm that a history of childhood EM (emotional abuse and emotional neglect) predicted current levels of DP and to explore how both a person's attitude towards experiencing and expressing emotions (with an emphasis on the affect phobia model) and their current attachment security are related to current DP. A cross-sectional design was employed, which included young adults (N = 761) aged between 18 and 25 years. Participants completed an online survey that comprised of several self-report measures. Regression and mediation analyses were conducted. The results indicated that: (1) DP significantly mediated the relationship between childhood EM and current psychological distress; (2) that a history of EM, but no other forms of childhood abuse, significantly predicted current DP experiences; and (3) EM, attachment-related anxiety, and negative attitudes toward emotions predicted clinical cutoff levels of DP. The results are discussed in detail, including clinical implications and direction for future research.

TI  - THE MOCK HEROIC, AN INTRUDER IN ARCADIA: GIROLAMO GIGLI, ANTONIO CALDARA AND L'ANAGILDA (ROME, 1711)
T2  - EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY MUSIC
LA  - English
AB  - In 1711 the opera L'Anagilda was performed ill the private theatre of Francesco Maria Ruspoli, (ill important Roman patron of the Arcadian Academy,. L'Anagilda's librettist (Girolamo Gigli) and composer (Antonio Caldara) were both associated with this society, but the opera contrasts with the basic goal of Arcadian aesthetics - namely, to reform literature an opera by imitating the structure of ancient Greek tragedy and the stylistic purity of Italian renaissance poets. Rather, Gigli and Caldara created an opera infused with comedy, interspersed with fantastic intermezzos and formulated according to a genre not endorsed by Arcadian literary critics, flit, mock heroic. This article explores topics related 10 one central question: why would Gigli and Caldara openly flout the literary precepts of Arcadia? Gigli was a career satirist whose works eventually caused him to be exiled from,0111 his native Siena, all of Tuscany and the Papal States, and to be expelled from three major literary academies, ill(, Intronati, the Cruscanti and the Arcadians. Since lie continually criticized file organizations to which he, belonged for their narrow-mindedness, prejudice mid hypocrisy, I contend that L'Anagilda represents (I critique of Arcadia. Yet ill the process, Gigli also shows the Arcadians that there is more than one path to verisimilitude and the imitation of classical models. Despite the mock-heroic characteristics of the libretto, Gigli adheres to scale Aracadian structural requirements, and Caldara's score heightens the characterizations and the overall verisimilitude of the Opera.

AB  - Objective: To analyze factors that lead nurses and doulas to have positive views of each other.
   Design: A multivariate analysis of a cross-sectional survey, the Maternity Support Survey.
   Setting: Online survey with labor and delivery nurses, doulas, and childbirth educators in the United States and Canada.
   Participants: A convenience sample of 704 labor and delivery nurses and 1,470 doulas.
   Methods: Multiple regression analysis was used to examine five sets of hypotheses about nurses' and doulas' attitudes toward each other. Scales of nurses' attitudes toward doulas and doulas' attitudes toward nurses included beliefs that nurses/doulas enhance communication, are collaborative team members, enhance a woman's birth experience, interfere with the ability to provide care, or interfere with relationships with the women for whom they care.
   Results: For nurses, exposure to doulas in their primary hospitals was associated with more positive views, whereas working more hours, feeling overworked, and a preference for clinical tasks over labor support were associated with more negative views of doulas. For doulas, working primarily in one hospital and certification were associated with more positive views of nurses. Nurses with more positive attitudes toward common obstetric practices had more negative attitudes toward doulas, whereas doulas with more positive attitudes toward common obstetric practices had more positive attitudes toward nurses.
   Conclusion: Our findings show factors that influence mutual understanding and appreciation of nurses and doulas for each other. These factors can be influenced by educational efforts to improve interprofessional collaboration between these maternity care support roles.

AB  - This study uses an event-based approach to examine individual, relationship, and contextual correlates of heterosexual condom use among homeless men. Structured interviews were conducted with a predominantly African American sample of 305 men recruited from meal lines in the Skid Row area of Los Angeles. Men reported on their most recent heterosexual event involving vaginal or anal intercourse. Adjusting for demographic characteristics only, condom use was more likely when men had higher condom use self-efficacy, greater HIV knowledge, or talked to their partner about condoms prior to sex. Condom use was less likely when men held more negative attitudes towards condoms, the partner was considered to be a primary/serious partner, hard drug use preceded sex, or sex occurred in a public setting. Condom attitudes, self-efficacy, partner type, and communication were the strongest predictors of condom use in a multivariate model that included all of the above-mentioned factors. Associations of unprotected sex with hard drug use prior to sex and having sex in public settings could be accounted for by lower condom self-efficacy and/or less positive condom attitudes among men having sex under these conditions. Results suggest that it may be promising to adapt existing, evidence-based IMB interventions for delivery in non-traditional settings that are frequented by men experiencing homelessness to achieve HIV risk reduction and thus reduce a significant point of disparity for the largely African American population of homeless men.

AB  - It is difficult to rapidly and accurately achieve alignment under complicated interferential environmental conditions with a marine strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) subject to angular swaying interference and linear motion interference. To solve this problem, an SINS self-alignment algorithm in a complex interference environment is presented in this article. For the angular motion disturbance problem, we used the attitude-updating algorithm in the coagulation inertial coordinate system to reflect the carrier's attitude change in real time under the swaying interference so as to eliminate the influence of angular motion disturbance. To solve the problem of linear motion interference, we first use Fourier transform analysis (FFT) to analyze the frequency characteristics of linear motion interference signals. We then adaptively decompose the original signal into a series of signal components with different time scales and local characteristics according to the amplitude and frequency using the modified ensemble empirical mode decomposition (MEEMD) algorithm. Finally, we remove and reconstruct the disturbing signal components according to the frequency characteristics of the disturbing signal to filter the line motion disturbing signal. We use the MEEMD algorithm to conduct a ship alignment test. After pre-filtering by MEEMD, high accuracy can be achieved after 100 s of alignment, and the mean square error of the heading angle is 2.85'. The test results show that the MEEMD method has a good noise removal effect. The anti-jamming initial alignment algorithm based on the MEEMD algorithm has the ability to suppress the interference of angular motion and linear motion and achieve high-precision anti-jamming initial alignment under the complicated interferential environmental conditions with angular swaying interference and linear motion interference.

AB  - Aims: To determine 'hypothetical willingness' to initiate insulin, and identify associated factors, among adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in primary care for whom insulin is clinically indicated.
   Methods: Eligible participants were adults with T2DM with an HbA1c >= 7.5% (58 mmol/mol) and prescribed maximum oral hypoglycaemic agents. A total of 261 participants were recruited from 74 Victorian general practices: mean age 62 +/- 10 years; 39% (n = 103) women; diabetes duration 10 +/- 6 years; HbA1c 9.0 +/- 1.3% (75 +/- 14 mmol/mol). Data collected by the Stepping Up Study: demographic and clinical characteristics, 'willingness' to initiate insulin, insulin appraisals, depressive symptoms, and diabetes-related distress. A multinomial regression investigated predictors of 'willingness'.
   Results: Nineteen percent (n = 50) were 'very willing' to initiate insulin, if recommended. The final regression model (R-2 = .44, chi(2)(12) 145.91, p < .001) demonstrated higher socioeconomic status and less negative attitudes to insulin were associated with increased willingness to initiate insulin.
   Conclusions: Among adults with T2DM for whom insulin is clinically indicated, only one in five are 'very willing' to begin insulin therapy. Independent of demographics, clinical factors and emotional wellbeing, insulin appraisals were associated with ` willingness'. This study highlights the importance of addressing attitudinal barriers to insulin therapy among adults with T2DM in primary care to improve insulin receptiveness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - The health threat posed by the novel coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic has particular implications for people with disabilities, including vulnerability to exposure and complications, and concerns about the role of ableism in access to treatment and medical rationing decisions. Shortages of necessary medical equipment to treat COVID-19 have prompted triage guidelines outlining the ways in which lifesaving equipment, such as mechanical ventilators and intensive care unit beds, may need to be rationed among affected individuals. In this article, we explore the realities of medical rationing, and various approaches to triage and prioritization. We discuss the psychology of ableism, perceptions about quality of life, social determinants of health, and how attitudes toward disability can affect rationing decisions and access to care. In addition to the grassroots advocacy and activism undertaken by the disability community, psychology is rich in its contributions to the role of attitudes, prejudice, and discriminatory behavior on the social fabric of society. We call on psychologists to advocate for social justice in pandemic preparedness, promote disability justice in health care settings, call for transparency and accountability in rationing approaches, and support policy changes for macro- and microallocation strategies to proactively reduce the need for rationing.

AB  - Background Community pharmacists have significant opportunity to contribute to prevention and treatment of opioid use disorders, but barriers to implementation still exist. Understanding their viewpoints is critical to designing future interventions. Objective To qualitatively explore experiences and beliefs of community pharmacists regarding the misuse of prescription opioids in the United States. Methods The study was part of a larger project that utilized a survey questionnaire to evaluate the relationships between knowledge, attitudes, and practices of community pharmacists in substance use disorders. The survey included an open-ended item on pharmacist views regarding the prescription opioid epidemic. The responses were used for inductive content analysis. Axial coding of themes was conducted to analyze underlying relationships: associations, consequences, intervening relationships, and action strategies regarding a central phenomenon. A model describing pharmacist experiences in the opioid epidemic was conceptualized. Results The open-ended question resulted in 50 (37.3%) usable responses. Final abstraction resulted in six themes including (1) overprescribing opioids: inappropriate prescribing as a contributor to the epidemic, (2) policy and practice recommendations: potential action strategies against the epidemic, (3) poor prescriber-pharmacist relationship: barrier to addressing the epidemic, (4) negative attitudes: intervening condition affecting roles of the pharmacist, (5) personal experience: facilitator to improve pharmacist roles and (6) decreased access to opioids: consequence of strict prescribing laws. Conclusion The study identified themes that described pharmacist views, attitudes, barriers, and experiences related to their perceived role in prevention and treatment of opioid use disorders. Future research should consider the implications of the barriers and facilitators identified.

TI  - A NEW APPROACH TO PLAINTIFF INCENTIVE FEES IN CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS
T2  - NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - CLASS-ACTION SETTLEMENTS
AB  - Because modern litigation is time-intensive and expensive, a consumer has no monetary incentive to sue over a low-value claim-even when the defendant has clearly violated that consumer's legal rights. But the defendant may have harmed many consumers in the same way, causing significant cumulative damage. By permitting the aggregation of numerous small claims, class action lawsuits provide a monetary incentive for lawyers and plaintiffs to pursue otherwise low-value suits. Often, an important part of this incentive is the "incentive fee," an additional payment awarded to the named plaintiffs as compensation for the time they spend and risks they assume in representing the class. But such fees have the potential to create dangerous conflicts of interest-named plaintiffs may be "bought off" with a large incentive fee to give their approval to an otherwise unfair settlement. To avoid this problem, courts must review and approve requests for incentive fees. Unfortunately, courts do not adequately evaluate the dangers of incentive awards and balance these dangers against the justifications for such awards. This Note proposes a new test to better guide courts in assessing the propriety of incentive fees. Specifically, courts should look at (1) the amount of time and effort that the plaintiff expended in pursuing the litigation; (2) risks that the named plaintiff faced in bringing and advancing the litigation; and (3) evidence of conflicts of interest that might prejudice the class.

AB  - People with mild intellectual disabilities are more vulnerable to become victims of crime. Victims with intellectual disabilities can face attitudinal, procedural and practical barriers within the justice system. This exploratory study looked at obstacles encountered by victims of crime with mild intellectual disabilities in effectuating their rights, their vulnerability to secondary victimization and ways to support them. In 2014, 35 respondents from across the Dutch justice system and 10 respondents with mild intellectual disabilities-expertise were interviewed. Inductive and deductive content analysis was carried out. Resonance of findings was checked in an expert meeting.
   Findings Three major problems were identified: (1) victims' incomprehension about the process and the proceedings; (2) victims' difficulty meeting system requirements and expectations; and (3) impact of prejudices concerning mild intellectual disabilities. A system adequately set up to deal with victims with mild intellectual disabilities could ease these difficulties. However, additional problems were identified, namely: (1) limited recognition of mild intellectual disabilities; (2) insufficient knowledge and understanding of consequences of mild intellectual disabilities; (3) issues related to accessing and accepting support; (4) communication unsuited for victims' reading and comprehension-level. These problems influence the ability of victims with mild intellectual disabilities to effectuate their rights and increases risk of secondary victimization.
   Applications Besides the importance of these findings for policymakers, results are of importance for all those working with victims or with people with mild intellectual disabilities. Individually tailored forms of support are required to overcome the identified problems. Awareness of the barriers that victims with mild intellectual disabilities may encounter will aid providing adequate support for victims with mild intellectual disabilities to exercise their rights and protect against secondary victimization.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to add experiential data from individuals with lived experiences of eating disorder recovery to the existing literature, regarding daily habits and attitudes toward eating and self-weighing. Methods An anonymous open-ended online survey was completed by 32 adults. One was excluded due to current eating disordered behaviors. Remaining participants were divided into three self-identified groups: Recovered from an eating disorder, Recovering from an eating disorder, and Partially Recovered from an eating disorder. Results Results showed the Recovered group reported more years of recovery than the other two groups, named "recovered" as part of their identity, practiced intuitive or regular eating instead of a prescribed meal plan, and held negative attitudes about self-weighing. The Recovering group reported, "I will always be recovering," and either followed prescribed meal plans or weighed themselves and did not expect to change those behaviors. The Partially Recovered group did not see themselves as recovered, but aspired to become recovered, and if they followed a prescribed meal plan or self-weighed, then they expected to change these behaviors in the future. Conclusions There is a difference in years of recovery, meal planning, and scale attitudes, among people who self-identify in the recovery categories of Recovered, Recovering, and Partially Recovered. These results can (1) help providers better serve clients with eating disorders; (2) help researchers better understand individuals who have suffered from eating disorders and are in the recovery process; and (3) offer guidance and hope for those in recovery.

AB  - Land change due to urbanization often results in the loss of desert ecosystems. The loss of desert land affects ecological and social processes in arid cities, such as habitat provisioning, the extent and intensity of the urban heat island, and outdoor recreation opportunities. Understanding the human?environment dynamics associated with environmental change is critical to understanding and managing the implications of urban growth. Few studies, however, have empirically examined people?s attitudes about hot, arid environments such as deserts. The primary objectives of our study are to (1) identify how patterns of attitudes are spatially distributed throughout neighborhoods in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona, and (2) determine how attitudes toward the desert are shaped by social and environmental attributes. We found that desert attitudes are spatially clustered throughout neighborhoods. Positive views of the desert are fortified in high-income areas and those near preserved desert parks, whereas negative attitudes are clustered in areas associated with lower socioeconomic status and in neighborhoods with relatively grassy landscaping. Negative perceptions toward the desert are stronger among Latino residents and in low-income neighborhoods, where environmental hazards, especially extreme heat, and the perceived risks associated with such hazards are more prominent. Overall, we found that factors shaping attitudes in arid landscapes, including socioeconomic status and social identity, are similar to those that shape attitudes toward urban forests and greenspace in more temperate environments. Understanding attitudes toward the desert can help strengthen the connection between the regional environment and the local community, ultimately encouraging land preservation in arid cities. Key Words: deserts, environmental attitudes, extreme heat, open space, vulnerability.

AB  - Background: There is a long history of certain medical conditions being associated with stigma, stereotypes, and negative attitudes. Research has shown that such attitudes can have a detrimental effect on patients presenting with stigmatised medical conditions and can even flow on to impact their family. The objective of this study was to measure the attitudes of undergraduate students enrolled in six different health-related courses at Monash University toward patients with intellectual disability, substance abuse, and acute mental illness.
   Methods: A convenience sample of undergraduate students enrolled in six health-related courses in first, second and third years at Monash University were surveyed. The Medical Condition Regard Scale - a valid and reliable, self-report measure of attitudes - was administered to students along with a brief demographic form. Mean scores, t-tests, and ANOVA were used to analyse student attitudes. Ethics approval was granted.
   Results: 548 students participated. Statistically significant differences were found between the courses (p = 0.05), year of the course (p = 0.09), and gender (p = 0.04) for the medical condition of intellectual disability. There was no statistically significant difference between the courses, year of the course, gender, and age group for substance abuse or acute mental illness conditions.
   Conclusion: The findings suggest that students in undergraduate health-related courses, as a group, have a strong regard for patients with intellectual disability and some regard for patients with acute mental illness, but not for patients presenting with substance abuse problems.

AB  - Research has largely ignored the systematic examination of physicians' attitudes towards providing care for patients with chronic noncancer pain The objective of this study was to identify barriers and facilitators to opioid treatment of chronic noncancer pain patients by office-based medical providers We used a qualitative study design using individual and group interviews Participants were 23 office-based physicians in New England Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and systematically coded by a multidisciplinary team using the constant comparative method Physician barriers included absence of objective or physiological measures of pain, lack of expertise in the treatment of chronic pain and coexisting disorders including addiction lack of interest in pain management, patients aberrant behaviors and physicians attitudes toward prescribing opioid analgesics Physician facilitators included promoting continuity of patient care and the use of opioid agreements Physicians' perceptions of patient-related barriers included lack of physician responsiveness to patients' pain reports, negative attitudes toward opioid analgesics, concerns about cost, and patients' low motivation for pain treatment Perceived logistical barriers included lack of appropriate pain management and addiction referral options, limited information regarding diagnostic workup, limited insurance coverage for pain management services limited ancillary support for physicians and insufficient time Addressing these barriers to pain treatment will be crucial to improving pain management service delivery
   Perspective This article demonstrates that perceived barriers to treating patients with chronic noncancer pain are common among office-based physicians Addressing these barriers in physician training and in existing office-based programs might benefit both noncancer chronic pain patients and their medical providers (c) 2010 by the American Pain Society

AB  - Attitudes to animals and their use are becoming increasingly important for the success of conservation and environmental initiatives. Beliefs about animals, their perceived emotional appeal, as well as individuals' moral capacities are all likely drivers of attitudes to animal use. In the present study, 320 participants completed an online survey containing the animal purpose questionnaire (APQ), the likeability and the speciesism scales, along with subscales of the moral foundations questionnaire and some demographic items. The results suggest that participants were least agreeable towards the use of pet species, but more neutral towards the use of profit and pest species. Individuals with a stronger liking for animals, greater individualising moral values and fewer speciesist attitudes were more likely to challenge animal use. In addition, individuals who identified as young female and non-meat-eating displayed heightened concern about animal use. Individualising morality and speciesism, along with personal factors such as eating orientation were significant predictors of attitudes to animal use as measured by the APQ. Speciesism was the strongest individual predictor of APQ totals, accounting for the highest proportion of the variance in the hierarchical regression. Overall the findings suggest that human versus non-human animal and pet versus non-pet are the key speciesism prejudices at work. Moreover, a general measure of human respect for the rights of other humans also predicted respect for the rights of animals. Thus the findings also suggest some similarity in the psychological mechanisms underpinning human-human and human-animal relations.

AB  - Background: Many patients have erroneous views with regard to depression and its management, and it was noted that these attitudes and beliefs significantly affected their adherence rates.
   Objectives: The primary aim of this study was to determine the attitudes and beliefs of patients with depression toward depression and antidepressants. A secondary aim was to assess the influence of ethnicity on patients' attitudes and beliefs.
   Patients and methods: The study involved patients with chronic depression being followed up at an outpatient clinic at a government-run hospital in Malaysia. Patients' attitudes and beliefs were assessed using the Antidepressant Compliance Questionnaire.
   Results: A total of 104 patients of Malay, Chinese, and Indian ethnic groups met the selection criteria. Chinese patients had significantly negative attitudes and beliefs toward depression and antidepressants compared to Malays and Indians (b=-8.96, t(103)=-3.22; P < 0.05). Component analysis revealed that 59% of patients believed that antidepressants can cause a person to have less control over their thoughts and feelings, while 67% believed that antidepressants could alter one's personality; 60% believed it was okay to take fewer tablets on days when they felt better, while 66% believed that antidepressants helped solve their emotional problems and helped them worry less.
   Conclusion: Patients had an overall positive view as to the benefits of antidepressants, but the majority had incorrect views as to the acceptable dosing of antidepressants and had concerns about the safety of the medication. Assessing patients' attitudes and beliefs, as well as the impact of their respective cultures, can be used in tailoring psychoeducation sessions accordingly.

AB  - In June 2015, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced that a woman would replace Hamilton on the $10 bill. In April 2016, it announced that Harriet Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill, instead. After each announcement, we surveyed nationally representative samples of American adults and asked them what they thought of these proposed changes for the $10 bill (Study 1, N=209) and the $20 bill (Study 2, N=208). Predictors of currency preferences were gender, race, political affiliation and their respective prejudices and biasessexism, racism, and political ideology. On the basis of social identity, system justification, and social dominance theories we predicted that privileged groups (i.e., males, Whites) and groups who desire to maintain the status quo (i.e., Republicans, conservatives, sexist and racist individuals) would prefer to leave Hamilton on the $10 bill and Jackson on the $20 bill. Results were consistent with these predictions: Overall, we found that under-represented groups and more liberal individuals support the proposals from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. These findings suggest a bill of money is not just a piece of paper. The person depicted on U.S. currency can be perceived as an in-group or out-group member and this can affect judgements in line with relevant social psychological theories.

AB  - Background: The attitudes of advanced psychiatric nurses significantly contribute to the management, treatment plan and care of the mental healthcare users, and resultantly affects the quality and standards of mental healthcare. Considering these effects, it is imperative to understand how the attitudes of advanced psychiatric nurses are perceived by other multidisciplinary team members.
   Aim: To describe the perceptions of the multidisciplinary team members regarding advanced psychiatric nurses' attitudes in clinical practice.
   Setting: Three mental health institutions were utilised to obtain the perceptions related to the attitudes displayed by advanced psychiatric nurses in the clinical environment.
   Method: A qualitative research descriptive approach was adopted to obtain in-depth descriptions of the attitudes portrayed by advanced psychiatric nurses. Eight purposefully sampled multidisciplinary team members were interviewed to obtain information. Data were analysed using Colaizzi's method.
   Results: Themes and sub-themes emerged. Mental healthcare providers exhibited both negative and positive attitudes towards mental health patients. By perception, unfavorable attitudes hindered effective communication and psychosocial rehabilitation programs for mental health patients. Positivity enhanced feedback during ward rounds and during clinical meetings.
   Conclusion: Despite the positive impact advanced psychiatric nurses have on mental health care, views regarding mental health patients remain negative. It is recommended that advanced psychiatric nursing education curriculum address negative attitudes, views, and stereotypes. Mental healthcare users need to be provided with psychosocial rehabilitation programs and activities that address advance psychiatric nurses' lack of initiatives.
   Contribution: A clear set of principles and protocols underpins the collaborative effort among multidisciplinary teams in mental health care.

AB  - Introduction: Pain is the most common reason that patients come to the emergency department. Emergency nurses have an indispensable role in the management of this pain.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to examine emergency nurses' knowledge, attitude and clinical decision-making skills about pain.
   Methods: This descriptive study was conducted in a state and a university hospital between September and October 2012 in Malatya, Turkey. Of 98 nurses working in the emergency departments of these two hospitals, 57 returned the questionnaires. The response rate was 58%. Data were collected using the Demographic Information Questionnaire, Knowledge and Attitude Questionnaire about Pain and Clinical Decision Making Survey. Frequency, percentage, mean and standard deviation were used to evaluate data.
   Results: 75.4% of participant nurses knew that patients' own statement about their pain was the most reliable indicator during pain assessment. Almost half of the nurses believed that patients should be encouraged to endure the pain as much as possible before resorting to a pain relief method. The results also indicate that most of nurses think that a sleeping patient does not have any pain and pain relief should be postponed as it can influence the diagnosis negatively. It is determined that the pain scale was not used frequently. Only 35.1% of nurses reported keeping records of pain.
   Conclusion: Despite all the recommendations of substantial past research the results of this study indicate that emergency nurses continue to demonstrate inadequate knowledge, clinical decision-making skills and negative attitudes about pain. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Judges and juries are frequently called upon to evaluate a party's actions in retrospect with the benefit of hindsight. Traditionally, courts and scholars have been understandably wary about how hindsight bias influences verdicts, focusing on how to keep outcome information away from jurors and how to minimize its influence on adjudication. But outcome information can be probative evidence: Bad outcomes can be indicative of bad decision making. In this Essay, I aim to rehabilitate the use of outcome information by conceptualizing it as a new category of evidence: hindsight evidence. First, I develop a framework for deciding how much weight to afford hindsight evidence and whether it should be admitted to a jury under Rule 403, which requires judges to weigh probative value against prejudicial impact. As for relevance and probative weight, I show that hindsight evidence is probative to the extent that facts supporting one party's theory of the case have a greater tendency to generate that outcome than facts supporting the other party's theory. As for prejudice, I review the research on hindsight bias and the factors that mitigate its impact. Finally, I apply this framework to four paradigmatic examples from diverse areas of the law civil rights, contracts, special education law, and civil procedure where courts have disagreed about whether to consider hindsight evidence. Ultimately, I conclude that a deeper theoretical understanding of how hindsight evidence operates will allow courts to embrace its value more readily.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to give voice to the experiences of women with disabilities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) who have accessed employment, to highlight the structural barriers to employment and to identify the skills they used to obtain work.
   Design/methodology/approach This is a phenomenological study conducted in KSA. Themes from the interviews of women with disabilities were explored using Yosso's (2005) cultural capital conceptual framework.
   Findings The participants had work and career aspirations, persisted in their job search, navigated barriers, and had familial support and emotional support from their social networks, but lacked instrumental assistance in accessing work. KSA policies to support women and people with disabilities to obtain employment are not adequately enforced, and negative attitudes toward people with disabilities are widespread.
   Research limitations/implications The sample size is small, but these preliminary findings justify the necessity for additional research and policy development specifically focused on women with disabilities.
   Practical implications There is an urgent need for existing policy enforcement and a need for a national strategy promoting the employment of women and the needs of women with disabilities should be specifically included in this agenda.
   Originality/value There is no extant research or policy literature regarding employment and women with disabilities in the KSA. This study applies Yosso's (2005) theory of cultural capital to women with disabilities, demonstrating its applicability outside of race/ethnicity studies and suggests that community is not an essential factor in building employment success.

AB  - Objective To explore entry-level physiotherapy students' attitudes and beliefs relating to weight bias and stigmatisation in healthcare. Design Cross sectional survey of physiotherapy students. Methods All final year physiotherapy students (n = 215) enrolled in entry-level physiotherapy programmes in the Republic of Ireland were invited to participate. Each received a questionnaire, consisting of 72 questions, within four key sections. Descriptive statistics and frequencies were used to analyse the data. Results A response rate of 83% (179/215) was achieved. Whilst physiotherapy students, overall, had a positive attitude towards people with obesity, 29% had a negative attitude towards people with obesity, 24% had a negative attitude towards managing this population and most (74%) believed obesity was caused by behavioural and individual factors. Over one third of students (35%) reported that they would not be confident in managing patients with obesity and more than half (54%) felt treating patients with obesity was not worthwhile. Conclusion This study provides preliminary findings to suggest that weight stigma-reduction efforts are warranted for physiotherapy students. Helping students to understand that obesity is a complex, chronic condition with multiple aspects requiring a multi-faceted approach to its management might be the first step towards dispelling these negative attitudes towards patients living with obesity. Inclusion of a formal obesity curriculum should perhaps now be part of the contemporary physiotherapy students' education. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Persons of South Asian origin (SAs) are the fastest growing minority group in the United States. Culturally competent care for patients and families of SA origin necessitates an understanding of the cultural factors that affect decision-making for palliative and end-of-life care. Objective: To better understand health-care providers' perspectives on decision-making among seriously ill persons of SA origin. Method: Data were collected in a US Midwestern city, predominantly in 2 hospital-based health-care systems along with a few interviews of private practitioners. Researchers conducted a thematic analysis of data. Transcripts were coded individually, coding disagreements resolved through discussion and themes arrived upon by consensus. Results: Health-care providers reported that numerous factors interact to influence decision-making among SAs. Patient-based factors include education, time spent in the United States, expectations of physician-directed care, and spiritual beliefs. Family-based factors include a norm of family-based decision-making and a complex distribution of decision-making responsibilities among family members. Provider-based factors include challenges reconciling SA and American approaches to decision-making. Community-based factors include negative attitudes and a lack of education regarding palliative care and the potential role of community support in health-care decision-making. Conclusions: A rich cultural context influences health-care decision-making among seriously ill SAs. An understanding of this context will enhance providers' cultural competence and likely improve services to this growing population.

AB  - Considering a relatively slow adoption of online grocery shopping in the vast majority of the world markets, the main objective of this study was to uncover any new reasons why customers hesitate to shop groceries online. Moreover, we were not looking for undiscovered discouraging reasons only but also intended to validate previously researched reasons in published studies. Thus, we have first used a systematic literature review to cover all relevant previous studies on online grocery non-buyers. Even though this process is time-consuming, it provides a coherent overview of the published material on the topic. Further, we designed a web-based survey of 670 respondents from the general internet population. The data in open-ended questions related to online grocery attitudes and opinions were analysed by the content analysis. 14 thematic units emerged from the process from which the majority confirmed previously researched negative attitudes toward online grocery shopping. Non-buyers prefer to see grocery in person before buying it, there is a distrust in e-tailers to choose the best and freshest grocery, non-buyers prefer personal contact with the seller and behave habitually. Moreover, they tend to shop offline also because of hedonic reasons and pleasure from the shopping experience. Novel reasons why people hesitate to shop online in this category were the time consumption where consumers perceived online shopping slow regarding order-delivery time gap and were reluctant to pay for the delivery service, to mention just a few. We conclude with a summary of our results and a handful of recommendation for e-tail companies.

AB  - Purpose: In recent years, many psychological problems in patients with stomas have been addressed in a number of studies. But there are only a few studies that use objective measures to take into account self-appraisal by patients with permanent or temporary stomas. The aim of this study is to compare the psychological attitude of patients with permanent and temporary stomas and to determine the most appropriate psychological supportive care.
   Methods: Sixty-five patients, who received a stoma between January 2009 and March 2012, were classified into two groups with either permanent or temporary stomas and were observed prospectively. We developed a questionnaire with the aid of a psychiatrist to analyze the grade of psychological attitude of self-appraisal of patients. The questionnaire was categorized into three parts; body image scale, self-esteem scale, and depression scale. Patients responded to the questionnaire 4 weeks after the operation and the answers of each group were compared.
   Results: Out of 65 patients, 42 received temporary stomas and 23 received permanent stomas. There was no significant mean difference between permanent and temporary stoma patients in the body image scale, the self-esteem scale, and the depression scale. However, patients with a permanent stoma tended to have a worse body image and lower self-esteem on some specific items within the questionnaires.
   Conclusion: Patients with stomas have negative attitudes toward themselves and some meaningful differences were found between different types of stoma applied. Surgeons should be concerned about postoperative psychological support for patients with stomas.

AB  - Purpose - The aims of this study are to identify and analyse prevalent gender roles and the persistence of sexist stereotypes among teachers in training in Spain, to determine the reasons for them and suggest solutions for eradicating sexist prejudices.
   Design/methodology/approach - A gender role questionnaire was administered to 1260 workers from 54 different professions who were enrolled on a postgraduate training course to qualify as secondary education teachers. The instrument contained six variables for both quantitative and qualitative analysis: professional work, family (looking after children), feelings and emotions, household chores, body image and free time.
   Findings - Household chores, looking after children and gender roles linked to body image were those most indicated by both men and women. It is concluded that men participate little in bringing up children and household chores and that women continue to shoulder the responsibility. Both are concerned about their body image, but women have little self-acceptance of and satisfaction with their bodies and a stronger sense of being judged by how they look. Gender stereotypes persist, despite extensive legislation in Spain since 2004.
   Research limitations/implications - The study has limitations deriving from its choice of convenience sampling. Although it includes participants from six Spanish autonomous communities, the number from each region is not very high. Nevertheless, the sample is representative of almost all branches of knowledge (54 professions). Another limitation concerns the images used in the research instrument as a data collection strategy insofar, as they could not be obtained from a data bank specific to the research subject but instead had to be found in databases of general images. It can be inferred that a data collection strategy without any danger of bias would be to encourage each participant to design their own images, reflecting their perceptions and auto-perceptions of gender roles and stereotypes. The fact that there were no pre-existing studies using this type of research instrument in education sciences was a handicap for the investigation. Despite these methodological limitations, the results of the study may serve as a basis for implementing specific future actions originating from any area - but especially from the area of education - aimed at teaching people about equal roles in order to eliminate sexist sterotypes. This research was carried out as part of the Proyecto Diseno y Atencion a las Oportunidades de Genero en la Educacion Superior (Project on Design and Gender Equality of Opportunities in Higher Education) funded by the Vicerrectorado de Cooperacion al Desarrollo (Office for University Cooperation for Development) at the University of Alicante (Spain).
   Practical implications - Spanish legislation has not been able to promote significant changes in the performance of traditional gender roles or to eliminate sexist stereotypes that perpetuate imbalances between men and women. The ideal and prevalent model of a Spanish woman is still that of a "self-sacrificing mother", responsible for the household chores and childcare. She must combine this first job with a second profession, and, in addition, she must have a "desirable physical image". The study puts forward various possible solutions for reducing and/or eradicating sexist attitudes with the participation of different social agents and in particular through education.
   The investigation could be of use when carrying out specific cross-sectional interventions on the subject of gender equality with students on postgraduate teacher training courses, for the purposes of encouraging the elimination of stereotypes and strengthening the capacity for critical judgement, positive self-concept and self-esteem.
   Originality/value - The study may be useful for carrying out specific and transversal university training interventions in postgraduate teacher training on gender equality aimed at promoting the elimination of stereotypes, the strengthening of critical judgement capacity, positive self-concept and self-esteem.

AB  - Objective: To describe the barriers and facilitators to implementing the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses Postpartum Hemorrhage (AWHONN PPH) Project experienced by hospital leaders, project champions, and staff.
   Design: Qualitative descriptive study with a grounded theory approach.
   Setting: Hospital leaders, champions, and staff from hospitals in New Jersey and Georgia.
   Participants: A total of 21 nurses and physicians who worked at six hospitals shared their experiences with regard to implementation of the AWHONN PPH Project.
   Methods: Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Analysis included open, selective, and theoretical coding with a constant comparative method of grounded theory. Analysis was complete when a central process emerged.
   Results: Successful implementation of most or all of the program elements was facilitated by support from administrators, positive attitudes, active nurse and physician champions, and an existing culture of safety. When these elements were in place, respondents reported that they believed they made a difference. Barriers to implementation included negative attitudes, lack of champions, poor staff buy in, lack of resources, and lack of support from administrators. When barriers were encountered, respondents felt discouraged and disappointed.
   Conclusion: Although the road to full participation and implementation was difficult for some, lessons were learned by all. Suggestions for future projects include a step-by-step approach that begins with education, the creation and celebration of milestones, and the formation of teams to facilitate buy in and empowerment.

AB  - Backgroud: Personal characteristics contribute to whether negative attitudes in society are internalized as deteriorating self-stigma. Studies in healthy subjects suggest that resilience is associated with the regulation of amygdala activation by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), but little is known about the factors that contribute to individual stigma resistance in psychiatric patients.
   Methods: We assessed stigma (by measuring association strengths between social inferiority and schizophrenia by an implicit association test) in 20 patients with schizophrenia and in 16 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. The brain activation strengths were measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging during evaluation of schizophrenia-related statements and of control statements.
   Results: Association strengths between social inferiority and schizophrenia were inversely related to the strength of the activation of the rostro-ventral mPFC. This inverse correlation survived adjustment for global functioning, depression symptom scores, and insight. Activation of the rostro-ventral mPFC was negatively correlated with activation of the amygdala. The association strengths between social inferiority and schizophrenia correlated with the compromised performance in a Stroop task, which is a measure of cognitive regulation.
   Discussion: Our findings suggest that individual stigma resistance is associated with emotion regulation. These findings may help to understand better stigma resistance and thereby aid the development of patient interventions that add to the public anti-stigma work in reducing devastating effects of stigma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Negative perception and attitude of community prevents many people with depression and their caregivers from seeking help and receiving adequate treatment due to fear of social reaction and may try to hide the illness. The reasons for negative attitudes are not consistent across communities or cultures. Therefore, understanding the level of community perception and attitude towards people with depression is important to develop an intervention to reduce the impact of mental illness.
   METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 617 randomly selected adults. The data was collected using structured, pre-tested, and interviewer-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics like frequency, mean, and median were performed. Bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the factors that affect the community attitude towards people with depression.
   RESULTS: Of the study population, 325(52.7%) had a good perception and 246(39.9%) had a positive attitude towards people with depression. The majority of study participants frequently identified as the perceived cause of depression was substance misuse, loss of loved one, and conflict within a family. In addition, psychosocial treatment was the most preferred treatment for people with depression in the study area. Marital status and educational status were significantly associated with the community attitude towards people with depression
   CONCLUSION: Giving special attention to people with substance misuse, loss of loved one, and conflict within a family is very vital for the prevention of depression. In addition, future mental health promotion activities should focus on cause and common manifestation of depression to improve the attitude toward people with depression

AB  - Objective: This exploratory study investigated empathy and attitudes towards specific medical conditions, two important aspects of the midwife-woman relationship, amongst undergraduate midwifery students at one university.
   Method: Fifty-two Bachelor of Midwifery students across three years of the course completed questionnaires, the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy-Health Professional (JSPE-HP) version and the Medical Condition Regard Scale (MCRS). Both the JSPE-HP and the MCRS are standardised, self-report questionnaires with established reliability and validity.
   Findings: An overall respectable level of empathy was measured, which was shown to increase consistently and substantially with each year level of the student undergraduate program. Attitudes to selected diagnoses were very good with the exception being substance abuse, which received a significantly lower mean.
   Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that the Bachelor of Midwifery course, or studying midwifery, has a positive effect on students' empathy. Low results in participants' attitudes towards patients presenting with substance abuse raises concern that students may harbour prejudice that could impinge upon their professional practice and the way in which they care for these mothers. Hence, this aspect in particular may need further development within midwifery curriculum development. Further research around other conditions may extend on our understandings of empathy and attitudes in midwifery students and practitioners.

AB  - The largest area of the South African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) distribution occurs outside formally protected areas, making cheetahs vulnerable to conflict-related killings. This conflict is assumed to be related to negative attitudes of landowners towards predators. Our study assessed the socio-economic factors influencing landowner attitudes towards cheetahs on private properties adjacent to the Kruger National Park (Kruger), South Africa. We used structured questionnaires to interview 199 landowners. Attitudes of landowners towards cheetahs were generally positive; 58% of landowners had attitude index scores between eight and 11. However, 11% had fairly negative or low scores (scores between -2 and 4). First language, land use and respondent knowledge of cheetahs were key drivers of attitude. English speaking landowners (49.8%) were more likely to display positive attitudes towards cheetahs than Afrikaans first-language speakers (46.8%). In addition, the likelihood of having a more positive attitude increased significantly as respondent knowledge of cheetahs increased. Attitudes were also influenced by land use, with wildlife ranchers or ecotourism ventures having a significantly higher probability of having more positive attitudes than livestock farmers. With the Kruger being a stronghold for cheetah conservation in Africa, and large carnivores being vulnerable to edge effects in protected areas, it is important to understand the factors driving conflict so that mitigation efforts can be targeted for maximum impact.

AB  - Clinical social work supervision is not immune to enactments of racial and social injustice, prejudice, power and privilege rampant in our social environment and institutions. These dynamics are active in all social interactions. Most often felt on impact, these remain underground and unevenly experiencedthough predominantly by people representing intersecting marginalized identities. Such real enactments can be misunderstood or avoided in social work supervision. Negative consequences not only impede learning for the supervisee and supervisor, and affect clinical understanding of client care they also perpetuate injustice based on power and social locations. Social work supervision provides space for critical analysis to identify and alter dynamics of power, privilege, and social oppression. The critical conversations (CC) model provides a framework to illuminate and examine power dynamics in order to produce change with parallel insight and actionsupervisee, supervisor, and client care. Supervisee and supervisor gain capacity to engage in reflection, examine personal and professional values, hold tension and tolerate ambiguity, use one self critically, articulate ideas and insights thoughtfully and effectively, as well as inform clinical understanding of clients. The need for critical dialogue in social work supervision regarding dynamics of sameness, differences, intersectional identities, power and privilege is emphasized. Theoretical grounding is offered to elucidate how complex structural forces of oppression and privilege, cultural patterns and narratives are internalized. A definition of CC, its theoretical underpinnings and the CC model are presented with a case scenario to illuminate the application of the CC model in clinical supervision.

AB  - Many stressors plague bee populations including habitat fragmentation and degradation, as well as pathogens and pesticide exposure. With bee communities at risk, conservation efforts are imperative. Although recent research has examined bee communities across cities, few studies have analyzed variation in human attitudes toward and perceptions of bees, or how these perspectives might influence bee conservation. We therefore analyzed residents' attitudes toward and perceptions of bees, specifically in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. Primarily drawing upon 2017 survey data (n = 496, 39% response rate), we posed the following questions: 1) What cognitive, environmental, and social factors explain whether people like or dislike bees? and 2) How do attitudes and perceptions about bees relate to land management practices, specifically landscaping choices, herbicide and pesticide use, and desert plantings? Overall, attitudes toward bees were mostly neutral with a slight trend toward dislike but most residents did not believe bees were problematic at their homes. Additional findings reveal that risk perceptions, ecological worldviews, and pet ownership significantly explained attitudes toward bees. Moreover, people who live closer to desert parks had relatively positive attitudes toward bees. Regarding yard management practices, both attitudes toward and perceptions of bees were positively correlated with adding desert plants to residential yards. Moreover, people who use pesticides had more negative attitudes toward bees. Our results indicate conservation potential for urban bee populations, for example, by planting native vegetation in residential areas near desert preserves. We hope this study will result in more attitudinal research on bee species and other understudied urban wildlife.

AB  - Increasingly severe environmental issues, especially those in developing countries such as China, drive the evolution of the environmental protection institution (EPI) to its strictest levels. However, the implementation of the strictest EPI still confronts various challenges and barriers, and the multi-stakeholder features of EPI determine these barriers are not independent of one another but rather present complex interactive relationships. This paper identifies the barriers to implementing China's EPI from four aspects of environmental legal, economic, regulatory, and public participation institutions. A variable precision rough DEMATEL approach is proposed to visualize the causal relationships and intensities among barriers from the similarities and differences in perspectives of stakeholders from the government, company, and public levels. The obtained causal interactive mechanism among barriers highlights the need to prioritize the improvement of environmental policy assessment, and the concrete measures in policies or plans should be integrated into legislation to ensure they are mutually supportive early. The non-substantive contributions achieved by China's public participation in environmental protection reveal prejudices that the public is often regarded as a supporter or spectator by both government and company groups, which makes the transparent environmental information disclosure, transfer and feedback into an effective mediation among stakeholders. Comprehensive coordination and feedback mechanisms including source prevention, process control, and severe punishment for consequences while enhancing linkages among stakeholders are put forward to overcome barriers and help implement the strictest EPI.

AB  - Introduction Public health interventions need to balance the benefits with any potential harms. One proposed intervention for reducing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption involves placing graphic warning labels on products and advertisements. A recent study found that a graphic warning label that contained negative imagery of obesity reduced purchases of sugar-sweetened beverages. However, these labels may also promote obesity stigma, which is concerning given that weight stigma is associated with harmful health consequences including weight gain and increased risk of mortality. Methods In Study 1 (n = 681), participants viewed a standard soda label or the graphic warning label online and then completed measures of disgust and prejudice towards people with obesity. In Study 2 (n = 506), participants who identified as having overweight or obesity viewed the graphic warning label online before or after completing measures of mood and state self-esteem. Results In Study 1, participants who had viewed the graphic warning label reported higher disgust and weight bias. In Study 2, the majority of participants perceived the warning label to be stigmatizing, and participants displayed worse mood and, through this, lower self-esteem after viewing the label. Conclusions Although the graphic warning label has been found to reduce sugary drink purchases, it also promotes obesity stigma and is perceived as stigmatizing by individuals with overweight and obesity. Given that weight stigma predicts harmful health and well-being consequences, the benefits of graphic warning labels need to be balanced against the potential costs.

AB  - Recognition and respect for sexual minorities in Hong Kong is still a contested area. Public sexual identity politics in Hong Kong has been framed by traditional Chinese gender ideology and imported Christian beliefs which are profoundly negative. Focusing on the interpersonal relationships in three spheres of life, the research adopted the sociological perspective of personal life and the feminist geographers' idea of spatialization of identity management to analyze how the sexual self of sexual minorities has been marginalized and excluded in intimate social spaces of family, church communities and schools in Hong Kong with specific spatial practices and different forms of power/knowledge. By examining overlooked intimate injustice in personal life, this study illustrates that identity conflicts between Christianity and non-heterosexuality in everyday life is constructed through misrepresentation, misrecognition, harassment and exclusion in intimate relationships. Different types of knowledge are being used to reiterate pre-existing norms and institutionalized patterns of cultural value that constitute the sexual minorities as comparatively unworthy of respect. These micro-political processes involve both conformity and resistance to gender and sexual stereotypes. Participants managed to develop spatial coping strategies such as concealment, compartmentalization, confrontation and alternative sources of support to manage their lives with dignity and self-esteem.

KW  - PELVIC EXAMINATION
KW  - PROFESSIONAL PATIENTS
KW  - STUDENTS
KW  - SKILLS
KW  - MODEL
AB  - Background: Increasingly, professional patient programs are used for training medical students to perform pelvic examinations, yet we know little of the experiences of women who teach medical students these sensitive examination skills.
   Aim: To describe the experiences of women working as Clinical Teaching Associates (CTAs) teaching medical students the technical and communication skills required to perform pelvic examinations.
   Methods: Twelve women employed as CTAs participated in semi-structured interviews. Individual interviews were used to identify major themes in women's experiences of teaching sensitive examinations to medical students.
   Results: CTAs identified unique difficulties in their work including negative attitudes from others towards their role and the unpleasantness of the examination, although other challenges (such as teamwork issues or providing negative feedback to colleagues) were characteristic of many work situations. Effective communication was identified as central to the CTA role and the women described growth in their communication skills and assertiveness that they applied to other aspects of their work and personal lives. CTAs were motivated to join the program and remained in the program because of an interest in women's health and a desire for meaningful work, which they believed improved the examination and communication skills of future doctors. Positive interactions with work colleagues were a valued part of the role and a primary motivator to remain in the program.
   Conclusions: Highlighting the experiences of women working as CTAs validates the significant teaching role these women perform and, from a pragmatic perspective, may increase understanding of the best way to attract and retain women to these important teaching roles.

AB  - Sharing marketplaces emerged as the new Holy Grail of value creation by enabling exchanges between strangers. Identity reveal, encouraged by platforms, cuts both ways: While inducing pre-transaction confidence, it is suspected of backfiring on the information senders with its discriminative potential. This study employs a discrete choice experiment to explore the role of names as signifiers of discriminative peculiarities and the importance of accompanying cues in peer choices of a ridesharing offer. We quantify users' preferences for quality signals in monetary terms and evidence comparative disadvantage of Middle Eastern descent male names for drivers and co-travelers. It translates into a lower willingness to accept and pay for an offer. Market simulations confirm the robustness of the findings. Further, we discover that females are choosier and include more signifiers of involuntary personal attributes in their decision-making. Price discounts and positive information only partly compensate for the initial disadvantage, and identity concealment is perceived negatively.

AB  - Purpose This study investigates the effect of consumers' brand attitude changes according to the fashion film type. Furthermore, it examines the psychological mechanism by engagement and consumer fantasy proneness. This study is meaningful because it provides a more in-depth understanding of the use of fashion film as a means of consumer-oriented persuasion communication. Design/methodology/approach This research uses a 2(fashion film type: narrative vs non-narrative) x 2(consumer fantasy proneness: high vs low) mixed factorial design to test the hypotheses. ANOVA and the PROCESS macro mounted on SPSS was used to test hypotheses. Findings The group with high consumer fantasy proneness showed more changes in brand attitude when exposed to non-narrative than narrative fashion films, but the group with low consumer fantasy proneness showed no significant difference in brand attitude change according to the fashion film type. In addition, when consumer fantasy proneness is high, media and brand engagement for non-narrative fashion films increase sequentially, resulting in a greater change in brand attitude, whereas these psychological mechanisms do not work in groups with low consumer fantasy proneness. Practical implications Fashion brands should identify their respective target group when producing fashion films and choose differentiated narrative forms. In the case of pursuing a fantastic aesthetic value, the non-narrative type induces more attention and curiosity from consumers than the narrative type, which affects the feeling of a special bond or relevance with the brand. Originality/value This study has value in that it demonstrates the rationale for why a fashion brand needs to select a differentiated content structure according to the aesthetic value pursued when making a fashion film in branding work.

AB  - Covering faces with masks, due to mandatory pandemic safety regulations, we can no longer rely on the habitual daily-life information. This may be thought-provoking for healthy people, but particularly challenging for individuals with neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Au fait research on reading covered faces reveals that: 1) wearing masks hampers facial affect recognition, though it leaves reliable inferring basic emotional expressions; 2) by buffering facial affect, masks lead to narrowing of emotional spectrum and dampen veridical evaluation of counterparts; 3) masks may affect perceived face attractiveness; 4) covered (either by masks or other veils) faces have a certain signal function introducing perceptual biases and prejudices; 5) reading covered faces is gender- and age-specific, being more challenging for males and more variable even in healthy aging; 6) the hampering effects of masks on social cognition occur over the globe; and 7) reading covered faces is likely to be supported by the large-scale assemblies of the neural circuits far beyond the social brain. Challenges and limitations of ongoing research and parallels to the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test are assessed. Clarification of how masks affect face reading in the real world, where we deal with dynamic faces and have entree to additional valuable social signals such as body language, as well as the specificity of neural networks underlying reading covered faces calls for further tailored research.

AB  - PurposeThe present study examined whether and how attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., safety, efficacy, and price), mental health statuses (i.e., perceived stress and depression), and interpersonal factors (i.e., online social support, perceived social support) would predict COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Patients and methodsThe two-wave longitudinal surveys were conducted in December 2019 and 2020 in Chinese medical college students (N = 194). Well- validated measures were used, including the Perceived Stress Scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the Online Social Support Questionnaire, and the Perceived Social Support Scale. Perceived safety, efficacy, price of COVID-19 vaccine, vaccine hesitancy, and actual intake were also measured. ResultsOnly 2.1% of participants had been vaccinated against COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic; 13.4% intended to get vaccinated in the next 3 months, and 66% intended to have it in the next 12 months upon follow-up. Multiple regression analyses revealed that perceived stress (beta m = -0.15, p < 0.05) and depression (beta m = -0.15, p < 0.05) were risk factors for positive attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine; online social support (ORm = 1.41, p < 0.01) and positive attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine (ORm = 1.83, p < 0.01) were protective factors of intention to get vaccinated in future. ConclusionFindings suggest that intervention efforts should be made to reduce negative attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine among people with poor mental health and enhance online social support to promote COVID-19 vaccination.

AB  - Based on their high nutritional value and low production costs, insects are an excellent and sustainable source of animal protein. In contrast to countries such as China, in Western societies, the consumption of insects is not rooted in traditional diet. Data for the present study was collected from adults in Germany (n = 502) and China (n = 443). A cross-cultural comparison was conducted based on consumers' willingness to eat different insect-based, processed (e.g., cookies based on cricket flour) and unprocessed (e.g., crickets) food. The influence of food neophobia on consumers' willingness to eat insects was examined. The Chinese rated all insect-based food more favourably with regard to taste, nutritional value, familiarity and social acceptance compared with the Germans. Also, they indicated greater willingness to eat the tested food products, and no differences were observed between their ratings of processed and unprocessed food. The Germans reported higher willingness to eat the processed insect-based foods compared to the unprocessed foods. Further results revealed that low scores for food neophobia, positive taste expectations, high scores for social acceptance and experiences with eating insects in the past were significant predictors of consumers' willingness to eat insects in both countries. Consequently, the introduction of insects as a food source in Western societies seems more likely to succeed if insects are incorporated into familiar food items, which will reduce neophobic reactions and negative attitudes towards insect-based foods.

AB  - Background: The growth of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been increasing, including amongst psychological clients. Therefore, it is important to investigate psychologists' attitudes towards CAM. Negative attitudes towards CAM among psychologists could be a barrier to CAM integration into psychological services and may prevent clients to trust psychologists. This study aims to compare Indonesian and Australian psychologists' attitudes towards CAM using the previously published study on Psychologists' Attitudes Towards Complementary and Alternative Therapies (PATCAT) scale validation.
   Methods: The PATCAT scale was adapted from an Australian study to an Indonesian version using backward-and-forward translation. This scale was used to investigate attitudes towards: (1) CAM knowledge; (2) CAM integration; and (3) the risks associated with CAM. An online survey was sent to all Indonesian psychologists and completed by 247 participants. Afterward, the data were compared with the published data from 115 Australian psychologists.
   Results: In general, psychologists in Indonesia and Australia showed relatively similar ambivalent attitudes towards CAM. This uncertainty may stem from the same Western psychology education, which is a basis for the medical models in both nations. They also considered it somewhat important to have an understanding of CAM. Participants in both nations displayed positive attitude towards CAM integration into psychological services. However, they felt that CAM usage for mental health holds some risks.
   Conclusion: Australian and Indonesian psychologists reported ambivalent attitudes towards CAM that might be reduced with clear regulation of CAM integration into psychological services from the government and professional organizations.

AB  - Background In the COVID-19 pandemic, Switzerland introduced broad nationwide face mask mandates only by October 2020, later than other Western European countries. This study aims to assess the underlying values and considerations of individuals to wear face masks in the absence of face mask mandates in the COVID-19 pandemic in German-speaking Switzerland. Methods As part of the "Solidarity in times of a pandemic" (SolPan) research commons, we interviewed 31 participants living in the German-speaking part of Switzerland in April 2020 and 25 of them again in October 2020. Qualitative inductive thematic analysis was applied for data analysis and interpretation. Public health ethics principles guided the interpretation and organization of findings. Results Five themes were identified: Trust and governmental policy; perceived benefits of mask-wearing; perceived risks of mask-wearing; social exclusion and prejudice; and decision-making in the absence of mandates. In light of increasing infection rates in October 2020, many participants started to consider the benefits higher than the risks and were willing to accept face mask mandates in that context, despite earlier reservations. Conclusions The absence of face mask mandates underline individual autonomy but may also suppress personal responsibility due to social influence. Face masks are only temporarily acceptable in liberal Western societies and face mask mandates should be enforced only when epidemiologically necessary.

AB  - The Australian Government's 'Caring for our Country' program has undermined Australia's 'regional model' for natural resource management, and eroded gains made under the precursor Natural Heritage Trust and related programs, in eight significant ways. Contrary to expectations that Caring for our Country, established in 2008, would build on the foundations established by the Natural Heritage Trust, it has adopted a narrower agenda, increased central government control, and compromised buy-in by state and territory governments. In reaction to the difficulty of assessing the cost-effectiveness of natural resource management program investments, priority has been given to discrete projects capable of demonstrating short-term, measurable outputs. Implementation of Caring for our Country has failed to realise the aspirations of regional organisations for core funding, substantially increased transaction costs and diminished success rates under competitive funding arrangements, and prejudiced the goodwill of many in the natural resource management community. Commitment to local community natural resource management movements like Landcare has been inconsistent, and largely unsuccessful. Retracting investment in relevant research and development, notably the termination of Land and Water Australia in 2009, has severely limited knowledge creation and sharing to inform and strengthen the regional model. We contend that the Australian Government should revisit its strategy for enabling and sustaining natural resource management investment, and that there is a substantial body of evidence in favour of approaches based on the regional model.

AB  - linden m. & kavanagh r. (2012) Attitudes of qualified vs. student mental health nurses towards an individual diagnosed with schizophrenia. Journal of Advanced Nursing68(6), 1359-1368. Abstract Aim. This paper is the report of a study which sought to compare the attitudes held by student and qualified mental health nurses towards individuals with schizophrenia in the Republic of Ireland. Background. Media portrayals of individuals with schizophrenia often include images of aggression and violence. With global initiatives aimed at reducing the stigma and exclusion associated with mental illness, the attitudes of those who care for people with schizophrenia are of particular interest. Methods. A survey was administered to 66 student mental health nurses, and 121 qualified mental health nurses. Participants completed the community attitudes to mental illness scale and the social interaction scale in 2009. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to test for the effects of qualification, work setting, years of experience and education on the measures. Results. Nurses employed in a community setting held more positive attitudes, when compared with colleagues who worked in an inpatient setting, as measured by the community mental health ideology subscale, indicating their desire to promote community care for individuals with schizophrenia. Nurses working in an inpatient setting held more socially restrictive attitudes indicating that they felt individuals with schizophrenia were dangerous and should be avoided. These findings were statistically significant at the P < 0.05 level. Conclusions. Mental health nurses must be alerted to the fact that holding negative attitudes may adversely affect the therapeutic relationship and ultimately lead to stigmatization and its negative consequences.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study was twofold: first, to optimize the Environmental Attitudes Inventory (EAI) and second, to establish a baseline of the difference in environmental attitudes between first and final year students, taken at the start of a university's declaration of commitment to EfS.
   Design/methodology/approach - The psychometrically designed EAI was used to overcome the problems and limitations of the much-used, but controversial, revised New Environmental Paradigm (NEP) Scale. The performance of the original 72-item EAI was compared with our 37-item reduced form using a population of first-and final-year university students.
   Findings - The reduced 37-item EAI provides a reliable and valid tool for investigating structured, multi-dimensional environmental attitudes of university students while reducing response burden and increasing response and completion rates compared with the longer versions of the EAI.
   Research limitations/implications - No attempt is made to link elements of the university experience with changes in attitude between first-and third-year students. The authors expect the 12-faceted EAI to provide more detailed feedback on the affective outcomes of EfS initiatives than currently used instruments.
   Originality/value - This research contributes to establishing the EAI as a gold standard with which to monitor students' environmental attitudes. Although most studies aimed at understanding the impact of EfS measure attitude change over relatively short periods of time - typically using the brief NEP scale administered immediately before and after a specific semester course - the approach developed here is designed to detect attitudinal change that may be ascribed to the entire university experience between students' first and final year.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the emergence of "Roma health and wellbeing" as a focus of attention in European research and in policy and the possible detrimental consequences of action founded on a generic representation of "Roma health." Design/methodology/approach Based on discussions with and research conducted by scholars who work directly with Roma communities across European regions from a wide range of academic disciplines it suggests how future research might inform: a more nuanced understanding of the causes of poor health and wellbeing among diverse Roma populations and; actions that may have greater potential to improve the health and wellbeing among these populations. Findings In summary, the authors promote three types of research: first critical analyses that unpick the implications of current and past representations of "Roma" and "Roma health." Second, applied participatory research that meaningfully involves people from specific self-defined Roma populations to identify important issues for their health and wellbeing. Third, learning about processes that might impact on the health and wellbeing of Roma populations from research with other populations in similarly excluded situations. Originality/value The authors provide a multidisciplinary perspective to inform research that does not perpetuate further alienation and prejudice, but promotes urgent action to redress the social and health injustices experienced by diverse Roma populations across Europe.

AB  - Background: Chronic and cancer diseases are expected to rise with the growing population of the elderly in the world. Home palliative care might be a possible solution for improving these patients' quality of life; therefore, the present study sets out to investigate home care nurses' attitude towards and knowledge of home palliative care. Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study (2018-19), in which 168 home care nurses and nursing assistants in East Azerbaijan Province (Iran) were included (2018). The questionnaire used was specifically designed by Shimizu et al. in 2016 for determining the nurses' attitude towards and knowledge of home care. Data analysis was carried out using descriptive and inferential statistics (T-test and ANOVA). Results: In this study, 95 (56.60%) and 113 (67.90%) of the participants were found to have negative attitudes and limited knowledge, respectively. The other participants seemed to have neutral attitudes towards and average knowledge of home palliative care. The Mean (SD) attitude score on terminal home care was estimated 2.33 (0.83), and the knowledge score on dying care was calculated 41.76%, which were the lowest in comparison with the scores of other dimensions. Conclusions: The home care nurses' attitude towards and knowledge of home palliative care were found to be negative and limited, respectively, which underscores the need to endeavor to improve the attitude towards home care and the knowledge of dying care.

AB  - Background: Opioid agonist treatments (OAT) are widely-used, evidence-based strategies for treating opioid dependence and reducing HIV transmission. The positive benefits of OAT are strongly correlated with time spent in treatment, making retention a key indicator for program quality. This study assessed patient retention and associated factors in Ukraine, where OAT was first introduced in 2004.
   Methods: Data from clinical records of 2916 patients enrolled in OAT at thirteen sites from 2005 to 2012 were entered into an electronic monitoring system. Survival analysis methods were used to determine the probability of retention and its correlates.
   Results: Twelve-month retention was 65.8%, improving from 27.7% in 2005, to 70.9% in 2011. In multivariable analyses, the correlates of retention were receiving medium and high doses of medication (compared to low doses, dropout aHR = 0.57 for both medium and high doses), having not been tested for HIV and tuberculosis (compared to not being tested, dropout aHR = 4.44 and 3.34, respectively), and among those who were tested a negative TB test result (compared to receiving a positive test result, dropout aHR = 0.67).
   Conclusion: Retention in Ukrainian OAT programs, especially in recent years, is comparable to other countries. The results confirm the importance of adequate OAT dosing (>= 60 mg of methadone, >= 8 mg of buprenorphine). Higher dosing, however, will require interventions that address negative attitudes toward OAT by patients and providers. Interruption of OAT, in the case developing tuberculosis, should incorporate continuity of OAT for TB patients through integrated care delivery systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Previous studies of patient portals have found low rates of enrollment and significant disparities in enrollment by race and ethnicity. As the reasons for these findings are unclear, we sought to identify patient reported barriers to enrollment in a patient portal.
   Methods We conducted a telephone survey of patients in one urban general internal medicine clinic. Patients were eligible if they did not enroll within 30 days of receiving an electronic order inviting participation. Our primary outcomes were: (a) reasons for not enrolling in the patient portal; (b) reasons for not attempting enrollment; and (c) perceived benefits of the portal.
   Results Participants' (N=159) mean age was 51 years, 48% were black, 72% female, and 70% had a college degree or greater. 63% of respondents not enrolling reported never attempting enrollment despite remembering receiving an order. Most of these 63% did not attempt enrollment because of lack of information or motivation. Smaller proportions reported not attempting enrollment because of negative attitudes toward the portal (30%) or computer related obstacles (8%). Overall, respondents favorably viewed most patient portal features, however black respondents were less likely than white respondents to consider features assisting self-management such as getting test results (69% vs 86%; p<0.05) as important. Adjusting for age, gender, education, and chronic disease did not substantially change results.
   Conclusion Strategies to increase enrollment in patient portals need to ensure patients understand patient portal features and receive follow-up reminders. Interventions to reduce racial disparities in enrollment must address attitudinal barriers and not focus solely on improving access.

AB  - Background: Poor insight is associated with negative attitudes to involuntary admission and care in qualitative studies. Aims: The current paper aims to examine and compare retrospective qualitative perceptions of service-users in relation to their involuntary admission with their levels of clinical insight, using a mixed methods approach. Methods: Forty two participants were assessed 3 months after the revocation of their involuntary admission. Each provided qualitative data relating to their perceptions of the coercive care process, which was analysed using content analysis, along with a quantitative measurement of insight, the Schedule for the Assessment of Insight-Expanded (SAI-E). Employing a mixed methods design and incorporating NVivo matrix coding queries, the datasets were merged to enable qualitative themes to be identified against the quantitative data. Results: Differences were observed between those with high and low insight in terms of their understanding of the need for treatment, their levels of arousal at the time of admission and how they perceived the compassion of health professionals. Certain negative perceptions of care appeared more universal and were common across those with high and low insight. Conclusion: Some negative perceptions of coercive practices appear linked to inherent elements of psychotic illness such as unawareness of illness. Individuals with higher levels of insight tended to perceive their involuntary admission and receiving a diagnosis as beneficial. Negative views that persist amongst service users with high insight levels can highlight areas for successful service improvement, including increased emphasis on non-pharmacotherapy based supports during the coercive care process.

AB  - This article explores how computers and the Internet are represented among young, educated people in Niger and the social expectations that are attached to their use. It argues that pre-existing social and economic conditions play an important role in shaping the meanings associated with these devices. Thus, in a context of poverty and unemployment, the Internet and computers are perceived as technologies that may help young people and their country integrate into a modern world of economic opportunities and well-being via the transnational and transcultural interactions that take place in cyberspace. The Internet is associated with the ideas of modernity and 'leapfrogging' development. However, because of the lack of computer equipment and adequate infrastructure, these expectations are largely exaggerated, and they divert attention from the actual possibilities for change that reside in people and not in technological devices. The research is based on fieldwork conducted among young, educated computer and Internet users during the summers of 2003 and 2004 in Niamey, the capital city of Niger and further complemented by data collected in 2008. Semistructured interviews were used to explore the reception of the Internet and the representations associated with them. Although the term 'educated' may sometimes refer to traditional or Arabic/Islamic education in Niger, we restricted the use of the word to refer to modern western-style education (without prejudice or pejorative label to those who are not in that category).

AB  - People should use antibiotics (AB) prudently to mitigate antibiotic resistance (ABR). Previous studies-and, subsequently, interventions-on ABR have focused mainly on improving public awareness and knowledge. We investigated a comprehensive theory-based explanatory model to understand the public's decision making regarding prudent AB use, based on, among others, the theory of planned behavior. In a cross-sectional online survey, the psychological determinants of people's decisions about prudent AB use were examined in a sample of 1,228 Swiss adults. The questionnaire assessed respondents' demand for AB, willingness to adopt measures that prevent the need for AB, perceived risks of ABR, perceived benefits of AB, attitudes and social influences regarding AB, knowledge of AB and ABR, and cultural values. Mokken scale analysis revealed three types of knowledge: knowledge of the functioning of AB, of ABR, and of preventive measures. Structural equation modeling indicated that respondents' demand for AB was mostly predicted by social influences, perceived benefits of AB, and knowledge of AB functioning. Willingness to prevent AB use was mainly related to conservative values, perceived risks of ABR, negative attitudes toward AB, and knowledge of preventive measures. Our study suggests that the provision of information about AB and preventive measures is a first step toward changing people's decisions related to prudent AB use. Future interventions that additionally utilize cultural values to convey important messages and target additional factors, such as social influences, the risks of ABR, and the benefits of cautious AB use, can be more successful in promoting prudent AB use.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the psychosocial factors influencing participation in colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) among Puerto Rican men and women. We conducted seven focus groups in metropolitan and rural areas of Puerto Rico (PR) with men and women (using gender specific groups) aged 50 to 80 years (n = 51) who were non-adherent to CRC guidelines. The focus group guide included questions related to colorectal cancer (CRC) and CRC screening knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs. We analyzed data using a modified grounded theory approach to identify emergent themes. Focus groups revealed seven major themes that represented barriers to CRCS: (1) lack of CRC knowledge, (2) lack of knowledge about colorectal cancer screening tests as well as the required preparation, (3) embarrassment, (4) low perceived benefit of CRCS and sense of fatalism, (5) transportation (mostly among participants in rural areas), (6) lack of time, and (7) financial burden. All participants understood the benefits of CRCS once the procedure was explained. Additionally, participants reported a lack of provider recommendation for CRCS. In this group of Puerto Rican participants who were non-adherent to CRCS, there were misconceptions about CRC, screening tests available, and preparation and testing procedures. Participants' low levels of knowledge and negative attitudes concerning CRCS and low reported provider recommendation were important deterrents to screening. These findings suggest the need for educational efforts to increase knowledge and attitudes about CRCS and improved patient-provider communication to reduce missed opportunities to recommend.

AB  - Background and Objectives The persistent status of ageism as one of the least acknowledged forms of prejudice may be due in part to an absence of quantifying its costs in economic terms. In this study, we calculated the costs of ageism on health conditions for all persons aged 60 years or older in the United States during 1 year.
   Research Design and Materials The ageism predictors were discrimination aimed at older persons, negative age stereotypes, and negative self-perceptions of aging. Health care costs of ageism were computed by combining analyses of the impact of the predictors with comprehensive health care spending data in 1 year for the eight most-expensive health conditions, among all Americans aged 60 years or older. As a secondary analysis, we computed the number of these health conditions experienced due to ageism.
   Results It was found that the 1-year cost of ageism was $63 billion, or one of every seven dollars spent on the 8 health conditions (15.4%), after adjusting for age and sex as well as removing overlapping costs from the three predictors. Also according to our model, ageism resulted in 17.04 million cases of these health conditions.
   Discussion and Implications This is the first study to identify the economic cost that ageism imposes on health. The findings suggest that a reduction of ageism would not only have a monetary benefit for society, but also have a health benefit for older persons.

AB  - Purpose: Lung cancer is the most common malignancy and the leading cause of cancer death globally. Lung cancer incidence and mortality are highest among socioeconomically deprived individuals. This study explored awareness and help-seeking for early signs and symptoms of lung cancer among high-risk individuals. Methods: Participation was sought from multiple community centres and organisations in high-incidence and socioeconomically deprived areas in Ireland. Semi-structured focus groups were conducted with individuals at risk for lung cancer. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Five focus groups were conducted with 46 participants. Two themes were identified: (i) lung cancer awareness, beliefs, and experiences and (ii) help-seeking for early signs and symptoms of lung cancer. Participants had fragmented knowledge of lung cancer and associated this malignancy with death. Symptom change, persistence, seriousness, and family history of lung cancer served as triggers to help-seeking. General practitioners were identified as the first point of contact for symptoms of concern, yet their presumed negative attitudes towards smokers served as barriers to help-seeking. Other barriers included symptom misappraisal, fear, denial, use of self-help measures, being inherently a non-help seeker, and machoism and stoicism among men. Conclusion: Study findings offer guidance regarding lung cancer knowledge gaps and barriers to help-seeking that ought to be considered in public health interventions aimed to promote lung cancer awareness and early detection. Clinical implications: This study highlights the need for healthcare professionals to adopt a non-judgmental approach during consults for symptoms indicative of lung cancer. This can potentially help detect lung cancer early.

AB  - We estimated the prevalence of sexual violence (SV) experience among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Brazil and identified its associated risk factors. We recruited 3859 MSM through respondent driven sampling. A multivariable hierarchical analysis was performed using an ecological model. The prevalence of having ever experienced SV was 15.9 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 14.7-17.1). SV experience was independently associated with discrimination due to sexual orientation (odds ratio [OR] 3.05; 95 % CI 2.10-4.42), prior HIV testing (OR 1.81; 95 % CI 1.25-2.63), a parts per thousand currency sign14 years at first sex (OR 1.86; 95 % CI 1.28-2.71), first sex with a man (OR 1.89; 95 % CI 1.28-2.79), presenting STI symptoms (last year) (OR 1.66; 95 % CI 1.12-2.47), and having suicidal ideas (last 6 months) (OR 2.08; 95 % CI 1.30-3.35). The high levels of SV against MSM in Brazil place them at a markedly higher risk of SV than the general population. Homophobic prejudice is the strongest determinant of SV and urgently needs to be included at the forefront of the national response to SV.

AB  - Research Highlights and Abstract
   The article explores attitudes to New Labour in particular and politics in general through analysing their dramatization on TV.
   It indicates that such dramatizations are almost wholly negative, focusing on sleaze, spin and betrayal.
   The article explains the character of such dramas as being the result of the producers ' desire to present politics in terms their audiences will accept.
   It suggests that, as a consequence, popular hostility to politics is reinforced by television drama and so indicates that culture has an independent part to play in this process.
   Echoing Plato's banishment of artists, mainstream political scientists have excluded serious consideration of art from their discipline. Yet, there are grounds for believing that it can help address what Gerry Stoker suggests is one of social science's greatest failings: understanding 'what politics means to citizens'. This study of New Labour's television dramatization suggests it can help political scientists better appreciate the dynamics underpinning the much-noted decline of popular trust in representative politics. It looks at the reasons for the narrowing of the public's picture of politics by focusing on the changing production context for television drama during the New Labour period, something that led it to emphasise 'sleaze'. The article suggests such dramas consequently helped make more credible the public's pre-existing prejudices about what they supposed was the corrupt nature of Britain's political class.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors driving the adoption of "green innovations" notably green food and certified organic food and to examine the attitudes of Chinese consumers towards genetically modified food.
   Design/methodology/approach - A mixed methods approach was used. A total of 402 consumers responded to a structured questionnaire and 58 consumers responded to a survey designed to gather qualitative data. Data analysis involved content analysis, the probit model, frequency distributions and the t-test for two unrelated means.
   Findings - This study shows that affluent, middle class Chinese citizens are opting out of the conventional food market. There is a gender divide, with men showing a preference for green food and females showing a preference for certified organic food. Certified food purchase is associated with demographic variables, such as income, education, age, gender, presence of young children, household size, living in developed cities and overseas experience. A follow-up study shows that the absence of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) motivates the purchase of organic food. Overall, the results suggest that Chinese consumers are turning towards certified food for health reasons and are sceptical about genetic modification (GM) food.
   Research limitations/implications - This paper provides some insights into how Chinese consumers view innovations in the food sector. The study found that almost half of the sample is unaware that the concept of green food is different to that of organic food. The priority for the certified organic industry is to address this lack of knowledge and clearly explain what certified organic food is and how it differs from green food. Small-scale farmers could use consumer aversion to GMOs as a promotional tool. The ultimate goal of this paper is to help marketers better promote certified organic food, but inferences can be drawn in terms of Chinese sustainable consumption. Negative attitudes towards genetically modified foods exist due to human health concerns. Hence, Chinese policy makers need to confront these perceptions, real or perceived, if they wish to maintain public trust in biotechnology.
   Practical implications - Based on the qualitative data, stressing the GM-free status is likely to enhance sales since there appears to be a segment of consumers that distrusts GM technology.
   Originality/value - The contribution of this research lies in examining what drives the adoption of "green innovations", notably green food and certified organic food in China. This research is important given that little is known about what Chinese consumers think of, and how they react to, innovations in the agro-food value chain.

AB  - Crimea and the City of Sevastopol justifiably separated from Ukraine and reunified with the Russian Federation in 2014. Support for this proposition is found in historic, economic, and political reasoning. Extant principles of public international law, derived from the Treaty of Westphalia, and subsequently developed by Great Powers to facilitate their strategic interests, when applied to the Crimean/Russian reunification, produce absurd results: nailing a population to a cross of misery, oppression, and poverty. In addition, the principles invoked are underdeveloped, prejudiced toward Nation States holding the imprimatur of "Great Powers," and ignore individual and population preferences. Moreover, scholarly and jurist analyses repose upon an edifice of incomplete facts, and ignore the 1991 illegal annexation of Crimea by Ukraine. Crimea suffered twenty- three years of economic rot under Ukrainian rule. Under the Russian Federation, economic conditions in the peninsula are improving, despite the US/EU sanctions imposed upon the Crimean population, a cruelty that the Great Powers cannot justify. Exceptional circumstances that took place in Ukraine in 2013/14 permitted scheduling a referendum to seek independence from Ukraine. Polls taken after the 2014 referendum unanimously demonstrate that the population of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol prefer reunification with the Russian Federation, as opposed to going back and becoming a subject of Ukraine rule and exploitation under a US installed right wing regime. Repeated calls to "give back" Crimea to Ukraine are based on twisted historical narratives, solely designed to weaken the Russian Federation.

AB  - Background: Prescription opioid use disorder and overdose have risen substantially in the U.S. Primary care physicians are critical to many ongoing and proposed efforts to address the prescription opioid epidemic. Yet, little is known about their attitudes and beliefs surrounding this issue. This study aimed to determine primary care physicians' perceptions of the seriousness of the problem, its causes, groups responsible for addressing it, attitudes toward individuals with prescription opioid use disorder, beliefs about the effectiveness of addiction treatments, and support for various policies.
   Methods: We conducted a national web-based survey in 2014 among 1010 primary care physicians. We gauged responses to attitude and belief items on 7-point Likert scales. We examined the proportion agreeing with each statement, and whether responses differed among physicians prescribing higher and lower volumes of opioids.
   Results: Respondents largely attributed the causes of prescription opioid use disorder to individual oriented factors and certain physician-oriented factors, and believed that individuals with prescription opioid use disorder and physicians were primarily responsible for addressing the problem. Negative attitudes toward people with prescription opioid use disorder were prevalent, but a majority believed that treatment could be effective. There was majority support for all measured policies, with the highest levels of support for policies to monitor prescribing among patients potentially at risk for an opioid use disorder and to improve physician education and training.
   Conclusions: Given strong endorsement of recommended policies, physician support could be leveraged to advance efforts to curb prescription opioid use disorder and overdose. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, organizations have expanded the number and types of work-life policies they offer in an attempt to attract and retain talent. We challenge the assumption that work-life policies uniformly signal personal-life support and elicit favorable employee attitudes by investigating a relatively new work-life policy: egg freezing coverage. We theorize that, relative to other work-life policies, egg freezing coverage is more likely to send signals that evoke negative employee attitudes; although framed as intended to support employees' personal lives, employees interpret egg freezing as signaling that personal-life sacrifice and work prioritization are encouraged, which in turn decrease policy support and organizational attraction. We test these ideas in six studies, including an archival study, a qualitative survey study, a scale development study, two quantitative survey studies, and an experiment. We find egg freezing coverage evokes more negative attitudes than a range of other work-life policies (in vitro fertilization [IVF], on-site childcare, paid parental leave, flextime) as well as no policy at all. More negative reactions to egg freezing than to other policies are driven by perceptions that the policy sends a stronger signal that personal-life sacrifice is encouraged, as well as perceptions that it offers fewer benefits to employees and is more costly to organizations. In all, this work expands understanding of the signaling effects of work-life policies and demonstrates that reactions to a range of work-life policies are both more variable and driven by a larger number of underlying factors than prior theory can account for.

AB  - Objective: With obesity being a major public health epidemic, dietitians are charged with the difficult task to assist clients in modifying their behaviours. Since there are inconsistent data about dietitians' beliefs, attitudes and practices concerning obesity and little is known concerning differences in public and private practice, we conducted the present study to address those gaps. Design: Semi-structured interviews analysed according to thematic analysis procedures.
   Setting: Public primary-care and private settings.
   Subjects: Seventeen Portuguese registered dietitians working in public primary-care (n 10) and private settings (n 7).
   Results: Regardless of work context,'persistence of efforts' emerged as the main characteristic of dietitians' action. Besides holding negative attitudes towards obese patients, their practices are not negatively influenced. They perceive themselves as active agents in promoting lifestyle changes, offering as many management strategies as possible to empower patients, feeling positive about the accomplishment of a successful weight loss, believing in their own efficacy and competency in helping patients. However, differences in reimbursement, work environment, perceived barriers, patient characteristics and availability of resources seem to contribute to differences in persistence according to the setting in which dietitians are working, evidenced by an increase of efforts and engagement in private practice and a decrease in public primary-care practice.
   Conclusions: Portuguese dietitians present a positive mindset and actions about obesity treatment outcomes; however, education in behaviour change strategies should be improved. The public health system requires reorganization to enhance effective obesity management delivery. Motivation driving dietitians' work in private settings should be addressed.

AB  - Detecting various attacks and abnormal traffic in the network is extremely important to network security. Existing detection models used massive amounts of data to complete abnormal traffic detection. However, few-shot attack samples can only be intercepted in certain special scenarios. In addition, the discrimination of traffic attributes will also be affected by the change of feature attitude. But the traditional neural network model cannot detect this kind of attitude change. Therefore, the accuracy and efficiency of few-shot sample abnormal traffic detection are very low. In this paper, we proposed a few-shot abnormal network traffic detection method. It was composed of the multi-scale Deep-CapsNet and adversarial reconstruction. First, we designed an improved EM vector clustering of the Deep-CapsNet. The attitude transformation matrix was used to complete the prediction from low-level to high-level features. Second, a multi-scale convolutional capsule was designed to optimize the Deep-CapsNet. Third, an adversarial reconstruction classification network (ARCN) was proposed. The supervised source data classification and the unsupervised target data reconstruction were achieved. Moreover, we proposed an adversarial training strategy, which alleviated the noise interference during reconstruction. Fourth, the few-shot sample classification were obtained by combining multi-scale Deep-CapsNet and adversarial reconstruction. The ICSX2012 and CICIDS2017 datasets were used to verify the performance. The experimental results show that our method has better training performance. Moreover, it has the highest accuracy in two-classification and multi-classification. Especially it has good anti-noise performance and short running time, which can be used for real-time few-shot abnormal network traffic detection.

AB  - Introduction: There is very little insight into the psychosocial characteristics of young adults susceptible to waterpipe tobacco use and their reactions to messages about harms of waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS). We investigated how young adults who were or were not susceptible to WTS differed on various characteristics and their reactions to messages about WTS harms.
   Methods: Young adults ages 18 to 30 who had never used waterpipe tobacco were recruited through an online crowdsourcing site. Participants were stratified on susceptibility status (susceptible or not) and randomized to receive messages about harms and addictiveness of WTS or a control condition that received no messages. Participants' perceptions of risk and worry, their attitudes toward, and willingness/curiosity to try WTS were assessed.
   Results: Compared to nonsusceptible participants, susceptible participants perceived themselves to be at lower risk and worried less about harms and addictiveness of WTS, had more positive attitudes toward use, and expressed a greater willingness and curiosity to try it. Among susceptible participants, messages decreased willingness/curiosity to try WTS; messages had no effect on nonsusceptible participants. The message effects among susceptible participants were explained by more negative attitudes and less ambivalence toward WTS.
   Conclusions: Susceptible young adults' psychosocial characteristics place them at high risk for future uptake of WTS. Brief public health messages about harm and addiction may deter susceptible young adults' willingness to try WTS and prevent WTS initiation and progression.
   Implications: Findings suggest that in order to curb the initiation of WTS among susceptible young adults, interventions should target risk appraisals and attitudes toward WTS.

AB  - Purpose This research study looks at issues such as why does incivility occur, dynamics responsible for incivility with an emphasis on causes stimulated by the general context and its influence on the behavior of individuals, groups and organizations. Design/methodology/approach This paper provides a fresh perspective on workplace incivility by integrating institutional theory with empirical data from two case studies from academic institutions located in different continents to understand incivility in organizations. A comparative case analysis across two different geographical regions is used to validate the argument that institutional antecedents can influence micro-level organizational events such as employee incivility despite variance in geographical locations and cultural dimensions. Findings The findings of the study reveal that academic institutions are subject to uncivil behaviors, which could be a direct offshoot of the historical and cultural beliefs of the society. The general context of the studied cases led to workplace incivility mainly in the form of racial prejudices and sectarianism transferred to the organizational day-to-day practice. The paper suggests a pragmatic view for possible interventions to humanize workplaces where it is better not to adopt a "one size fits all" recipe to deal with such a complex phenomenon. Originality/value This paper provides a macro-level analysis of workplace incivility by assuming an institutional perspective to explore the relationships if any between incivility experienced by employees within an organization and the wider political and historical structuration of the society.

AB  - One of the most important features of comprehensive land use and transport planning is an ability to identify candidate projects and policies that are adding value to the sustainable performance of transport networks and to the economy as a whole. Standard methods of identifying a shortlist of projects to assess are often qualitative in nature and/or influenced by prejudices of elected officials or their advisers without a systematic way of narrowing the many potential options to evaluate, in sufficient detail, a truly value-adding set. There is a case to be made for having a capability to undertake, in a timely manner, a scan of a large number of potentially worthy projects and policies that can offer forecasts of passenger and freight demand, benefit-costs ratios and economy-wide outcomes. Such a framework would then be meaningful in the sense of offering outputs that are similar to those that are the focus of assessments that are typically spread over many months, if not years, on very few projects, which may exclude those which have the greatest merit. This paper introduces MetroScan, a strategic-level transport and land use planning application system that allows for mapping of passenger and freight activity, as well as an endogenous treatment of the location of households and firms. We summarise the analytical framework of MetroScan and show its capability (including the many useful outputs) with a case study for a 25 percent reduction in public transport fares across the entire network.

AB  - Objectives: Subjective nearness to death (SNtD), or individuals' subjective evaluation of how close they are to death, has been demonstrated to be an important predictor for different aspects of the individual's aging process across the life cycle. However, the relationship between SNtD and anxieties linked with the aging process has not been examined among individuals who may be in the initial stages of experiencing the first physical and cognitive signs of aging. Thus, this study examined the association between SNtD and aging, dying, and death anxieties. Moreover, the role of ageism, or negative attitudes toward older adults, as a moderator for these perceptions regarding the end of life has not been addressed. Moreover, we examined whether ageism serves as a moderator for the aforementioned association.Method: A convenience sample of 1146 Israeli participants, ranging in age from 45 to 65, filled out scales assessing SNtD, aging anxiety, dying anxiety, death anxiety, and ageism.Results: High levels of SNtD were positively associated with aging, dying, and death anxieties. Moreover, there was a positive association between ageism and the three end-of-life anxieties. Significant interactions demonstrated the moderating effect of ageism for the relationship between SNtD and both aging and dying anxieties, but not for death anxiety.Conclusion: SNtD is an important construct, which is connected to various perceptions and anxieties concerning the aging and dying processes. Moreover, while high ageism mitigates the positive association between SNtD and certain anxieties, the role of ageism is more complicated, and its negative aspects are discussed.

AB  - As a social identity, religion is unique because it contains a spectrum of choice. In some religious communities, individuals are considered members by virtue of having parents of that background, and religion, culture, and ethnicity are closely intertwined. Other faith communities actively invite people of other backgrounds to join, expecting individuals to choose the religion that best fits their personal beliefs. These various methods of identification influence beliefs about the essentialist nature of religious identity. Essentialism is when social groups are considered to have deep, immutable, and inherent defining properties. In this study, college students (N = 55) provided ratings of essentialism for eight religious identities: Atheist, Buddhist, Catholic, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Protestant, and Spiritual-but-not-religious. Significant differences in essentialism were found between the target groups. Results and implications for intergroup relations are discussed.

AB  - Previous research has shown that face masks impair the ability to perceive social information and the readability of emotions. These studies mostly explored the effect of standard medical, often white, masks on emotion recognition. However, in reality, many individuals prefer masks with different styles. We investigated whether the appearance of the mask (pattern: angular vs. curvy and color: black vs. white) affected the recognition of emotional states. Participants were asked to identify the emotions on faces covered by masks with different designs. The presence of masks resulted in decreasing accuracy and confidence and increasing reaction times, indicating that masks impair emotion recognition. There were no significant effects of angularity versus curvature or color on emotion recognition, which suggests that mask design may not impair the recognition beyond the effect of mere mask wearing. Besides, we found relationships between individual difference variables such as mask wearing attitudes, mask design preferences, individual traits and emotion recognition. The majority of participants demonstrated positive attitudes toward mask wearing and preferred non-patterned black and white masks. Preferences for white masks were associated with better emotion recognition of masked faces. In contrast, those with negative attitudes toward masks showed marginally poorer performance in emotion recognition for masked faces, and preferred patterned more than plain masks, perhaps viewing masks as a fashion item rather than a necessity. Moreover, preferences to wear patterned masks were negatively related to actual wearing of masks indoors and perceived risks of COVID.

AB  - Video games often contain sexist content that may be connected to negative consequences for female video game players, such as internalizing negative attitudes and beliefs about women. However, aspects of feminist identification may prevent such negative outcomes from occurring. The present study investigated the relationships among time spent playing video games, internalized misogyny, and the synthesis dimension of feminist identity, which is characterized by embracing the positive aspects of being a woman and incorporating feminine attributes into one's own unique personality. A total of 319 U.S. female video game players completed measures of media usage, internalized misogyny, and feminist identity. The authors tested a moderation model in which gaming predicted internalized misogyny and synthesis moderated this relationship. Gaming was positively associated with internalized misogyny at lower, but not higher, levels of synthesis. Thus, those who value the positive aspects of womanhood and have thoughtful and realistic perceptions of gender may be resistant to internalizing some harmful beliefs about women perpetuated in games. The present study provides evidence for the potential negative influence of cumulative video game exposure for some women and the protective effect of feminist identity synthesis. Counselors and activists should do work aimed at critically evaluating and challenging gendered messages in video games and affirming women's gender identities and feminine attributes. Game developers must consider the impact of their content on players and strive to create female characters that are agentic, complex, and competent. Conversely, gamers should avoid supporting games with depthless depictions of women.

AB  - Although stereotype awareness is a prerequisite for stereotype threat effects (Steele & Aronson, 1995), research showed girls' deficit under stereotype threat before the emergence of math-gender stereotype awareness, and in the absence of stereotype endorsement. In a study including 240 six-year-old children, this paradox was addressed by testing whether automatic associations trigger stereotype threat in young girls. Whereas no indicators were found that children endorsed the math-gender stereotype, girls, but not boys, showed automatic associations consistent with the stereotype. Moreover, results showed that girls' automatic associations varied as a function of a manipulation regarding the stereotype content. Importantly, girls' math performance decreased in a stereotype-consistent, relative to a stereotype-inconsistent, condition and automatic associations mediated the relation between stereotype threat and performance.

AB  - Purpose Blockchain is an evolving technology that has an impact on a variety of industries and related operations including food supply chain. There are several challenges associated in the implementation of blockchain in the food supply chain. As a result, the goal of this research is to identify and analyse the barriers associated with the implementation of blockchain in food supply chains. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive literature review is conducted to identify 16 primary barriers associated with the implementation of blockchain technology in the food supply chain and experts finalise these identified barriers and further categorise them into four groups. Furthermore, the best worst method is used to prioritise the finalised barriers. Findings The findings suggest that "technological barriers" and "organisational barriers" are primary barriers among the identified barriers for the implementation of blockchain. These barriers could be mitigated through supply chain collaboration, efficient blockchain technology development through research and development, and increasing technical competence. Research limitations/implications In terms of limitation, there is a possibility that some barriers were overlooked in the literature review process, and expert judgement might be prejudiced. This paper examines the blockchain implementation in the food supply chain, to assist policymakers in overcoming these barriers and ensuring effective adoption. Originality/value This study focuses on the effective implementation of blockchain technology in the food supply chain in the context of emerging economies.

AB  - The morphologies of biological materials, from body shapes to membranes within cells, are typically curvaceous and flexible, in contrast to the angular, facetted shapes of inorganic matter. An alternative dichotomy has it that bio-molecules typically assemble into aperiodic structures in vivo, in contrast to inorganic crystals. This paper explores the evolution of our understanding of structures across the spectrum of materials, from living to inanimate, driven by those naive beliefs, with particular focus on the development of crystallography in materials science and biology. The idea that there is a clear distinction between these two classes of matter has waxed and waned in popularity through past centuries. Our current understanding, driven largely by detailed exploration of biomolecular structures at the sub-cellular level initiated by Bernal and Astbury in the 1930s, and more recent explorations of sterile soft matter, makes it clear that this is a false dichotomy. For example, liquid crystals and other soft materials are common to both living and inanimate materials. The older picture of disjoint universes of forms is better understood as a continuum of forms, with significant overlap and common features unifying biological and inorganic matter. In addition to the philosophical relevance of this perspective, there are important ramifications for science. For example, the debates surrounding extra-terrestrial life, the oldest terrestrial fossils and consequent dating of the emergence of life on the Earth rests to some degree on prejudices inferred from the supposed dichotomy between life-forms and the rest.

AB  - Purpose
   Early diagnosis and an improved survival rate have emerged as important issues for cancer survivors returning to work during the prime of their working life. This study investigated the attitudes of the general public towards cancer survivors returning to work in Korea and attempted to identify the factors influencing this negative attitude.
   Materials and Methods
   A general public perception survey regarding cancer survivors returning to work, targeting 2,000 Individuals between 40-70 years of age, was conducted as face-to-face home visit.
   Results
   The public expressed a negative attitude towards cancer survivors returning to work, in terms of both perception and acceptance. Negative perception was higher among those in metropolitan areas compared with urban/rural areas (odds ratio [OR], 1.71), with monthly incomes < $2,000 compared with > $4,000 (OR, 1.54), and with patient care experience compared with those without (OR, 1.41). Negative acceptance was higher among those with monthly incomes < $2,000 compared with > $4,000 (OR, 1.71) and those with patient care experience compared with those without (OR, 1.54). The common factors between acceptance and perception that influenced negative attitude included area of residence, patient care experience, and monthly income.
   Conclusion
   This study identified negative attitudes towards cancer survivors returning to work in South Korea and the factors influencing the reintegration of cancer survivors into society. It is necessary to promote community awareness and intervention activities to enable access to community, social, and individual units for the social reintegration of cancer survivors.

AB  - Providers suspect malingering when patients seek compensation for injury or when pain is unconfirmed via objective evidence, judged disproportionate to the cause, or recalcitrant to treatment. Suspicions or claims of malingering may prejudice treatment or reimbursement decisions. The purpose of this archival study was to identify malingering in a predominantly Hispanic workers' compensation population seeking treatment for pain. We used a correlational archival research design to collect data from the medical records of 91 patients treated over a 10-year period in a specialty clinic. Inclusion criteria included individuals with psychologic evaluation for persistent pain that affected function. Using a priori power analysis for a medium effect size, power of .80, and alpha of .05, data from 85 medical records were necessary to meet correlational significance. The study sample reflects the ethnicity, educational level, and socioeconomic status of the larger U.S.-Mexico border community. The majority (93%) had workers' compensation and about one-third had active litigation. No one was diagnosed with malingering or pain disorder with primarily psychologic origins. Depression coexisted with chronic pain, and patients reported serious impairment in physical, occupational, and social function an average of 5 years after the onset of chronic pain. However, the vast majority of patients returned to work. In our experience, there is no place for the labeling and resultant stigma of malingering in chronic pain sufferers.

AB  - The years following the 2008 global recession saw many liberal-democratic states respond to the economic crisis by introducing austerity policies. In turn, this provoked widespread dissent and social movement activism involving large numbers of young people. In response, governments of many different political persuasions moved to suppress these actions by criminalizing political dissent. The article inquiries into state and institutional moves to suppress social movement activism like the 'Maple Spring' student strikes in Quebec, Canada, and the Indignados movement in Spain. While Canada can be described as a 'mature liberal-democracy' and Spain might be better described as an 'emergent liberal-democracy', both criminalized young people exercising their democratic and constitutionally guaranteed rights to free expression and assembly by engaging in various forms of political protests. While some of this can be explained by reference to contradictions inherent in liberal democracies, we consider if it also reflects certain long-standing prejudices directed at young people. Young people have traditionally attracted disproportionate attention from police and legal systems when they are involved in 'conventional' criminal conduct. What role if any did the 'youthful' face of protest play in government moves to criminalize dissent in 2011-12? An account of the 'civilizing offensive' highlights the influence of ageist assumptions that 'young people' require close management. This provides some insight into state responses to young people's engagement in politics when it goes beyond the conventional mode of 'youth participation' prescribed by states committed to managing electoral party politics.

AB  - Purpose: Research linking family rejection and health outcomes in sexual minority people is mostly limited to North America. We assessed the associations between negative treatment by family members and depressive symptoms, life satisfaction, suicidality, and tobacco/alcohol use in sexual minority women (SMW) in Viet Nam. Methods: Data were from an anonymous internet survey (n=1936). Latent class analysis characterized patterns of negative treatment by family members experienced by respondents. Latent class with distal outcome modeling was used to regress depressive symptoms, life satisfaction, suicidality, and tobacco/alcohol use on family treatment class, controlling for predictors of family treatment and for two other types of sexual prejudice. Results: Five latent family treatment classes were extracted, including four negative classes representing varying patterns of negative family treatment. Overall, more than one negative class predicted lower life satisfaction, more depressive symptoms, and higher odds of attempted suicide (relative to the non-negative class), supporting the minority stress hypothesis that negative family treatment is predictive of poorer outcomes. Only the most negative class had elevated alcohol use. The association between family treatment and smoking status was not statistically significant. The most negative class, unexpectedly, did not have the highest odds of having attempted suicide, raising a question about survivor bias. Conclusion: This population requires public health attention, with emphasis placed on interventions targeting the family to promote acceptance and to prevent negative treatment, and interventions supporting those SMW who encounter the worst types of negative family treatment.

AB  - Objectives: Although a wide literature details the psychological impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosis, it predates the introduction of effective treatment for HIV (i.e. anti-retroviral therapies, ARTs). This article explores the psychological impact of HIV diagnosis in post-ART accounts. This is important, given the recent policy developments which focus upon increasing HIV testing and thus diagnoses.
   Design: This study presents a qualitative exploration of the experiential accounts of HIV-positive gay men living in Scotland. A total of 14 HIV-positive gay men took part in open-ended interviews.
   Methods: Interpretative phenomenological analysis was employed to identify recurrent themes across the interviews.
   Results: Our analysis focuses upon the participants' struggles in adjusting to their HIV status. Diagnosis was a deeply shocking and unexpected experience. Stigma and fear of prejudice dominated their accounts. HIV was understood, variously, as a shameful, fatal and life-changing condition. Overall, within these accounts there was little sense of HIV normalisation.
   Conclusions: In Scotland, where HIV prevalence is low, and where no accessible HIV-positive sub-culture exists, there is on-going psychological distress and morbidity amongst gay men testing HIV positive. As HIV-related policy increasingly focuses on increasing rates of antibody testing, there is a need to reduce the psychosocial costs associated with HIV-positive diagnoses.

AB  - Political affiliation, racial attitudes, and opioid stigma influence public support for public health responses to address opioid use disorders (OUD). Prior studies suggest public perceptions of the opioid epidemic are less racialized and less politically polarized than were public perceptions of the crack cocaine epidemic. Analyzing a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample (n = 1161 U.S. adults) from the October 2020 AmeriSpeak survey, we explored how political affiliation, racial attitudes (as captured in the Color-Blind Racial Attitudes Scale [CoBRAS]), and OUD stigma were associated with respondents' expressed views regarding four critical domains. Respondents with unfavorable attitudes towards Black Americans were less likely to support expanding Medicaid funding, increasing government spending to provide services for people living with OUD, and distributing naloxone for overdose prevention. Democratic Party affiliation was associated with greater support for all three of the above measures, and increased support for mandatory treatment, which may be seen as a substitute for more punitive interventions. Black respondents were also less likely to support expanding Medicaid funding, increasing government spending to provide services for people living with OUD, and of distributing naloxone. Our finding suggest that negative attitudes towards African-Americans and political differences remain important factors of public opinion on responding to the OUD epidemic, even after controlling for opioid stigma. Our findings also suggest that culturally-competent dialogue within politically conservative and Black communities may be important to engage public support for evidence-informed treatment and prevention.

AB  - The evidence is now overwhelming that discrimination negatively impacts both the physical and mental health of minority groups. Members of multiple-minority groups, such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer people of color (LGBTQ-POC), are more likely to be exposed to experiences of stigmatization, discrimination, and fear of rejection. However, whether the stress of having these unfavorable experiences translates into increased risk for negative health outcomes is unanswered by the literature. Research to date attempts to address the relationship of stress as a minority and health outcomes through examining the role of microaggressions, exploring the concepts of risk and resilience, and most notably the creation of the minority stress model. The model analyzes the complex relationship between external (discrimination/prejudice) and internal (self-doubt/rumination) stressors that shape the experience of multiple-minority groups, which helps us understand the lived experiences of LGBTQ-POC. LGBTQ-POC are adversely affected by cumulative discrimination and social exclusion, including racism from the LGBTQ community, and homophobia and heterosexism within their racial/ethnic community. In this way, they are a multiply marginalized group, which has implications not only for their risk of mental illness, but also for their access to mental health care, and the quality of care they receive. Using the minority stress model as a frame of reference, we will discuss current approaches to capturing the toll that stress as an LGBTQ-POC has on mental health consequences.

AB  - ObjectiveThe Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory [EPSI; Forbush KT, Wildes JE, Pollack LO, Dunbar D, Luo J, Patterson K, et al. Development and validation of the EPSI. Psychological Assessment, in press] is an empirically derived self-report measure of eating disorder (ED) symptoms. The EPSI is able to capture the majority of variance associated with established ED measures, yet possesses additional content that is not currently represented in any existing multidimensional ED measure. The purpose of this study was to present normative and psychometric data for the EPSI in a large sample of college men (N=502) and women (N=625).
   MethodParticipants completed the EPSI and a battery of self-report measures to evaluate convergent and discriminant validity. To provide context as to how normative scores compare to ED psychopathology, undergraduate student scores were compared to scores from individuals with EDs (N=150).
   ResultsConfirmatory factor analyses indicated that the EPSI had a robust eight-factor structure that was replicated in both men and women. Mean scores for most scales were significantly higher in women, except for Excessive Exercise, Muscle Building, and Negative Attitudes toward Obesity, which were significantly higher in men. Most scale scores were significantly lower in college students than in patients with EDs. Results indicated excellent convergent and discriminant validity in both genders.
   DiscussionThese data provide the first large-scale normative data for the EPSI in young adults, as well as additional evidence supporting the psychometric properties and construct validity of the EPSI. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. (Int J Eat Disord 2014; 47:85-91)

AB  - Overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic requires motivating the vast majority of Americans to get vaccinated. However, vaccination rates have become politically polarized, and a substantial proportion of Republicans have remained vaccine hesitant for months. Here, we explore how endorsements by party elites affect Republicans' COVID-19 vaccination intentions and attitudes. In a preregistered survey experiment (n = 1,480), we varied whether self-identified Republicans saw endorsements of the vaccine from prominent Republicans (including video of a speech by former President Donald Trump), from the Democratic Party (including video of a speech by President Joseph Biden), or a neutral control condition including no endorsements. Unvaccinated Republicans who were exposed to the Republican elite endorsement reported 7.0% higher vaccination intentions than those who viewed the Democratic elite endorsement and 5.7% higher than those in the neutral control condition. These effects were statistically mediated by participants' reports of how much they thought Republican politicians would want them to get vaccinated. We also found evidence of backlash effects against Democratic elites: Republicans who viewed the Democratic elite endorsement reported they would be significantly less likely to encourage others to vaccinate and had more negative attitudes toward the vaccine, compared with those who viewed the Republican elite endorsement or the neutral control. These results demonstrate the relative advantage of cues from Republican elites-and the risks of messaging from Democrats currently in power-for promoting vaccination among the largest vaccine-hesitant subgroup in the United States.

AB  - Smoking cessation remains a health promotion target. Applying the Transtheoretical Model to Australian Burden of Obstructive Lung Diseases (BOLD) data, we examined differences in stages of change (SoC) and readiness to quit decisional behaviours. Factors were identified likely to influence readiness of smokers, >= 40 years old, to quit. Analysis was restricted to current smokers classified to one of three stages: pre-contemplation (PC), contemplation (C) or preparation (P) to quit. Their ability to balance positive and negative consequences was measured using decisional balance. Among 314 smokers, 43.0% females and 60.8% overweight/obese, the distribution of SoC was: 38.1% PC, 38.3% C and 23.5% P. Overweight/obesity was associated with readiness to quit in stages C and P and there were more negative than positive attitudes towards smoking in those stages. Males were significantly heavier smokers in PC and C stages. Females used smoking cessation medication more frequently in PC stage, were more embarrassed about smoking and had greater negative reinforcements from smoking. Age started smoking and factors related to smoking history were associated with readiness to quit and increased the odds of being in stage C or P. An overweight/obese smoker was likely to be contemplating or preparing to quit. In these stages, smokers have more negative attitudes toward smoking. Starting smoking later, taking advice on cessation from health providers and using quit medications indicate increased readiness to quit. Evaluating these factors in smokers and developing cessation gain-framed messages may prove useful to healthcare providers.

AB  - Recent evidence indicates that homosexuals and bisexuals are, on average, at greater risk for psychiatric problems than heterosexuals. It is assumed with some supporting evidence that prejudice often experienced by nonheterosexuals makes them more vulnerable to psychiatric disorder, but there has been no investigation of alternative explanations. Here we used Eysenck's Neuroticism and Psychoticism scales as markers for psychiatric vulnerability and compared heterosexuals with nonheterosexuals in a community-based sample of identical and nonidentical twins aged between 19 and 52 years (N = 4904). Firstly, we tested whether apparent sexual orientation differences in psychiatric vulnerability simply mirrored sex differences-for our traits, this would predict nonheterosexual males having elevated Neuroticism scores as females do, and nonheterosexual females having elevated Psychoticism scores as males do. Our results contradicted this idea, with nonheterosexual men and women scoring significantly higher on Neuroticism and Psychoticism than their heterosexual counterparts, suggesting an overall elevation of psychiatric risk in nonheterosexuals. Secondly, we used our genetically informative sample to assess the viability of explanations invoking a common cause of both nonheterosexuality and psychiatric vulnerability. We found significant genetic correlation between sexual orientation and both Neuroticism and Psychoticism, but no corresponding environmental correlations, suggesting that if there is a common cause of both nonheterosexuality and psychiatric vulnerability it is likely to have a genetic basis rather than an environmental basis.

AB  - Bisexual people experience unique psychosocial vulnerabilities and their mental health needs and social identity remain underserved and understudied, respectively. We report results from a latent profile analysis where we identified a preliminary typology of bisexual identity subgroups and its association with demographic and mental health variables. Bisexual+ adults (N=292) residing in the U.S. were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk and administered a demographic survey, indicators of bisexual identity, and measures of internalizing symptoms and self-esteem. Joint consideration of statistical and substantive criteria in the modeling process yielded a well-differentiated and qualitatively distinctive three-profile solution comprised of Affirmative (e.g., having a positive orientation towards one's bisexuality), Vigilant (e.g., being significantly concerned about others' reactions to one's bisexuality), and Ambivalent (e.g., endorsing mixed but generally negative attitudes and beliefs about one's bisexuality) profiles of bisexual identity. Auxiliary analyses revealed conceptually and statistically significant associations among profile membership, demographic covariates, and mental health outcomes. Some key findings included that compared to the Affirmative profile, men and people of color were overrepresented in the Ambivalent profile, whereas men were overrepresented in the Vigilant profile. Bisexuals with a Vigilant profile displayed the poorest mental health constellation. Our findings highlight the categorically heterogeneous nature of bisexual identity, support the relevance of social identity to mental health among bisexuals, and represent the first attempt to model bisexual identity using mixture techniques. Future studies should consider larger and more demographically diverse samples, address replicability and generalizability, examine additional auxiliary variables, and investigate longitudinal developments in profiles.

AB  - Background Breast cancer incidence is increasing in Vietnam with studies indicating low levels of knowledge and awareness and late presentation. While there is a growing body of literature on challenges faced by women in accessing breast cancer services, and for delivering care, no studies have sought to analyse breast cancer messaging in the Vietnamese popular media. The aim of this study was to investigate and understand the content of messages concerning breast cancer in online Vietnamese newspapers in order to inform future health promotional content. Methods This study describes a mixed-methods media content analysis that counted and ranked frequencies for media content (article text, themes and images) related to breast cancer in six Vietnamese online news publications over a twelve month period. Results Media content (n = 129 articles &n = 237 images) sampled showed that although information is largely accurate, there is a marked lack of stories about Vietnamese women's personal experiences. Such stories could help bridge the gap between what information about breast cancer is presented in the Vietnamese media, and what women in Vietnam understand about breast cancer risk factors, symptoms, screening and treatment. Conclusions Given findings from other studies indicating low levels of knowledge and women with breast cancer experiencing stigma and prejudice, more nuanced and in-depth narrative-focused messaging may be required.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Today, marked by advanced scientific approach, urbanism, and changing life style, there is an ever-growing rate of fast-food consumption, which has significantly affected public health. Hence, the present research aimed to predict factors involved in fast-food consumption in light of the prototype/willingness model among the students of Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present descriptive/analytical research conducted in 2018-2019, 350 students in Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences were selected through proportionate stratified random sampling. The required data were collected using a self-administrated questionnaire in light of the constructs within the prototype/willingness model and fast-food consumption behavior. The data were analyzed in SPSS version 16.0 using descriptive and inferential statistics including mean scores, standard deviation, correlation coefficient, and linear regression. RESULTS: Behavioral intention of fast-food consumption showed to be positively correlated with positive willingness, positive prototype, positive subjective norms, and positive attitude toward fast-food consumption. Furthermore, the correlation between positive behavioral intention of consuming fast food and positive subjective norms and positive attitude toward fast-food consumption was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The underlying constructs of prototype/willingness model altogether managed to explain 13% of the total variance of fast-food consumption behavior. Behavioral intention showed to be the strongest predictor of the behavior (beta = 1.613). CONCLUSION: It is suggested that the preventive measures aimed to reduce fast-food consumption among the youth focus more on strengthening negative attitudes and subjective norms concerning fast-food consumption.

Design: Multivariate hierarchical linear regression model Setting: Lower-income neighborhoods in an urban setting in the Midwestern USA Participants: 144 care network members of White and African American women aged >= 65 years Measurements: Age Group Evaluation and Description (AGED) Inventory assessed attitudes toward older women; CES-D scale measured depressive symptoms; Intergenerational Affectional Solidarity Scale assessed relationship closeness. Results: In bivariate analyses, African American caregivers endorsed more positive attitudes toward older women. In the multivariate regression model, attitudes toward older women were associated with care recipient health (beta = 0.18, p < 0.05) and relationship closeness with the care recipient (beta = 0.23, p < 0.05). However, these associations were fully mediated by care recipient-specific attitude ratings by the care network member. The association between person-specific attitudes and general attitudes was uniquely directional. Conclusions: Findings from the present study are consistent with past research suggesting that 'ageism' may, at least in part, derive from bias against perceived poor health. Further, our findings of an association between attitude toward the care recipient and attitudes toward older women in general provide support for cognitive psychology theory which emphasizes the role of personal experience in stereotype formation through the availability heuristic. The current study underlines the necessity for development of interventions to address ageism in informal caregivers.

AB  - Background: The study analyses the perception of risks of pandemic due COVID-19 by Roma people living in Roma settlement Zehra and their attitudes to quarantine, emergency actions and vaccination against influenza and their willingness to get vaccinated with the forthcoming vaccine against COVID-19.
   Methods: We used quantitative research to collect data at the time of first wave of COVID-19 epidemic in April-May 2020. The sample was consisted of 98 Roma people at the age of 25-60 years old and the data were analysed by descriptive statistics on the path of chi test p<0.05.
   Results: The wearing masks is considered and recommended as an effective protection against the spreading of COVID-19; there is significant corelation between internal motivation to wear masks and information about danger of coronavirus (p=0.032) and a government regulation (p=0.037) and state punishments if we refuse to wear the mask on the face in public places (0.028). The level of significance p= 0.048 (df 14, v=1.12) confirmed the relationship between the reasons for wearing protective masks and attitudes to emergency measures due COVID-19. To increase motivation of Roma people to follow rules, restrictions and the quarantine is not via financial penalties and threats, but it is important to increase health and information literacy and their trust in authorities.41.8% of the Roma people use masks due to a government regulation at the places where it is obligatory, not for personal reasons to protect themselves or others. There is significant correlation between poor motivation to wear masks, lack of information and misunderstandings of government restrictions (0.036) in the quarantine.Due to the quarantine Roma living in segregated settlements lost sources of income and economic activity (formal or informal), the rate of unemployment and poverty has been increased in these communities.The quarantine caused problems with e-learning at home (some of them do not have equipment or no ability to learn online due low education of parents and missing internet connection), social distance, increased cases of domestic violence, misunderstandings of restrictions, fear of social insecurity and deeper poverty.
   Conclusion: At the first wave of epidemic COVID-19 the most of Roma returned from countries (UK, Germany, France, Italy), they lost their jobs and faced negative prejudices from other Roma as "returners" to gained benefits from social and health care system. There should be interdisciplinary strategies to solve problems based on health care via public insurance, psychological support via crisis links, street work in communities via non-profit organisations and health and social support via Slovak Red Cross, help with distance education by community centres near Roma settlements, supports rights and living conditions by The Slovak National Centre for Human Rights and municipalities preparing a framework of initiatives financed through the reallocation of resources to eliminate consequences of COVID-19.

AB  - Sexual minority youth (SMY), especially those who are plurisexual (e.g. bisexual, pansexual, queer), are more likely to use nicotine or develop nicotine dependence than their heterosexual peers, and this disparity is often attributed to minority stress (e.g. discrimination). This study tested the association between minority stress and nicotine use and dependence among SMY and examined the moderating role of impulsivity. A sample of SMY (N = 85; aged 14-19; 80.6% White; 80% plurisexual) who were active nicotine users were recruited from the community. Results indicated that greater discrimination experiences were associated with more nicotine use days and higher nicotine dependence symptoms. However, impulsivity did not moderate the relationship between discrimination and nicotine use or dependence. These results highlight the potential importance of minority stress in understanding SMY's risk for nicotine use and dependence. This research suggests the need for identifying factors that could place some SMY at greater risk for nicotine use and dependence and points to potential clinical implications for nicotine cessation interventions for SMY.

AB  - Social and physical distancing is important in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and it impacts people's financial/social well-being tremendously. This study tested the application of the Theory of Planned Behaviors (TPB) to three types of social/physical distancing indicators (i. e., the number of close physical contacts on a single day in public venues, the frequencies of avoiding social gathering, and the levels of physical distancing in public venues). A population-based random telephone survey interviewed 300 Hong Kong Chinese adults in April 2020 when gatherings involving >4 people were banned. The participants on average made 15.3 close physical contacts (<1.5 m and for >3 min) in a day (5.0 in public transportation). About 80% practiced social distancing (avoided/reduced social gatherings) and physical distancing in public spaces (e. g., avoidance of going out, visiting crowded places, and gatherings of >4 people) but only 35.4% avoided using public transportations. Positive but not negative attitudes (inconvenience and lack of necessity), perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm were significantly associated with the three social/physical distancing outcomes. The data suggest that the levels of social/physical distancing were relatively high in the Hong Kong general population, and it, in general, supports the application of TPB to understand factors of social distancing for preventing COVID-19. Health promotion should take the findings into account. Furthermore, cross-cultural and time-series studies are warranted to compare the levels of social/physical distancing across countries and further explore their effectiveness in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Strong political movements voicing opposition to immigration are on the upswing. Does such potential antagonism translate into residential dynamics? We study whether natives fled from immigrant areas in reaction to the largest and fastest migration shock in the OECD. The inflow causing the population of Spain to grow by 10% between 1998 and 2008 represented a largely new phenomenon, the size of which had not been factored into previous expectations, thereby providing quasi-experimental sources of variance. Our results show that immigrant inflows caused mild native displacement from denser, established neighborhoods, but also more real estate development in these areas. In parallel, both natives and immigrants were collocating in booming suburban communities, resulting in no changes to overall measures of ethnic segregation. In light of the results, we argue that whenever ethnic-minority arrivals spur the creation of new neighborhoods, conventional empirical methods overstate the degree of native flight.

AB  - Focusing on the post-accord generation in Northern Ireland, this study aimed to examine the role of intergroup contact in promoting support for peacebuilding and youth civic engagement. The sample comprised 466 youth (aged 14-15; 51% Catholic, 49% Protestant) who were born after the 1998 Good Friday/Belfast Agreement and therefore represent a `post-accord' generation. Recruited through their schools, youth completed scales on intergroup contact (quality and quantity), support for peacebuilding, and civic engagement. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling and bootstrapped mediation in MPlus. Results found that support for peacebuilding partially mediated the association between higher quality and higher quantity contact and greater civic engagement (volunteering and political participation). Findings demonstrate that youth who are living with the legacy of protracted intergroup conflict can support peacebuilding and engage in constructive behaviours such as civic engagement. By recognising the peacebuilding potential of youth, especially in a post-accord generation, the findings may inform how to promote youth civic engagement and social reconstruction after conflict.

KW  - REFLECTION
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore athletes' perceptions of how coaches shaped their experiences in disability sport throughout development. Athletes with physical disabilities (N = 21) participated in life history interviews. Participants outlined their sport history and responded to questions targeting the roles that coaches played in their development, which laid the foundation for broader conversations about how coaches shaped the disability sport experience. Using thematic analysis, patterns in coach knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors were captured in 4 themes. Three themes were discussed in relation to positive experiences in disability sport (consideration, collaboration, professionalism), and 1 theme was related to negative disability sport experiences (prejudice). The findings of this work are analyzed through the lens of the social-relational model of disability, thus challenging the dominant discourse that underpins understandings of (dis)ability in the sport context. Practical recommendations for disability sport coaches include reflective practice and introspective examination of implicit biases and assumptions, as well as a focus on interpersonal skills that assist coaches in collaborating with athletes-thus encouraging the integration of sport- and disability-specific knowledge.
   Lay Summary Athletes with physical disabilities were interviewed about how coaches shaped their experiences in sport over time. Differences in how coaches created positive experiences were identified at each stage of development, reflecting varied combinations of knowledge and behaviors. Negative experiences stemmed from perceptions of unfair treatment and inequality.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to gain an understanding of the public's beliefs, attitudes and knowledge regarding rockfalls, and to see whether these variable,, could predict whether a person is likely to enter high-risk rockfall areas.
   Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire was developed to measure beliefs (informed by the health belief model), knowledge, and previous behaviour in relation to rockfalls. Questions were also included to measure attitudes regarding rockfall caution signs In total, 138 members of the general public completed the questionnaire.
   Findings High-risk behaviour was more likely if the person was male and if the person had the belief that sign-posted high-risk areas were not dangerous Further, believing that the sign-posted areas were not dangerous was more likely among people who held negative attitudes towards cautionary signs, specifically, these participants were more likely to doubt the validity of the warning signs
   Research limitations/implications - The research was exploratory in nature. Further research should be conducted with a larger sample size and a more random selection of the general population. Ways of improving measurement of the variables are discussed
   Practical implications - Efforts should be made to increase the public's perception of the validity of rockfall cautionary signs. Doing so may decrease injury and death as a result of rockfalls Suggestions on ways to increase the validity of signage are made
   Originality/value - It is presumed that this study is the first to attempt to gain an understanding of the beliefs and attitudes that may lead a person into engaging in high-risk behaviour in relation to rockfalls.

AB  - Background Research shows that personnel working in mental health facilities may share some of the societal prejudices towards mental illness. This might result in stigmatizing behaviours towards people suffering from mental disorders, undermining the quality of their care.
   Aims To describe and compare attitudes towards mental illness across a sample of professionals working in a wide range of mental health facilities in Spain, Portugal and Italy.
   Method We administered a survey to personnel including two questionnaires related to stigmatizing attitudes: The Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill (CAMI) and the Attribution Questionnaire (AQ-27). Data were compared according to professional category, work setting and country.
   Results 34.06% (1525) professionals of the surveyed population responded adequately. Psychologists and social therapists had the most positive attitudes, and nursing assistants the most negative, on most factors of CAMI and AQ-27. Community staff had more positive attitudes than hospital-based professionals in most factors on CAMI and in discriminatory responses on AQ-27.
   Conclusions Globally, mental health professionals showed a positive attitude towards mental illness, but also a relative support to coercive treatments. There are differences in attitudes modulated by professional category and setting. Results can guide preventive strategies, particularly for the hospital-based and nursing staff.

AB  - Female and male condoms are the only methods that prevent both sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, and unintended pregnancy. Despite continuing high STI rates, few studies investigate factors predicting whether women initiating female condom (FC) use sustain use. Using data from a randomized trial, we examined predictors of sustained FC use at five-month follow-up (FU2) among female university students in South Africa who participated in either a one-session, information-only, group-deliveredMinimal Interventionor a two-session, group-deliveredEnhanced Intervention. In the final multiple logistic regression model, believing one's partner holds positive attitudes toward the FC (aOR = 1.40; p = 0.028), and greater FC use for vaginal sex at previous assessment (aOR) = 1.19; p = 0.008) were associated with greater odds of FC use at FU2. Excluding number of FC-protected occasions at FU1 from the analysis, discussing FC use with partner (aOR = 2.89; p = 0.071) and believing one's partner holds positive attitudes toward the FC (aOR = 1.63; p < 0.001) were associated with greater odds of use at FU2. The FC empowers women to protect themselves from both STIs and unintended pregnancy, but targeted interventions are needed to address men's negative attitudes toward the device. Engaging men as FC champions to support and promote FC use, along with marketing campaigns targeted to men, may expand FC coverage and enhance uptake.

AB  - Treatment decisions after an injury like finger amputation are made based on injury and patient factors. However, decisions can also be influenced by provider and patient preferences. We compared hand surgeon and societal preferences and attitudes regarding finger amputation treatment in Japan and the US. We performed a cross-sectional survey with subjects derived from large tertiary care academic institutions in the US and Japan. We secured 100% participation of American hand surgeon members of the Finger Replantation and Amputation Multicenter Study and presenting hand surgeons at the 32nd Annual meeting of the Central Japanese Society for Surgery of the Hand. Societal preferences were gathered from volunteers at the 2 universities in the US and Japan. There were no significant differences in estimations of function, sensation, or appearance after replantation; American and Japanese societal participants preferred replantation compared to surgeons, although this was more pronounced in Japan. The Japanese society displayed more negative attitudes toward finger amputees than did Japanese surgeons. American respondents anticipated more public stigmatisation of amputees than did American surgeons. Societal preference for replantation was not caused by inflated expectations of outcomes after replantation. Japanese societal preference was likely driven by negative views of finger amputees. American society noted no decrease in physical health after amputation, but did note a quality of life decrease attributed to public stigmatisation. Japanese society and surgeons had a stronger preference for replantation than American society and surgeons, possibly attributed to cultural differences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many young adult hookah tobacco users do not consider themselves hookah "smokers," but data on this topic are limited. There are no existing measures of young adults' mental schemas of hookah "smokers." We examined the factor structure and reliability of the Hookah Smoker Scale and examined associations with perceived harm and addictiveness and attitudes toward hookah. Two hundred and forty-six young adult (ages 18-30) hookah smokers participated in a cross-sectional online study. Participants completed items assessing schemas characterizing hookah smokers and valid measures of perceived harm and addictiveness of hookah smoking, risk appraisals, and attitudes toward hookah. Exploratory factor analysis using principal axis factoring with oblique rotation extracted a 12-item scale with three dimensions (Regular Use, Social-Enabled Use, and Self-Enabled Use). The scale explained 69.7% of the variance (eigenvalue = 9.2). Cronbach's alpha for the scale was.89, with Cronbach's alpha >= .80 for four-item subscales. Higher subscale scores indicate stronger beliefs that the dimension characterizes a hookah smoker. Higher Regular Use scores (score variance = 46.9%; eigenvalue = 5.6) were associated with greater perceived harm and addictiveness (beta = 0.21, p =.01), greater risk appraisals (beta = 0.20, p =.02), and more negative attitudes toward hookah (beta = -0.18, p =.03). The Hookah Smoker Scale is a promising measure that can be used to identify targets for preventing and reducing young adults' hookah tobacco use. Findings also suggest young adults associate health risks of hookah with daily smoking, but not with intermittent social smoking patterns.

AB  - Context: Obesity is a major health concern in the United States, and its prevalence continues to rise. Although it is a common health issue, many people, including health care professionals, are biased against people with obesity.
   Objective: To determine whether a comprehensive obesity curriculum presented to students in medical school can positively influence their attitudes toward obesity.
   Methods: The study was designed around a comprehensive educational obesity curriculum at Touro University College of Osteopathic Medicine-CA, involving the classes of 2013 through 2018. A survey to assess student attitudes toward obesity was distributed to first-year students before the curriculum, directly after completion, and each year after until graduation (graduating classes of 2015 through 2018). Second- and third-year medical students in 2011 (graduating classes of 2014 and 2013), who did not complete the curriculum, were given an examination to establish baseline values and served as the control group. The obesity curriculum consisted of lectures delivered during the first and second year of medical school and case study simulations during the third year. Knowledge gained from the curriculum was assessed with a multiple-choice examination, and bias was assessed using the Fat Phobia Scale.
   Results: A total of 718 first-through fourth-year students were included. Students who completed the first year of the obesity curriculum (n=528) showed significantly greater medical knowledge regarding obesity-related epidemiology, pathogenesis, biochemistry, pathophysiology, and metabolic factors; nutrition, diet, physical activity, self-control, and behavior modification; pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions; and associated chronic disorders, based on their multiple-choice examination scores compared with the control group. The examination scores indicated significant increases in medical knowledge compared with the precurriculum cohort after the curriculum (OMS I students: 130 [72.4%]; 133 [92.6%]; 133 [91.1%]; 132 [89.0%]; vs control: 105 [47.2%]; 134 [52.6%], respectively [P<.01]). In all 4 years observed, there was a significant reduction in bias among first-year medical students after obesity curriculum (before: 3.65, 3.76, 3.57, 3.61, and after: 3.47, 3.38, 3.34, 3.37, respectively) (P<.05). The reduction in bias was also significantly sustained throughout the fourth year.
   Conclusion: A comprehensive obesity curriculum throughout medical school resulted in an improvement in students' attitudes toward and knowledge of obesity.

AB  - Objective: This study explored the nature and extent of Athlete Support Personnel's (ASP's) attitudes and beliefs toward athletes with symptoms of anorexia nervosa (AN) compared with those with symptoms of depression. Design: A cross-sectional study with a survey instrument. Setting: Sport and Exercise Science Professional Bodies and Associations in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, and mainland United Kingdom. Participants: One hundred fifty-two ASP. Main Outcome Measures: Participants read 2 vignettes describing a fictional female athlete with symptoms of AN or depression after which they completed an on-line survey examining attitudes toward such athletes. Results: Significant differences in patterns of responses were found between the 2 mental health conditions. The athlete with AN was viewed as significantly more difficult to communicate with F(1,148) = 18.17, P = 0.000, eta(2) = 0.11, more likely to be using her disorder to gain attention F(1,148) = 21.69, P = 0.000, eta(2) = 0.13, personally responsible for her condition F(1,148) = 10.10, P = 0.00, eta(2) = 0.06, and less likely to recover F(1,148) = 23.03, P = 0.000, eta(2) = 0.14 than the athlete with depression. Male service providers were more likely to believe that the athletes depicted were attention seeking F(1,148) = 10.69, P = 0.001, eta(2) = 0.07 and only had themselves to blame for their mental health condition F(1,148) = 12.97, P = 0.000, eta(2) = 0.08. Conclusions: Athlete support personnel report stigmatizing attitudes toward athletes with eating disorders such as AN. Male service providers hold greater negative attitudes toward athletes with mental health conditions.

AB  - The present study was designed to assess mental health provider attitudes and perceptions of telemental health (TMH) prior to and during the COVID-19 Pandemic, as well as the nature of their TMH utilization. The study aimed to gather information about positive and negative attitudes towards TMH, perceptions and correlates based on the modality of care, and beliefs about the overall effectiveness of TMH as compared to face-to-face care. The current study is part of a larger mixed methods project utilizing a repeated cross-sectional design. An online survey was administered to a sample of 1448 mental health providers and included demographic and professional information, experiences with and perceptions of TMH prior to and during the COVID-19 Pandemic, as well as a brief measure of pandemic-related stress. The COVID-19 Pandemic resulted in an increased use of TMH in the study sample. During COVID-19, providers reported increased agreement with TMH being necessary, important, and effective for care delivery. Providers who primarily used video, compared with telephone, reported that TMH was more useful, satisfying, and effective. While negative attitude towards TMH was predicted only by prior attitudes and belief in TMH effectiveness, positive attitude towards TMH was also predicted by female sex and current level of pandemic related stress. TMH use during the pandemic was predicted by primary use of video platform and previous TMH use. The 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic resulted in increased use of TMH and significantly increased positive perceptions about TMH among mental health providers.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Social Networking Services (SNS), especially Twitter, have been an increasingly popular communication medium, especially in political transformation. This research analyses the language of tweets by Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) of Pakistan, shared during the recent standoff between India and Pakistan on the issue of the Pulwama Attack in February 2019 and the Revocation of Article 370 by the Indian Government in August 2019.
   Methodology: The present research examines the linguistic techniques, and micro and macro approaches used in the discourse of tweets by DG ISPR on the said issues. Selection of vocabulary, tone of the message, and emotion in the discourse are studied through Ideological Square Model under the umbrella of CDA, with the aid of NVivo 12 Plus, to inspect the magnitude of the impact of linguistic memorandums from authoritative institutes.
   Findings: This study has revealed that the impeccable choice of vocabulary by ISPR adequately represented the Military of Pakistan, nationally and internationally, and has brought a state of tranquility at the time of standoff between two rival countries. This research argues that the discourse in tweets by DG ISPR represented Pakistan as a peaceful country but determinedly ready to defend its homeland during external enmity.
   Contributions: This study contributes a better understanding of the subtle ways in which language plays an essential role in creating political polarisation and constructing or manipulating reality while consolidating power struggle, discrimination, prejudice and inequality in society.

AB  - Negative generalization asymmetry (NGA) is a tendency to generalize negative attitudes more widely than positive attitudes. Studies found robust NGA for new objects that resemble both positive and negative learned objects, and even stronger NGA for new objects that resemble neither. Two biases were suggested to underlie NGA: (1) negative response bias, whereby a novel object is perceived as novel, but forced to make a dichotomous good/bad decision, a responder has a strategy to classify it as bad; (2) negative weighting-of-similarity bias, whereby a novel object seems more similar to negative learned objects than to positive learned objects. We hypothesized that adding a third response alternative, "cannot be evaluated", to the good/bad response alternatives commonly used in the BeanFest paradigm would reduce negative response bias but not negative weighting-of-similarity. As predicted, the new response alternative was used more as similarity to learned stimuli decreased. Also as predicted, NGA, although still significant, was lower in the 3-alternatives condition. Interestingly, extent of reduction in NGA due to adding the new response alternative did not vary as a function of stimulus type, and was not particularly strong for stimuli very dissimilar to any learned stimuli. These results confirm that NGA is indeed partly due to response bias. They additionally suggest that increased NGA with decreasing similarity to learned stimuli cannot be attributed solely to negative response bias. Thus, avoidance of new, unfamiliar objects does not reflect only strategic caution, but rather reflects to a large extent a naive-realistic belief that they are negative.

AB  - Background: There is a growing recognition of the need to provide HIV/AIDS prevention and care to migrant workers. Social involvement, a type of social capital, is considered a 'critical enabler' of effective HIV/AIDS prevention. Designated participation in formal community groups by the government (e.g., political parties) and informal, voluntary local networks by NGOs (e.g., alumni association, cultural & sports club) play different roles in HIV prevention. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of different types of social organizations on HIV/AIDS prevention knowledge among migrant workers.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study of 758 migrants was conducted in Hefei, Anhui Province, China. Data were collected through a self-reported questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between different social organizations and HIV/AIDS prevention.
   Results: Migrants who participated in social organizations had a higher awareness of HIV/AIDS knowledge than migrants who do not participate in social organizations. Higher levels of HIV/AIDS knowledge is associated with positive HIV/AIDS behaviors for people who attended political parties (odds ratio [OR] = 3.49, 95% CI: 1.22-9.99). This effect is not significant for alumni association. For both political parties and alumni association members (OR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.06-0.66, OR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.08-0.61, respectively), people who exhibited higher levels of HIV/AIDS knowledge had more negative attitudes than those with less knowledge.
   Conclusion: Social organizations play an important role in improving HIV/AIDS knowledge and behavior in migrants, providing a great opportunity for HIV/AIDS prevention.

AB  - This article uses 20 years of survey data from the Mexican Migration Project to describe how the experiences of Mexico-U.S. migrants have changed over time. I use survey questions about migrants' experiences on their last U.S. trip to develop composite indices of six integration domains, and then estimate random intercept linear regression models with individual-, family-, and community-level characteristics to explain variations in Mexican migrant integration. I find that, over time, Mexican migrant linguistic and social integration has steadily increased, whereas integration in other family and economic domains changed little or not at all. Results from the multivariate models show the importance of human capital to integration across the multiple domains. Higher education, more time spent in the country of destination, and being male are all strongly associated with higher levels of integration. I also find evidence that both family and community migration networks facilitate integration.

AB  - Background: Anecdotal reports suggest a rise in anti-Asian racial attitudes and discrimination in response to COVID-19. Racism can have significant social, economic, and health impacts, but there has been little systematic investigation of increases in anti-Asian prejudice. Methods: We utilized Twitter's Streaming Application Programming Interface (API) to collect 3,377,295 U.S. race-related tweets from November 2019-June 2020. Sentiment analysis was performed using support vector machine (SVM), a supervised machine learning model. Accuracy for identifying negative sentiments, comparing the machine learning model to manually labeled tweets was 91%. We investigated changes in racial sentiment before and following the emergence of COVID-19. Results: The proportion of negative tweets referencing Asians increased by 68.4% (from 9.79% in November to 16.49% in March). In contrast, the proportion of negative tweets referencing other racial/ethnic minorities (Blacks and Latinx) remained relatively stable during this time period, declining less than 1% for tweets referencing Blacks and increasing by 2% for tweets referencing Latinx. Common themes that emerged during the content analysis of a random subsample of 3300 tweets included: racism and blame (20%), anti-racism (20%), and daily life impact (27%). Conclusion: Social media data can be used to provide timely information to investigate shifts in area-level racial sentiment.

AB  - Organ donation provides a life-saving opportunity for patients with organ failure. China, like most countries, is faced with organ shortages. Understanding public opinion regarding organ donation in China is critical to ensure an increased donation rate. Our study explored public concerns and attitudes toward organ donation, factors involved, and how the public pays attention to organ donation. Sixteen million users' public information (i.e. gender, age, and geographic information) and posts from January 2017 to December 2017 were collected from Weibo, a social media platform. Of these, 1755 posts related to organ donation were included in the analysis. We categorized the posts and coded the users' attitudes toward organ donation and the associations between the demographics. The most popular posts mentioning organ donation were "publicly expressing the willingness to donate organs." Furthermore, 87.62% of posts exhibited a positive attitude toward organ donation, whereas only 7.44% exhibited a negative attitude. Most positive posts were "saluting the organ donors," and most negative posts involved "fear of the family's passive medical decision." There was no significant gender difference in the users' attitudes, but older people generally had a more negative attitude. Users with negative attitudes mainly distrust the medical system and are worried that the donated organs may be used in improper trading. Social media may be an important channel for promoting organ donation activities, and it is important to popularize scientific knowledge related to organ donation in order to eliminate the public's misunderstanding of organ donation and transplantation.

AB  - This paper presents the challenges and barriers to accessing formal maternity care in South East Nigeria from women's perspectives. It is drawn from a study that explored the concept of safe motherhood. The study used a hermeneutic phenomenological approach guided by post-structural feminism. Data were collected through individual semi-structured interviews with 17 women who were attending a formal healthcare facility for antenatal care. Four aspects of the challenges and barriers encountered by women when accessing care in a formal healthcare setting as reported by the participants of the study are as follows: financial constraints, lack of autonomy, negative attitude of the healthcare providers, and healthcare worker strikes. Some participants linked the economic status of women to the lack of education which had an impact on their ability to make an independent decision as to whether to seek formal maternity healthcare or not. Negative attitudes, and frequent strikes of healthcare workers in many cases, discourage women from using the formal maternity healthcare facilities. It is evident that Nigeria did not achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5, which is to improve maternal health. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.1, which is to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio, requires more than technical approaches. Genuine political will is required if the health system is to be affordable for all women. There is the need to address the gender-related issues that sustain women's low socio-economic status. The government needs to pay the workers as and when due, and a performance appraisal should be in place to ensure improvement in the quality of care offered to women.

AB  - Non-Hispanic (NH) Black, American Indian/Alaska Native (Indigenous), and NH-White men have the highest colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality rates among all other racial/ethnic groups. Contributing factors are multifaceted, yet no studies have examined the psychometric properties of a comprehensive survey examining potential masculinity barriers to CRC screening behaviors among these populations. This study assessed the psychometric properties of our Masculinity Barriers to Medical Care (MBMC) Scale among NH-Black, Indigenous, and NH-White men who completed our web-based MBMC, Psychosocial Factors, and CRC Screening Uptake & Intention Survey. We conducted exploratory factor analysis on a sample of 254 men and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) on a separate sample of 637 men nationally representative by age and state of residence. After psychometric assessment, the MBMC scale was reduced from 24 to 18 items and from six to four subscales. NH-Black men's mean scores were lowest on three of four subscales (Being Strong, Negative and Positive Attitudes) and highest on the Acknowledging Emotions subscale. Compared with both Indigenous and NH-White men, NH-Black men had significantly lower Negative Attitudes subscale scores and significantly higher scores on the Acknowledging Emotions subscale. Compared with both Indigenous and NH-Black men, NH-White men had significantly higher Being Strong and Positive Attitudes subscales scores. This study expands on previous research indicating that, among racialized populations of men, endorsement of traditional masculine ideologies influences engagement in preventive health behaviors. Our scale can be tailored to assess attitudes to screening for other cancers and diseases that disproportionately burden medically underserved populations.

AB  - Ageism can be seen as systematic stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination of people because of their age. For a long time, society has accepted negative stereotypes as a norm. When referring to older adults, the United Nations Global Report on Ageism warns about a severe impact. The Intergenerational Study for a Healthy Aging, a questionnaire about believes, stereotypes, and knowledge about older people and grandparents, was administered to 326 Spanish biology and medical students. Here we report the results of stereotype analysis through adjective qualification of the youth and older people performed before the survey. Content analysis of two open questions about metacognition at the end of the survey is also presented. The results show that: (1) The questionnaire promoted metacognition; (2) Positive metacognition toward grandparents was higher than for the general old population; (3) Most participants were not conscious about ageism; (4) Gender was a key factor-male students were more ageist than females; (5) The feeling of guilt was higher in the questionnaire about older people; (6) The metacognition exercise elicited thoughts and, in few cases, the need to take action to tackle ageism. In conclusion, both activities promoted active thoughts about older people vs. grandparents and helped participants realize unconscious ageism-specifically toward the older population-serving as an awareness activity that may help tackle ageism.

AB  - The boring of valve seats of internal combustion engines is done approximately 25 million times per year in Brazil. Excessive vibrations during this operation are common and can adversely affect dimensional and geometrical tolerances of the valve seats. The sealing of the combustion chamber is prejudiced, resulting in loss of power and higher emission of pollutant gases, harming the environment. The raw material of the valve seats is sintered steel of 370-410 HB hardness and is machined with expensive polycrystalline cubic boron nitride blades. In order to avoid the generation of excessive vibration or chatter during machining, operators reduce cutting speed and feed rate, which consequently causes reduction of productivity. In this context, investigation of the process was performed with the objective of minimizing the vibrations during the valve seat boring through changes in the tool holder design and in geometry of the cutting blades. The proposed modifications resulted in a remarkable reduction in magnitude of the resultant cutting force, vibrations, and roundness deviations of the valve seat. Hence, the sealing between the valve and the seat was improved and the emission of gases from the motor could be reduced, with gains in efficiency. The results also showed that the cutting blade edge must have a 60-mu m honing, and the best cutting parameters are in the range: cutting speed 80-100 m/min and feed rate 0.04-0.08 mm/rev/tooth.

AB  - This article analyses perceived in-group discrimination of 29,189 first and second generation immigrant respondents from 201 different countries of origin currently living in one of 27 EU countries. In addition to testing effects of individual factors, the article estimates the effects of macro-characteristics of both origin and destination countries and community variables. The migration history of these groups is relevant for perceived discrimination: immigrants with citizenship, who speak the majority language at home and have at least one native parent perceive less in-group discrimination, whereas religious respondents, especially from religions that differ more in comparison to the majority, perceive more in-group discrimination. Furthermore, macrocharacteristics of the country of origin are most important in explaining differences between European countries. Immigrants from socio-economically more developed countries with higher living standards-and for that reason more comparable to the native population-are less likely to perceive in-group discrimination.

AB  - Introduction: Physicians are often reluctant to prescribe strong opioids for chronic non cancer pain (CNCP). No study has qualitatively examined physicians' beliefs about prescribing opioids for CNCP to patients with a history of substance abuse (PWHSA).
   Aims: To describe physicians' attitudes and experience of prescribing opioids for CNCP to PWHSA.
   Design, setting and participants: Nineteen individual interviews and two focus groups were conducted with GPs, Addiction Specialists, Pain Specialists and Rheumatologists.
   Results: Physicians were "reluctant" to prescribe opioids to PWHSA experiencing CNCP for fear of addiction, misuse or diversion of medications. Many exhibited "distrust" that such patients were experiencing "genuine pain", resulting in patients often being considered guilty until proven innocent. Such negative regard towards these patients was based on previous manipulative "drug seeking" encounters and often resulted in the under treatment of pain. Potential "flags" were identified that alerted physicians to the potential for abuse or diversion of their prescription including: doctor shopping. loosing prescriptions, frequent attendance and early requests for repeat prescriptions. Physicians reported different management approaches and stricter prescribing regimes for PWHSA to limit the potential of addiction, misuse and diversion. Examples of poor pain management were described where drug users had been under treated as a result of negative attitudes or inexperience of staff.
   Discussion: Applying the chronic disease model to comorbid addiction and CNCP would ensure a health and social care system that makes it difficult to stigmatise patients experiencing these conditions and would facilitate the prescribing of opioid pain medication to patients who could benefit.

AB  - Determining which dimensions of social classification are culturally significant is a developmental challenge. Some suggest this is accomplished by differentially privileging intrinsic visual cues over nonintrinsic cues (Atran, 1990; Gil-White, 2001), whereas others point to the role of noun labels as more general promoters of kind-based reasoning (Bigler & Liben, 2007; Gelman, 2003). A novel groups procedure was employed to examine the independent effects of noun labels and visual cues on social categorization. Experiment 1 demonstrated that in the absence of a visual cue, a noun label supported social categorization among 4-year-olds and 7-year-olds. Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated that children and adults fail to differentiate between intrinsic and nonintrinsic visual cues to category membership, suggesting that this distinction is not central to the acquisition of social category concepts. Experiments 2 and 3 also showed that in the absence of a shared noun label, visual cues were not sufficient for younger children to form social categories. Experiment 4 ruled out a potential demand characteristic in the previous experiments. Together, these results reveal the primacy of verbal labels over visual cues for social categorization in young children and suggest a developmental change between ages 4 and 7 in the ability to construct new representations of social category concepts.

AB  - Background Uptake of colorectal cancer screening programmes needs to be improved or at least maintained in order to achieve projected reductions in mortality and morbidity. Understanding the origins of non-participation in screening is therefore important.
   Objective To explore the beliefs and experiences of individuals who had not responded either to their screening invitation or reminder.
   Design A qualitative study using in-depth interviews with non-participants from England's population-based colorectal cancer screening programme. Data collection and analysis were carried out using a grounded theory approach, with an emphasis on the constant comparison method, and continued until saturation (27 interviews).
   Findings The interviews provided an in-depth understanding of a range of reasons and circumstances surrounding non-participation in screening, including contextual and environmental influences as well as factors specific to the screening test. Non-participation in screening was not necessarily associated with negative attitudes towards screening or a decision to not return a kit. Reasons for non-participation in screening included not feeling that participation is personally necessary, avoiding or delaying decision making, and having some degree of intention to take part but failing to do so because of practicalities, conflicting priorities or external circumstances. Beliefs, awareness and intention change over time.
   Discussion and conclusions A range of approaches may be required to improve screening uptake. Some non-participants may already have a degree of intention to take part in screening in the future, and this group may be more responsive to interventions based on professional endorsement, repeat invitations, reminders and aids to making the test more practical.

TI  - A general enlarging shear impulse approach to green printing large-area and efficient organic photovoltaics

KW  - FLOW
AB  - Green solvent-treated organic solar cells (OSCs) have demonstrated remarkable advantages in recent years for printing large-area photovoltaic devices. However, the high boiling point and poor solubility of green solvents lead to difficulties in morphological exploration and regulation, which are ultimately prejudiced against the upgrading of large-area OSCs. In this work, the shear impulse strategy is used to prepare high-performance scalable OSCs with green solvents. In PM6:Y6 films treated with o-XY, the shear impulse during film formation is improved by increasing the meniscus-guided coating (MGC) speed, which leads to achieving suitable phase separation. Therefore, the PCE of the device prepared by MGC is up to 15.1%, and the PCE of large-area devices (1 cm(2)) reaches 13.66%. Moreover, the critical conditions for the fabrication of homogeneous films are explored. To validate the universality of the shear impulse strategy, PM6:BTP-eC9 films are fabricated by the MGC method. A PCE of 17.15% is obtained for small-area (0.04 cm(2)) devices. Noticeably, the PCEs of large-area (1 cm(2)) rigid devices reached 15.50%, and a large-area module (25 cm(2)) exhibited an excellent PCE of 11.29%. Overall, the shear impulse strategy can effectively guide the lab-to-manufacturing translation of printing organic photovoltaic devices.

AB  - An effective method of birth control in men yet least accepted and patronized is vasectomy. Vasectomy provides health benefits to the user, his direct family, and the entire population as it helps to control population growth. This article explored the beliefs and attitudes of commercial drivers on vasectomy in an urban community in Ghana. The study employed qualitative exploratory design using focus group discussion. Data were collected from 12 married men between the ages of 45 to 60 years who were selected through purposive sampling method. The focus group discussions were audiotaped, handwritten, and recorded. Recorded data were then transcribed verbatim, and the current version of the NVivo software for analyzing qualitative data was used to manage the data. Three major themes emerged from the study: knowledge of respondents on vasectomy, beliefs, and attitudes of married men toward vasectomy. Each of the themes had three subthemes. The study revealed that vasectomy was perceived by some of the respondents to be synonymous to castration which comes with negative effects. Inadequate knowledge, negative perceptions, future uncertainty, and the irreversible nature of vasectomy emerged as contributing to the low patronage and some of the reasons why most of the respondents had no intentions of opting for vasectomy. In view of these findings, it is imperative for all stakeholders to give urgent attention to behavior change strategies that can be put in action to ameliorate the effects of these negative attitudes and misbeliefs. Ultimately, the tide can be turned around and vasectomy will be a preferred alternative when it comes to family planning in Ghana.

AB  - Objectives To assess the attitude of medical students towards cultural diversity aiming to elucidate our current status in understanding cultural awareness and sensitivity. Design, setting and participants A web-based cross-sectional study was carried out among 601 undergraduate health science students (medical and dental courses) at a health sciences university in eastern Nepal via various modes of social-media platforms like WhatsApp, Messenger, Gmail, etc. Outcome measures Medical students' attitude towards cultural diversity and its association with the sociodemographic profile of the students. Results A total of 601 students participated in the study, out of which, 64.2% were men with a sex ratio of 1.8:1 and a mean age of 22.3 +/- 1.9 years. More than two-thirds (77.2%) of the students had an excellent to good attitude towards cultural diversity. The proportion of students reporting 'excellent' attitude towards cultural diversity was higher among male students compared with female students (37.8% vs 20.5%) and students aged >22 years compared with younger students (37.1% vs 26.7%). Gender (p<0.001) and age (p=0.009) were significantly associated with the attitude towards cultural diversity. Conclusions Medical students, in general, are aware of the impacts of a cross-cultural society on the delivery of quality healthcare and also about the need to be aware of prejudices doctors may have towards certain cultures. Majority suggest the inclusion of concepts of multicultural awareness and sensitivity in the medical curriculum itself.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and coping related to HIV and AIDS in a rural hospital in South Africa. A randomly selected sample of 222 nurses was asked to respond to a self-administered questionnaire. Results indicate that the majority (83.8%) of the sample had a medium level of HIV knowledge and had a positive attitude towards caring of HIV/AIDS patients (75.8%), while a minority had negative attitudes toward caring of patients with HIV/AIDS. Regarding coping, 71.2% of the nurses had a medium level of coping in caring for patients with HIV/AIDS. Attitudes towards caring of HIV/AIDS patients was significantly associated with coping (r =.31, p<.05). Female nurses displayed a more positive attitude towards caring of HIV/AIDS patients than male nurses (t=1.89, p<.05). Nurses who had more than 10 years working experience had a significantly more positive attitude (t=2.16, p<.05) and coping ability (t=2.35, p<.05) than nurses who had less than 10 years of working experience. In conclusion, nurses had insufficient knowledge about HIV/AIDS, one in four nurses had negative attitude and one in five nurses had low coping ability toward caring HIV/AIDS patients. Therefore, in-services training to update on HIV/AIDS knowledge to modify attitudes towards caring of HIV/AIDS patients should be implemented.

AB  - Purpose: Teamwork is important to providing safe and effective care for hospitalized patients with cancer; however, few studies have evaluated teamwork in this setting.
   Methods: We surveyed all nurses, residents, hospitalists, and oncology physicians in oncology units at a large urban teaching hospital from September to November 2012. Respondents rated teamwork using a validated instrument (Safety Attitudes Questionnaire; scale, 0 to 100) and rated the quality of collaboration they had experienced with other professionals using a 5-point ordinal response scale (1, very low quality; 5, very high quality). Respondents also rated potential barriers to collaboration using a 4-point ordinal response scale (1, not at all a barrier; 4, major barrier). We compared ratings by professionals using analysis of variance (ANOVA).
   Results: Overall, 129 (67%) of 193 eligible participants completed the survey. Teamwork scores differed across professional types, with nurses providing the lowest ratings (69.7) and residents providing the highest (81.9; ANOVA P = .01). Ratings of collaboration with nurses were high across all types of professionals. Ratings of collaboration with physicians varied significantly by professional type (P = .02), with nurses giving lower ratings of collaboration with all physician types. Similarly, perceived barriers to collaboration differed by professional type, with nurses perceiving the biggest barrier to be negative attitudes regarding the importance of communication. Oncologists did not perceive any of the listed options as major barriers to collaboration.
   Conclusion: In inpatient oncology units, discrepancies exist between nurses' and physicians' ratings of teamwork and collaboration. Oncologists seem to be unaware that teamwork is suboptimal in this setting.

AB  - Background: Public health education increasingly emphasizes the link of personal lifestyle with cancer risk, which may result in unintended negative social effects such as triggering stigma and/or blame towards cancer patients when their illness is perceived to be caused by personal behaviours or disapproved lifestyles.
   Objectives: To explore nurses' blame attributions towards patients with different types of cancer and to identify associated factors.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Setting: A tertiary cancer-specialized hospital in Beijing.
   Participants: 317 Chinese oncology nurses working in the cancer hospital.
   Methods: Participant nurses completed a self-administrated anonymous questionnaire and rated how much they would blame someone with a diagnosis of breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, as well as leukaemia and obesity.
   Results: More than half of the oncology nurses (57.1%) attributed at least some blame to patients with leukaemia, following with breast cancer (67.5%), cervical cancer (79.2%), liver cancer (79.2%), and colon cancer (78.5%). Lung cancer patients attracted at least some blame by 82.0% of participating nurses. Attributions of blame for patients with lung, cervical, colon and liver cancer were most common among nurses with shorter working experience.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated that a high proportion of Chinese nurses attributed at least some blame to patients with different cancers despite being working in a cancer-specialized hospital. Future education and support for nurses are essential to avoid negative attitudes and blame attributions to cancer patients in order to enhance the quality of care. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In recent years several European states have seen the emergence of counter-Jihad' movements, which in contrast to the established populist radical right eschew electoral politics and put stronger emphasis on mobilising opposition to Islam and Muslims. Despite attracting attention, counter-Jihad movements and the predictors of their support are under-researched. Drawing on a new survey and sample of self-identified supporters, this article investigates the predictors of public support for the English Defence League (EDL), the inaugural defence league' in Europe. Contrary to accounts that stress unemployment, apathy or single issues, it is found that support is concentrated among male workers, citizens with school-level education, who read tabloid newspapers and vote for right-wing parties, but who are not more likely to be unemployed, in social housing, have no qualifications or be politically apathetic. Foremost, regression analysis confirms that the strongest predictor of their support is xenophobic hostility toward Muslims, and ethnic minorities more generally.

AB  - Sport hunting is often proposed as a tool to support the conservation of large carnivores. However, it is challenging to provide tangible economic benefits from this activity as an incentive for local people to conserve carnivores. We assessed economic gains from sport hunting and poaching of leopards (Panthera pardus), costs of leopard depredation of livestock, and attitudes of people toward leopards in Niassa National Reserve, Mozambique. We sent questionnaires to hunting concessionaires (n = 8) to investigate the economic value of and the relative importance of leopards relative to other key trophy-hunted species. We asked villagers (n = 158) the number of and prices for leopards poached in the reserve and the number of goats depredated by leopard. Leopards were the mainstay of the hunting industry; a single animal was worth approximately U.S.$24,000. Most safari revenues are retained at national and international levels, but poached leopard are illegally traded locally for small amounts ($83). Leopards depredated 11 goats over 2 years in 2 of 4 surveyed villages resulting in losses of $440 to 6 households. People in these households had negative attitudes toward leopards. Although leopard sport hunting generates larger gross revenues than poaching, illegal hunting provides higher economic benefits for households involved in the activity. Sport-hunting revenues did not compensate for the economic losses of livestock at the household level. On the basis of our results, we propose that poaching be reduced by increasing the costs of apprehension and that the economic benefits from leopard sport hunting be used to improve community livelihoods and provide incentives not to poach.

AB  - Aim Self-harm is common among adolescents and young adults and carries increased risk of suicide and other negative outcomes, yet only a small proportion will seek professional help. General practitioners (GPs) are a potentially valuable source of help as most young people visit their GP regularly for other reasons. The primary aim of this research was to explore GPs' empathy and attitudes towards young people who self-harm and how these are related to GP specialist training.
   Method GPs completed questionnaires regarding their training, levels of empathy, perceived knowledge and attitudes towards young people who self-harm. The cross-sectional design included a random sample of 178 GPs and 47 GPs-in-training in the Republic of Ireland. Bootstrapped mediation analysis using structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied to explore the pattern of relationships among GP-training, empathy, perceived knowledge of self-harm and attitudes towards youth who self-harm.
   Results The SEM results revealed that the model had a very good fit to the data. Empathy was the strongest predictor of attitudes towards self-harm even if GPs had received youth mental health training and fully mediated the effect of youth mental health training on perceived knowledge of self-harm. Specialized training in self-harm was a stronger predictor of perceived knowledge than empathy but had no association with negative attitudes.
   Conclusions The findings emphasize positive outcomes associated with GP training and highlight potential differences in the effects associated with specific vs general training in youth mental health. These differences may be used to inform the design and implementation of continuing professional development.

AB  - To ensure the best market conditions for their fish, vessel owners are incentivized to create Fish Producer Organizations (PO), with obvious market advantages for fishers. However, the management of POs is not an easy task. This paper aims to understand how adaptation to environmental and market changes among POs relates to their capacities (or failures) to manage production and market demand. Drawing on an analytical framework developed by the authors, twelve Portuguese POs are compared in terms of context, structure, evidence of crisis and adaptability of response. Results revealed three modes of adaptation amongst POs (anticipatory, maladaptation and reactive adaptation) and identified key reasons explaining different degrees of adaptability in POs: 1) prejudiced market regime and 2) prevalence of the sardine fishery, as contextual conditions; 3) evidence of market crisis; 4) leadership, 5) trust and 6) perception of self-interest; 7) learning, based on shared experience, and 8) collaboration with demand side. Internal adaptation could improve PO contribution to sustainable fisheries management, but it is not a panacea. Official market regime and the internal structure of POs need to change as they sustain overfishing as well as fisher vulnerability and self-interest. The adaptive strategies evident in some of the POs, both intentional and agency-reliant, demonstrate ways to deal with these problems. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim. To explore primary family caregivers' observations and perceptions of their older relatives' knee osteoarthritis pain and pain management.
   Background. Osteoarthritis is one of the most common joint disorders in older people. Studies have mainly focused on spouses' or partners' perceptions of older individuals' osteoarthritis pain.
   Design. Qualitative description.
   Methods. Primary family caregivers of older outpatients with osteoarthritis (N = 28) were recruited by convenience from one medical centre in northern Taiwan and two regional hospitals in northern and eastern Taiwan in 2012. Data were collected in individual interviews using a semi-structured guide and analysed by content analysis.
   Results. Primary family caregivers observed that their older relatives commonly mentioned that osteoarthritis pain interfered with their walking ability, daily activities, moods, sleep and social activities. Older adults commonly shared their pain with their family members. Participants observed that their older relatives with osteoarthritis used limited pain-management strategies to relieve pain, but participants provided few pain-management strategies to help their relatives. Most participants had limited knowledge about osteoarthritis pain. Some participants and their older relatives held negative attitudes towards using pain medicines. Most participants suggested that other families should bring their older relatives with osteoarthritis pain to see a doctor as soon as possible.
   Conclusion. Our results show that family caregivers were the main support for older people with osteoarthritis. Interventions should educate patients and family members about osteoarthritis causes, common misconceptions about osteoarthritis, osteoarthritis pain medicines and treatment and encourage family members' support.

AB  - Aim. This paper reports a study testing the validity and reliability of the Italian version of the Kogan Attitude towards Older People scale. Background. Nursing students attitudes towards older people can affect their preference for working with them. One of the most common instruments used to assess these attitudes is the Kogan Attitude towards Older People scale. Previous validation studies performed on college students internationally have demonstrated good reliability and validity. The psychometric properties of the Italian version have not yet been tested. Design. A cross-sectional, descriptive study. Method. The study was conducted from MarchJune 2010 with a convenience sample of nursing students attending two Italian universities. Reliability was evaluated using internal consistency and item-to-total correlation. Content and construct validity were evaluated using a content validity index and principal factor analysis. Results. A total of 1637 nursing students participated in the study. Two factors were extracted from the factor analysis: prejudice describing a negative disposition and appreciation indicating a favourable feeling and opinion towards older people. Conclusion. The Kogan Attitude towards Older People scale applied to Italian nursing students exhibited good internal consistency. The two-dimensional construct of the scale was congruent with some, but not all, results of previous studies due to methodological differences among the studies. Based on the study findings, the scale can be recommended for future research studies in Italy including use as pre/post-test measurement associated with nursing education programmes.

AB  - A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 759 Australian horse owners to determine their biosecurity practices and perceptions one year after the 2007 equine influenza outbreak and to investigate the factors influencing these perceptions and practices. A web link to an online questionnaire was sent to 1224 horse owners as a follow-up to a previous study to obtain information about biosecurity perceptions and practices, impacts of the 2007 El outbreak, demographic information and information about horse industry involvement. Ordinal logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine factors associated with poor biosecurity practices. Biosecurity compliance (low, medium, high), as determined by horse owners' responses to a 16-item question on the frequency of various biosecurity measures, was used as the outcome variable in ordinal logistic regression analyses. Variables with a univariable p-value <= 0.2 were eligible for inclusion in multivariable models built using a manual stepwise approach. Variables with a p-value <0.05 in multivariable models were retained in the final model. Two potential confounders - age and gender of participants - were included in the final model irrespective of their p-values.
   Thirty percent of the respondents had low biosecurity compliance and were performing biosecurity practices 'not very often' or 'never'. Younger people, people with two or more children, those who were not involved with horses commercially and those who had no long-term business impacts resulting from the 2007 El outbreak were more likely to have lower biosecurity compliance. People who were not fearful of a future outbreak of equine influenza in Australia and those who thought their current hygiene and access control practices were not very effective in protecting their horses also had poor biosecurity practices.
   In this observational study we identified factors associated with a group of horse owners with low levels of biosecurity compliance. As this cross-sectional study only assesses associations, the identified factors should be further investigated in order to be considered in the design of extension activities to increase horse owners' biosecurity compliance.

AB  - Objectives: Previous research supports that subjective views on aging (VoA), such as older subjective age (SA) and negative attitudes toward own aging (ATOA), go along with negative outcomes. A differentiated treatment of health and disease as antecedents of VoA is largely lacking. Therefore, our objective was to estimate the relationship between generally framed physical, affective, and cognitive health as well as specific diseases and VoA, operationalized both as SA and ATOA.
   Methods: Data were drawn from the ActiFE Ulm study for which a representative sample of community-dwelling older people (65-90 years) was recruited at baseline. Follow-ups were conducted 7.7 years (median) after recruitment (N = 526). Health- and disease-related data at baseline, based on established assessment procedures for epidemiological studies, were regressed on VoA (1-item SA indicator, 5-item ATOA scale) measures at follow-up.
   Results: Reported severity of affective health problems such as depression was the strongest general risk factor for both older SA and negative ATOA. Also, some but not all major diseases considered were associated with VoA. Notably, back pain predicted negative ATOA, while cancer was associated with older SA. Rheumatism was linked with more negative ATOA along with higher SA. Throughout analyses, explained variance in ATOA was considerably higher than in SA.
   Discussion: Affective health problems, such as depression, should be regarded as a major correlate of subjective aging views. Interestingly, diseases do not have to be life-threatening to be associated with older SA or negative ATOA.

AB  - Published in 26 languages across 68 countries, Forbes is one of the most-read business periodicals globally, and in 2019, its annual Top 50 World's Most Influential CMOs list highlighted 31 female CMOs and 19 male CMOs who demonstrate industry-shaping leadership. In this article, we analyze the language used to describe the male and female CMOs on the list to determine whether certain words are commonly seen as gendered characteristics, as leadership traits, or as compliments. Using this data, we find that Forbes presents female CMOs in a gendered way and argue for the importance of strategically choosing leadership words for female marketing leaders.

AB  - The goal of this qualitative study was to assess physicians' perceptions around features of key screens within a prominent commercial EHR, and to solicit end-user recommendations for improved retrieval of high-priority clinical information. We conducted a qualitative, descriptive study of 25 physicians in a medical ICU setting. at a tertiary academic medical center. An in-depth, semi-structured interview guide was developed to elicit physician perceptions on information retrieval as well as favorable and unfavorable features of specific EHR screens. Transcripts were independently coded in a qualitative software management tool by at least two trained coders using a common code book. We successfully obtained vendor permission to map physicians perception's on full Epic (c) screenshots. Among the 25 physician participants (13 female; 5 attending physicians, 9 fellows, 11 residents), the majority of participants reported experiencing challenges finding clinical information in the EHR. We present the most favorable and unfavorable screen-level features for four central EHR screens: Flowsheet, Notes/Chart Review, Results Review, and Vital Signs. We also compiled participants' recommendations for a comprehensive EHR dashboard screen to better support clinical workflow and information retrieval in the medical ICU through User-Centered Design. ICU physicians demonstrated a mix of positive and negative attitudes toward specific screen-level features in a major vendor-based EHR system. Physician perceptions of information overload emerged as a theme across multiple EHR screens. Our findings underscore the importance of qualitative research and end-user feedback in EHR software design and interface optimization at both the vendor and institutional level.

AB  - The Maroni basin, an isolated region which lies between Suriname and French Guiana, has been affected by the HIV epidemic 10 years after coastal French Guiana. However, the rise in HIV prevalence was sharp with a prevalence exceeding 1% within 10 years. Stigma and discrimination towards people living with HIV (PLWHIV) or "suspected to have HIV" is rampant as reported by health professionals or non-governmental organisations. The objective of this article is to present the first quantitative data from the general population of this region on stigma towards people living with HIV. Data were collected in 2012 by a structured questionnaire among a random sample of 896 individuals residing in remote villages on the Maroni River. Proportion comparisons between the Maroni sample and the sample from the general population on the coastline in 2011 were conducted. Simple and multivariate logistic regression models were used to predict stigmatising attitudes. For all situations involving PLWHIV, the proportion of negative attitudes was significantly higher on the Maroni than in coastal French Guiana (p < 0.001). Findings indicate that the different levels of knowledge, erroneous beliefs and poor situation (not having electricity in one's home; not having French health insurance) were associated with stigmatising attitudes. The present data could help both sides coordinate interventions both at the individual level by improving knowledge and at the community level to change norms in order to reduce stigma and discrimination aiming for increased impact.

AB  - Background. The South African (SA) government introduced Implanon NXT, a long-acting subdermal contraceptive implant, in 2014 to expand contraceptive choice. Following an initial high uptake, its use declined considerably amid reports of early removals and frequent side-effects. We examine providers' perceptions of training and attitudes towards Implanon NXT, as well as their views on the causes of early removals and the impact on the implant service.
   Objective. To assess healthcare providers' perceptions and attitudes towards implant services in SA.
   Methods. In-depth interviews were conducted with eight nurses providing implant services in public facilities in Gauteng and North West Province. Emerging themes were identified, manually coded and thematically analysed following an interpretivism approach.
   Results. Nurses lacked confidence in providing implant services effectively, particularly removals, which they ascribed to the brief, cascade-type training received. Nurses generally held negative views towards the method. They also reported that side-effects are the most common reason for early removals - particularly irregular bleeding - and that men often do not support their partners who use the method. Lastly, it was found that providers require guidance on counselling regarding the method and standardised guidelines on the management of side-effects.
   Conclusion. Retraining and support of providers are needed to address competency gaps and negative attitudes towards the method. Assessment of providers' readiness to perform removal procedures is also important. Finally, effective plans are necessary to improve implant continuation rates, especially among women whose partners are unsupportive.

AB  - Background: Indigenous women in New South Wales Australia are nearly four times more likely to die from cervical cancer than non-Indigenous women due to lower screening rates. We aimed to understand Indigenous women's cervical screening awareness, behaviours, knowledge, perceptions, motivators and barriers since the December 2017 National Cervical Screening Program changed to HPV testing, new screening age and screening interval, and introduced the new self-collection test.
   Methods: A qualitative study was conducted with 94 Indigenous women 25 to 74 years of age across metropolitan, regional and remote New South Wales. A team of six specialist researchers conducted the fieldwork, analysis and reporting. All data were coded thematically.
   Findings: Participants showed limited awareness of the renewed cervical screening program and the role of cervical screening in cervical cancer prevention, with most having a strong negative attitude towards cervical screening. Several motivators and behavioural barriers to screening were identified into four audience segments based on key characteristics. Most participants eligible to self-collect were unwilling to, due to concerns they would administer it incorrectly, injure themselves or have to return for a more invasive test.
   Interpretation: This study demonstrates the complex and heterogenous nature of attitudes and behaviours, among Indigenous women and highlights the intrinsic negative attitudes and social norms that are currently shaping community discourse and ultimately limiting screening. Our findings support the need for enhancing positive sentiment and community advocacy. (C) 2021 Cancer Institute NSW. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Approximately 545,000 women and girls in the USA have undergone Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) or have mothers from a country where FGM/C is practiced. Women and girls living with FGM/C in the USA may experience stigma and bias due to their FGM/C, immigration, racial, and language status. Health care provider attitudes toward FGM/C and confidence for related clinical care may affect the quality of care, yet there are no validated instruments to measure these constructs.
   Methods: We developed the instruments via review of the FGM/C literature, the development of scale items, expert review, and pre-testing. We validated the instruments using a convenience sample of providers in Arizona and Maryland. We used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to confirm factor structures, and compared scores between known groups to assess validity.
   Results: The EFA revealed a two-factor solution for attitudes, including subscales for Negative Attitudes and Empathetic Attitudes toward FGM/C and those who practice with Cronbach's alphas of 0.814 and 0.628 respectively. The EFA for confidence revealed a two-factor solution including Confidence in Clinical FGM/C Care and Confidence in Critical Communication Skills for FGM/C Care with Cronbach's alphas of 0.857 and 0.694 respectively.
   Conclusions: Health care provider attitudes and confidence toward FGM/C care may affect quality of care and health outcomes for women and girls. Our study describes the rigorous psychometric analysis to create reliable and valid instruments to assess health care provider attitudes and confidence for the care of women and girls who have experienced FGM/C.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine qualitatively how respondents create national distinctiveness using rhetorical identity strategies in the context of four Finnish national symbols. The data consist of 127 essays written by Finnish secondary school students. Analysis revealed five different strategies used to distinguish between the in-group and the out-group. These strategies differ on two dimensions: the level of polarization, and the extent to which the in-group-out-group relationship is depicted as being active versus passive. Furthermore, the analysis showed that the two dimensions of nationalism, particularism and universalism, have an important role in the differentiation processes and therefore highlighted the importance of taking into consideration ideological issues while studying social identities. The meaning of the contents of national identity in the differentiation processes is also discussed.

AB  - Objectives To investigate doctors' intentions to raise a patient safety concern by applying the socio-psychological model 'Theory of Planned Behaviour'. Design Qualitative semi-structured focus groups and interviews. Setting Training venues across England (North West, South East and South West). Participants Sampling was purposeful to include doctors from differing backgrounds and grades. Main outcome measures Perceptions of raising a patient safety concern. Results While raising a concern was considered an appropriate professional behaviour, there were multiple barriers to raising a concern, which could be explained by the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Negative attitudes operated due to a fear of the consequences, such as becoming professionally isolated. Disapproval for raising a concern was encountered at an interpersonal and organisational level. Organisational constraints of workload and culture significantly undermined the raising of a concern. Responses about concerns were often side-lined or not taken seriously, leading to demotivation to report. This was reinforced by high-profile cases in the media and the negative treatment of whistle-blowers. While regulator guidance acted as an enabler to justify raising a concern, doctors felt disempowered to raise a concern about people in positions of greater power, and ceased to report concerns due to a perceived lack of action about concerns raised previously. Conclusions Intentions to raise a concern were complex and highly contextual. The Theory of Planned Behaviour is a useful model to aid understanding of the factors which influence the decision to raise a concern. Results point to implications for policymakers, including the need to publicise positive stories of whistle-blowers and providing greater support to doctors.

AB  - In Germany, Turkish students are overrepresented on lowest school tracks. Research has provided evidence that stereotypical expectations can color judgments. We experimentally investigated whether student information that strongly confirmed or disconfirmed Turkish stereotypical expectations led to student teachers' judgments that were biased against nationality. Furthermore, we explored whether judging an expectation-confirming or expectation-disconfirming Turkish student resulted in changes in stereotypical beliefs. Results showed that student teachers' judgments were biased against nationality when it came to an expectation-confirming student and that the expectation-disconfirming student could change stereotypical beliefs into slightly more positive ones. Results are discussed with regard to their theoretical relevance as well as to their importance for teacher education.

AB  - A new interpretive technique called "corpus linguistics" has exploded in use over the past five years from state supreme courts and federal courts of appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court. Corpus linguistics involves searching a large database, or corpus, of text to identify patterns in the way in which a certain term is used in context. Proponents of the method argue that it is a more "empirical" approach than referencing dictionaries to determine a word's public meaning, which is a touchstone in originalist approaches to legal interpretation.
   This Article identifies an important concern about the use of corpus linguistics in legal interpretation that courts and scholarship have overlooked: bias. Using new machine learning techniques that analyze bias in text, this Article provides empirical evidence that the thousands of documents in the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA), the leading corpus currently used in judicial opinions, reflect gender bias. Courts and scholars have not considered that the COHA is sexist, raising the possibility that corpus linguistics methods could serve as a vehicle for infecting judicial opinions with longstanding prejudices in U.S. society.
   In addition to raising this important new problem, this Article charts a course for dealing with it. It explains how hidden biases can be made transparent and introduces steps for "debiasing" corpora used in legal interpretation. More broadly, it shows how the methods introduced here can be used to study biases in all areas of the law, raising the prospect of a revolution in our understanding of how discriminatory biases affect legal decisionmaking.

AB  - Seeking ethics committee approval for research can be challenging even for relatively simple studies occurring in single settings. Complicating factors such as multicentre studies and/or contentious research issues can challenge review processes, and conducting such studies internationally adds a further layer of complexity. This paper draws on the experiences of the LINNAEUS Collaboration, an international group of primary care researchers, in obtaining ethics approval to conduct an international study investigating medical error in general practice in six countries. It describes the ethics review processes applied to exactly the same research protocol for a study run in Australia, Canada, England, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the US. Wide variation in ethics review responses to the research proposal occurred, from no approval being deemed necessary to the study plan narrowly avoiding rejection. The authors' experiences demonstrated that ethics committees operate in their own historical and cultural context, which can lead to radically different subjective interpretations of commonly-held ethical principles, and raised further issues such as 'what is research?'. This first LINNAEUS study started when patient safety was a particularly sensitive subject. Although it is now a respectable area of inquiry, patient safety is still a topic that can excite emotions and prejudices. The LINNAEUS Collaboration now extends to more countries and continues to pursue an international research agenda, so reflection on the influences of history, social context, and structure of each country's ethical review processes is timely.

AB  - Background and ObjectivesHeroin use is a severe problem worldwide. To develop more effective treatments for heroin abusers, a comprehensive psychosocial model of heroin use should be established and examined. We created and assessed a neuroticism, depression, attitudes, and heroin addiction (NDA) model.
   MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, 234 patients undergoing methadone replacement treatment were recruited from psychiatric clinics. We used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to assess all for neuroticism, depression, and a positive outcome expectancy (POE) (attitudes).
   ResultsThe full model had acceptable goodness-of-fit indices, but neuroticism was not significantly associated with a POE or heroin use. A reduced model that deleted insignificant paths had better goodness-of-fit indices, and neuroticism had indirect effects on heroin use via depression and a POE
   ConclusionsOur findings provide evidence that depression, neuroticism, and POE affect heroin use. We also found that POE mediates between depression and heroin use. Despite the emotional regulation strategies recommended to help heroin abusers with depression to reduce the likelihood of their heroin use, teaching them with negative attitudes using heroin should also be considered when developing treatments for heroin abusers with depression.
   Scientific SignificanceOur findings provide a comprehensive mechanism of addiction that is integrated with emotion, cognition, and personality. Drug-related beliefs and emotional regulation can be targeted to reduce the likelihood of relapse in abusers with higher levels of neuroticism. (Am J Addict 2018;27:139-143)

AB  - Background and Objectives Gay and bisexual men (GBM) are deferred from donating blood in many countries. Perceptions by GBM that blood donor deferral policies are unjustifiably discriminatory, especially due to advances in HIV prevention, could contribute to non-compliance and need to be understood. We explore blood donation interest and history among GBM and attitudes towards donor deferral policies for the first time in New Zealand (NZ). Materials and Methods Data from a cross-sectional online survey of GBM in NZ were examined. We constructed three groups: (1) never donated blood and not interested; (2) never donated but expressed interest; and (3) previously donated blood. We tested these for association with demographic and behavioural variables, as well as attitudes towards blood donation policy. Results A total of 607 GBM were eligible for the study, of whom 32.9% reported having donated blood previously, 44.3% had never donated blood but expressed interest and 22.7% expressed no interest in donating. Among previous donors, a third (8.6% of the total sample) reported non-compliance with the deferral policy. Most participants found the 12-month deferral policy to be too strict (81.8%), unfair (75.4%) and homophobic (68.8%). Conclusion We estimate that, for the first time in NZ, almost 10% of the sample did not report compliance with the 12-month deferral policy for men who have sex with men (MSM). Negative attitudes towards the deferral policy were common and could potentially increase the risk to the blood supply if compliance reduces. Further work is needed to inform a deferral policy that is accepted by GBM while maintaining the safety of NZ's blood supply.

AB  - Social workers have a critical role on medical teams for facilitating effective conversations about advance care planning (ACP) in palliative and end-of-life care. Engaging patients in such conversations may be influenced by clinicians' attitudes. During the COVID19 pandemic, the need to examine barriers to serious illness care across healthcare settings and areas of specialty practice became abundantly clear. This study examines: (1) social workers' attitudes about ACP and (2) factors that influence the completion of advance directives (ADs). Using a cross-sectional study design, we surveyed 142 social workers on their knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to ADs. Using exploratory factor analyses, we identified 2 provider practice attitudes factors, 3 perceived barriers factors, and 2 perceived importance of AD factors. We then used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each of the factors in association with the frequency social workers reported educating patients about ADs. While various positive and negative attitudes and barriers toward educating patients are important factors to consider, social workers' perceptions of the importance of engaging patients in ACP education was the most important factor that influenced their behaviors. The odds of always/often (vs. sometimes/rarely/never) educating patients about ADs in their practice were greater for those social workers who reported they see the importance of AD decision-making (OR = 3.21, 95%CI = 1.83-5.62) and confirming goals-of-care (OR = 1.76, 95%CI = 1.03-3.01). Social worker's ACP knowledge and skills for educating patients are important in initiating conversations prior to a health crisis, especially important for developing a comprehensive care plan.

AB  - Objectives: The authors compared attitudes of the U.S. general public and of mental health professionals about the competence and perceived dangerousness of people with mental health problems and the desire for social distance from them. Factors related to negative attitudes and the desire for social distance also were examined. Methods:. Vignettes describing individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depression and schizophrenia were included in the 2006 General Social Survey (GSS) and a 2009 study of mental health professionals, and responses were descriptively compared (GSS, N=397 responses to depression vignette, N=373 responses to schizophrenia vignette; 731 mental health professionals responded to both vignettes). Regression analyses examined whether demographic and provider characteristics were associated with perceptions of less competence and perceived dangerousness of the vignette character and with respondents' desire for social distance. Results: Compared with the American public, mental health professionals had significantly more positive attitudes toward people with mental health problems. However, some providers' conceptions about the dangerousness of people with schizophrenia and provider desire for social distance from clients in work and personal situations were concerning. Younger age, self-identifying as non-Hispanic white, being female, having at least a four-year college degree, being familiar with mental illness, and certain job titles and more years of experience in the mental health field were predictive of more positive conceptions. Conclusions: Although mental health professionals held more positive attitudes than the general public about people with mental health problems, strong stereotypes persisted in both groups, especially concerning schizophrenia. This study identified several demographic and provider characteristics that can inform intervention strategies in both groups.

AB  - Purpose This study investigates the use of gamification in promoting the silver generation's adoption of mobile payment technology through the gamified cultural practice of gifting red packets. It considers the effectiveness of using gamification in a cultural context to promote technology acceptance among older adults. This crossover between digital technology and cultural traditions brings unique gaming elements to the adoption of technology. Design/methodology/approach Drawing upon technology acceptance Model (TAM) and prospect theory, a research model is evaluated using structural equation modeling. Data were collected via survey from elderly consumers who are current users of WeChat but are yet to use its mobile payment functions. Findings The results reveal the perceived effectiveness of gamification is determined by the perceived enjoyment of the game and contributes to users' attitude development, directly and through its perceived usefulness. Perceived risks were identified as a barrier to converting positive attitude into adoption intention. Research limitations/implications The findings contribute to the conceptualization and understanding of the effectiveness of gamification in technology adoption, specifically among the silver generation. Originality/value In contrast with previous gamification studies on gamified experience, this study introduces a new conceptualization of the perceived effectiveness of gamification and its measurement. This study validates game engagement as being effective in encouraging seniors to adopt a technology. In an era of an aging population where digitization is a norm, improving the digital literacy and digital inclusion of elders by encouraging them to adopt technology is essential to developing a more accessible and inclusive social environment.

KW  - multi-task learning
AB  - Discretion, namely discretionary power, indicates that administrative agencies could make modifiable decisions under personal judgment when facing situations defined in the law. It plays an essential part in an administrative practice that existing laws and regulations could hardly cover all cases. However, this may also cause the abuse of enforcement power. The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and databases has provided a powerful tool to measure discretionary power, such as judging if a given administrative punishment is appropriate, and recommending similar cases for a new law-violation record. In this paper, we develop a multi-task framework to extract contrastive patterns from historical records and recommend unprocessed penalties. There is massive ambiguity in collected records, where the limited samples of specific penalties and a large number of whole records make it hard to distinguish factors in individual administrative enforcement actions. We propose an automatic data-labeling method based on data pattern discovery, clustering, and statistical analysis to replace manual labeling under potential personal prejudice. We estimate the distribution of collected penalty records to distinguish deviated and reasonable ones, then produce contrastive samples, which are fed into different network branches. We build a complete IoT platform and collect three-year administrative penalty records nationwide as an empirical evaluation. Experiments show that our proposed methods can learn reasonable discretion by measuring the objectiveness in samples and combining it with a joint training strategy. The final results of penalty amount forecasting and penalty reasonableness judging tasks reach ready-to-use performance.

TI  - THE ILLEGALITY DEFENCE IN CORPORATE LAW CLAIMS AGAINST DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS
T2  - HONG KONG LAW JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - If a company incurs substantial fines or other pecuniary losses as a result of its unlawful conduct, can the company obtain an indemnity from its director' officer for having caused the company to incur such fines and losses? In particular, can the director/officer utilise the defence of illegality, notwithstanding that he has breached his duties owed to the company? The illegality defence, which raises the twin issues of the relationship between the unlawful act to the corporate claim and the attribution of the unlawful act to the company, has been the subject of detailed analysis recently in England, Singapore and Hong Kong. This article argues that absent clear legislative intention, there is no reason for English law to bar the claims against the delinquent director/officer, once regard is made to the relevant constituencies of the company. In particular, there is no reason for the illegality defence to operate if the result will prejudice the non complicit constituencies of the company, such as the creditors where company is insolvent or where the company has innocent participants. Likewise, it argues that in determining the proper scope of the attribution of the acts or knowledge of the delinquent director' officer to the company, regard should also be made to the relevant constituencies of the company. If the result is one that does not lead to the delinquent director' officer benefitting from the corporate claim, there is no reason to attribute the wrongdoing so as to bar the corporate claim.

AB  - The present study examined whether student evaluations of college teaching (SETs) reflected a bias predicated on the perceived race and gender of the instructor. Using anonymous, peer-generated evaluations of teaching obtained from RateMyProfessors.com, the present study examined SETs from 3,079 White; 142 Black; 238 Asian; 130 Latino; and 128 Other race faculty at the 25 highest ranked liberal arts colleges. Results showed that racial minority faculty, particularly Blacks and Asians, were evaluated more negatively than White faculty in terms of overall quality, helpfulness, and clarity, but were rated higher on easiness. A two-stage cluster analysis demonstrated that the very best instructors were likely to be White, whereas the very worst were more likely to be Black or Asian. Few effects of gender were observed, but several interactions emerged showing that Black male faculty were rated more negatively than other faculty. The results of the present study are consistent with the negative racial stereotypes of racial minorities and have implications for the tenure and promotion of racial minority faculty.

AB  - Aims and Objectives/Purpose/Research Questions: After years of conflict, struggle and separation, the partial opening of the Green Line that divides Cyprus made mutual transitions and contact between the Turkish and Greek Cypriots possible. Soon after, Greek and Turkish language courses started to attract interest and gained popularity. This study aims to identify the motivations that led both community members to learn the language of 'the other community' and discover their attitudes towards each other and the target language. Design/Methodology/Approach: A questionnaire that includes motivation and attitude scales and subscales on a five-point Likert-type scale was prepared both in Turkish and English. It was distributed to the Turkish and Greek Cypriots who were attending evening classes at that time. The study employed a quantitative approach. Data and Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS 18 statistical package. Frequency analysis and independent samples t-tests were applied. Results/Conclusions: Both community members have intrinsic motivation to continue the language classes. The participants express their enjoyment of the feeling of accomplishment that comes with learning to speak another language successfully in this regard. The Greek Cypriots are driven by their integrative motivation as they illustrate their wish to feel closer to the Turkish Cypriots and communicate with them. In terms of language attitudes, the Turkish Cypriots tend to exhibit more positive attitudes, mostly due to economic reasons. However, the fact that the Greek Cypriots do not cross the border seems to reveal their negative attitudes towards the Turkish Cypriots. Overall, the members of both communities are hesitant to express their opinions about each other.

AB  - Introduction: management of tuberculosis (TB) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) within primary health care (PHC) facilities involve nursing students as part of them integrating theory to practice. Clinical learning for nursing students requires adequate support from the Nursing Education Institution (NEI) and nursing professionals. Given the dearth of literature regarding clinical support for nursing students in the management of TB/HIV in PHC setting, this study is aimed at exploring and describing nursing students' experiences regarding clinical support. Methods: a phenomenological design was used to explore and describe the experiences of nursing students using an individual, unstructured, in-depth interview. Audio-taped interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Atlas TI software. Results: themes derived from the study were factors inhibiting clinical support which incorporated shortage of professional nurses (PNs), lack of accompaniment, fear of managing TB/HIV patients and negative attitudes of PNs; outcomes of poor clinical support included inability to integrate TB/HIV theory to practice and lack of confidence among nursing students; nursing students' desired outcomes through clinical support included becoming a competent TB/HIV nurse and the ability to integrate TB/HIV theory to practice; and strategies to strengthen and promote clinical support in TB/HIV management through strengthened occupational health and safety learning, provision of knowledge regarding post-exposure prophylaxis and infection control, and appointed clinical PN for students in each facility. Conclusion: the development of policies for clinical support, increasing supervision, appointment of clinical preceptors and accompanists in facilities where nursing students are placed would promote clinical learning within the NEI and the production of competent and confident nurses.

AB  - The population of the Critically Endangered Mariana crow Corvus kubaryi on the island of Rota, Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands, has decreased dramatically in recent years. It is unclear to what extent negative practices by people, such as inappropriate land use or persecution of crows, have contributed to this decline. We conducted a public opinion survey to document ongoing practices towards the crows on Rota, to assess residents' knowledge of and attitudes towards the birds, and to gauge potential responses to a government-instituted land incentive programme. Enumerators administered surveys in person during August 2011. Most of the 573 respondents were native Chamorro residents (75%) and more than half were landowners (62%). A majority of respondents (72%) considered environmental issues very important' and 76% knew of the Mariana crow's Critically Endangered status. Fewer respondents (55%) expressed concern about the bird going extinct. A number of respondents condoned shooting and chasing crows (17 and 52%, respectively), suggesting that residents may be harassing the birds. Chamorro landowners on the island were more likely to have negative attitudes towards the crows and to know people who persecute the crows than other island residents. Education was positively correlated with knowledge and concern about the crow and environmental issues, suggesting that new educational programmes on Rota may help improve residents' attitudes towards the species. In addition, we recommend a revision of current land-use regulations and implementation of a monetary compensation programme for owners of crow nesting habitat to improve landowners' attitudes and practices.

T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA  - English
KW  - HEALTH
AB  - Background: The continuous increase in number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) represents a serious health and economic burden. HIV positive individuals with oral lesions have significantly lower oral health-related quality of life than HIV positive individuals without oral lesions. The objective of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) within a cohort of HIV/AIDS positive patients towards HIV/AIDS associated oral lesions.
   Methods: Two hundred seventy patients attending a national referral hospital of infectious disease in Malaysia were recruited for the study. The study involved the administration of a validated interview-based questionnaire designed to elicit knowledge, attitude and practices of these patients towards HIV associated oral lesions. The last part of the questionnaire assessed the training provided to the patients in relation to the oral lesions associated with the disease and the effectiveness of this training. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS version 18.
   Results: Thirty seven percent of patients were reported as knowledgeable, while sixty four percent reported to have positive attitude towards the care of oral hygiene. Sixty six percent of the patients reported that they would seek professional care when experiencing oral lesion. Training was reported effective for 93% patients.
   Conclusions: Patients were non-knowledgeable in relation to oral manifestations of the disease and one third of the participating patients showed negative attitudes towards oral health care and reported various measures to manage oral lesions rather than seeking professional care. Developing effective educational methodologies can empower patients with knowledge that may translate to positive attitudes and practices.

TI  - Performing a Viking History of America: The 1893 Voyage and Display of a Viking Longship at the Columbus Quadricentennial
T2  - THEATRE JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - MUSEUM
AB  - When the Norwegian sea captain Magnus Andersen reflected back in his published account of his endeavor to reconstruct a ninth-century Viking longship and sail it to the United States to perform at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago two years earlier, he concluded that one thing alone had made the effort worth it: his countrymen, the Norwegian immigrants in America, transcended the inferior position of belonging to a "small and unknown nation" and for a moment enjoyed the limelight on the world stage. "It is difficult for an immigrant or settler in a foreign land to make a living," he wrote, "when he meets prejudice on account of his nationality" Performing belonging has been a key component of the relatively recent fields of both experimental archaeology and performance as research. This essay investigates a modern instantiation of this type of historical belonging: the journey of the reconstructed Norse vessel Viking at the world's fair in 1893. Here, in perhaps the first-ever effort in experimental archaeology and performance as research, the re-performance of the past played out in a transatlantic world of cultural contacts, exchanges, and migrations. Despite Andersen's claims that the project was all about Norwegian Americans, the story of a Viking ship traversing the ocean also became not only a self-conscious articulation for Norwegian independence from Sweden, but was also seized on by the Protestant East Coast elites of the United States, who, in fear of decline, could find in it a counter-narrative to the story that Christopher Columbus had discovered America.

AB  - Background: A challenge in human genome research is how to describe the populations being studied. The use of improper and/or imprecise terms has the potential to both generate and reinforce prejudices and to diminish the clinical value of the research. The issue of population descriptors has not attracted enough academic attention outside North America and Europe. In January 2012, we held a two-day workshop, the first of its kind in Japan, to engage in interdisciplinary dialogue between scholars in the humanities, social sciences, medical sciences, and genetics to begin an ongoing discussion of the social and ethical issues associated with population descriptors.
   Discussion: Through the interdisciplinary dialogue, we confirmed that the issue of race, ethnicity and genetic research has not been extensively discussed in certain Asian communities and other regions. We have found, for example, the continued use of the problematic term, "Mongoloid" or continental terms such as "European," "African," and "Asian," as population descriptors in genetic studies. We, therefore, introduce guidelines for reporting human genetic studies aimed at scientists and researchers in these regions.
   Conclusion: We need to anticipate the various potential social and ethical problems entailed in population descriptors. Scientists have a social responsibility to convey their research findings outside of their communities as accurately as possible, and to consider how the public may perceive and respond to the descriptors that appear in research papers and media articles.

AB  - Based on more than 280,000 newspaper articles published in North America, this study proposes an integrative machine learning framework to explore heterogeneous social sentiments over time. After retrieving and preprocessing articles containing the term "Chinese" from six mainstream newspapers, we identified major discussion topics and assigned articles to their corresponding topics via posterior probabilities estimated by using a novel Bayesian nonparametric model, the hierarchical Dirichlet process. We also employed a groundbreaking deep learning technique, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, to assign a negative or positive sentiment score to each newspaper article, which was trained on binary-labeled movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). By combining state-of-the-art tools for topic modeling and sentiment analysis, we found an overall lack of consensus on whether sentiments in North America since 1978 were pro- or anti-Chinese. Moreover, the images of Chinese are highly topic specific: (1) sentiments across different topics show distinct trajectories over the period of study; (2) discussion topics explain much more of the variation in sentiments than do the publisher, year of publication, or country of publisher; (3) less positive sentiments appear to be more relevant to material concerns than to ethnic considerations, whereas more positive sentiments are associated with an appreciation of culture; and (4) sentiments on the same or similar topic might exhibit different temporal patterns in the United States and Canada. These new findings not only suggest a multifaceted and dynamic view of social sentiments in a transnational context but also call for a paradigm shift in understanding intertwined sociodiscursive interactions over time.

AB  - Historically, the legal system justified family law's rules and policies through morality, common sense, and prevailing cultural norms. In a sharp departure, and consistent with a broader trend across the legal system, empirical evidence increasingly dominates the regulation of families.
   There is much to celebrate in this empirical turn. Properly used, empirical evidence in family law can help the state act more effectively and efficiently, unmask prejudice, and depoliticize contentious battles. But the empirical turn also presents substantial concerns. Beyond perennial issues of the quality of empirical evidence and the ability of legal actors to use it, there are more fundamental problems: Using empirical evidence focuses attention on the outcomes of legal rules, discouraging a debate about contested and competing values. Reliance on empirical evidence overlays a veneer of neutrality on normative judgments. And uncritically adopting evidence about present conditions without interrogating the role of historical discrimination that continues to disadvantage some families can replicate that discrimination.
   Given the promise and peril of the empirical turn in family law, this Essay proposes a framework to guide the use of this evidence. The framework preserves space for debating multiple values and advises decisionmakers when to use empirical evidence, with particular attention to the dangers for nondominant families. The framework also recommends strengthening evidentiary gatekeeping and elevating the potential for legal scholarship to serve as a bridge from the broader research base to the courts. With this guidance in place, empirical evidence can take its rightful place as a useful but cabined tool in the legal regulation of families.

AB  - Objectives:Italy's 2015 emergency contraception (EC) policy made EC available without prescription for individuals aged 18 years and older; however, women living in Italy continue to face barriers to accessing EC. The purposes of this study were to understand EC knowledge, attitudes and behaviours among women living in Italy and explore the impact of the 2015 policy. Methods:Researchers conducted 30 interviews with women living in Florence, Italy, aged 18-50 years and using the Italian health care system. Researchers used an expanded grounded theory approach to understand women's EC experiences, with diffusion of innovations (DOI) serving as a conceptual lens. Researchers completed open and axial coding to identify emerging themes. Results:Participants had low awareness of the 2015 EC policy and suggested increased messaging in strategic locations to overcome this barrier. They held positive and negative attitudes towards EC: while some perceived the advantage of EC compared with unintended pregnancy, others expressed concerns about irresponsible behaviour and safety. Finally, conscientious objection impacted access, despite women's desire for autonomous EC decision making. Conclusion:The findings offer practical recommendations to guide EC messaging in Italy to increase women's access to EC. Recommendations include using theory- and audience-based methods to overcome gaps in policy knowledge and real and perceived barriers to EC access. Incorporating DOI as a theoretical framework with women's voices presents a novel opportunity to enhance policy and EC dissemination.

AB  - Attitudes, and attitudinal change towards persons with disabilities, is an important area of research as it can potentially enable greater understanding of the constraints that may preclude full participation in society. In the realm of sport and recreation mega sporting events have been suggested as a potential catalyst for positive societal change and shifting negative attitudes. Much of the event research to date, however, has focused on able-bodied sport events, with parasport events being largely overlooked. As a result, the impact of major parasport events on attitudinal change towards persons with a disability is assumed by sport practitioners, policy-makers and politicians but not justified by empirical evidence. The current study thus presents a starting point by examining the benefits of hosting mega sport events and in particular focuses on an important event stakeholder group; volunteers. More specifically, the current study addresses volunteer's perceptions of attitudes towards disability at two major parasport events: the 2014 Commonwealth Games (where parasport was integrated with the able-bodied sport) and the 2015 Pan Am/ParaPan American Games (where parasport was separated from the able-bodied sport). Data were collected at two time points for each event: pre-Games, and post-Games. Results revealed that both events had an impact on volunteer awareness levels of disability and accessibility-related issues, as well as positively impacting attitudes towards persons with disability. Interestingly, the integrated events at the Commonwealth Games appeared to impact attitudes to a greater degree than the non-integrated events at the ParaPan Am Games. Implications are discussed pertaining to the impact of an integrated vs. non-integrated major parasport event on disability/accessibility awareness, and attitudes towards disability.

AB  - The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is increasingly depended upon by education policy makers to provide reliable measures of their country's education system against international benchmarks. PISA attempts to provide efficient, scientific and technical means to develop educational policies which achieve optimal outcomes (Berg & Timmermans, 2000, p. 31). This kind of scientific evidence is seen by policy makers as being free of prejudice and ideology. Science is expected to represent the truth, state universal facts and make predictions. Thus PISA seeks to rank countries' performances, work out future scenarios and offer policy direction. By what means does PISA gain knowledge and speak with confidence about diverse cultures and distant nations? How does it acquire a voice from nowhere (Haraway, 1988; Suchman, 2000), and become a modern-day Oracle that countries might consult for policy advice? Modelled on early actor-network accounts of laboratory life, this ethnography traces how PISA knowledge comes to be made, guided by interview data with two insiders in the PISA laboratory. It traces the translations and the circulating reference that turn PISA into a centre of calculation. It highlights how human and non-human entities are imbricated in the assembling of scientific facts and argues for a suspension of the divide between science and politics. In the process, the paper offers an empirical instantiation of how some concepts from actor-network theory may be applied in the field of education policy, and ponders the implications of such an understanding for evidence based policy making.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine the impact an individual's long-term orientation (a cultural dimension) has on their attitude, behavioral intention and actual voluntary security actions taken in the context of the dangers related to poor account access management. Design/methodology/approach The paper relied upon survey data and actual usage information from a culturally diverse sample of 227 individuals who were introduced to the specific security problem and the accepted solution of using a password manager application. Findings The paper provides empirical evidence that the effect of positive attitudes increased when individuals were more long-term oriented, but the effect was reversed for average/negative attitudes toward the voluntary security behavior. Furthermore, participants with high long-term orientation and strong positive attitudes toward the security action actually adopted password manager applications 57 per cent more than the average adoption rate across the sample. Research limitations/implications - Due to the research approach (survey data), security context and sample population, the research results may lack generalizability. Practical implications - The findings suggest that security awareness messaging and training should account for differences in long- term orientation of the target audience and integrate the distinctly different types of messages that have been shown to improve an individual's participation in voluntary security actions. Originality/value - The paper addresses previous research calls for examining possible cultural differences that impact security behaviors and is the only study that has focused on the impact of long- term orientation, specifically on voluntary security actions.

AB  - In 2019, Colombia approved the combination of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine for HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP). Therefore, we conducted a situational analysis in HIV-care providers to identify barriers and facilitators for PrEP implementation. A survey was applied to a non-probabilistic sample of health care workers of HIV-specialized clinics. We examined PrEP awareness and familiarity, comfort with PrEP-related activities, perceived barriers for PrEP implementation, concerns, and attitudes. Poisson regressions assessed the relationship between these factors and the variable "having a plan to offer PrEP". The participation rate was 41% and included physicians (42.6%) and other health professionals (57.4%). Fifty-one percent of the participants reported more than five years of experience caring for people living with HIV. Forty-two percent of non-physician health care workers were nurses. Most reported high familiarity/comfort with PrEP-relevant activities. Concerns about PrEP were prevalent (> 50%) and included causing more harm than good, reducing condom use, medication non-adherence, drug resistance, and healthcare system barriers. Physicians had a plan to offer PrEP (72.2%) more often than other health professionals (52.6). Having a plan to offer PrEP was related to PrEP knowledge and comfort assessing sexual behavior and providing HIV counseling. Overall, about half of HIV-care providers seemed ready to offer PrEP and constitute an asset for PrEP implementation efforts in Colombia. PrEP awareness among non-physicians, PrEP concerns, and negative attitudes need to be addressed to enhance implementation.

AB  - Aims: The objective was to evaluate a campaign designed to influence social norms and re-establish boundaries around the issue of unwanted sexual attention in pubs and clubs. In particular, the campaign aimed to raise awareness, and reduce the acceptability, of unwanted sexual attention when drunk.
   Methods: A before-after-with-control group study design was used to evaluate campaign effectiveness. The data was further segmented to explore gender differences and between individuals who reported enjoying going out to get drunk and those who did not.
   Results: The experimental group with campaign recall demonstrated a significant change in their attitudes to harmful drinking behaviours and unwanted sexual attention compared to the control group. A number of gender differences as well as drink-enjoyment-related differences pre- and post-campaign were observed. Female respondents who were able to recall the campaign demonstrated a significantly lower tolerance of unwanted sexual attention than those who were unable to recall it in either the experimental or control regions. The campaign had limited impact on people who enjoy drunken night outs (DNOs). However, those who do not enjoy DNOs demonstrated significantly higher negative attitudes towards harmful drinking post-campaign recall.
   Conclusion: The campaign was effective in shifting attitudes towards unwanted sexual attention and harmful drinking behaviour. This was particularly observed among female respondents and those who do not enjoy DNOs.
   Short summary: Drinkaware's 'You Wouldn't Sober, You Shouldn't Drunk' behavioural change campaign targets young adults living in North-West England participating in 'drunken nights out'. The experimental group with campaign recall demonstrated a significant change in their attitudes to harmful drinking behaviours and unwanted sexual attention compared to the control group.

AB  - Following the shooting of Mark Duggan by police on 4 August 2011, there were riots in many large cities in the UK. As the rioting was widely perceived to be perpetrated by the urban poor, links were quickly made with Britain's welfare policies. In this paper, we examine whether the riots, and the subsequent media coverage, influenced attitudes toward welfare recipients. Using the British Social Attitudes survey, we use multivariate difference-in-differences regression models to compare attitudes toward welfare recipients among those interviewed before (pre-intervention: i.e. prior to 6 August) and after (post-intervention: 10 August-10 September) the riots occurred (N53,311). We use variation in exposure to the media coverage to test theories of media persuasion in the context of attitudes toward welfare recipients. Before the riots, there were no significant differences between newspaper readers and non-readers in their attitudes towards welfare recipients. However, after the riots, attitudes diverged. Newspaper readers became more likely than non-readers to believe that those on welfare did not really deserve help, that the unemployed could find a job if they wanted to and that those on the dole were being dishonest in claiming benefits. Although the divergence was clearest between right-leaning newspaper and non-newspaper readers, we do not a find statistically significant difference between right-and left-leaning newspapers. These results suggest that media coverage of the riots influenced attitudes towards welfare recipients; specifically, newspaper coverage of the riots increased the likelihood that readers of the print media expressed negative attitudes towards welfare recipients when compared with the rest of the population.

AB  - Purpose of Review While research has identified racial trauma in other contexts, it is often overlooked amongst Canadian society. Racial trauma occurs as a result of an event of racism or cumulative events over time whereby an individual experiences stress and consequent mental health sequelae. Given that the BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and/or Person of Colour) population in Canada is increasing, it is imperative to identify racial discrimination and the subsequent stress and trauma associated with being racialized in Canada, which subjects BIPOC Canadians to various forms of racism, including microaggressions.
   Recent Findings This paper reviews the published literature on racism and racial discrimination that identifies or infers racial trauma as the source of the mental health implications for various groups (e.g., Indigenous people, Black Canadians, Asian Canadians, immigrants, and refugees). In addition, intersectionality of racialized persons is prominent to their psychological well-being as their psychosocial and socioeconomic position are complex. Therefore, this paper both provides insight into the Canadian experience as a person of colour and signifies the need for further research on racial trauma in a Canadian context.
   Summary Despite Canada's emphasis on multiculturalism, racialized individuals are at risk for racial trauma due to prejudice and discrimination. The politicization of multiculturalism has permitted Canada to deny claims of racism, yet the historical basis of established institutions results in irrefutable systemic and systematic barriers for Canadian people of colour.

AB  - Ruminative thought patterns, defined as repetitive negative self-focused attention, are considered an avoidant coping strategy for managing stress. As trans and nonbinary (TNB) individuals commonly experience prejudice and discrimination in response to their gender identities (i.e. minority stressors), rumination over these stressors may contribute to heightened risk of psychopathology in these groups. Although rumination is a general risk factor for eating disorder (ED) psychopathology, no studies to date have examined whether eating- or genderrelated ruminative patterns relate to maintenance of ED psychopathology for TNB individuals. This crosssectional study investigated whether levels of rumination (both gender-related and ED-specific) mediated the relationship between minority stress and ED psychopathology. Method: Participants were 242 TNB adults (Mage = 24.92, SD = 6.5, Range = 18-70) recruited online, who completed measures of minority stress, gender-related rumination, ED-specific rumination, and ED psychopathology. We used Preacher-Hayes' approach to examine the parallel mediation model, with gender-related and ED-specific rumination as potential mediators. Results: Gender-related rumination did not mediate the relation between gender minority stress and ED psychopathology, Indirect B = -0.00 [95% BCa CI: -0.01, 0.00]; however, ED-specific rumination was significant, indicating partial mediation, Indirect B = 0.01 [95% BCa CI: 0.00, 0.02]. Conclusion: As gender minority stress and ED-specific rumination relate to ED psychopathology, it is essential that clinicians adopt an intersectional minority stress framework in understanding ED psychopathology among TNB individuals.

AB  - Transgender college students report higher rates of discrimination in gendered restrooms than do their cisgender peers. It is critical to understand factors that promote greater acceptance of transgender students using restrooms that align with their gender identity. The current experiment examined the impact of perceived social norms on both acceptance of transgender individuals using various locations and transphobia. Participants were 133 cisgender college students recruited on a college campus that had recently added all-gender restrooms to all campus buildings. Participants completed a prescreening measure of transphobia. During the experimental session, participants read results from a fictional study in which the social norm of their college campus was described as either in favor of (supportive norm) or against (unsupportive norm) the installation of all-gender restrooms on campus. Then participants completed measures of acceptance of transgender individuals in various spaces and transphobia. Supporting the primary hypothesis, relative to those in the unsupportive norm condition, participants in the supportive social norm condition were more accepting of transgender individuals using restrooms that aligned with their gender identity. However, the norm manipulation did not impact personal levels of transphobia between prescreen and post experimental manipulation. Implications and future directions will be discussed.

AB  - Ecological conditions and pathogen stress shape human cognition and behavior and can explain cultural and behavioral patterns cross-culturally. It has been previously shown that human values and preferences are also phenotypically plastic in response to parasitic stress across regions, and that parasite prevalence is associated with the out-group prejudice and nonconformity tolerance. Human preference for music is also variable across the world, and no previous study has considered this variability in the light of behavioral ecology. Research has shown that in the regions in which the parasite stress is higher, there is higher aversion against out-groups, and unusual and deviant behaviors. In the current study we hypothesized that extreme forms of music such as heavy metal, which is associated with antisocial behavior, irreligiosity, and deviation from the norm is less prevalent in the regions with higher prevalence of pathogenic stress. We tested our hypothesis using publicly available data measuring number and intensity of metal bands and parasite prevalence while controlling for importance of religion, human development index, and population size across European countries. Results showed that parasite stress negatively predicts the number of heavy metal bands. However, no relationship was found between the intensity of the music and parasite stress. We discussed our results in terms of association of parasite stress with tolerance to out-group members (metal community and culture) and with the openness to new musical endeavors. Overall, this study extends the role of the ecological and biological variation (parasite stress) in shaping human cognition to musical preference and prevalence.

AB  - Objective: Physician knowledge of the complex contributors to obesity varies. We do not know whether today's medical students are graduating with deep understanding of the causes of obesity. Our objective was to assess beliefs about causes of obesity in a national sample of 4th year medical students.
   Method: We randomly selected 2000 4th year students from a random sample of 50 U.S. medical schools and asked them to rate the importance of several factors as causes of obesity. Of those invited, 1244 (62%) responded. We conducted latent class analysis to identify groups with similar response patterns.
   Results: Most students demonstrated knowledge that obesity has multiple contributors. Students fell into 1 of 4 classes: (1) more likely to endorse all contributors (28%), (2) more likely to endorse physiological contributors (27%), (3) more likely to endorse behavioral or social contributors (24%), and (4) unlikely to endorse contributors outside of overeating and physical activity (22%).
   Conclusion: Though students were generally aware of multiple causes, there were 4 distinct patterns of beliefs, with implications for patient care.
   Practice implications: Targeted interventions may help to improve depth of knowledge about the causes of obesity and lead to more effective care for obese patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose
   This study aims to explore the challenges of providing primary health care (PHC) to Afghan immigrants in Tehran as an important global human right issue.
   Design/methodology/approach
   In this exploratory study, a total of 25 purposively selected PHC providers, including physicians, psychologists and midwives, were approached for face-to-face, semi-structured interviews, lasting 30 min on average. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data.
   Findings
   The most common challenges of providing PHC to Afghan immigrants were categorized at individual, organizational and societal levels. Communication barriers and socioeconomic features emerged at the individual level. The organizational challenges included mainly the lack of insurance coverage for all immigrants and the lack of a screening system upon the immigrants' arrival from the borders. At the societal level, the negative attitudes toward Afghan immigrants were causing a problematic challenge.
   Research limitations/implications
   The main limitation was the possibility that only health-care professionals with particular positive or negative perspectives about immigrants enter into the study, because of the voluntary nature of participation.
   Practical implications
   Findings can help policymakers adopt evidence-informed strategies for facilitating PHC provision and improving the access to health care in immigrants as a global human right concern.
   Social implications
   This study alerts about undesirable consequences of certain attitudes and behaviors of the society toward immigrant health.
   Originality/value
   To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first studies conducted in PHC centers in Tehran Province that explores the challenges of providing PHC to Afghan immigrants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical students are exposed to a growing number of obese patients in clinical encounters. Many medical students harbor negative attitudes and stereotypes regarding obese patients, which lead to negative interpersonal behaviors. This study pilot tested the effectiveness of an educational intervention in reducing bias toward obese patients.
   METHODS: Second- and third-year medical students (n=64) watched a 17-minute video, "Weight Bias in Health Care," and participated in interactive discussion to share experiences with encountering obese patients. The Beliefs About Obese Persons (BAOP), Attitudes Toward Obese Persons (ATOP), and Fat Phobia Scales (FPS) were administered before and after intervention. Change in mean scores from before to after the intervention was tested for statistical significance using the paired samples t test. General linear models were used to examine associations of subject characteristics with mean scores for each scale.
   RESULTS: The intervention increased beliefs that genetic and environmental factors play an important role in the cause of obesity as opposed to lack of personal control (mean BAOP increased from 16.53 to 19.27). It also decreased students' negative stereotypes regarding obese patients (mean FPS decreased from 3.65 to 3.45). There were independent associations of subject characteristics with post-intervention ATOP scores, with more positive attitudes in younger, male, and white participants.
   CONCLUSIONS: Implementing a short educational intervention was effective in improving medical students' beliefs and stereotypes regarding obese patients. This widely accessible and easily replicable program can serve as a model and springboard for further development of educational interventions to reduce weight bias among medical students.

AB  - Discrimination continues to plague society, creating stark inequities between groups. While existing work has considered the role of prejudice in perpetuating discrimination, we draw on emerging research on privilege and inequity frames to offer an overlooked, complementary explanation: Objectively discriminatory decisions that are described as favoring, compared with disfavoring, are less likely to be recognized as discrimination. We further theorize this is because favoring decisions are perceived to be motivated by positive intentions. We find support for our hypotheses across eight studies. First, using both qualitative (Studies 1a-b) and experimental approaches (Studies 2-7), across a range of discrimination contexts including race, sex, nationality, and age, we find that inequity frames affect perceptions of discrimination. Further, we find that even human resource employees are less likely to recognize discrimination when described as favoring (Study 3), in turn affecting their reporting behaviors: They are less likely to report potentially discriminatory decisions for review. Next, sampling language from U.S. Supreme Court cases, we find that people support litigation less when discrimination uses a favoring frame, versus disfavoring frame (Study 4). Then, we find that this pattern is driven by inequity frames shaping perceived intentions, rather than perceived harm (Studies 5-6). Finally, we find some evidence that inequity frames regarding a discriminatory decision committed by an organization may affect candidates' job pursuit behaviors (Study 7). This work contributes to a nascent perspective that advantaging mechanisms are critical for creating group inequity: given individuals are less likely to recognize favoritism as discriminatory, favoritism may especially contribute to the persistence of inequity.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify clusters of midlife women by physical activity and to determine racial/ethnic differences in physical activities in each cluster.
   Methods: This was a secondary analysis of the data from 542 women (157 non-Hispanic [NH] Whites, 127 Hispanics, 135 NH African Americans, and 123 NH Asian) in a larger Internet study on midlife women's attitudes toward physical activity. The instruments included the Barriers to Health Activities Scale, the Physical Activity Assessment Inventory, the Questions on Attitudes toward Physical Activity, Subjective Norm, Perceived Behavioral Control, and Behavioral Intention, and the Kaiser Physical Activity Survey. The data were analyzed using hierarchical cluster analyses, analysis of variance, and multinominal logistic analyses.
   Results: A three-cluster solution was adopted: cluster 1 (high active living and sports/exercise activity group; 48%), cluster 2 (high household/caregiving and occupational activity group; 27%), and cluster 3 (low active living and sports/exercise activity group; 26%). There were significant racial/ethnic differences in occupational activities of clusters 1 and 3 (all P < 0.01). Compared with cluster 1, cluster 2 tended to have lower family income, less access to health care, higher unemployment, higher perceived barriers scores, and lower social influences scores (all P < 0.01). Compared with cluster 1, cluster 3 tended to have greater obesity, less access to health care, higher perceived barriers scores, more negative attitudes toward physical activity, and lower self-efficacy scores (all P < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Midlife women's unique patterns of physical activity and their associated factors need to be considered in future intervention development.

AB  - Background
   Mental health stigma persists despite coordinated and widely-evaluated interventions. Socioeconomic, structural, and regional context may be important in shaping attitudes to mental illness, and response to stigma interventions. Regional differences in attitudes towards mental illness could be relevant for intervention, but have not been systematically explored. We evaluated regional variation in mental health stigma using nationally representative data from England, the Health Survey for England (HSE), from 2014.
   Methods
   A previously derived scale for mental health-related attitudes with 2 factors (i. tolerance and support, ii. prejudice and exclusion), and overall attitudes, were outcomes. Weighted linear regressions estimated contribution of individual characteristics and region of residence to inter-individual variability in mental health-related attitudes.
   Results
   London and southern regions tended to have more negative mental health-related attitudes. These differences were not fully or consistently explained by individual sociodemographic characteristics, or personal familiarity with mental illness.
   Conclusions
   Stigma policies could require refinements based on geographic setting. Regions may be in particular need of stigma interventions, or be more resistant to them. Regional differences might be related to media coverage of mental illness, funding differences, service availability, or accessibility of educational opportunities. Greater geographic detail is necessary to examine reasons for regional variation in stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental illness, for example through multilevel analysis.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to clarify the relationship between consumer accountability and responses to egoistic and altruistic appeals. It proposes that when consumers' relationships with others are heightened in the form of accountability, different prosocial message appeals become effective. The study expands the understanding of how marketing may enhance the efficacy of prosocial campaign messages. Design/methodology/approach The study utilized three online experimental studies to test hypotheses across different population samples and health product categories. Self-benefit and other-benefit appeals were tested to decrease meat consumption (Study 1), increase vaccination intent (Study 2) and purchase oxybenzone-free sunscreen (Study 3). Results provide converging evidence for the proposed interaction between appeal type and accountability. Findings When consumers believe their choices will be known or discussed with others, they are more persuaded by other-benefit or altruistic appeals. Contrary to some existing research, Study 3 found that when public accountability was heightened, hybrid appeals were less effective than a solely altruistic appeal in generating purchase intent, digital engagement and attitude change, even controlling for social desirability. Research limitations/implications Public accountability was manipulated only in an online setting, and future studies should replicate with greater ecological validity. Results inform how scholars, brands and organizations should approach message efficacy in prosocial campaigns, particularly when an individual's relationship with others may become salient. Practical implications The paper includes implications for the development and deployment of various organizational strategies such as changing the appeal depending on where a message will be viewed by consumers. Importantly for digital campaigns, maximum digital engagement arises from an altruistic appeal in a public context. Originality/value This paper fulfills an identified need to understand how organizations can successfully encourage prosocial consumer behavior, as well as bridges literature gaps on accountability and appeal efficacy.

AB  - Background
   Negative attitudes toward dementia may pose an obstacle to the early diagnosis and treatment of this syndrome. However, because no scale has been designed to measure fear of dementia, a reliable and valid instrument that is able to measure accurately the multifaceted attributes of fear of dementia must be developed. Purpose
   This study was designed to develop a scale to measure fear of dementia in community-dwelling older adults and to examine its validity and reliability. Methods
   A preliminary version of the measurement scale was developed using a literature review and conceptual framework. Expert analysis of content validity, item analysis based on classic test theory and item response theory, factor analysis, reliability analysis, criterion validity test, and a Rasch model analysis were performed for the psychometric evaluation. Data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0, AMOS 22.0, and WINSTEPS 3.92.1. Results
   The factor analysis revealed three dimensions, five factors, and 19 items that explain 78.44% of the total variance. The three dimensions are cognitive, social, and physical, and the five factors are (a) direct experience of precursor symptoms of dementia, (b) preliminary knowledge of dementia, (c) concerns about family burden, (d) shame, and (e) physical response. Conclusions
   The Fear of Dementia Scale for older adults was shown to be valid and reliable. Therefore, this scale may be used to accurately measure the fear of dementia in elderly individuals. Using this scale to identify the level of fear of dementia will facilitate the early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of dementia.

AB  - Purpose In Ireland, there is a regulatory focus on restraint minimisation in elderly residential care facilities. Consistent with this focus, this study aimed to explore and identify the relationship between nurses' knowledge levels, attitudes and intentions regarding physical restraint use in two large Irish elderly residential care facilities. Design A correlational and cross-sectional survey design was used to collect data on variables including nurses' education levels, years of experience and intentions toward restraint utilization. Methods Data was obtained from a sample of 83 nurses in early 2020 via an anonymous, adapted survey measuring knowledge, attitude and intentions. Results Results showed high knowledge levels, negative attitudes toward restraint implementation, and moderate mean intention scores. A significant positive relationship existed between knowledge and attitudes, with both variables negatively predicting intentions regarding restraint. Education was significant in predicting knowledge and attitudes; however, years of experience reported no such findings. Conclusion Knowledge and attitudes negatively predict nurses' intentions toward restraint, with attitude being the stronger predictor of intentions. Falls risk caused the greatest variation in intention scores. Clinical Relevance This research offered a seminal study providing insight into the use of restraints in an Irish context with findings that are in line with international research. It highlights the importance of knowledge and attitudes along with education with understanding intentions to use restraints. Furthermore this research demonstrates a useful instrument in the assessment of nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and intentions in Irish elderly residential care facilities, which can possibly be used in other settings.

AB  - Background. Because of the significant incidence and mortality of cancer in Iran, a Comprehensive National Cancer Control Program for the prevention and early detection of cancer was launched in 2007. However, cancer awareness and screening rates in Iran did not improve. This study aimed to evaluate public attitudes toward cancer and cancer patients in Iran.
   Materials and Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 953 non-institutionalized individuals in Isfahan, Iran, from November 2014 to February 2015. We collected data on attitudes toward cancer in three domains (impossibility of recovery, cancer stereotypes, and discrimination), as well as questions on willingness to disclose a cancer diagnosis.
   Results. Among all participants, 33.9% agreed that it is very difficult to regain one's health after a cancer diagnosis, 17.4% felt uncomfortable with a cancer patient, and 26.9% said that they would avoid marrying people whose family members had cancer. While 88.9% of study participants said that cancer patients deserve to be protected in society, 53.3% and 48.4% of participants agreed that they would not disclose a cancer diagnosis to neighbors and coworkers, respectively.
   Conclusion. Negative attitudes with respect to impossibility of recovery and discrimination toward cancer and cancer patients were common among urban Iranians. Most people would not disclose a cancer diagnosis to others in spite of advancements in cancer diagnosis and treatment, reflecting unfavorable attitudes toward cancer and cancer patients in society. Successful implementation of cancer awareness and prevention programs in Iran may require social changes based on adequate information on cancer and cancer patients.

AB  - Background Sexual and gender minority (SGM; i.e., non-heterosexual and transgender or gender-expansive, respectively) people experience physical health disparities attributed to greater exposure to minority stress (experiences of discrimination or victimization, anticipation of discrimination or victimization, concealment of SGM status, and internalization of stigma) and structural stigma. Purpose To examine which components of minority stress and structural stigma have the strongest relationships with physical health among SGM people. Methods Participants (5,299 SGM people, 1,902 gender minority individuals) were from The Population Research in Identity and Disparities for Equality (PRIDE) Study. Dominance analyses estimated effect sizes showing how important each component of minority stress and structural stigma was to physical health outcomes. Results Among cisgender sexual minority women, transmasculine individuals, American Indian or Alaskan Native SGM individuals, Asian SGM individuals, and White SGM individuals a safe current environment for SGM people had the strongest relationship with physical health. For gender-expansive individuals and Black, African American, or African SGM individuals, the safety of the environment for SGM people in which they were raised had the strongest relationship with physical health. Among transfeminine individuals, victimization experiences had the strongest relationship with physical health. Among Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish individuals, accepting current environments had the strongest relationship with physical health. Among cisgender sexual minority men prejudice/discrimination experiences had the strongest relationship with physical health. Conclusion Safe community environments had the strongest relationships with physical health among most groups of SGM people. Increasing safety and buffering the effects of unsafe communities are important for SGM health.

AB  - Purpose This article examines ways COVID-19 health surveillance and algorithmic decision-making ("ADM") are creating and exacerbating workplace inequalities that impact post-treatment cancer survivors. Cancer survivors' ability to exercise their right to work often is limited by prejudice and health concerns. While cancer survivors can ostensibly elect not to disclose to their employers when they are receiving treatments or if they have a history of treatment, the use of ADM increases the chances that employers will learn of their situation regardless of their preferences. Moreover, absent significant change, inequalities may persist or even expand. Methods We analyze how COVID-19 health surveillance is creating an unprecedented amount of health data on all people. These data are increasingly collected and used by employers as part of COVID-19 regulatory interventions. Results The increase in data, combined with the health and economic crisis, means algorithm-driven health inequalities will be experienced by a larger percentage of the population. Post-treatment cancer survivors, as for people with disabilities generally, are at greater risk of experiencing negative outcomes from algorithmic health discrimination. Conclusions Updated and revised workplace policy and practice requirements, as well as collaboration across impacted groups, are critical in helping to control the inequalities that flow from the interaction between COVID-19, ADM, and the experience of cancer survivorship in the workplace. Implications for Cancer Survivors The interaction among COVID-19, health surveillance, and ADM increases exposure to algorithmic health discrimination in the workplace.

AB  - Background Many women internalize negative attitudes regarding body shape and size because of the societal standards for women's ideal body shapes and sizes. Internalized weight stigma is related to poorer physical and psychological health. A growing body of research has documented the links between other forms of internalized stigma (e.g., HIV-stigma) and poor sleep quality; however, little research examines the links between internalized weight stigma and sleep or the mechanisms that explain this relationship. Internalized weight stigma may be associated with poor sleep through increases in psychological distress. This study hypothesized that the links between internalized weight stigma and sleep would be mediated by higher levels of depression and anxiety. Methods About 257 women were recruited via social media, word of mouth, and an undergraduate participant pool. Participants completed an online survey assessing various aspects of weight stigma and health through self-report questionnaires. Most women were non-Hispanic White (86.8%) and had a mean age of 31.40. Results The indirect effects of internalized weight stigma on poorer global sleep quality and daily disturbances through depression and anxiety were significant. In contrast, depressive symptoms but not anxiety explained the links between internalized weight stigma and perceived sleep quality and neither depressive symptoms nor anxiety explained the link between internalized weight stigma and sleep efficiency. Conclusions Internalized weight stigma is linked to poorer sleep quality, and these links may be explained by psychological well-being. Understanding the mechanisms by which internalized weight stigma is associated with sleep quality can inform the psychological interventions employed.

AB  - Seasonal influenza, causing complications, hospitalizations and deaths, generates a serious socio-economic burden, especially among elderly and high-risk subjects, as well as among adult individuals. Despite the availability and active free-of charge offer of influenza vaccines, vaccine coverage rates remain low and far from the target established by the Ministry of Health. Notwithstanding their effectiveness, vaccines are victims of prejudices and false myths, that contribute to the increasing phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy and loss of confidence. Media and, in particular, new media and information and communication technologies (ICTs) play a major role in disseminating health-related information. They are extremely promising devices for delivering health education and promoting disease prevention, including immunization. However, they can also have a negative impact on population's health attitudes and behaviors when channeling wrong, misleading information. During the 2014/2015 influenza vaccination campaign, the report of four deaths allegedly caused by administration of an adjuvanted influenza vaccine, Fluad - the so-called "Fluad case" - received an important media coverage, which contributed to the failure of the vaccination campaign, dramatically reducing the influenza vaccine uptake. In the extant literature, there is a dearth of information concerning the effect of the "Fluad case". The current study aims at quantifying the impact of the "Fluad effect" at the level of the Local Health Unit 3 (LHU3) ASL3 Genovese, Genoa, Italy. Ethical implications for health-care workers and health communication practitioners are also envisaged.

AB  - During rainfall, different types of sediments are transported (organic and inorganic) that end up prejudicing the hydraulic efficiency of materials such as pervious concrete (PC). Sediments tend to accumulate on the surface of the material and its internal pore structure causing a decrease in permeability. This phenomenon is known as clogging. This study aims to identify and characterize the phenomenon of clogging of PC considering laboratory and field conditions. In that sense, a PC mix and three types of sediment (sand (S), clay (C), and mixture of both (S thorn C)) were considered. Two types of permeability tests were adapted to induce the clogging and estimate the permeability reduction: the constant head test (laboratory), and the ASTM C1701 (field). Finally, different rates of clogging (low, medium and high) were considered. Considering the type of sediments, the finer they are the higher is the influence on the clogging phenomenon, reaching maximum permeability reductions greater than 95%. Considering the rate of clogging, the results show that low rate entails higher clogging. On the other hand, an analytical model to describe the clogging was proposed. This predicts efficiently the reduction of permeability considering the type and concentration of sediment. This model was proposed with experimental data obtained and validated with results from other investigations. The model aims to be used for engineers to design PC considering their life span and maintenance.

With Black men and women having the highest prevalence of hypertension, Black females having higher rates of coronary heart disease, stroke and breast cancer than White females, and Blacks, at all ages, having a greater risk for stroke mortality than Whites, researchers and health care providers must understand the clinical appropriateness of treatment for different states of disease among distinct populations. Further, to eliminate health disparities, the health care systems and legal regulatory climate must facilitate access to care while biases, prejudices and stereotyping by health care providers and all those in the health care system must be eliminated. Importantly, research continues to illustrate that many are dying prematurely or have advanced stages of disease because of disparate care.
   This article explores four strategies to address inequitable care and to work toward eliminating poorer health outcomes among minorities. First, those who deliver health care must adopt a quality-focused approach that improves the care of all patients while facilitating the reduction and elimination of health disparities. Second, cultural awareness and cultural competency must be improved. Third, we must remove barriers to access and promote public policies that lead to greater health awareness and healthier environments. Lastly, but most importantly, we need a prevention focus as the reduction in the onset of disease is the first step towards improving health outcomes.

AB  - In African countries, women with disability encounter severe discrimination as their devalued status as women intersects with negative and hostile community attitudes toward disability. Women with disability who are engaged as leaders in the disability movement play a vital role in addressing this discrimination. Through in-depth interviews, this study examined barriers and pathways to leadership encountered by women with disability from Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya who were active within the disability movement. By dismantling and reshaping stigmatising attitudes the participants had been able to form a positive sense of self and gain the self-esteem needed to succeed as leaders. Publicly, they defied traditional gender roles by leveraging their privileged status as leaders; Leadership was often linked to educational attainment, and being educated legitimised and their achievements as women. Using an intersectional lens, this study sheds further light on the discrimination specific to African women with disability and the strategies that they employ to overcome them. Points of interest African women with disability encounter severe forms of discrimination both due to their gender and due to their disability Women with disabilities who are engaged as leaders in the African disability movement play an important role in fighting this discrimination In this study, we identified how women with disability had overcome various barriers to become disability leaders We found that by resisting negative attitudes the women were able to develop the confidence they needed to become leaders The women also had to ensure that others accepted them as leaders. Being educated was one way in which they were able to convince others that they were competent as leaders.

AB  - This paper investigates volatility spillovers between the global crude oil market and the stock markets of the global oil stock markets (Russian, Canada, China, Kuwait, and the USA) pre and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We use wavelet Granger causality methods to study the volatility spillovers between global oil stock markets, mainly from January 1, 2019, to March 31, 2021. Our Results (1) shows that WTI and Brent oil prices had a negative mean return before COVID-19 but a positive mean return during the pandemic spread. Other Results (2) find the positive, significantly lowest, and highest frequency during the COVID-19 outbreak for all selected countries. The results also show that the link between oil WTI & Brent prices and stock markets return in the lowest (33-66 days) and highest frequency range (4-16) before the Covid-19 epidemic, especially in the first quarter of 2020. Before the COVID-19 period, the Russian oil stock market is seriously prejudiced with oil prices on a modest scale, but not after the pandemic's start. This study also perceives direction opposite between the COVID-19 period. The Canadian and United States America oil and stock markets influence the lowest scale in the previous COVID-19 sample for the U.S. market. Moreover, this paper exposed that oil marketing highest oil futures in their portfolios than stock shares for all times. We found that oil price shocks had a more significant impact on the stock markets of the United States and Canada than on the stock markets of other countries.

AB  - One prominent social-cognitive model of internalized stigma by Corrigan and his colleagues (2012; 2002) proposes that individuals are exposed to societal stereotypes about mental illness, at least tacitly agree with them, and may apply them to oneself, engendering harmful self-beliefs. There is limited empirical support for this model in serious mental illness. Moreover, it is not clearly established how internalized stigma and its associated factors impact recovery in this population. The current study uses structural equation modeling (SEM) to assess the social-cognitive model?s goodness of fit in a sample of Veterans with serious mental illness (Veteran sample, n = 248), and then validates the model in a second and independent sample of individuals receiving communitybased psychiatric rehabilitation services (community sample, n = 267). Participants completed the Self-Stigma of Mental Illness Scale (SSMIS; Corrigan et al., 2006) and measures of self-esteem, self-efficacy, and recovery attitudes. Consistent with Corrigan and colleagues? formulation of internalized stigma, SEM analyses showed a significant indirect pathway from stereotype awareness, to stereotype agreement, to application to self, to selfesteem decrement, to poorer recovery attitudes. Additionally, there was a significant direct effect from stereotype awareness to self-esteem. This study shows that individuals with serious mental illness experience psychological harm from stigma in two ways: (1) through perceived public prejudice and bias, and (2) through internalizing these negative messages. In particular, stigma harms individuals? self-esteem, which then reduces their recovery attitudes.

AB  - Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is affecting 170 million people annually (WHO, 2012) and Pakistan ranks high in chronic hepatitis. HCV is a leading cause of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma rapidly transmitting as silent killer. Our objectives were to assess the knowledge of students of Punjab University (Gujranwala Campus) about contributing risk factors for HCV infection. And to impart knowledge to students regarding preventive measures in relation to associated risk factors for HCV transmission. Subjects were 100 students our study was Descriptive / cross sectional study. The following data collection tools were developed and used. A consent form was used to get the consent of the respondents wherever possible. A semi structured Questionnaire was used to get information from study population. The tools were pretested and modified according to requirements. In our study the overall questionnaire response was 100 %.
   Objectives: To assess the knowledge of students of Punjab University (Gujranwala Campus) about contributing risk factors for HCV infection. To impart knowledge to students regarding preventive measures in relation to associated risk factors for HCV transmission.
   Result and Conclusion: 35% responded that sexual contact was possible mode of transmission of HCV infection followed by 20% and 19% who believed that organ transplant and blood transfusion were the main modes of transmission of virus. 13 % answered that sharing of tooth brushes and razors were main causes of its transmission. Another 13% responded that use of injections was the source of transmission of HCV. 80% believed that infection was transmittable from mother to child. 47% think recipient of blood and blood products are at the risk of developing HCV infection. 23 % thought that people with multiple sex partners were at the risk of developing HCV infection. 70% were of opinion that Vaccination was available against HCV infection and only 28% knew that it was not available. 77% believed that spread of HCV infection could prevented by avoiding blood contacts. 10% said that prevention was possible by avoiding eating together, 5% said by avoiding hand shake and 8% said that it prevention is not possible. 92 % believed that the treatment of HCV infection was available. 8% said there is no treatment of this infection. 77 % said that recurrence of HCV infection was possible and 7 % responded with no. 17 % said that they did not know about this. Summarizing the results of this study, these findings indicate an ambivalent knowledge about HCV infection amongst Punjab University Gujranwala students, many gaps were observed, suggesting the importance of continuous education about HCV in this population to prevent HCV infection as well as discrimination and prejudice towards patients with hepatitis C.

AB  - Background Various factors motivate people to undertake treatment for obesity. Among others they include health benefits, willingness to please others, and dissatisfaction with one's appearance. The present study aimed to assess body size dissatisfaction in patients with obesity seeking and not seeking treatment for obesity. Methods Two-hundred-sixteen adult subjects (154 women, 62 men) including 80 people with BMI >= 30 kg/m(2) starting treatment for obesity (BMI 35.7 +/- 5.3 kg/m(2)) and 136 volunteers with obesity (BMI 34.7 +/- 4.3 kg/m(2)) not seeking treatment for obesity, were enrolled. Body size satisfaction was assessed using the Figure Rating Scale adapted by Stunkard. Results Patients with obesity starting obesity treatment had more often a high level of body size dissatisfaction than volunteers with obesity not seeking the treatment (p < 0.001). There was a significant difference in the distribution of body size dissatisfaction in women (p < 0.05), but not in men (p = 0.47). Conclusion Patients with obesity, especially women, seeking obesity treatment more often represent a high level of body size dissatisfaction than volunteers with obesity not seeking treatment for obesity. This implies the need for public health campaigns to address negative attitudes or misconceptions about obesity and its treatment. Placing more attention and emphasis on body size dissatisfaction in more vulnerable women with obesity may help to define personal motivations and goals, strengthen the doctor-patient relationship and better adapt therapeutic strategies.

AB  - ObjectiveWe empirically demonstrate that the long-held political distinction between the Deep South and the Peripheral South persists to this day.
   MethodsData from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) are employed in logistic regression models to assess differences in the likelihood of voting Republican among Deep and Peripheral South whites in gubernatorial, senatorial, and presidential contests. Additionally, recent data on the partisan and racial composition of various elective offices document the sharp decline in Democratic officeholders.
   ResultsIn contemporary Southern elections, Deep South whites, after controlling for several factors such as partisanship, ideology, religion, and income, are consistently and significantly more likely to vote Republican than their Peripheral South peers.
   ConclusionsRace remains the most salient issue in Southern politics and it structures the alignment of whites and blacks into opposing parties. Because of this, whites are more Republican in their voting behavior in the more culturally conservative subregion where the proportion of African Americans is higher: the Deep South. Dixie is now dominated by the GOP, and especially in the Deep South, with grim representational implications for African Americans because they are no longer part of coalitional majorities at virtually every level of governance.

AB  - Critics raise alarm bells about governmental use of digital algorithms, charging that they are too complex, inscrutable, and prone to bias. A realistic assessment of digital algorithms, though, must acknowledge that government is already driven by algorithms of arguably greater complexity and potential for abuse: the algorithms implicit in human decision-making. The human brain operates algorithmically through complex neural networks. And when humans make collective decisions, they operate via algorithms too-those reflected in legislative, judicial, and administrative processes. Yet these human algorithms undeniably fail and are far from transparent. On an individual level, human decision-making suffers from memory limitations, fatigue, cognitive biases, and racial prejudices, among other problems. On an organizational level, humans succumb to groupthink and free riding, along with other collective dysfunctionalities. As a result, human decisions will in some cases prove far more problematic than their digital counterparts. Digital algorithms, such as machine learning, can improve governmental performance by facilitating outcomes that are more accurate, timely, and consistent. Still, when deciding whether to deploy digital algorithms to perform tasks currently completed by humans, public officials should proceed with care on a case-by-case basis. They should consider both whether a particular use would satisfy the basic preconditions for successful machine learning and whether it would in fact lead to demonstrable improvements over the status quo. The question about the future of public administration is not whether digital algorithms are perfect. Rather, it is a question about what will work better: human algorithms or digital ones.

AB  - The transition to motherhood is a time of elevated risk for clinical depression. Dispositional optimism may be protective against depressive symptoms; however, the arrival of a newborn presents numerous challenges that may be at odds with initially positive expectations, and which may contribute to depressed mood. We have explored the relative contributions of antenatal and postnatal optimism regarding maternity to depressive symptoms in the postnatal period. Ninety-eight pregnant women underwent clinician interview in the third trimester to record psychiatric history, antenatal depressive symptoms, and administer a novel measure of optimism towards maternity. Measures of depressive symptoms, attitudes to maternity, and mother-to-infant bonding were obtained from 97 study completers at monthly intervals through 3 months postpartum. We found a positive effect of antenatal optimism, and a negative effect of postnatal disconfirmation of expectations, on depressive mood postnatally. Postnatal disconfirmation, but not antenatal optimism, was associated with more negative attitudes toward maternity postnatally. Antenatal optimism, but not postnatal disconfirmation, was associated with reduced scores on a mother-to-infant bonding measure. The relationships between antenatal optimism, postnatal disconfirmation of expectations, and postnatal depression held true among primigravidas and multigravidas, as well as among women with prior histories of mood disorders, although antenatal optimism tended to be lower among women with mental health histories. We conclude that cautious antenatal optimism, rather than immoderate optimism or frank pessimism, is the approach that is most protective against postnatal depressive symptoms, and that this is true irrespective of either mood disorder history or parity. Factors predisposing to negative cognitive assessments and impaired mother-to-infant bonding may be substantially different than those associated with depressive symptoms, a finding that merits further study.

AB  - Diverse advocacy groups have pushed for the recognition of cultural differences in health care as a means to redress inequalities in the U.S., elaborating a form of biocitizenship that draws on evidence of racial and ethnic health disparities to make claims on both the state and health care providers. These efforts led to federal regulations developed by the U.S. Office of Minority Health requiring health care organizations to provide Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services. Based on ethnographic research at workshops and conferences, in-depth interviews with cultural competence trainers, and an analysis of postings to a moderated listserv with 2,000 members, we explore cultural competence trainings as a new type of social technology in which health care providers and institutions are urged to engage in ethical self-fashioning to eliminate prejudice and embody the values of cultural relativism. Health care providers are called on to re-orient their practice (such as habits of gaze, touch, and decision-making) and to act on their own subjectivities to develop an orientation toward Others that is "culturally competent." We explore the diverse methods that cultural competence trainings use to foster a health care provider's ability to be self-reflexive, including face-to-face workshops and classes and self-guided on-line modules. We argue that the hybrid formation of culturally appropriate health care is becoming detached from its social justice origins as it becomes rationalized by and more firmly embedded in the operations of the health care marketplace.

AB  - We are unlikely to stop seeking pleasure, as this would prejudice our health and well-being. Yet many psychoactive substances providing pleasure are outlawed as illicit recreational drugs, despite the fact that only some of them are addictive to some people. Efforts to redress their prohibition, or to reform legislation so that penalties are proportionate to harm have largely failed. Yet, if choices over seeking pleasure are ethical insofar as they avoid harm to oneself or others, public health strategies should foster ethical choice by moving beyond current risk management practices embodied in the harm reduction movement. The neuroscience of pleasure has much to offer neuroethics and public health strategies. Distinguishing between 'wanting' and 'liking' fosters new understandings of addiction. These hold promise for directing the search for pharmacotherapies which prevent addiction and relapse or disrupt associated neuromechanisms. They could inform new research into creating lawful psychoactive substances which give us pleasure without provoking addiction. As the health and well being of human and other animals rests upon the experience of pleasure, this would be an ethical objective within public health strategy. Were ethical and neurobiological obstacles to ending addiction to be overcome, problems associated with excessive consumption, the lure of unlawful psychoactive substances and the paucity of lawful means to achieve pleasurable altered states would remain. Non-addictive designer drugs, which reliably provided lawful access to pleasures and altered states, would ameliorate these public health concerns insofar as they fostered citizens' informed, ethical choices according to a neurobiological taxonomy of pleasures.

AB  - Background and Aim: People with severe mental illness (SMI) have a life expectancy of up to twenty years less than the general population and many live with incurable physical health conditions. Yet, they continue to experience barriers when trying to access palliative and end of life care (PEOLC). Little research has been carried out which includes the views and experiences of people with SMI, and this study presents first findings which include people with both SMI and an incurable condition and their carers. It aimed to seek their views, and those of their carers, on their experiences and expectations of accessing PEOLC and to understand how PEOLC for people with SMI could be improved.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 8 participants (5 patient participants and 3 carer participants). Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts was undertaken.
   Findings: Four over-arching themes were developed. (1) Stigma and Prejudice - See Me, Not My Diagnosis (2) Hesitancy and Avoidance - Treading on Eggshells (3) Collaborators in Care - The Ignored Experts and (4) Connections - Leaning in, Not Stepping Back.
   Significance of Findings: This study presents the first accounts from the UK concerning experiences of PEOLC, barriers to access and how care can be improved, from the perspectives of patients with both a SMI and an incurable physical condition and their carers. The findings illuminate an under-researched area of clinical practice and contribute rich understandings to future service developments and innovations.

KW  - Female leaders
KW  - Experiment
AB  - Purpose - A new phenomenon called "Glass Cliff" has formed claiming that women at the higher echelons of organizations are being placed in higher risk positions when compared to men. The purpose of this research study is to examine whether this phenomenon occurs at the middle to upper middle management levels for women. If so, it can possibly be one of the many underlying reasons that contribute to the grounds of why the pipeline problem exists with female leadership at the top-level management positions. Design/methodology/approach The design considers competing hypotheses based on the emerging, contradictory research on the Glass Cliff and the more established perspective of social norms and implicit biases. The experimental study is conducted on 202 participants to examine the likelihood of occurrence of this phenomenon at middle to upper middle management levels. Findings Counter to the tenets pertaining to the Glass Cliff phenomenon but consistent with the implicit leadership theories, this research study revealed that when compared to the female candidate, the male candidate was more likely to be assigned to the higher risk position. Research limitations/implications The subjective nature of the study can be the reason for variations of each participant and their biases since it is a specific experiment dealing with perceptions, social norms and prejudice. Originality/value This phenomenon is mostly studied at the executive level and can contribute to the pipeline problem for women, hence this study provides insight and examines the phenomenon at the middle to upper middle management levels to examine its likelihood.

KW  - Belt and Road Initiative
KW  - China-EU relations
AB  - 2020, the year that the world was engulfed by the Covid-19 pandemic, was also the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Italy. The China-Italy comprehensive strategic partnership plays an important role in deepening China-EU cooperation, advancing the Belt and Road Initiative, and building a community with a shared future for humanity. China-Italy relations should be studied within the analytical framework of strategic partnership which has gained traction in China's foreign policy narrative. Beijing's pursuit of strategic partnerships aims at forging stable and enduring relations that are driven by common interests in a world of proliferating challenges and geopolitical uncertainties. While making steady progress, the partnership is also facing multi-dimensional challenges. China and Italy should strengthen strategic dialogue to build mutual trust and constantly improve their institutionalized cooperation. Economically, they should work out broader areas for collaboration and better manage their competition to achieve win-win results. At the level of people-to-people exchange, mutual understanding and trust should be enhanced to eliminate misconception and prejudice. At the regional level, the China-EU-Italy trilateral relationship should be consolidated to shield bilateral cooperation from the volatility of China-EU relations. In the global arena, China and Italy should also step up efforts to catalyze international financial reforms and address global challenges such as climate change, economic governance, and global public health emergencies by improving policy coordination and aligning global strategies.

KW  - Ethics

KW  - JDA
AB  - The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) developed a 'Working Definition of Antisemitism' in 2016. Whilst the definition has received a significant amount of media attention, we are not aware of any comprehensive philosophical analysis. This article analyses this definition. We conclude that the definition and its list of examples ought to be rejected. The urgency to do so stems from the fact that pro-Israel activists can and have mobilised the IHRA document for political goals unrelated to tackling antisemitism, notably to stigmatise and silence critics of the Israeli government. This causes widespread self-censorship, has an adverse impact on freedom of speech, and impedes action against the unjust treatment of Palestinians. We also identify intrinsic problems in the way the definition refers to criticism of Israel similar 'to that leveled against any other country', ambiguous wording about 'the power of Jews as a collective', lack of clarity as to the Jewish people's 'right to self-determination', and its denial of obvious racism. We consider alternative definitions and prefer one like the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) definition, 'hostility to or prejudice against Jews', with the addition of the words 'as Jews'. We recognise that the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) can play a useful purpose in illustrating the shortcomings of the IHRA definition. However, we do not advocate promoting it as the prime international definition. Indeed, we question the efficacy of using complex new definitions to combat racism against Jews or other groups, and instead advocate combatting it through collective action across societies.

AB  - A common claim in the literature is that higher-educated persons are more likely to marry outside their ethnic/racial group than lower-educated persons. We re-examine this "educational gradient" with a multilevel analysis of 46 immigrant groups in the Current Population Survey. We find that there are positive effects not only of individual education on intermarriage but also of the educational level of a group. Moreover, the educational gradient declines when the aggregate level of education of an immigrant group is higher. The aggregate effect of education points to cultural explanations of the gradient that emphasize the role of interethnic attitudes. The interaction effect points to a structural explanation that explains the gradient in terms of opportunities of finding similarly educated spouses within the group.

TI  - Health Care Access and Support for Disabled Women in Canada: Falling Short of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: A Qualitative Study
T2  - WOMENS HEALTH ISSUES
LA  - English
AB  - Purpose: The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and other international human rights conventions guarantee the fundamental human rights to physical, social, and psychological health. The purpose of this study was to examine whether these rights are being upheld in Canada for disabled women.
   Methods: An interpretive, qualitative, focus group design was employed. Participants were women 18 to 67 years of age with a self-identified physical, sensory, cognitive, and/or psychiatric impairment. Eleven focus groups were conducted with 74 disabled women from urban and rural settings in Northern Ontario, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia. The data were analyzed for themes using a flexible coding system derived from and consistent with the research objectives and the study's human rights framework.
   Findings: Participants described multiple intersecting factors that impeded or facilitated access to health care. Services included both generic health services and impairment-specific services. Participants experienced a number of barriers accessing professionals, support programs, and services. These are described under three broad themes: 1) Labyrinthine health service 'systems,' 2) assumptions, attitudes, and discriminatory practices, and 3) inadequate sexual health or reproductive services and supports.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that Canada falls significantly short of guaranteeing disabled women's human rights to access health care supports and services. Access barriers resulted from the inefficiencies and complexities of the multiple agencies and programs that disabled women had to navigate, difficulties accessing information on available services, and negative attitudes of some health and social service providers.

AB  - This study addressed predictors of pre-service teachers' opposition toward the practice of educating students with disabilities in mainstream classroom settings-a practice known as inclusion. We tested a hypothesized path model that incorporated social dominance orientation (SDO) and contact as distal predictors, and intergroup anxiety, stereotype use, and self-efficacy for including students with disabilities as more proximal predictors of opposition to inclusion in a sample of 229 pre-service teachers from the Southwestern United States. In large part, the predicted relationships among our variables were supported. The effect of SDO on opposition to inclusion was both indirect (via stereotype use and intergroup anxiety) and direct. The effect of close contact with persons with disabilities relevant to inclusion was mediated by intergroup anxiety and, more distally, by stereotype use. Stereotype use and intergroup anxiety were positive predictors of opposition to inclusion. The predicted relationship between self-efficacy and opposition to inclusion was not supported by the data. Rather, the data supported a reverse causal ordering. Implications for future research are addressed.

AB  - Problem, research strategy, and findings: Planners' workplaces are diversifying with respect to gender, but office culture and policies do not always reflect such change. Our research explores the influence of gender, management, and organizational characteristics on planners' perceptions of workplace culture and benefits. We conducted a national survey with the APA's Women and Planning Division in 2015 to assess whether planners' perceptions regarding workplace culture and benefits differ by gender and organizational characteristics of the planning office. A limitation of the survey is the small self-selected sample of mostly female respondents. We combine feminist planning theory with workplace psychology theories of expectation states, role congruity, and representative bureaucracy, as well as transformational leadership, to explain workplace dynamics in planning agencies. Qualitative analysis shows problems with exclusive communication and equal opportunity are linked to management characteristics. To test this, we build five regression models on gender respect, exclusive communication, work-life benefits, flexibility perception, and equal opportunity. Our regression models control for gender, age, experience of respondent, and organizational characteristics. Our results indicate that gender respect, work-life benefits, and flexibility perception do not differ by gender. However, women are less likely to feel heard in their workplace (exclusive communication) or perceive equal opportunity. Workplaces with female management are more likely to show sensitivity to gender issues, support for flexible benefits, and equal opportunity for pay and advancement. Takeaway for practice: These results suggest planners feel they can raise gender issues and access flexibility benefits without prejudice. But planning workplaces need to address problems with exclusive communication and women's perceptions of unequal opportunities for pay and advancement. Introducing gender-inclusive planning and leadership development curriculum to planning programs would prepare future planners; and ongoing training for management may improve behavior, communication, and benefits for all genders in planning workplaces.

AB  - This study examined elaboration likelihood model (ELM) processing routes used by audiences to evaluate image repair messages for two organizations that often provoke polarizing dispositions in audiences: the National Rifle Association (NRA) and the New England Patriots football team. Involvement is a key concept in the ELM paradigm, yet studies have overlooked issues on the extreme ends of the dispositional spectrum, especially where ego-involvement motivates individuals. In order to test this largely unexplored idea, participants in the study were presented with post-incident message responses for the Columbine and Sandy Hook school shootings and the Spygate and Deflategate cheating scandals. Results indicated that the relationship between disposition and peripheral processing was curvilinear, with an increased use of peripheral processing at dispositional extremes. Ego-involvement fully mediated this relationship for most messages. Study items measuring reaction to the message source also showed statistical similarities to central processing variables. Although message source is often treated as a peripheral cue in ELM studies, the results of this analysis suggested that the message source was not used as a peripheral cue here. These findings are consistent with several other past studies on dual process models that align message source more closely with a likelihood to elaborate.

AB  - Given the degree of hostility toward transgender people and the pervasiveness of societal messages regarding gender roles, transgender people may internalize negative attitudes and beliefs about being transgender in the form of internalized transnegativity (IT). IT has been shown to contribute to negative behavioral health outcomes including suicide among transgender people (Breslow et al., 2015; Staples, Neilson, Bryan, & George, 2018). In this study, we developed an online intervention designed to reduce IT among transgender people and evaluated its efficacy using a randomized controlled trial. The IT intervention consisted of 4 modules aimed at (a) combatting stereotypes, (b) identifying and rejecting negative messages, (c) reinforcing the rejection of negative messages, and (d) enhancing identity affirmation. We analyzed data from 639 participants recruited with Amazon Mechanical Turk (Mturk) and randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 294) or a control (n = 345) addressing stress management. We measured IT using 2 subscales from the Transgender Identity Survey (TIS; Bockting, Miner, Swinburne Romine, Hamilton, & Coleman, 2013): shame and pride. At posttest, those who received the IT intervention reported significantly lower levels of shame and higher levels of pride when compared to control. The intervention conferred small to medium effects for reducing shame (d = .43) and increasing pride (d = .43). As IT represents a transdiagnostic risk factor for many behavioral health problems among transgender people, our brief online intervention offers a highly promising and accessible means of addressing public health issues in this population. Future research directions include dismantling studies and enhancing generalizability to transgender subpopulations.

AB  - Purpose - There is a perception that non-religious consumers are less ethical than religious consumers. Studies found prejudices against atheists around the world and assumed that those who committed unethical behavior were more likely to be atheists. Hence, first, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of consumers' intrinsic religiosity, extrinsic religiosity and atheism on consumers' ethical beliefs. Second, this study attempts to segment consumers and identify differences between these segments.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using data from 235 study participants in the USA and 531 in Vietnam. Subsequently, a two-step cluster approach was used to identify segments within these samples.
   Findings - The study results show consumers' intrinsic religiosity negatively influences all consumers' unethical beliefs. Similarly, atheism also negatively influences all consumers' unethical beliefs. This study also complements other studies exploring consumer ethics in developing countries. In addition, the segmentation analysis produced unique segments. The results from both samples (USA and Vietnam) indicated that non-religious consumers are less likely to accept various unethical behaviors compared to religious consumers. Religious consumers are not necessarily more ethical and atheism consumers are not necessarily less ethical. In the end, are implications for business ethics, religious and non-religious leaders on how to view the impact of beliefs on consumer ethical behaviors.
   Originality/value - This is one of the first few studies investigating the impact of atheism on consumer ethics. The results of this study further extend the knowledge of study in consumer ethics by comparing consumers' religiosity and atheism.

AB  - Convinced that some recent trends in the literature concerned with reactions involving solids have been unproductive, even discouraging interest in the subject, this reviewer analyses the reasons and charts a way forward. In particular, two topics are discussed: thermal analysis and activation energy. Thermal analysis, automated collection and interpretation of kinetic data for solid(?)-state decompositions, resulted in huge numbers of publications between late 1970s and 2010. Measurements were frequently minimalistic (few, often no, confirmatory tests complemented rate data). Kinetic data interpretations were based on the Arrhenius activation model, inapplicable to these assumed, usually unconfirmed, solid-state(?) reactions. Energy distributions within crystalline reactants differ from those of 'free-flying' gaseous reactants, and thus, mechanistic proposals are entirely speculative. Such studies yielded little more than the reaction temperature: no meaningful insights into reaction chemistry, controls, mechanisms. Despite my several highly critical articles, these inconsequential studies continued. Overall, this now sidelined topic impacted adversely on solid-state chemistry, activation energy, E. Concurrently with the above studies, L'vov published a theoretical explanation for the magnitude of E: the Congruent Dissociative Volatilisation (CDV), thermochemical approach. This was also ignored by the 'Thermoanalytical Community', possibly because it assumes an initial volatilisation step: it appears that many solid-state scientists are prejudiced against mechanisms involving a phase change. The value of this novel theory (CDV) in identifying controls and mechanisms of solid-state reactions is discussed here. This review is positive: an interesting branch of main-stream chemistry remains open for exploration, expansion, explanation and exploitation!

AB  - Genetic and other biological explanations appear to have mixed blessings for the stigma of mental disorder. Meta-analytic evidence shows that these biogenetic explanations reduce the blame attached to sufferers, but they also increase aversion, perceptions of dangerousness, and pessimism about recovery. These relationships may arise because biogenetic explanations recruit essentialist intuitions, which have known associations with prejudice and the endorsement of stereotypes. However, the adverse implications of biogenetic explanations as a set may not hold true for the subset of those explanations that invoke neurobiological causes. Neurobiological explanations might have less adverse implications for stigma than genetic explanations, for example, because they are arguably less essentialist. Although this possibility is important for evaluating the social implications of neuroscientific explanations of mental health problems, it has yet to be tested meta-analytically. We present meta-analyses of links between neurobiological explanations and multiple dimensions of stigma in 26 correlational and experimental studies. In correlational studies, neurobiological explanations were marginally associated with greater desire for social distance from people with mental health problems. In experimental studies, these explanations were associated with greater desire for social distance, greater perceived dangerousness, and greater prognostic pessimism. Neurobiological explanations were not linked to reduced blame in either set of studies. By implication, neurobiological explanations have the same adverse links to stigma as other forms of biogenetic explanation. These findings raise troubling implications about the public impact of psychiatric neuroscience research findings. Although such findings are not intrinsically stigmatizing, they may become so when viewed through the lens of neuroessentialism.

AB  - Generations of scholars have examined the variety of correlates of attitudes and behaviors of heterosexual men toward gay men. There has also been substantial exploration of the impact of homophobia on gay men and its gendering of heterosexual men. However, less research exists into the effects of the liberalization of sexual attitudes on these groups. In this forum, we call for scholarly engagement with a relatively new arena of masculinities studies: the impact of decreasing homophobia on socially acceptable gendered behaviors among heterosexual males in the U.S. We offer homohysteria as a concept to examine the social impact of heterosexual male's fear of being thought gay; suggesting that homohysteria is an effective heurism for investigating micro- and macro-level processes relating homophobia to masculinity. Our thesis is that as homohysteria declines, heterosexual males are able to engage in homosocial relationships characterized by a number of positive traits, including: the social inclusion of gay male peers; the embrace of once-feminized artifacts; increased emotional intimacy; increased physical tactility; the erosion of the one-time rule of homosexuality; and a rejection of violence. We focus solely upon heterosexual males and their attitudes toward gay males because these are the demographics of the participants in the empirical research in this area. We then highlight eight key areas where further research could both develop homohysteria as a concept and enhance understanding of social life.

AB  - Background: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is an important component of modern medicine and is essential for the provision of high-quality health services. Little is known about the level of EBM use among Ethiopian medical students. This study aimed to assess the factors associated with EBM practice among medical interns in teaching hospitals in northwestern Ethiopia.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a random sample of medical interns in teaching hospitals of northwest Ethiopia. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with EBM practice. The strength of the interaction between variables was calculated using the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).
   Results: Completed questionnaire was obtained from 403 (95.3%) of 423 medical interns. About 48.4% of respondents had a good EBM practice. EBM knowledge (AOR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.220-2.835), attitude to EBM (AOR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.318-3.193), ability to appraise evidence (AOR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.570-3.517), and having sufficient time to search for evidence (AOR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.065-2.627) were factors significantly associated to EBM practice.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the main factors affecting medical intern's practice of EBM were lack of critical appraisal skill, lack of knowledge needed to practice EBM, negative attitudes toward EBM, and insufficient time to search for evidence. Providing EBM training to the needs of medical interns would overcome the barriers identified in this study, as well as assist medical interns and other clinical staffs to ensure the correct application of EBM in to clinical practice.

AB  - Introduction: Musculoskeletal injury in the workplace is the primary work-related factor in loss of nursing personnel from the workforce. Moving or transferring patients is the dominant contributing event. A simulation educational approach has not been closely studied in this area but may have advantages over traditional approaches. Specific aims were to (1) evaluate the effect of a simulation intervention on success of patient transfers in a clinical setting and (2) measure change in participants' knowledge and attitude as a result of the intervention.
   Methods: A prospective, observational, longitudinal design was used. Baseline patient transfer observations were conducted on control and intervention units. An optimum task set was developed using hierarchical task analysis methods. Subjects (N = 71) completed pre- and postintervention knowledge and attitude assessments. The intervention consisted of simulated patient transfers using a mannequin, education, and training, followed by repeated simulated transfers using a mannequin with debriefing. Observations of patient transfers in patient care areas were repeated at 4 and 12 weeks.
   Results: Patient transfer success improved from 66% at baseline to 88% at the 4-week measurement point (t = 7.447, P <= 0.0004). At 12 weeks, transfer success had decreased to 71%, with addition of new employees between weeks 4 and 12 confounding the 12-week measurement. Knowledge improved from a baseline of 65% to 95% postsimulation intervention (z = -6.634, P <= 0.0004). Attitude change was also evaluated with significance seen with 12 of 15 items (P <= 0.05).
   Conclusions: A simulation intervention was successful in significantly improving knowledge and changing subject perceptions with regard to this task. Skills acquired through simulation successfully transferred to the clinical setting. Improvement in success for patient moves not trained in the simulation laboratory suggests that acquired skills were generalizable and supports application to different settings.

AB  - Assessment in learning is always of interest to practitioners, academics and researchers, and is always evolving with new implications. Alternative forms of assessment such as e-portfolios have gained recognition in documenting students' learning, as it is synchronous with both product and process. Vast amount of literature narrates the relative advantages of e-portfolios across disciplines, institutions, and applications. In Malaysia, such alternative assessment practices are less explored so far in teacher education. In this study, 55 pre-service TESOL teachers from Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) are required to create and maintain a personal e-portfolio. The aim of the study is to ascertain the future teachers' practices with e-portfolios in their learning and to determine if these practices lead to teaching competencies. In addition, the study also aims to identify the benefits and challenges of using an eportfolio as a tool for learning and self-assessment. Findings indicate that participants are appreciative of e-portfolios, as their performance and achievements are traced over time. It is also found that e-portfolios function as a monitoring tool, which helps the teachers recognize their learning and identify their strengths and weaknesses. Challenges are also noted, which include validity and reliability, interrupted Internet connection, negative attitudes participants, time constraints, workload and ethical issues. In terms of teacher competencies, it is found that six competencies emerge from the teachers' practices of e-portfolios - (1) developing understanding of an effective teacher's role; (2) developing teaching approaches/activities; (3) improving linguistic abilities; (4) comprehending content knowledge; (5) gaining la skills and; (6) the realization of the need to change mindsets.

AB  - Purpose: Perceived discrimination, perceptions of receiving differential treatment due to negative attitudes, and stereotypes about one's racial/ethnic group can increase vulnerability to depression and anxiety. Although ethnic minority youth now represent over half of the U.S. youth population, few studies have investigated potential protective factors in the relationship between perceived discrimination and mental health across diverse ethnic minority immigrant youth from different cultural backgrounds. Methods: We examined the association between perceived discrimination and past week symptoms of depression and anxiety and whether patterns of problem and emotion-focused coping moderate these relationships among Somali and Hispanic immigrant youth (N = 353) in an urban midwestern setting (mean age = 15; 53% male, 39% first generation, 75% low income). Path analysis models examined the main effects of perceived discrimination for depression and anxiety and whether problem and emotion-focused coping moderated these associations. Results: Path analysis models suggest that perceived discrimination was positively associated with past week symptoms of depression (13 = .37, standard error = .06) and anxiety (13 = .16, standard error = .06) across ethnicity. However, adolescents who reported high levels of discrimination and who used predominantly problem-focused coping strategies experienced fewer internalizing problems than youth who relied predominantly on emotion-focused coping strategies. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that strengthening youths' problem-focused coping strategies in the face of discriminatory stress is a promising health promotion and risk prevention approach.

AB  - In this study, we explore how ethnic diversity at the macro-level relates to students' generalized trust by using cross-national data. Our analysis shows a positive relationship between ethnic diversity and generalized trust. This relationship is, however, inverted U-shaped curvilinear rather than linear, indicating that the positive relationship levels off and turns negative. While we also find that students' educational experiences such as social relations at school are positively associated with generalized trust, ethnic diversity at the macro-level is still the most powerful factor in our analysis predicting students' generalized trust. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Human-elephant conflict (HEC) is one of the most complex issues for elephant conservation today and is on the increase. Incidents involving elephants can have severe consequences for people who co-exist with them, creating negative attitudes. While there has been a great deal of research on crop raiding, other forms of conflict including fence damage are poorly documented, but could still give rise to significant costs for households. In this study, we investigated the frequency, severity and patterns of fence damage caused by elephants in communities of the Trans Mara District, Kenya in 2014-2015 and compared these to patterns of crop raiding. In total there were 792 incidents involving fence damage only, 517 incidents involving crop and fence damage, and 72 incidents involving only crop damage. While the majority of fence damage incidents occurred between 18:00 and 06:00, some damage continued until 09:00. Fence damage occurred in every month of the study period and peaked when the frequency of crop damage decreased, highlighting the year-round nature of HEC in this region. The persistent occurrence of HEC in the Trans Mara, on both a daily and an annual timescale, becomes much more apparent when incidents of fence damage are considered as well as crop raiding. Such constant conflict could have significant implications for effects on human wellbeing and consequently, on local attitudes towards elephants and conservation efforts. This research highlights the need for more attention to be paid to the patterns and perceptions of all types of HEC, not just crop raiding, across elephant ranges in order to plan effective mitigation strategies.

AB  - Aims and objectives. To ascertain the views and experiences of mental health consumers regarding the availability and quality of care and treatment received for their physical health needs.
   Background. People diagnosed with mental illness have higher occurrence of physical health problems. Responsive health care services are crucial for prevention and management of physical health problems, and for reducing disparities in health between people diagnosed with mental illness and those who are not. There is limited research giving voice to consumer perspectives on their experiences with health care providers.
   Design. Exploratory qualitative.
   Methods. Focus group interviews with mental health consumers accessed via a consumer network group in a region of Australia (n = 31). All interview audio recordings were transcribed professionally. Interviews were thematically analysed.
   Results. The main themes were: symptomising; failure to act and alertness to prejudice. The first two themes were consumer perceptions of the actions and behaviours of health professionals, and the third describes consumer responses to these behaviours and actions. Consumers described increased risks of illness and death because of undiagnosed physical illness despite their physical health advice-seeking as the reason for the health consultation.
   Conclusion. Health care providers' non-recognition of physical health problems presents a clear example of a significant and potentially life threatening health inequity. The service provider responses described by participants suggest that mental health consumers' physical health needs may not be taken seriously.

AB  - Emerging methods for studying cultural dynamics allow researchers to investigate cultural change with newfound rigor. One change that has recently attracted the attention of social commentators is "concept creep," the semantic inflation of harm-related concepts such as trauma, bullying, and prejudice. In theory, concept creep is driven distally by several recent cultural and societal trends, but psychology also plays a proximal role in developing and disseminating expansionary concepts of harm. However, there have been few systematic attempts to document concept creep and none to explore factors that influence it. The present work reviews concept creep from the perspective of cultural dynamics and lays out a conceptual framework for exploring processes implicated in it. Illustrative analyses are presented that apply computational linguistic methods to very large text corpora, including a new corpus of psychology article abstracts. They demonstrate that harm has risen steeply in prominence both in psychology and in the wider culture in recent decades, and that harm-related concepts have inflated their meanings over this period. The analyses also provide evidence of dynamic relationships between the prominence and semantic breadth of harm-related concepts, and between psychology and the culture at large. Implications are drawn for theory and research on concept creep.
   Public Significance Statement This study indicates that concepts of harm have broadened their meanings and become more prominent in psychology over the past half century. It suggests that similar changes have occurred in the culture at large, and that the respective changes may be dynamically linked. These findings signal that psychology is implicated in an important cultural shift.

AB  - In partnership with the Canadian Mental Health Association, Ontario Division, the purpose of this study was to conduct a post-season evaluation of the effectiveness of a mental health and suicide-awareness program called Talk Today, delivered to elite adolescent male hockey players and their support staff. The study was conducted using a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design that began with a quantitative phase followed by a qualitative phase. In total, 105 participants (49 athletes, 56 staff) completed online questionnaires and 12 (6 athletes, 6 staff) participated in qualitative interviews. Results integrated quantitative and qualitative findings to examine participants' perceptions of acceptability of the program, acquisition and application of knowledge, and perceptions of stigma following the program. Findings revealed that 78% of athletes and 90% of staff reported high levels of satisfaction with the program, 85% of athletes and 87% of staff felt they acquired knowledge on mental health including access to resources, and 68% of athletes and 87% of staff felt they could provide more effective support to individuals with mental health issues. Participants felt the program helped them to identify, approach, and support someone experiencing mental health issues. Additionally, participants reported lower levels of personal stigma in comparison to levels of public stigma towards persons with mental health problems. Overall, results suggest a high level of openness to a mental health and suicide-awareness program among elite male adolescent athletes. Given that this group typically holds negative attitudes towards mental health, these findings are promising for the future implementation of such programs.

AB  - We investigated whether stereotypes linking Black men and Black boys with violence and criminality generalize to Black women and Black girls. In Experiments 1 and 2, non-Black participants completed sequential-priming tasks wherein they saw faces varying in race, age, and gender before categorizing danger-related objects or words. Experiment 3 compared task performance across non-Black and Black participants. Results revealed that (a) implicit stereotyping of Blacks as more dangerous than Whites emerged across target age, target gender, and perceiver race, with (b) a similar magnitude of racial bias across adult and child targets and (c) a smaller magnitude for female than male targets. Evidence for age bias and gender bias also emerged whereby (d) across race, adult targets were more strongly associated with danger than were child targets, and (e) within Black (but not White) targets, male targets were more strongly associated with danger than were female targets.

AB  - Sable antelope numbers in the Kruger National Park have declined substantially since the mid-1980s and have shown little recovery despite improved rainfall conditions. We used aerial survey records to investigate how changes in herd numbers, herd sizes, calf proportions and consequent changes in the distribution range of breeding herds contributed to this situation. Both herd sizes and herd numbers decreased in the drier northern half of the park, coupled with low calf proportions, especially during and following a severe drought, while declines in these measures became evident later in the wetter southern half. Herd extirpations led to a 25% contraction in the local distribution range of sable antelope, although some of these herds had only become established during the high rainfall period in the late 1970s. Local population trends were not related to increases in zebra numbers potentially attracting more predators. Compensatory density dependence in the population growth rate was no longer evident after 1986 during the period of the population decline. The population trajectory modelled from rainfall relationships indicated that the depressed population growth rate relative to rainfall apparent after 1986 has persisted, implicating either enduring habitat degradation or continuing high predation pressure. The pattern of the population decline and subsequent lack of recovery raises the possibility that an Allee effect could be operating, mediated through the consequences of reduced herd sizes for exposure to predation. Our findings suggest how delays in responding to declining population numbers could prejudice population recovery well before the overall population size drops to levels threatening population viability.

AB  - Drawing on the Canadian case, this study examines whether, in a multinational state, majority and minority nations emphasize different criteria when tracing the borders of their respective national community. It does so by comparing native-born French speakers in Quebec and native-born English speakers in the rest of Canada from three different perspectives. We examine (a) the wayascriptiveandattainablegroupings of characteristics are constructed in Quebec and in the rest of Canada, (b) the importance given to attainable and ascriptive characteristics, and (c) the implications of ascriptive and attainable characteristics for attitudes toward immigration and generalized trust. The findings suggest that majority-group members in Quebec and in the rest of Canada broadly draw the boundaries of their nation in similar ways and with similar implications.

AB  - Some past work indicates that sexual minorities may experience impairments in social health, or the perceived and actual availability and quality of one's social relationships, relative to heterosexuals; however, research has been limited in many ways. Furthermore, it is important to investigate etiological factors that may be associated with these disparities, such as self-reported discrimination The current work tested whether sexual minority adults in the United States reported less positive social health (i.e., loneliness, friendship strain, familial strain, and social capital) relative to heterosexuals and whether self reported discrimination accounted for these disparities. Participants for the current study (N= 579) were recruited via Amazon' s Mechanical Turk, including 365 self-identified heterosexuals (105 women) and 214 sexual minorities (103 women). Consistent with hypotheses, sexual minorities reported impaired social health relative to heterosexuals, with divergent patterns emerging by sexual orientation subgroup (which were generally consistent across sexes). Additionally, self -reported discrimination accounted for disparities across three of four indicators of social health. These findings suggest that sexual minorities may face obstacles related to prejudice and discrimination that impair the functioning of their relationships and overall social health. Moreover, because social health is closely related to psychological and physical health, remediating disparities in social relationships may be necessary to address other health disparities based upon sexual orientation. Expanding upon these results, implications for efforts to build resilience among sexual minorities are discussed.

AB  - Background: In medical training, statistics is considered a very difficult course to learn and teach. Current studies have found that students' attitudes toward statistics can influence their learning process. Measuring, evaluating and monitoring the changes of students' attitudes toward statistics are important. Few studies have focused on the attitudes of postgraduates, especially medical postgraduates. Our purpose was to understand current attitudes regarding statistics held by medical postgraduates and explore their effects on students' achievement. We also wanted to explore the influencing factors and the sources of these attitudes and monitor their changes after a systematic statistics course.
   Methods: A total of 539 medical postgraduates enrolled in a systematic statistics course completed the pre-form of the Survey of Attitudes Toward Statistics -28 scale, and 83 postgraduates were selected randomly from among them to complete the post-form scale after the course.
   Results: Most medical postgraduates held positive attitudes toward statistics, but they thought statistics was a very difficult subject. The attitudes mainly came from experiences in a former statistical or mathematical class. Age, level of statistical education, research experience, specialty and mathematics basis may influence postgraduate attitudes toward statistics. There were significant positive correlations between course achievement and attitudes toward statistics. In general, student attitudes showed negative changes after completing a statistics course.
   Conclusions: The importance of student attitudes toward statistics must be recognized in medical postgraduate training. To make sure all students have a positive learning environment, statistics teachers should measure their students' attitudes and monitor their change of status during a course. Some necessary assistance should be offered for those students who develop negative attitudes.

AB  - Little is known about the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) students attending religious colleges and universities. This study used grounded theory to analyze the narratives (N = 271) of LGBTQ former and current students. The central theme described by LGBTQ students was a fight for survival with five subthemes: (a) institutionalized homo/transphobia (strict school policies, enforcement of heterosexuality and gender conformity through discipline, conversion therapy); (b) a culture of fear (fear of exposure, homophobic panic and code words, seeking cover); (c) marginalization and isolation; (d) struggle (suffering and suicide, reconciling faith and LGBTQ identity); and (e) coping and resilience (surviving through critical thinking and strategic activism). Implications for practice are provided.

AB  - In recent years the international community has acknowledged the importance of gender perspectives in Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), arguing that social constructs of gender lead to structural inequalities, prejudices and biases that articulate people's disaster vulnerabilities and capabilities in all disaster phases. Studies showed that especially women are prone to genderbased disaster risks, and it is the responsibility of national governments not only to identify these vulnerabilities but also to develop disaster education and preparedness strategies to address them. To better understand gender-based disaster vulnerability in Japan, this study identifies factors of disaster vulnerabilities of women within a complex set of social and community norms and values, stressing the impact of public discourses of gender. Then, this paper addresses the questions: "What are the disaster vulnerabilities of women in Japan?" and "What is the impact of discourses of gender on disaster vulnerabilities of women in disaster preparedness Japan?". To address the first question, factors of vulnerability were identified through Grounded Theory based on data collected from participant observations and stakeholder interviews. Then, the impact of discourses around gender was extracted from the literature on gender and DRR using Critical Discourse Analysis. The study results show that the main factors of gendered disaster vulnerability are inadequate disaster education, a lack of protection measures, and cultural issues. Moreover, public discourses of gender are shown to not only shape these factors but to be deeply embedded in Japan's disaster preparedness strategies at large affecting both the quality and quantity of disaster information available.

AB  - This study examined how a diverse group of sexual and gender minority (SGM) homeless youth described and understood their victimization experiences occurring before they were homeless and those occurring after they were homeless and engaging in survival sex. In addition, the study explored how these youths manifested resilience when living on the street. The sample consisted of 283 racially/ethnically diverse youth between the ages of 15 and 26 years (M = 19.6, SD = 1.28) living in a large U.S. city. Participants identified their gender as male (47%), female (36%), transgender (15%), or queer and other (3%) and their sexual orientation as bisexual (37%), gay (23%), lesbian (15%), heterosexual (13%), or queer and other (13%). Thirty-seven percent identified as Black, 30% as multiracial, 22% as Latino/a, 5% as White, and 5% as another race. Content and thematic analyses were used to conduct a secondary analysis of qualitative data. Four themes were identified: unsafe and unsupported at home; barriers to housing and employment stability; ongoing victimization and lack of protection; and unexpected opportunities for resilience. Findings demonstrated that participants experienced victimization related not only to their SGM identities but also to chaotic home environments. Once homeless and engaging in survival sex, youth experienced barriers to securing employment and housing as well as victimization by police and clients. These experiences frequently involved prejudice related to their intersecting identities. Despite encountering numerous challenges, participants described surviving on the streets by living openly and forming relationships with other youth. Implications for practice and policy are discussed.

AB  - Wildlife species damaging crops can cause substantial losses to farmers and at the same time create negative attitudes against wildlife and conservation efforts that may result in negative interactions against wildlife and lead to human-wildlife conflicts (HWCs). For the analysis of negative interactions between humans and terrestrial wildlife species, a globally applicable scheme for monitoring was developed and applied over 6 years in study areas of two Asian (Nepal and India) and two African (Zambia and Tanzania) countries. Factors influencing crop consumption by eight different groups of herbivores were monitored and analyzed using generalized linear models. Seasonality, crop availability, type and the phenological stage of the crop seem to play an important role in the crop damaging behavior of herbivores. Crop consumers such as elephants (Loxodonta africana and Elephas maximus), zebra (Equus quagga spp.) and boars/hogs (Sus scrofa, Potamocherus larvatus and Phacochoerus africanus) show preferences for harvested and/or maturing crops. Rhinos (Rhinoceros unicornis) and antelopes/deer (Taurotragus oryx, Aepyceros melampus, Boselaphus tragocamelus and Axis axis) damage the highest numbers of fields with crops at an intermediate growth stage. The findings of this study can inform management of HWCs in areas where people and wildlife coexist. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the benefits of standardized HWC assessments in order to compare data from different continents and between different species to be able to draw generalized conclusions for the management of HWC.

AB  - Background: Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) stigma (ie, negative attitudes toward PrEP users) has been widely documented and is considered a significant barrier to implementation. However, few studies have examined PrEP stigma using implicit measures designed to reduce demand characteristics in responding. This study examined implicit PrEP-and HIV-related stigma among gay and bisexual men using geospatial social networking applications (ie, "hookup apps").
   Methods: Participants were presented with 4 simulated online profiles (pretested for comparability) paired with each of the following characteristics: HIV negative, HIV positive, on PrEP, or substance user. Participants rated the profiles on attractiveness, desirability, trustworthiness, likelihood of condom use, and riskiness of sex.
   Results: There was no evidence of PrEP-related stigma, ie, participants did not rate profiles of PrEP users more negatively than profiles of HIV-negative individuals not disclosing PrEP use. However, profiles of HIV-positive individuals were rated significantly less attractive and desirable than HIV-negative or PrEP profiles. When the sample was split by history of PrEP use, negative ratings of HIV-positive profiles remained only among participants who had never taken PrEP. Participants with any history of PrEP use demonstrated no difference in ratings by HIV status.
   Conclusion: These data provide the first empirical evidence for lower HIV stigma among PrEP users. Individuals who have used PrEP may "see" HIV-positive individuals differently than those without a history of PrEP use. The lack of evidence for PrEP-related stigma is encouraging and suggests that negative stereotypes about PrEP users may not extend to negative implicit judgments about them on social networking sites.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe a strap-down image stable strategy for multi-load optoelectronic imaging platform hung below a tethered aerostat.
   Design/methodology/approach - Four two dimension pods, each with a visible light camera, are fixed on the optoelectronic platform. A POS (Position and Orientation System) is used to acquire the attitude rate data of optoelectronic platform, while the data can be coupled to the pods' servo systems through corresponding coordinate rotation, then the motors of pods will adjust the line of sight to the opposite way to keep the stabilization of image exported by visible light camcorders. Simultaneously, two rate gyros are installed at the inner frame of each pod, which are used as a backup to avoid the failure of POS.
   Findings - Using one attitude and position measurement system can realize the stabilization of multi optoelectronic pods, which is same as or even better than the ratio gyro stabilization.
   Research limitations/implications - As the tethered aerostat is a flexible body, it is affected a lot by the wind speed and wind direction at the low height (< 1,000 m), which leads to the motors of pods always adjust the line of sight to the mechanical limiting of pods.
   Practical implications - Strap-down stabilization technology has been successfully used in the tethered aerostat monitoring platform to surveillance Shanghai World EXPO site. Long time experiments verify the feasible and effective of the multi-load stabilization technology. The impact on the image by the adjustment of servos is less than 10 percent of the whole view of sight.
   Originality/value - The paper introduces a strap-down stabilization technology for multi-load tethered aerostat platform, which is more suitable to be applied in the platform of relatively minor attitude change, like the airborne multi-load platform and multi-load UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) platform.

AB  - The 20th century saw the dismantling of several oppressive regimes and an international turn toward greater social justice. Yet structural inequality and intergroup animosity persist in many postcolonial and postslavery contexts, not least because the dehumanization inherent to those regimes remain entrenched socially. Here we examined whether the racialized hierarchy established under the inhumane South African apartheid system is still manifest in patterns of dehumanization today, and how this impacts intergroup relations and behaviors related to structural reform. Specifically, we investigated blatant dehumanization as the explicit attribution of reduced human uniqueness, factors contributing to its tenacity, and its intergroup outcomes in a national sample of the three largest racialized groups: Black African, Coloured, and White. We found that, despite significant changes in power dynamics postapartheid, dehumanization ratings mirrored the apartheid-inspired hierarchy, with White people rated "more human" than Coloured people, and Coloured people rated "more human" than Black African people across participants. Levels of dehumanization were ameliorated by positive intergroup contact and reinforced by feeling dehumanized (meta-dehumanization) and hierarchy-legitimizing beliefs in White and Coloured participants. Finally, White participants' dehumanization of Black African people predicted, beyond prejudice, several outcomes (social distance, collective action, and petition support) that would sustain the unequal status quo. Our results suggest that intergroup dynamics are influenced by the positions people occupied on the apartheid racial hierarchy, and that curbing dehumanization should be prioritized to advance structural reform in South Africa.

AB  - Residual carbon and ammonium in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) tail water lead fouling, and prejudice the operation and life time of reverse osmosis (RO) membrane. In this study, a new combined treatment system of ozone oyster shells fix-bed bioreactor (OFBR)-membrane bioreactor (MBR) was developed and pilot scale was tested for 110 days to intensify the removal of residual carbon and ammonium in WWTP tail water. This results showed that the mean maximum COD, ammonium and TP removal efficiencies were achieved by 73%, 99% and 43%, under the optimum ozone dosage of 70 mg L-1 and HRT of 25 h. The single contribution of OFBR and MBR was 62% and 38% to COD removal, 94% and 6% to ammonium removal, 63% and 37% to TP removal, respectively. High throughput sequencing data showed that there were rich bacterial populations (>2800 species), and Deinococcus-Thermus, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Planctomyctes were dominant in both reactors. After addition of ozone, Deinococcus-Thermus and Planctomyctes species bacteria increased significantly in OFBR, and Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Planctomyctes species bacteria increased remarkably in MBR, which might mainly contribute to carbon removal in OFBR and MBR, respectively. Aerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, and denitrifying bacteria were all existed in both reactors, which might be the main reasons for high removal efficiency of ammonium in OFBR-MBR system.

AB  - Background: Healthcare professionals are crucial in access to treatment for patients with substance use disorders. However, healthcare professionals often have negative attitudes towards this patient group. Healthcare professionals' regard for working with patients with substance use disorders was examined and three sectors in which professionals are working were compared.
   Methods: General practitioners (GPs; N=180), healthcare professionals of general psychiatry (N=89) and specialists in addiction services (N=78) filled out a questionnaire in which regard for working with patients with substance use disorders was assessed. ANOVAs were used to compare the sectors and multiple linear regression analysis tested the association of regard with attribution beliefs, emotional reactions and other characteristics of healthcare professionals.
   Results: Regard for working with patients with substance use disorders was different between the three sectors (GPs M=42.00; general psychiatry M=48.18; addiction specialists M=55.41; p=0.00, omega(2)=0.40). Attribution of personal responsibility and feeling of anger and fear were associated with lower regard scores. More familiarity with substance use problems, higher frequency of working with this patients group and more confidence in substance abuse treatment were positively associated with regard. Social desirability bias was present and was positively related to healthcare professionals' regard.
   Conclusions: Healthcare professionals of specialist addiction services showed higher regard for working with patients with substance use disorders compared to professionals of general psychiatry services and GPs. Improvement of education and shared care models in which healthcare professionals are supported by professionals specializing in addiction might address low regard. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - This study examined the factors that are likely to be associated with preferred behavioural and emotional responses to honour-threatening situations and possible differences between a dignity culture (United Kingdom) and an honour culture (Turkey). We examined the role of cultural background, type of social setting, and participants' causality orientation in preferred emotional and behavioural responses to honour-threatening situations. We first found that Turkish participants reported significantly higher levels of negative emotional response compared to British participants in the false accusation (not humiliation) scenario and in the public (not private) setting. Second, we found that Turkish participants reported a higher preference for retaliatory responses than did British participants when they imagined themselves being humiliated by one of their peers. Third, autonomy-oriented participants in the Turkish sample reported significantly higher levels of negative feeling (but not higher retaliatory intentions) compared with autonomy-oriented participants in the British sample, whereas controlled-oriented participants in the Turkish sample tended to report lower levels of negative feeling compared with controlled-oriented participants in the British sample. This interaction effect suggests that controlled- and autonomy-orientations may serve different functions in the Turkish and British settings.

AB  - Research Summary Substantial evidence indicates that leaders are perceived through a lens of gender bias, but what mitigates such bias remains underexplored. Examining men and women in creative, project-based leadership roles, we integrate insights from role congruity and gender bias literatures to predict how project unconventionality and leader gender affect external perceptions of project quality. We argue that prejudice against female leaders is strongest for conventional projects due to the established presence of male-centric prototypical projects which induce bias, but that project unconventionality weakens this bias by distancing the project from these male-centric prototypes. We find support for this using a sample of 1,414 films by 32 major film studios (1990-2014) across three measures of perceived quality: moviegoer ratings, critic ratings, and film awards. Managerial Summary Despite recent strides in gender equality, women are still highly underrepresented in leadership positions across all kinds of organizations. This is partly because society still views women as "less fit for leadership," and this both prevents the appointment of female leaders and damages audience perceptions of the few projects that women do lead. Surprisingly, we know little about how to address this bias. In this study, we predict that in terms of how audiences rate the quality of a project, "unconventional" projects are less susceptible to gender bias. After examining 1,414 feature films from 32 major studios, we find that whether audiences rate a female-directed film poorly depends on its conventionality-conventional films favor male directors, while unconventional films favor female directors.

AB  - One of the primary causes of lubricating oil failure in automobile engines is thermal degradation caused by high temperatures, which prejudices the lube oil capacity between friction pairs. This research aims to comprehensively investigate the effect of the h-BN/MoS2 hybrid nanoparticles and ionic liquid (IL) on the thermal performance of engine oil (5 W-40). The rheological results showed that nanolubricants (NL) behave like non-Newtonian fluids and IL promoted the viscosity value of lubricant due to the extension of alkyl chains. The thermal peculiarities of lube oil were analyzed by thermogravimetric (TGA/DTG/DSC) analysis to explore the thermal stability of h-BN/MoS2 hybrid nano-lubricants modified by IL and further revealed how IL improved the thermal characteristics. The results strongly showed the synergistic effect between the IL and h-BN/MoS2 hybrid nanoparticles produces a complicated interaction at high temperatures, forming a layer of film which can delay the erosion of high temperature on the surface of the nanoparticles. Ultimately, this study revealed a delay of burnout temperature in thermal degradation by approximately 8.1% under the use of hybrid nano-lube oils in a wide temperature range.

AB  - Background: Nursing care is guided by a value base focusing on promoting dignity and health by means of the caring relationship. However, previous research has revealed that negative attitudes towards 'addicted' patients, as well as these patients' behaviour, can give rise to negative emotions such as frustration and disappointment among nurses. This can contribute to a judgmental and controlling attitude towards patients. To preserve order, nursing interventions focusing on creating structure and stability could be applied in a way that challenges caring values.
   Aims and objectives: This study aimed to describe how nurses' working in inpatient psychiatric care experience caring encounters with patients suffering from substance use disorder (SUD).
   Design: This qualitative study is part of a clinical application project focusing on value-based care of patients suffering from SUD. Data were obtained during four reflective group dialogues with six nurses in a psychiatric hospital.
   Methods: The transcribed dialogues were subjected to latent qualitative content analysis.
   Results: The analysis facilitated the organisation of the findings into a coherent pattern. A common thread of meaning was conceptualised as a theme labelled 'the multifaceted vigilance', describing how nurses strived to deliver good care, while at the same time being vigilant towards patients' behaviour as well as their own reactions to it. Within that theme, four categories described experiences related to different challenges nurses face in caring encounters.
   Conclusion: We suggest that this perhaps unavoidable aspect of caring encounters can be an asset. Thus, if acknowledged and subject to reflection, being vigilant could be understood as a strength enabling nurses to safeguard caring values, and to use their authority to promote patients' health and alleviate suffering.

AB  - Cat management is often discussed in terms of population reduction, with trap-neuter-return (TNR) campaigns commonly organized to manage unowned urban cat populations. However, long-term effectiveness is only possible if positive neutering practices are continued by local residents. Here we discuss how implementing TNR within a wider framework of social engagement has the potential to tackle cat overpopulation and instill long-term positive behavior change toward them. We demonstrate how community engagement pre-TNR can help establish a baseline of the attitudes, knowledge and behavior concerning cats. Using a case study, we explore whether this information can be linked with positive intended behavior based on intentions to arrange for neutering of unowned cats. Structural equation modeling indicated that negative attitudes toward cats and reduced knowledge around neutering reduced the likelihood of positive intended behavior. This result was underpinned by the indirect effects of perceptions of unowned cats and reduced understanding of their needs. Utilizing these results alongside an understanding of the values and motivation of the community allows for tailored and targeted education and intervention. In turn, this addresses the underlying knowledge gaps and perceptions regarding cat welfare. This framework can help address the challenge of cat management because it: (1) takes an integrative approach to identifying the motivations of communities to take responsibility for unowned cats; (2) changes the structure of the social environment, encouraging positive neutering practices for unowned cats. In turn this improves the impact and longevity of TNR campaigns whilst promoting positive welfare change for unowned and owned cats; and (3) appreciates that opinions are likely to vary hugely between areas, therefore providing an adaptable community level approach.

AB  - This article aims to determine whether Algerian public spaces are gendered or gender neutral and to deduce the place of women in this type of hedonistic aesthetic consumption space. A non-probability sample of 363 individuals allowed us to collect the necessary data on the basis of an experiential scale designed for Algerian public spaces. This scale offers us the possibility of measuring their spatial and phenomenal experiential tendency. In other words, it allows us to evaluate the potential of their sensorial, relational, emotional, cognitive, behavioural spaces, their urban environments and their spirits of the place. This scale has undergone the tests of reliability and validity laid down by Churchill. It has also undergone the latest generation confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) method. Due to the non-normality of the sample distribution, we applied non-parametric tests in our analysis. The Mann Whitney U tests were used to calculate and compare the indices of spatial and phenomenal segregation of public places. The results revealed the gendered or gender-neutral nature of the three public places with their respective mapping. In the end, on the basis of the cultural dimensions of Hofstede, we were able to get to know the populations of the cities in our case studies that require urgent awareness-raising action. This promotes gender equality and especially the right of women to use and occupy hedonic public spaces without any conditions or prejudice.

AB  - Purpose: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals in Romania encounter pervasive stigma and discrimination and there is a high need for LGBT-competent mental health professionals (MHPs). We tested the impact of a pilot LGBT-affirmative training for MHPs in Romania on these professionals' LGBT-relevant attitudes, knowledge, and perception of clinical skills.
   Methods: We conducted a 2-day training for MHPs in Bucharest. Fifty-four attended and 33 provided training evaluation data at baseline and follow-up.
   Results: The majority of trainees were female (90%) and heterosexual (73%) with a mean age of 36.4 (SD = 7.7). From baseline to follow-up, trainees demonstrated a significant increase in perceived LGBT-relevant clinical skills (P < 0.001) and perceived knowledge (P < 0.05). LGBT-affirmative practice attitudes (P < 0.05) and comfort in addressing the mental health of LGBT individuals (P < 0.01) increased significantly, and homonegative and transnegative attitudes decreased significantly (P < 0.01). Negative attitudes toward LGBT individuals were low at both baseline and follow-up. The majority of trainees reported being highly interested in the training (84%), which they reported had prepared them to interact with and care for LGBT individuals (74%).
   Conclusion: This pilot training appeared to be effective in increasing perceived LGBT competence among participating MHPs. This type of training model needs to be tested further in a randomized controlled trial with longer follow-up periods to assess intervention durability and implementation of clinical skills. Future trainings can be incorporated into existing curricula. National accreditation bodies might consider encouraging such training as part of standard educational requirements.

AB  - Objectives
   Concussion non-disclosure research has focused almost exclusively on athletes. The focus on athletic populations has been sensible considering athletes' demonstrated susceptibility to sustaining and concealing concussions. Nevertheless, the habitual use of athletic populations has allowed researchers and practitioners to omit the development of generalized perceived costs and perceived rewards as critical determinants of concussion self-disclosure. We hypothesized that perceiving concussion disclosure as generally more costly than rewarding would predict negative attitudes towards disclosure and decreased intent to disclose. We also hypothesized that generalized perceived costs and rewards could explain concussion non-disclosure in different populations, athletes and future pilots specifically, even when those populations perceive concussion self-disclosure as costly for different specific reasons.
   Methods
   We examined concussion disclosure using 2,504 cadets at the United States Air Force Academy. Cadets completed anonymous surveys assessing their intention to self-disclose undiagnosed concussions (Anticipated Concussion Disclosure) as well as several variables potentially related to concussion self-disclosure: perceived cost, perceived reward, personal identity, attitudes, normative behavior, social support, and self-efficacy.
   Results
   The results demonstrate that concussion non-disclosure develops when a population perceives disclosure as more costly (i.e. directly or emotionally) and less rewarding. Perceived Cost and Perceived Reward variables alone accounted for 50% of the variance in Anticipated Conclusion Disclosure (Adjusted R-2 = 0.50, F(2,2312) = 1,145.31, p < 0.001). As expected, Anticipated Conclusion Disclosure developed for different reasons within different sub-populations. Consistent with existing research, cadet intercollegiate athletes reported being primarily concerned that concussion self-disclosure would cause them to miss practice or game time (t (736.7) = 14.20, p <.001, Cohen's d = 0.96). In contrast, cadet future pilots reported being primarily concerned that concussion self-disclosure would have negative United States Air Force career repercussions (t (1828) = 10.25, p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.50).
   Conclusions
   These results suggest that cultures of concussion non-disclosure can develop in any population where disclosure is perceived as having undesirable consequences, not just athletic populations. Concussion researchers and practitioners should devote more attention to the perceived cost-benefit structures that create concussion non-disclosure to address this crucial public health issue more effectively.

AB  - Backround: Internalized stigma, adoption of negative attitudes, and societal stereotypes regarding acne vulgaris (AV) have not been previously studied. Objective: To investigate the internalized stigma state in AV and determine its association with quality of life, perceived health, body image, and depression Methods: A total of 77 AV patients (43 female, 34 male; aged 19.7 +/- 2.3 years) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The scales used in the study were Acne Internalized Stigma Scale (AISS), Acne Quality of Life scale (AQOL), FDA Global score, Perceived Health Status (PHS), Body Image Scale (BIS), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results: Mean AISS scores (53.68 +/- 13.6) were significantly higher in males than in females (57.41 +/- 14.37, 50.39 +/- 12.25, P = 0.042). There was a significant positive correlation between mean values of AISS and AQOL (r = 0.816, P < 0.001), FDA Global grade (r = 0.391, P = 0.002) and BDI (r = 0.440, P < 0.001). Lower PHS (P = 0.027) was another determinant of high AISS scores. The mean AISS score of patients with a family history was significantly lower than those without a family history (P = 0.007). VAS was also found to be correlated with mean values of AISS and AQOL. Linear regression analysis revealed that the most important determinant of internalized stigma was AQOL (beta = 0,632; P < 0.001), followed by gender (beta = -0,229; P = 0.001), FDA Global score (beta = 0,193; P = 0.007), and BDI (beta = 0,177; P = 0.024). Discussion: Significant and independent predictive factors for high internalized stigma state were the negative quality of life, male gender, the severity of the illness, and depression. Therefore, internalized stigma may be one of the major factors responsible for the psychosocial burden of AV.

AB  - Conflicts with human interests have reappeared following recovery of large carnivores in Europe. Public acceptance is higher than historically but there is a need to identify effective, acceptable techniques to facilitate coexistence. We present a case study of predation on livestock in Slovakia. Damage, mitigation measures and public opinion were assessed using compensation records, analysis of farm conditions, questionnaire surveys, semi-structured interviews, diet analysis and on-farm trials of livestock-guarding dogs. Economic damage was inconsequential on a national scale but high locally: c. 80% of reported losses occurred at 12% of sheep flocks. Grey wolves Canis lupus were held responsible for four to six times more damage than brown bears Ursus arctos, although livestock occurred in only 2 of 78 wolf faeces during spring-autumn, when sheep and cattle were most vulnerable. Losses to Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx were negligible. Compared to other sectors of society shepherds had the most negative attitudes, particularly towards wolves, despite compensation payments. Appropriate use of livestock-guarding dogs was associated with fewer losses: median loss at trial flocks with predation was 70% lower than at control flocks. We conclude that identifying vulnerable farms and targeting them for mitigation could reduce damage, although lack of motivation and awareness are obstacles. This study shows that damage levels need not be excessive despite high predator densities in human-dominated landscapes. Conflicts were unevenly distributed, with much of the variation explained by local conditions and husbandry practices, especially preventive measures. Livestock-guarding dogs are particularly appropriate where wolves are present in proximity to unfenced pastures.

AB  - Abortion is a relatively frequent experience, yet public discourse about abortion is contentious and stigmatizing. Little literature is available on private conversations about abortion, which may be distinct from public discourse. We explored private discourse by documenting the nature of women's discussions about abortion with peers in a book club. We recruited thirteen women's book clubs in nine states. Participants (n = 119) read the book Choice: True Stories of Birth, Contraception, Infertility, Adoption, Single Parenthood, & Abortion, and participated in a book club meeting, which we audio-recorded and transcribed. Data collection occurred between April 2012 and April 2013. In contrast to public discourse of abortion, private discourse was nuanced and included disclosures of multiple kinds of experiences with abortion. Participants disclosed having abortions, considering abortion as an option for past or future pregnancies, and supporting others through an abortion. Distinguishing between public and private discourse enabled us to identify that an abortion experience could include personal decisions, hypothetical decisions, or connection with someone having an abortion. The book club atmosphere provided a rare opportunity for participants to explore their relationship to abortion. More research is needed to understand the role of private discourse in reducing abortion stigma.

AB  - The Bogardus social distance scale, which measures the level of acceptance that Americans feel toward members of the most common ethnic and racial groups in the United States, was administered six times nationally between 1920 and 2001. Replicating the most recent study with its revised list of ethnic and racial groups, the authors of this study analyzed a stratified random sample of 3,166 college students, making it the largest national social distance study ever conducted. The findings indicate an increase since 2001 in the mean level of social distance toward all ethnic groups, as well as in the spread between the groups with the highest and lowest levels of social distance. Further, a consistency between studies in group preferences reaffirms the relevance of the similarity-attraction bond in accepting those who are racially and culturally different. Mean comparisons and analysis of variance tests also showed that gender, birthplace of respondents and/or their parents, race, and year in college are all significant indicators of the level of social distance toward groups.

AB  - Purpose: Occupational safety and health (OSH) professionals are often the point of contact for health and safety policies derived in the workplace, and the handling of incidents in their aftermath. As chronic pain affects 20% of people, many pain-awareness campaigns and educational activities target healthcare professionals. However, initiatives directed toward OSH professionals are also important to aid in prevention and rehabilitation efforts. The objective of this study was to describe knowledge and attitudes of OSH students with regard to chronic pain.
   Methods: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted amongst a convenience sample of 88 students enrolled in the distance learning OSH undergraduate certificate program at the Universite du Quebec en Abitibi-Temiscamingue (Quebec, Canada).
   Results: Although 30% of students were already employed within OSH or human resources and 40% reported intervening in cases involving chronic pain in their line of work, 56% of respondents had received no training on chronic pain and its treatment in the past five years. Only 14% chose to take the optional 45 hr course dedicated to pain within the program. OSH students also exhibited poorer knowledge and more negative attitudes toward people suffering from chronic pain when compared to other groups assessed in the province of Quebec, including healthcare professionals, chronic pain patients, and people not suffering from chronic pain (p <= 0.0002). Half of the respondents (51.9%) were not aware that chronic pain affects 1 in 5 adults.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrates a need for pain education within OSH training programs and through continuing education.

AB  - Background: In Ethiopia, maternal health service utilization is still unacceptably low. The societal and cultural factors that constrain women from attending these services have not yet been sufficiently explored. Using qualitative methods, we aimed to explore the factors that delay maternal health service utilization in eastern Ethiopia.
   Method: A total of 13 audio-recorded focus group discussions were conducted comprising 88 participants. We conducted separate group discussions with reproductive aged women, mothers-in-law, traditional birth attendants, husbands, and Health Extension Workers to capture their knowledge, practices, feelings, thoughts and attitudes towards maternal health service utilization. The recorded sessions were transcribed into the local language and then translated into English for analysis.
   Result: The study identified a number of factors that may delay maternal health service utilization. Factors were grouped using the Three Delays model as a framework. Low level of awareness regarding need, poor involvement of husband, perceived absence of health problems, social power, community misperceptions and cultural restrictions, negative attitudes towards male midwives, acceptance of traditional birth attendants and poor social networking were Delay One factors. Lack of physical accessibility and high transportation costs were categorised as Delay Two factors for skilled birth care attendance. Perceived or experienced poor quality of care were categorised as Delay Three factors for both skilled birth and postnatal care utilization.
   Conclusion: Despite the ongoing government measures to improve maternal health service utilization in Ethiopia, numerous factors continue to contribute to delays in service use, which in turn contribute to high maternal mortality.

AB  - Aim. This paper reports a study conducted to describe Chinese nurses attitudes and practice in addressing the sexuality concerns of people with gynaecological cancer. Background. Women with gynaecological cancer face numerous challenges to their sexuality. The importance of addressing sexuality concerns of people with cancer is emphasized by a growing body of literature in Western countries. Methods. This is a descriptive and correlational study. An inventory was adopted to explore Chinese nurses attitudes and practice related to sexuality care in nursing. Data were collected from December 2009 to February 2010. Results. A sample of 202 nurses working in gynaecological units in China was recruited. Study results revealed that the majority (77.7%) held the attitude that sexuality is too private an issue to discuss with patients. Only 34.2%make time to discuss sexual concerns with patients. Regression analysis revealed that nurse marital status and hospital type in which they were working influenced their practice in sexuality care. Nurses conservative attitudes towards sexuality, their prejudices about gynaecological cancer, the lack of availability of private environment, the lack of sexuality care training and the failure to include sexuality care in routine nursing care, were found to be factors that significantly influenced sexual care and nursing practice (adjusted R2 = 0.542, P < 0.001). Conclusions. The study findings contribute to the understanding of Chinese nurses attitudes and practice in addressing the sexuality concerns of people with gynaecological cancer. There is a need to increase Chinese nurses awareness of their roles and the importance of equipping themselves with relevant skills in sexuality care in nursing practice.

AB  - Background: Racial disparities in unintended pregnancy and contraceptive use in the United States are not mediated by access to family planning services alone. Rather, a history of medical mistrust underlies Black Americans' adoption of new medical technologies, inclusive of contraception. Efforts to develop hormonal male contraceptives need to incorporate Black Americans' experiences and perspectives so that new contraceptives enable their reproductive goals and promote gender equity.
   Study Design: Working with our community-based partner, Healthy African American Families in Los Angeles, California, we conducted six 60-minute focus group discussions with 39 Black men over age 18, in ongoing heterosexual relationships, to explore attitudes towards and willingness to use hormonal male contraceptives.
   Results: Just over one-third (35%) of respondents reported willingness to use or rely on hormonal male contraceptives. The majority held negative attitudes about hormonal male contraceptives, citing concerns about side effects and safety. Several respondents expressed mistrust of the medical community and medical research, noting that hormonal male contraceptives could be used against Black communities; several expressed unwillingness to trial hormonal male contraceptives without years of testing. However, all groups described scenarios where they would use them despite stated concerns.
   Conclusions: Black men's hypothetical willingness to use hormonal male contraceptives is limited by medical mistrust, which may be overcome by their concerns about the unreliability of current options or the contraceptive behaviors of female partners. Nevertheless, addressing Black Americans' history of medical mistreatment and exploitation will be essential for hormonal male contraceptives to positively contribute to Black men's reproductive options and agency.

AB  - Integrated early palliative care (EPC) improves quality of life and reduces psychological distress in adult patients with cancer and caregivers, but attitudes toward EPC have been poorly studied. We aimed to investigate attitudes toward EPC in a nationwide survey of patients with cancer and caregivers. From July to October 2016, we administered nationwide questionnaires examining attitudes toward EPC in patients with cancer (n = 1001) and their families (n = 1006) from 12 Korean hospitals. When an individual considered EPC unnecessary, the reasons were collected and analyzed. Factors associated with perception of EPC were examined. A majority of patients (84.5%) and caregivers (89.5%) had positive attitudes toward EPC. The most common reasons for deeming EPC unnecessary were that EPC may be an obstacle to cancer treatment (patients: 37%; caregivers: 23%; respectively) or that they were not sure if EPC is beneficial (patients: 21%; caregivers: 24%; respectively). Financial burden as a reason was more evident in caregivers (23%) than in patients (17%). Male gender, age <50, early stage, intensive care unit admission, and not believing that dying people should prepare to practice charity were associated with patients' negative attitudes. In caregivers, opposition to EPC was associated with not thinking death should be feared, not thinking people should be remembered, and lower educational level. Our findings showed that significant numbers of patients with advanced cancer and family caregivers showed positive attitudes toward EPC. However, more than 10% of participants did not consider EPC necessary. Physicians' communication with patients and caregivers and financial support could help overcome the barriers of EPC.

AB  - Objective: Breast cancer (BC) is an important disease for women. BC influences both patient's and relatives lives. Especially, husb:uals/boyfriends/lovers are the ones that are affected mostly. In this study, it was aimed to introduce knowledge and attitudes of men toward BC and their sources of information about BC.
   Materials and Methods: This descriptive study was conducted with men applied to a University Hospital in Istanbul (Turkey-2018). The ethics per- mission was obtained form The Clinical Research Ethics Committee. Data regarding socio-demographic characteristics with the knowledge and attitudes towards BC were collected with a questionnaire specific to the research. Statistical significance level was accepted as p<0.05.
   Results: In the study, 240 men (mean age: 36.2 +/- 10.6 years,min: 18.0, max: 63.0) were interviewed. Fifty four percent of men declared that they would nor marry someone with BC and/or someone who had mastectomy. Thirty four percent of participants thought that a woman with BC should conceal the disease. The mean BC knowledge score was 234.1 +/- 128.0 (median: 227.5, min: 0, max: 571.0) among the cocal which was 600.
   Conclusion: A significant proportion of men did not haw sufficient and accurate knowledge about BC. If the BC knowledge scores increase, there was an association with more positive attitudes. Negative attitudes of men related with BC of a woman may be an indicator of stigmatization. If it is aimed to increase support of men for women dealing with BC, it is recommended that BC awareness activities should be prepared to include men in order to increase their knowledge and to change their attitudes into a more positive way.

AB  - Racial and ethnic differences are well-documented social factors shaping sexual interactions. However, these racial/ethnic dynamics have been mostly overlooked in the context of sexual fluidity, specifically for bisexual individuals. Furthermore, there is limited literature on how sexual objectification based on skin color and ethnicity, factors well documented to influence individual's sexual partnering decision, might be different for male, female, and/or transgender partners of bisexual individuals. From 2009 to 2014, we conducted a mixed methods study examining how bisexual Latino men construct and participate in their sex markets. In the qualitative component of the study, we asked behaviorally bisexual Latino men (n = 148) how race/ethnicity, prejudice, stereotyping, and objectification intersected with their sexuality, specifically perceptions of their sexual experiences, decision making regarding sexual partners, and their reflection of their own race/ethnicity in their sexuality. We conducted a content analysis and identified three recurrent themes that are fully described in this article: (1) Bisexual Latino men objectify other men based on skin color, ethnicity, and race; (2) the race and ethnicity of women and transgender partners were not a dominant factor in sexual partnering decision making; and (3) sexual objectification based on skin color and ethnicity was a frequent, dominant experience throughout the sexual histories of our study participants. In summary, our findings suggest that bisexual Latino men participate in sex markets where race, ethnic, and nationality differences play a role in shaping men's desires for other men as sexual partners and they themselves are objects of desire.

AB  - Objective: Sexual and gender minority people of color (SGM-POC) experience intersectional forms of minority stress, including heterosexism within racial/ethnic minority communities, which can contribute to feelings of conflict between SGM and racial/ethnic identities. Internalized stigma may be a consequence of sexual orientation-based discrimination but has not been tested as a mechanism linking intersectional minority stress to identity conflict among SGM-POC. We hypothesized that the association between experiences of heterosexism in racial/ethnic minority communities and identity conflict would be mediated by internalized stigma among SGM assigned female at birth (SGM-AFAB). Method: Participants were 316 SGM-AFAB who identified as POC. Data were collected as a part of an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of young SGM-AFAB. We tested the longitudinal mediation using data from baseline, 6-month follow-up, and 1-year follow-up assessments. Results: Internalized stigma at 6-month follow-up partially mediated the association between experiences of heterosexism in racial/ethnic minority communities at baseline and identity conflict at 1-year follow-up. Conclusions: For SGM-POC, experiences of heterosexism within their racial/ethnic communities may lead to internalization of those negative attitudes. A consequence of internalizing heterosexist attitudes from one's racial/ethnic group could be a feeling that one's sexual orientation and racial/ethnic identities must remain separate, perhaps to maintain connection to one's racial/ ethnic community. Identifying internalized stigma as a mediating process is critical to better understand identity development for SGM-POC, and has important clinical implications for working with this population.

AB  - Two studies examined how managers' pay decisions for male and female employees are affected by the opportunity to provide social accounts and how managers think about the value of accounts for men versus women. I theorized that managers would treat social accounts as substitutes for pay for women but not for men, paradoxically leading managers who could behave more procedurally fairly to create gender-based distributive injustice. Study 1 confirms this hypothesis. Practicing managers who learned before making pay decisions that they could provide a social account-here, an explanation of circumstances justifying low raises-paid women less than men and less than women for whom they could not provide this account. Also as hypothesized, when an account was available, experienced managers paid women less than did inexperienced managers. In addition to pay decisions, participants' explicit beliefs about the value of accounts as substitutes for pay (Study I) and in motivating male and female employees (Study 2) were examined. When participants expected the account to make the employee feel that he or she had been treated with a high level of procedural fairness (Study 1), or the language of the account explicitly acknowledged and apologized for unfair treatment (Study 2), participants assumed that the account would be significantly more valuable for women than for men. This difference was greater for experienced participants than inexperienced ones. I discuss the implications of this "substitutability thesis" and these results for research on justice and gender as well as for achieving gender equity in the workplace.

AB  - The reintegration of former members of violent extremist groups is a pressing policy challenge. Governments and policymakers often have to change minds among reticent populations and shift perceived community norms in order to pave the way for peaceful reintegration. How can they do so on a mass scale? Previous research shows that messages from trusted authorities can be effective in creating attitude change and shifting perceptions of social norms. In this study, we test whether messages from religious leaders-trusted authorities in many communities worldwide-can change minds and shift norms around an issue related to conflict resolution: the reintegration of former members of violent extremist groups. Our study takes place in Maiduguri, Nigeria, the birthplace of the violent extremist group Boko Haram. Participants were randomly assigned to listen to either a placebo radio message or to a treatment message from a religious leader emphasizing the importance of forgiveness, announcing the leader's forgiveness of repentant fighters, and calling on followers to forgive. Participants were then asked about their attitudes, intended behaviors, and perceptions of social norms surrounding the reintegration of an ex-Boko Haram fighter. The religious leader message significantly increased support for reintegration and willingness to interact with the ex-fighter in social, political, and economic life (8 to 10 percentage points). It also shifted people's beliefs that others in their community were more supportive of reintegration (6 to 10 percentage points). Our findings suggest that trusted authorities such as religious leaders can be effective messengers for promoting peace.

AB  - Objective: We investigated user requirements for a smartphone application to coordinate layperson administration of naloxone during an opioid overdose.
   Materials and Methods: We conducted interviews and focus groups with 19 nonmedical opioid users and other community members in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which has one of the highest overdose rates in the country. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Results: We found high levels of trust and reliance within one's own social group, especially nonmedical opioid users and members of the neighborhood. Participants distrusted outsiders, including professional responders, whom they perceived as uncaring and prejudiced. Participants expressed some concern over malicious use of a location-based application, such as theft when a victim is unconscious, but overall felt the benefits could outweigh the risks. Participants also trusted community-based organizations providing services such as bystander training and naloxone distribution, and felt that a smartphone application should be integrated into these services.
   Discussion: Individuals affected by opioid use and overdose reacted positively to the concept for a smartphone application, which they perceived as a useful tool that could help combat the high rate of opioid overdose fatalities in their neighborhood. A sense of unity with others who have shared their experiences could be leveraged to connect willing bystanders with victims of overdose, but risk must be mitigated for layperson responders.
   Conclusion: Based on participant experiences with overdoses, trust-based considerations for the design of smartphone applications to facilitate layperson response will be critical for their adoption and use in real overdose situations.

AB  - This study advances and tests the notion that the phenomenon of guilt by association- whereby innocent organizations are penalized due to their similarity to offending organizations- is shaped by two distinct forms of generalization. We analyze how and why evaluators' interpretative process following instances of corporate misconduct will likely include not only inductive generalization (rooted in similarity judgments and prototype-based categorization) but also deductive generalizing (rooted in evaluators' theories and causal-based categorization). We highlight the role and relevance of this neglected distinction by extending guilt-by-association predictions to include two unique predictions based on deductive generalization. First, we posit a recipient effect: if an innocent organization falls under a negative stereotype that causally links the innocent firm with corporate misconduct, then that innocent firm will suffer a greater negative spillover effect, irrespective of its similarity to the offending firm. Second, we also posit a transmission effect: if the offending firm falls under the same negative stereotype, then the negative spillover effect to other similar firms will be lessened. We also analyze how media discourse can foster negative stereotypes, and thus amplify these two effects. We find support for our hypotheses in analyses of stock market reactions to corporate misconduct for all U.S. and international firms using reverse mergers to gain publicly traded status in the United States. We discuss the implications of our theoretical perspective and empirical findings for research on corporate misconduct, guilt by association, and stock market prejudice.

KW  - Hutter
AB  - This Opinion from the European Copyright Society (ECS) discusses the legal boundaries of the use of sound sampling under copyright law in the context of the currently pending CJEU case 476/17 (Pelham GmbH v. Hutter). The ECS recommends a careful interpretation of the scope of the phonogram producer's right. In the absence of any threshold or condition for protection, this right will extend to cover minimal parts of phonograms and will exceed the protection offered to works in copyright law. Sampling should only be covered by the phonogram producer's rights where it significantly prejudices the economic interests of the right holder. The ECS also argues that the quotation exception in Art. 5(3)(d) InfoSoc Directive should apply to sound sampling, even where it is not evident to the listener that another person's work or subject matter is being used in the form of a sound sample. However, such use requires that the source, including the author's name, should be given in the description of the work.

AB  - Background and Objectives: While older adults' social participation has attracted sustained attention, the realities faced by seniors with impairments in this area are still understudied. Social representations are formed from socially constructed opinions regarding a given object and have four functions (knowledge, identity, orientation, justification). The purpose of this article is to document the social representations that exist within seniors' organizations regarding participation by older people with impairments.
   Research Design and Methods: In this mixed-methods study, an exploratory sequential design was applied. First, a qualitative phase involved meetings with five focus groups to explore how participants would manage difficult situations in which the inclusion of an older person with impairments must be addressed. Second, a quantitative phase consisted of a questionnaire administered to 86 respondents to examine the components of social representations about the participation of older people with impairments.
   Results: Results show that, although research participants acknowledge that all seniors have the right to participate, this right confronts a collective identity infused with aging model that demands a youthful, "un-disabled" appearance and activities. In terms of the orientation function, making participation a reality is seen as relying on the efforts of people with impairments, but when there is a failure of inclusiveness, the reasons offered to justify it concern the resources available, rather than possible prejudices.
   Discussion and Implications: Interpretation of the results leads to recommendations for both implementing an inclusion philosophy and practices in seniors' organizations and revisiting the view of impairment in old age as otherness.

AB  - Active suspension control strategies are a top priority in active suspension system. The current research on active suspension control strategies is mostly focused on two-axle vehicles, and there is less research investigating multi-axle vehicles. Additionally, their effective implementation is dependent on accurate mathematical models, and most of them adopt force feedback control, which is vulnerable to external interference. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an active suspension control strategy based on Inertial Measurement Unit. The multi-axle emergency rescue vehicle is made to be equivalent to a 3-degrees-of-freedom parallel mechanism by using the method of grouping and interconnecting the suspension units of the whole vehicle. The attitude change of the vehicle body was transformed into the servo actuator's displacement by solving the inverse solution of the parallel mechanism position and the action of the servo actuator was driven in reverse according to the displacement obtained. In this way, the vehicle body attitude can be compensated, and the ride comfort and the handling stability of the vehicle can be improved. To verify the effectiveness of the control strategy proposed, the three-axle six vehicle was taken as the research object, the position inverse solution of its equivalent 3-degrees-of-freedom parallel mechanism was deduced, and a high-pass filter was designed. The three-axle vehicle experiment platform integrating active suspension and hydro-pneumatic suspension was built, and the gravel road and slope road experiments were carried out and the results compared with those obtained with hydro-pneumatic suspension. The experiment results showed that, compared with hydro-pneumatic suspension, the active suspension control strategy based on Inertial Measurement Unit proposed in this paper can not only stabilize the body attitude, but also effectively suppress body vibration, improving the ride comfort and handling stability of the vehicle significantly.

AB  - Objective. Most studies done with Hispanics illustrate their preference for self-management practices; therefore, examining the factors driving patients to seek medical care for pain management will help elucidate what patients want and need from their doctors for pain management. The aim of the present study was to obtain patients' perspectives and enhance our understanding of the cultural beliefs influencing pain management decisions of foreign-born Spanish-speaking Hispanics with low acculturation.
   Methods. Twenty-four individuals (17 females and 7 males) with self-reported chronic pain completed the study. Participants attended a focus group and shared about pain management practices and their experiences with medical care for pain management. Descriptive data on pain and mood variables were collected to examine how this population compares with the norms reported in the pain literature for Hispanics.
   Results. Participants reported a preference for pain self-management and noninvasive medical treatments and expressed negative attitudes toward pain medications, although wanting the option of pain medications as a "last resort." Satisfaction with medical care for pain was highly influenced by the participants' expectations and preference for personal, warm, and friendly interactions.
   Conclusions. Our findings are consistent with previous reports on Hispanics' preference for self-care practices. Perhaps foreign-born Hispanics may rely on self-care practices and delay medical attention for pain management because of their unfamiliarity with the US health care system. Other potential explanations for a reliance on self-care for pain management involve patients having a limited understanding of or access to effective treatment options for chronic pain and negative experiences with US medical providers.

AB  - In order to study sexual violence internationally, it is helpful to understand similarities and differences in how sexual violence is conceptualised across countries. The current study examined prosecuting attorneys' judgments about which sexual tactics legally qualify as sexual violence in two countries. Attorneys from the U.S. (n = 28) and Colombia (n = 24) evaluated whether 36 tactics would qualify as a sexual offense in their jurisdiction. Although Colombian and U.S. attorneys agreed on the legality of many tactics, Colombian attorneys judged more behaviours as criminal, on average, than U.S. attorneys. Within-country variations suggested that differences were due not only to different legal statutes, but also to different interpretations of laws. Open-ended responses illustrated sources of ambiguity, including lack of clarity about how much coercion is required and which behaviours indicate nonconsent. This suggests that vagueness within legal definitions may allow attorney judgements to be influenced by stereotypes and prejudices. Practical Impact Statement: This study illustrates the vagueness of legal definitions of sexual violence in two countries-the United States and Colombia. This vagueness provides prosecuting attorneys with substantial power to interpret the law, and in this study, some attorney judgements of legality seemed to be influenced by stereotypes. Greater training for law students and attorneys about the realities of sexual violence may be helpful in undermining belief in rape myths that may inhibit attorneys from prosecuting certain sexual violence cases.

AB  - Organized activities represent a potentially important context for the development of adolescent sociopolitical values, but few studies have examined longitudinal associations between youths' sociopolitical values and activity involvement. Adolescents (N=299, Time 1 M-age=15.49, SD=.93, 62% female) reported on their organized activity involvement (volunteering, church, sports, arts/music, school and community clubs) and sociopolitical values (materialism, social dominance, authoritarianism, patriotism, spirituality) at baseline and one year later. Greater involvement in arts/music predicted lower spirituality and patriotism one year later and greater involvement in church predicted higher levels of spirituality and lower levels of social dominance one year later. Higher levels of materialism predicted less involvement in arts/music one year later and higher social dominance values predicted less involvement in volunteering one year later. Findings support the importance of organized activities in sociopolitical development, and suggest that sociopolitical values may guide decisions concerning future organized activity involvement.

AB  - Background: The increase in demand for blood products because of new surgical and medical procedures seeks more research to find new ways to recruit people to donate blood.
   Objective/Aim: To determine the level of people's knowledge about donating blood considering its relation with infectious and chronic diseases, drug abuse, unsafe sexual intercourse, menstruation and anaemia. In addition, their attitude towards blood donation regarding their previous behaviour and factors such as altruism, religion, family, fears and availability of blood donation centres has been evaluated.
   Methods: This study was conducted in Tehran, Iran in 2009 on 1000 respondents. Data were collected through questionnaires that comprised 37 questions considering demographic and background characteristics, level of knowledge and positive and negative attitudes towards blood donation. Finally, data were analysed using SPSS software.
   Results: Of 1000 in this study, 26% were donors, of whom 55% had donated blood more than once. The mean knowledge score of the participants was 8.6, which was associated with the subjects' gender and level of education (P = 0.031 and P < 0.001, respectively). Age, gender and level of education were significantly associated with one's attitude towards blood donation (P = 0.021, P < 0.001 and P = 0.003, respectively). Ninety-five percent of people have stated that their main motivation to donate blood was altruism.
   Conclusion: Altruism and being encouraged by others had the leading roles in peoples' positive attitude towards blood donation; whereas hard access to blood donation centres seemed to be the main inhibitory factor.

AB  - Background and Objectives: This study sought to explore the challenges and opportunities associated with supporting older homeless persons' relocations to long-term care (ITC) from the perspective of service providers. It aims to inform how to improve relocation processes for this vulnerable and growing subpopulation of older persons.
   Research Design and Methods: This cross-sectional qualitative study employed semistructured face-to-face interviews with service providers from two Health and Social Service Centres in Montreal, Quebec. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed in five stages.
   Results: A total of eight service providers reported on their experiences supporting over 40 relocations of older homeless persons (50+) in the last year. According to participants, older homeless persons' trajectories into LTC typically included a series of neglected medical issues followed by hospitalization and eventual relocation to LTC. Systemic barriers such as limited-time for proper planning, insufficient housing options for persons with minor functional limitations, disregard for preferred geographic location, multiple moves, and staff prejudices worked together to expedite premature relocation and challenge relocation processes.
   Discussion and Implications: Older homeless persons appear to be at heightened risk of premature and challenging relocation processes. Expanding housing stock for persons with functional limitations, strengthening intersectoral collaborations, providing education and training to staff, and ensuring flexibility around rules and regulations in receiving LTC homes would both improve access to aging in place for this marginalized group of older persons and ensure conditions are in place to support positive relocations to LTC for those who require it.

AB  - Background: Ukraine is experiencing one of the most volatile HIV epidemics globally, fueled primarily by people who inject drugs (PWIDs), and a parallel incarceration epidemic. Opioid substitution therapy (OST) is internationally recognized as one of the most effective forms of treatment for opioid dependence and is among the most effective HIV prevention strategies available, yet efforts to adopt it in Ukraine's Criminal Justice System (CJS) have been thwarted.
   Methods: To understand the reluctance of the Ukrainian CJS to adopt OST despite the overwhelming evidence pointing to its health benefits and improved criminal justice outcomes, we conducted the first survey of Ukrainian prison administrative, medical and custodial staff (N=243) attitudes towards addiction in general, OST, and people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in representative regions of Ukraine.
   Results: Results revealed that Ukrainian CJS workers' attitudes toward OST, PLWHA, and drug addiction were universally negative, but differed substantially along geographic and occupational lines. Whereas geographic and cultural proximity to the European Union drove positive attitudes in the west, in the southern region we observed an identifiability effect, as workers who worked directly with prisoners held the most positive attitudes. We also found that knowledge mediated the effect of drug intolerance on OST attitudes.
   Conclusion: In Ukraine, adoption of OST is more influenced by myths, biases and ideological prejudices than by existing scientific evidence. By elucidating existing attitudes among CJS personnel, this study will help to direct subsequent interventions to address the barriers to implementing evidence-based HIV prevention treatments.

AB  - Objective The aims of this cross-sectional, case-controlled, observational study were to examine attitudes toward menstruation in female patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and in a control group, and to explore the associations between attitudes toward menstruation and psychopathology, menstrual regularity during antipsychotic treatment, and menstrual distress symptoms.
   Methods Fifty-eight patients treated with anti-psychotic medications for at least the previous 6 months were placed in irregular (irregular menstrual cycle) (n = 31) and regular (regular menstrual cycle) (n = 27) groups. Sixty-two, age-matched, healthy female participants with regular menstrual cycles were enrolled as a control group. Psychopathology was assessed by psychiatrists using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The Menstrual Attitude Questionnaire (MAQ) was used to assess attitudes toward menstruation, and symptom checklists based on the Moos Menstruation Distress Questionnaire (MMDQ) were used to assess menstrual distress symptoms.
   Results Patients with psychotic disorders (both irregular and regular groups) had more negative attitudes toward menstruation than the control group. In the Schizophrenia group, there was no association between the severity of psychotic symptoms and their influence on attitudes toward menstruation. Moreover, regular menstrual cycles during antipsychotic treatment and fewer menstrual distress symptoms were the two main predictors for more positive attitudes toward menstruation in the patient group.
   Conclusion This is one of the first studies to explore the relationship between psychotic symptoms and attitudes toward menstruation. The findings provide more support for the assumption that attitudes toward menstruation are derived from a woman's perception of her bodily experience rather than a psychiatric disorder.

AB  - This current study qualitatively explored Chinese international students' coping strategies and social support resources in dealing with academic stressors. A consensual qualitative research (CQR) methodology was used on analyzing data gathered from semi-structured interviews. We identified an array of academic stressors and differentiated them according to the frequency labels (from general to rare). Academic competency, academic culture shock, academic resources, intercultural communication and pressure were found to be the main sources of Chinese students' academic stressors. In response, Chinese international students tended to utilize different coping strategies and social support resources to deal with academic stressors. Specifically, they generally employed problem-coping strategies to deal with competency-related challenges, but more preferred forbearance coping for other types of academic stressors. Furthermore, co-national peers emerged as the primary source of Chinese students' social support in academic learning, followed by support from multi-national students, university/tutors, and host students, respectively. The results obtained from the data implied that it was the heritage culture, instead of the host academic context, that strongly affected Chinese students' behavioral features in class and their responses to academic stressors. We provided practical implications for the host university, as well as interventions at the individual and institutional levels.

AB  - Social mobility is the movement of individuals, families and groups from one social position to another. Researchers indicate that people with psychiatric disabilities tend to come from lower socioeconomic status groups, and that the causal relationship between lower socioeconomic status and mental illness occurs through social mobility process. The purpose of this study was to examine the occupational social mobility process of a sample of self-identified psychiatrically disabled individuals who have been active members of the labor force for most of their adult lives. A total of 200 participants were recruited from the customers of a One-Stop Career Center in Gloucester County, New Jersey. The social mobility pattern of persons with psychiatric disabilities was compared to that of persons without psychiatric disabilities (n = 100 for each group). That is, the social selection and the social causation hypotheses were applied to the social mobility patterns of people with psychiatric disabilities. It was revealed that the social class distribution for fathers of people with psychiatric disabilities was not different from that of people without psychiatric disabilities and also there was no significant social mobility difference between the two groups. These findings do not support the social causation and the social selection hypotheses. Specifically, the findings demonstrate that occupational capabilities and skills of people with psychiatric disabilities have been stabilized and are similar to those of people without psychiatric disabilities. Furthermore, these results may dispute several biases and prejudices with regard to social mobility process of persons with psychiatric disabilities.

AB  - Public support for accepting refugees into Western countries may depend on their perceived cultural malleability the possibility of cultural change and adaptation. We hypothesize that members of host nations will perceive child refugees as having greater potential for cultural malleability than adults, which, in turn, will positively predict their support for acceptance of refugees into their country. In Study 1, participants reported greater perceived cultural malleability in response to images of child Syrian refugees (compared to those of adults with explicit markers of ethnic/religious identity, or groups of refugees), which positively predicted policy support. This pattern was replicated using American (Study 2a) and German (Study 2b) samples, and even when adult refugees were depicted without explicit markers of identity in the images. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings for research on essentialism and intergroup helping, and implications for fostering inclusive public opinion regarding immigration.

AB  - Online and social media platforms employ automated recognition methods to presume user preferences, sensitive attributes such as race, gender, sexual orientation, and opinions. These opaque methods can predict behaviors for marketing purposes and influence behavior for profit, serving attention economics but also reinforcing existing biases such as gender stereotyping. Although two international human rights treaties include explicit obligations relating to harmful and wrongful stereotyping, these stereotypes persist online and offline. By identifying how inferential analytics may reinforce gender stereotyping and affect marginalized communities, opportunities for addressing these concerns and thereby increasing privacy, diversity, and inclusion online can be explored. This is important because misgendering reinforces gender stereotypes, accentuates gender binarism, undermines privacy and autonomy, and may cause feelings of rejection, impacting people?s self-esteem, confidence, and authenticity. In turn, this may increase social stigmatization. This study brings into view concerns of discrimination and exacerbation of existing biases that online platforms continue to replicate and that literature starts to highlight. The implications of misgendering on Twitter are investigated to illustrate the impact of algorithmic bias on inadvertent privacy violations and reinforcement of social prejudices of gender through a multidisciplinary perspective, including legal, computer science, and critical feminist media-studies viewpoints. An online pilot survey was conducted to better understand how accurate Twitter?s gender inferences of its users? gender identities are. This served as a basis for exploring the implications of this social media practice.

AB  - Background. How people think and talk about weight is important because it can influence their behavior toward people who are overweight. One study has shown that physical therapists have negative attitudes toward people who are overweight. However, how this finding translates into clinical practice is not well understood. Investigating physical therapists' ways of thinking and speaking about overweight and obesity in the context of their work can provide insight into this underresearched area.
   Objectives. The purpose of this study was to investigate physical therapists' ways of talking about overweight individuals and discuss clinical implications.
   Design. An interpretive qualitative design was used.
   Methods. The research team used discourse analysis, a type of inductive qualitative methodology, to guide data collection and analysis. The data came from 6 focus groups of 4 to 6 physical therapists in Queensland, Australia, who discussed weight in a physical therapy environment. Participants (N=27) represented a variety of physical therapy subdisciplines.
   Results. Data analysis identified 4 main weight discourses (ways of thinking and speaking about weight). Participants described patients who are overweight as little affected by stigma and difficult to treat. Furthermore, participants portrayed weight as having simple causes and being important in physical therapy. Alternate weight discourses were less frequent in these data.
   Conclusions. The results indicated that some physical therapists' understandings of weight might lead to negative interactions with patients who are overweight. The findings suggest physical therapists require more nuanced understandings of: how patients who are overweight might feel in a physical therapy setting, the complexity of causes of weight, and possible benefits and disadvantages of introducing weight-management discussions with patients. Therefore, education should encourage complex understandings of working with patients of all sizes, including knowledge of weight stigma.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of depressive symptoms in peri- and post-menopausal Taiwanese women, and to investigate the relation between depressive symptoms and demographic variables, chronic disease status, health habits, stress management, menopausal symptoms, and attitudes toward menopause and aging.
   Study design: Crops-sectional study, using a purposive sample of 566 women between 45 and 60 years of age from a medical center and residential community in Southern Taiwan.
   Main outcome measures: Demographic and health habits questionnaire, Women's Health Initiative Symptom Scale, Attitudes Toward Menopause and Aging Scale, and Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D).
   Results: The prevalence of depressive symptoms (CES-D score >= 16) was 38.7% in peri- and post-menopausal Taiwanese women. Bivariate correlations and analyses of variance indicated that higher CES-D scores were related to lower family income, younger age, smoking for a greater number of years, consuming more alcohol, having multiple chronic diseases, not exercising regularly, consulting with a specialist for stress management, having more severe menopausal symptoms, and more negative attitudes toward menopause and aging. A stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that the key predictors, accounting for 33.7% of the variance, were menopausal symptoms, attitudes toward menopause and aging, family income, and chronic disease status.
   Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of considering psychosocial factors, life style, and chronic disease management in providing health guidance for peri- and post-menopausal women to enhance their quality of life and reduce the risk of depressive symptoms.

AB  - Introduction: The stigma of mental illness and the ensuing social exclusion are due to the lack of knowledge on the causality of mental illness.
   Aim: The purpose of this study was to record the stigmatic attitudes of health professionals towards depression, patients suffering from it and the available therapeutic approaches.
   Material and Methods: The sample of the study included 609 health professionals working in the General Hospital of Corinth. The collection of the empirical material was performed using an anonymous questionnaire. The statistical analysis was performed with the statistical program SPSS 17.0.
   Results: Although the health professionals showed more optimistic attitudes towards the abilities of the mentally ill, they seem to maintain stereotypes, proving that stigmatization of the mentally ill and prejudice around mental illness continue to exist. Participants identified psychosocial and psychotherapeutic interventions as the most effective forms of therapy, such as supportive social destination (74.4%), healthy eating and physical activity (67.9%), psychoanalysis (60.6%), relaxation techniques (60.5%) and counselling (53.2%), recording ambivalent attitudes towards psychiatric medicines, questioning their effectiveness. The economic crisis has had a direct impact on health professionals as well burdened their psyche (78.3%) and created problems in everyday work (86.7%).
   Conclusion: Health professionals must be protagonists, free from the stigma attached to mental illness as only in this way will they be able to transmit optimism and feelings of acceptance.

AB  - Racial/ethnic minorities are underrepresented in current biobanking programs. The current study utilized community-based participatory research to identify motivating factors and barriers that affect older African Americans' willingness to donate biospecimens. The standardized phone survey was administered to 78 African Americans who are 55 years old or older and live in the metropolitan Detroit area to assess their overall willingness to donate biospecimens and what factors were associated with it. The majority of the participants were willing to donate biospecimens, along with their personal information, for medical research and indicated that they did donate biospecimens when they were asked. However, African Americans were rarely asked to participate in biobanking programs. Furthermore, African Americans were not as concerned with research exploitation or as mistrusting of medical researchers as previously thought by the medical researchers. Even if African Americans were concerned over potential research exploitation or mistrust of medical researchers, these concerns or mistrust did not translate into an actual unwillingness to participate in biobanking programs. Rather, transparency in medical research and biobanking programs was more important when predicting African Americans' willingness to donate biospecimens for medical research. The findings suggest that underrepresentation of African Americans in current biobanking programs may not be due to their willingness/unwillingness to participate in such programs but rather due to a failure of medical researchers to approach them. Additionally, researchers and clinicians should focus on increasing the transparency of medical research and biobanking programs rather than changing African Americans' potential negative attitudes toward them.

AB  - In 1942, a library official in Portsmouth, UK appealed to the city's inhabitants to 'read for victory', believing that they had a duty to use their reading time productively as part of their wartime activities. This article argues that long-standing desires among the country's political and civic elites to encourage the nation's readers to spend their leisure time prudently intensified during the Second World War. The public library service was utilised by civic leaders, library officials and publishing trade personnel to aid the country's war effort. The article argues that negative attitudes regarding mass reading tastes remained largely static, despite recognition that the conflict drew people to the written word for relaxation and escapism. Using the naval city of Portsmouth as a case study, this article charts the activities of the city's public library authorities and the borrowing habits of its readers to reveal that while many people borrowed books in order to distract themselves from the conflict, the city's strategic importance ensured that many citizens also read in order to facilitate their preparedness for war service, whether that be on the home front or overseas. The article argues that while, in common with national trends, many of Portsmouth's citizens used libraries to obtain books to help distract them from the war, many remained eager to make use of the service for educational purposes, unlike the majority of the nation's library users, whose interest in this aspect of library provision rapidly waned as the war progressed. The article concludes that the public library service was viewed as a central plank in the war effort and that library officials worked continuously to ensure that it remained so.

AB  - Background
   HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) has been found to be efficacious in preventing HIV acquisition among seronegative individuals in a variety of risk groups, including men who have sex with men and people who inject drugs. To date, however, it remains unclear how socio-cultural norms (e.g., attitudes towards HIV; social understandings regarding HIV risk practices) may influence the scalability of future PrEP interventions. The objective of this study is to assess how socio-cultural norms may influence the implementation and scalability of future HIV PrEP interventions in Vancouver, Canada.
   Methods
   We conducted 50 interviews with young men (ages 18-24) with a variety of HIV risk behavioural profiles (e.g., young men who inject drugs; MSM). Interviews focused on participants' experiences and perceptions with various HIV interventions and policies, including PrEP.
   Results
   While awareness of PrEP was generally low, perceptions about the potential personal and public health gains associated with PrEP were interconnected with expressions of complex and sometimes conflicting social norms. Some accounts characterized PrEP as a convenient form of reliable protection against HIV, likening it to the female birth control pill. Other accounts cast PrEP as a means to facilitate 'socially unacceptable' behaviour (e.g., promiscuity). Stigmatizing rhetoric was used to position PrEP as a tool that could promote some groups' proclivities to take 'risks'.
   Conclusion
   Stigma regarding 'risky' behaviour and PrEP should not be underestimated as a serious implementation challenge. Pre-implementation strategies that concomitantly aim to improve knowledge about PrEP, while addressing associated social prejudices, may be key to effective implementation and scale-up.

AB  - An increasing number of elderly people are living in aged care facilities in Japan, a country that is facing a globally unprecedented challenge of population aging. Due to the declining health status and mobility limitations of older adults, community gardens (CGs) are crucial for giving residents in aged care facilities contact with nature. However, there is a lack of research on the characteristics and perceptions of CGs in aged care facilities in Japan and how these factors can influence the use of and attitude toward CGs. In this study, a questionnaire was developed and sent to the managers of elderly housing with care services (EHCS) across the Tokyo metropolitan area (TMA) in Japan in 2020. The aim of the study was to examine the effects of the characteristics and per-ceptions of CGs on the frequency of gardening activities, leisure activities, and attitudes toward gardening ac-tivities. Data were collected from 44 EHCS managers and were analyzed by using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results indicated that the use of gardens (frequency of gardening activities, absence of leisure activities) was positively associated with the garden area, the number of garden equipment types, the presence of barrier-free design elements, interaction, community aesthetics, and a sufficient number of participants. Compared to a low frequency of gardening activities, a high frequency of gardening activities was also associated with a decreased building age and improved education about agriculture. The managers with negative attitudes had gardens managed only by residents, and they showed more concern about the reduced attractiveness of CGs and insufficient members. The study provides significant lessons for policy makers and facility managers to focus on the development of strategies that will establish and strengthen the cooperation between aged care facilities and community agencies and organizations to encourage community members to engage in CGs.

AB  - Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the USA with some strains increasing the risk of certain cancers. The HPV vaccine, introduced in 2006, has reduced the infection rate, although racial/ethnic disparities in vaccination exist. Asian college students are among those with the lowest vaccination rates, however there has been little exploration as to why. The purposes of this study were to assess (a) knowledge and attitudes regarding HPV and its vaccine, (b) HPV vaccination practices, and (c) factors associated with HPV-related knowledge and attitudes, and vaccination among Chinese college students in the USA. This cross-sectional quantitative survey collected data face-to-face and online from 449 participants. The mean scores for HPV knowledge and attitudes were 40.87 and 2.36 indicating a low-to-moderate level of knowledge but a moderately positive attitude regrading HPV transmission and vaccination. Only half (50.8%) knew that the vaccination could be received after the age of 18 years. Only 38.3% reported having receiving at least one dose of the vaccine, with 92.4% receiving their first HPV vaccines in the USA. Multiple logistic regression showed that men and non-health sciences majors had lower knowledge about HPV. Older students, those without a primary care provider, and those who completed the survey in English had more negative attitudes about the HPV and vaccine. Participants who were younger, female, had a higher level of knowledge, had more positive attitudes, and completed the survey online were associated with better vaccination status. Findings from this study provide insight into Chinese college students' knowledge and attitudes about HPV and HPV vaccination and may be used to develop culturally sensitive programs that address the risk of HPV and the benefits of HPV vaccine.

AB  - Background: Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are prevalent among people who inject heroin (PWIH). Delays in seeking health care lead to increased costs and potential mortality, yet the barriers to accessing care among PWIHs are poorly understood.
   Methods: We administered a quantitative survey (N = 145) and conducted qualitative interviews (N = 12) with PWIH seeking syringe exchange services in two U.S. cities.
   Results: 66% of participants had experienced at least one SSTI. 38% reported waiting two weeks or more to seek care, and 57% reported leaving the hospital against medical advice. 54% reported undergoing a drainage procedure performed by a non-medical professional, and 32% reported taking antibiotics that were not prescribed to them. Two of the most common reasons for these behaviors were fear of withdrawal symptoms and inadequate pain control, and these reasons emerged as prominent themes in the qualitative findings. These issues are often predicated on previous negative experiences and exacerbated by stigma and an asymmetrical power dynamic with providers, resulting in perceived barriers to seeking and completing care for SSTIs.
   Conclusions: For PWIH, unaddressed pain and withdrawal symptoms contribute to profoundly negative health care experiences, which then generate motivation for delaying care SSTI seeking and for discharge against medical advice. Health care providers and hospitals should develop policies to improve pain control, manage opioid withdrawal, minimize prejudice and stigma, and optimize communication with PWIH. These barriers should also be addressed by providing medical care in accessible and acceptable venues, such as safe injection facilities, street outreach, and other harm reduction venues.

AB  - Background Prior work has suggested that first responders have mixed feelings about harm reduction strategies used to fight the opioid epidemic, such as the use of naloxone to reverse opioid overdose. Researchers have also noted that provider-based stigma of people who use opioids (PWUO) may influence perceptions of appropriate interventions for opioid use disorder (OUD). This study examined first responders' perceptions of naloxone and the relationship between stigma of OUD and perceptions of naloxone. Methods A web-based survey assessing perceptions of PWUO and naloxone was administered to 282 police officers and students enrolled in EMT and paramedic training courses located in the Northeastern United States. Bivariate and multivariable analyses assessed the relationship between variants of stigma (e.g., perceived dangerousness, blame, social distance, and fatalism) and self-reported perceptions of naloxone. Results Participants, in the aggregate, held slightly negative attitudes toward the use of naloxone. Findings from multivariable modeling suggest that stigma of OUD, living in a rural area, and prior experience administering naloxone, were significantly and inversely related to support for the use of naloxone. Support for the disease model of addiction and associating drug use with low socioeconomic status were positively related to support for the use of naloxone. Conclusion Efforts to alleviate perceptions of PWUO as dangerous, blameworthy, or incapable of recovery may increase first responders' support for naloxone. To this end, first responder training programs should include instruction on the disease model of addiction, and more broadly, attempt to foster familiarity between PWUO and the professionals who serve them.

AB  - Objective: There is a need to adapt pathways to care to promote access to mental health services for Indigenous people in Australia. This study explored Indigenous community and service provider perspectives of well-being and ways to promote access to care for Indigenous people at risk of depressive illness.
   Design: A participatory action research framework was used to inform the development of an agreed early intervention pathway; thematic analysis
   Setting: 2 remote communities in the Northern Territory.
   Participants: Using snowball and purposive sampling, 27 service providers and community members with knowledge of the local context and the diverse needs of those at risk of depression were interviewed. 30% of participants were Indigenous. The proposed pathway to care was adapted in response to participant feedback.
   Results: The study found that Indigenous mental health and well-being is perceived as multifaceted and strongly linked to cultural identity. It also confirms that there is broad support for promotion of a clear pathway to early intervention. Key identified components of this pathway were the health centre, visiting and community-based services, and local community resources including elders, cultural activities and families. Enablers to early intervention were reported. Significant barriers to the detection and treatment of those at risk of depression were identified, including insufficient resources, negative attitudes and stigma, and limited awareness of support options.
   Conclusions: Successful early intervention for wellbeing concerns requires improved understanding of Indigenous well-being perspectives and a systematic change in service delivery that promotes integration, flexibility and collaboration between services and the community, and recognises the importance of social determinants in health promotion and the healing process. Such changes require policy support, targeted training and education, and ongoing promotion.

AB  - Access to Caesarean section (C-section) remains inadequate for some groups of women while others have worryingly high rates. Understanding differential receipt demands exploration of the socio-cultural, and political economic, characteristics of the health systems that produce them. This extensive institutional ethnography investigated under- and over-receipt of C-section in two rural districts in Pakistan - Jhelum and Layyah. Data were collected between November and July 2013 using semi-structured interviews from a randomly selected sample of 11 physicians, 38 community midwives, 18 Lady Health Visitors and nurses and 15 Traditional Birth Attendants. In addition, 78 mothers, 35 husbands and 23 older women were interviewed. The understandings of birth by C-section held by women and their family members were heavily shaped by gendered constructions of womanhood, patient-provider power differentials and financial constraints. They considered C-section an expensive and risky procedure, which often lacked medical justification, and was instead driven by profit motive. Physicians saw C-section as symbolizing obstetric skill and status and a source of legitimate income. Physician views and practices were also shaped by the wider health care system characterized by private practice, competition between providers and a lack of regulation and supervision. These multi-layered factors have resulted in both unnecessary intervention, and missed opportunities for appropriate C-sections. The data indicate a need for synergistic action at patient, provider and system levels. Recommendations include: improving physician communication with patients and family so that the need for C-section is better understood as a life-saving procedure, challenging negative attitudes and promoting informed decision-making by mothers and their families, holding physicians accountable for their practice and introducing price caps and regulations to limit financial incentives associated with C-sections. The current push for privatization of health care in low-income countries also needs scrutiny given its potential to encourage unnecessary intervention.

AB  - Purpose: To determine how people attending outreach eye care clinics in Papua New Guinea (PNG) perceive eye health and eye health services.Methods: An interview-based questionnaire was administrated to a convenience sample of 614 adult participants across four provinces and perceptions of eye health and eye health services were recorded. Presenting and near visual acuity were measured and cause of visual impairment (VI) determined.Results: In this sample, 113/614 participants (18.4%) presented with distance VI, 16 (2.6%) with distance blindness, and 221 (47.6%) with near VI. Older participants and those with near VI were more likely to indicate that it is hard to have an eye examination due to travel time, lack of transport and transport costs. Female participants and those from underserved areas were more likely to report shame and fear of jealousy from others when asked about their attitudes towards spectacles. Participants reporting that they were willing to pay higher amounts for testing and spectacles/treatment also reported higher education levels, higher household incomes and were more likely to be male. A quarter of participants (25.9%) indicated that they did not like having an eye examination because their reading and writing was poor.Conclusions: People attending outreach eye care clinics in PNG reported finding it difficult to attend eye health services due to transport difficulties and anticipated high costs. Negative attitudes towards spectacles were also prevalent, and negative perceptions appeared more frequently among older participants and those with less education.

Recently, people started seeking relaxing treatment through technology, which enhanced and expanded mental health care, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the use of mental health forums, websites, and applications has increased by 95%. However, these solutions still have many limits, as existing mental health technologies are not meant for everyone. In this work, an up-to-date literature review on state-of-the-art of mental health and healthcare solutions is provided. Then, we focus on Arab-speaking patients and propose an intelligent tool for mental health intent recognition. The proposed system uses the concepts of intent recognition to make mental health diagnoses based on a bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model and the International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Experiments are conducted using a dataset collected at the Military Hospital of Tunis in Tunisia. Results show excellent performance of the proposed system (the accuracy is over 92%, the precision, recall, and F1 scores are over 94%) in mental health patient diagnosis for five aspects (depression, suicidality, panic disorder, social phobia, and adjustment disorder). In addition, the tool was tested and evaluated by medical staff at the Military Hospital of Tunis, who found it very interesting to help decision-making and prioritizing patient appointment scheduling, especially with a high number of treated patients every day.

AB  - Background: Awareness about HIV/AIDS in future healthcare professionals is necessary to control growing epidemics of the above diseases. Objective: To evaluate and compare the knowledge, attitude and risk perceptions towards HIV/AIDS between the final year pharmacy and medical students at University Sains Malaysia.
   Materials and Method: In a cross sectional study, validated questionnaires were served to (130) pharmacy and (160) medical students in their final year of study. The data were analyzed to find differences at a p-value <0.05.
   Results: About 83% pharmacy and 65% medical students responded in this study. Though 36.1% pharmacy students showed confidence on their professional education, lesser number (9.2%) of pharmacy students' demonstrated willingness to assist HIV patients. The majority (58.1%) of medical students were doubtful regarding their competency, 55.2% were wiling to assist, while 50.5% were confident on their professional education. About 72% of medical students feared of acquiring HIV in professional life compared 29.6% (p=0.000) pharmacy students. Student groups were having lower awareness levels about PEP (post exposure prophylaxis), 18.5% by pharmacy and 48.6% by medical students (p=0.000). About 40% of both groups demonstrated lack of unawareness for the use of antivirals to treat HIV/AIDS. Pharmacy students showed lesser awareness about opportunistic infections (18.5%). Low agreement on competency to treat and counsel HIV/AIDS patients were reflected, 12.9% and 29.6% for pharmacy and medical students, respectively. The confidence on the education provided was lower in pharmacy (36.1%) and medical students (49.1%).
   Conclusion: Significant misconceptions, negative attitudes and risk perceptions were indicated by the pharmacy and medical students and should be addressed with educational and practical programs.

AB  - Purpose: A small fraction of people with opioid use disorder (OUD) receives appropriate care. Public opinion about addiction contributes to the availability and accessibility of effective treat-ment services. Little is known about such attitudes toward OUD among young adults, a population at heightened risk for OUD onset. The current study examined endorsement of social stigma, discrimination, and policy attitudes about OUD and hypothesized correlates of such attitudes (familiarity with OUD, criminal justice involvement, respondent demographic characteristics).
   Methods: A national sample of 190 young adults (weighted n = 408; 69% female, 42% White, non-Hispanic) aged 19-29 years completed web and telephone surveys covering opioid social stigma, discrimination, policy attitudes, personal experience with opioids, and criminal justice, and participant characteristics (age, sex, race, education, employment, income). Linear regressions were performed to examine associations between respondent characteristics and attitudes.
   Results: Young adults, on average, endorsed moderate levels of stigma and discrimination toward people with OUD and support for treatment-oriented policies. Stigma was positively associated with discrimination and negatively associated with support for policies favorable to people with OUD. Regression results revealed that more negative attitudes toward OUD were endorsed as a function of older age and less personal experience or familiarity with OUD.
   Conclusions: Heterogeneity in young adults' attitudes about OUD may be explained, in part, by personal characteristics and familiarity with OUD. Adolescence may be an opportune develop-mental period to prevent or reduce public stigma related to OUD and MOUD and increase public attitudes in support of expanded access to effective OUD treatments.

AB  - Traditionally, conceptual models of racial stressors (including racial microaggressions) have characterized the reactive experiences of African Americans, particularly identifying how African Americans cognitively, emotionally, and behaviorally respond to racial stress. The current study extends beyond the reactive coping experience and identifies nuances in the anticipatory and preparatory coping processes associated with racial microaggressions. Methods: 58 African American college students participated in a stress induction condition that exposed them to racial microinsults and prompted anticipatory concerns of further exposure to racial stress while completing a task with a racially insensitive peer. Following exposure to the stress induction condition, participants completed self-report questionnaires about their anticipatory thoughts, current affect, and proactive coping behaviors. Results: Threat-oriented thinking and negative affect were experienced in anticipation of racial discrimination; however, the endorsement of challenge-oriented thinking and positive affect were better predictors of how the current sample planned to use proactive coping behaviors to manage the anticipated racial stress. Implications: The current findings expand the racial stress coping narrative by capturing how the expression of optimism, perceived control, self-confidence, goal attainability, and positive emotion in anticipation of racial stress increases one's intention to implement coping strategies to minimize the impact of racial stress on task completion. Such findings provide cognitive and emotional targets for assessment when attempting to understand how African Americans are preparing themselves to manage anticipated racial stressors.

AB  - There is a growing body of evidence that suggests a positive role for religious involvement in physical and mental health. Studies have shown that attitudes of physicians toward religion affect their relationship with patients and their medical decisions, and in this way may ultimately affect treatment outcomes. Attitudes of nurses toward religion could also influence whether or not they address patients' unmet spiritual needs. To assess attitudes of physicians and nurses toward religion and how these attitudes vary by education level and demographic characteristics, a total of 800 physicians, medical students, and nurses from some of the largest hospitals in Tehran, Iran, were approached, of whom 720 completed questionnaires (148 nurses, 572 medical students and physicians). The survey questionnaire included the Duke University Religion Index (DUREL), Hoge Intrinsic Religiosity Scale, a brief measure of Negative Religious Coping (NRCOPE), and the brief Trust/Mistrust in God Scale. Religious attitudes and practices were compared between physicians (medical students and physicians) and nurses. Regression analysis revealed that except for intrinsic religiosity, physicians were not less religious than nurses on any other dimension of religiosity. Training level (year of training) was a predictor of religiosity, with those having less training being the most religious. The findings suggest that there are few religious differences between nurses and physicians in Iran. However, religiosity may become less as the training level increases. Lack of emphasis in training on the important role that religion plays in health care may result in a decrease in religious involvement and the development of negative attitudes toward religion over time (displaced by a focus on the technological aspects of health care).

AB  - Background. The concurrent TB and HIV epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa place all healthcare workers (HCWs) at increased risk of exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
   Aim. This study explores personal experiences, attitudes and perceptions of medical doctors following treatment for TB within the healthcare system.
   Method. Sixty-two medical doctors who were diagnosed with and treated for TB during 2007 - 2009 agreed to participate and complete a semi-structured questionnaire.
   Results. The response rate was 64.5% (N=40). The mean age of participants was 33.7 years (standard deviation +/- 10.6). A correct diagnosis of TB was made within 7 days of clinical presentation in 20% of participants, and was delayed beyond 3 weeks in 52.5%. Non-routine special investigations and procedures were performed in 26 participants. Complications following invasive procedures were reported by 8 participants. Multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) was diagnosed in 4 participants. Nineteen considered defaulting on their treatment because of drug side-effects. The majority (n=36) expressed concerns regarding lack of infection control at the workplace, delays in TB diagnosis and negative attitudes of senior medical colleagues and administrators. Ninety per cent of participants indicated that their personal illness experiences had positively changed their professional approach to patients in their current practice.
   Conclusion. The inappropriate delays in diagnosis in a large number of participants, coupled with a number of negative personal perceptions towards their treatment, are cause for concern. The results further amplify the need for improved educational and awareness programmes among all healthcare personnel (including hospital administrators), adherence to national health guidelines, effective infection control measures, pre- and post-employment screening in all HCWs> and changes in attitudes on the part of senior medical colleagues and administrators.

AB  - Mental health nursing is not regarded favourably by most Bachelor of Nursing (BN) students as a desirable career option. However, little is known about what attracts those students who do become interested. The primary aim of the current study was to explore BN students' reasons for choosing to undertake the major in mental health nursing and the degree to which completing the subject: "Recovery for mental health nursing practice", confirmed that interest or otherwise. A secondary aim was to examine their perceptions about the attitudes of others to their expressed interest in mental health nursing. A qualitative exploratory study was undertaken with undergraduate nursing students (BN) (n = 12) enrolled in a major stream in mental health nursing. In-depth individual interviews were conducted primarily by telephone. Data were analysed using Colaizzi's steps to explicate the main themes. Two main themes emerged: Swimming against the tide - that's not real nursing, captures participants' experience of the negative attitudes of others to their interest in mental health nursing; and, creating and confirming an interest in mental health nursing, where participants discuss how their interest emerged and how it had been enhanced after completing the subject: Recovery for Mental Health Nursing Practice. Mental health nursing continues to be a stigmatised and undervalued profession both within nursing and the general public. Despite this, participants of this research were attracted to the specialty, and their interest was generally strengthened after completing the Recovery subject. Further research is required to examine the impact of being taught by an academic with lived experience on interest in mental health nursing as a career. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigate the relationship between stereotypes of immigrants and assessments of the impact of immigration on U.S. society. Our analysis exploits a split-ballot survey of registered voters in Ohio, who were asked to evaluate both the characteristics of one of four randomly assigned immigrant groups and perceived impacts of immigration. We find that associations between impact assessments and stereotypes of Middle Eastern, Asian, and European immigrants are weak and fully attenuated by control covariates. By contrast, this relationship for Latin American immigrants is strong and robust to controls, particularly in the areas of unemployment, schools, and crime. Our findings suggest that public views of the impacts of immigration are strongly connected to beliefs about the traits of Latin American immigrants in particular.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the factors explaining changes in the generic quality of life among patients with Meniere's disorder (MD) and to evaluate the EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) quality-of-life measures. A questionnaire focusing on symptoms and disabilities caused by MD was collected from 726 individuals. General health-related quality of life (EQ-5D) was evaluated using the time trade-off (TTO) and visual-analogue scale (VAS). Personal traits were measured with the sense of coherence. The TTO-VAS score difference was modeled with activity limitations, participation restrictions, attitudes, and symptoms. For TTO as the outcome measure, one symptom-based, three attitude-based, one activity limitation, and one participation restriction item explained 43% of the variability. For VAS, six attitude-based, one symptom-based, three activity limitations, and one participation restriction item explained 43% of the variability of the data. The correlation between TTO and VAS (r=0.515, P < 0.001) explained only 27% of the variance. The difference between TTO and VAS was reflected in attitudes towards the illness. The model explained 10% of the variability in the VAS and TTO difference. There was a disease duration effect in the TTO-VAS difference. In conclusion, a symptom-based model combined with disabilities provided a good description of general quality of life in MD. The TTO-based and VAS-based evaluation explained somewhat different aspects of MD. The difference between TTO and VAS could be described as an attitude toward the ailment. Evaluation of disabilities and the difference in TTO and VAS can be used to guide the rehabilitation to promote attitude change.

AB  - Objectives: In recent years, BRAF(v600E) mutation has emerged as a promising prognostic marker for risk stratification of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). However, routine use of this marker has been questioned. In some parts of the world, particularly in Korea, the incidence of BRAF(v600E) mutation is too high to have true prognostic value. The relatively low number of tumors without BRAF(v600E) mutation would prejudice the efficient use of this marker in the Korean population.
   Methods: The study involved 107 patients with histologically confirmed conventional PTC after surgical management for thyroid cancer from April 2010 to December 2010. BRAF(v600E) mutation analysis was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplification of DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tumor specimens, and the relationship between BRAF(v600E) mutation and various prognostic factors was investigated.
   Results: BRAF(v600E) mutation was found to be present in 85 (79.4%) of 107 patients with conventional PTC. Analysis of the clinical characteristics as function of the presence or absence of BRAF(v600E) mutation revealed no differences between the BRAF(v600E)-positive and BRAF(v600E)-negative patients. Moreover, BRAF(v600E) mutation was not correlated with any of the prognostic factors including age >= 45 years, male gender, tumor size >= 1 cm, multifocality, extra-thyroidal extension, concurrent Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and lymph node metastasis neither in the univariate nor in the multivariate analysis.
   Conclusions: BRAF(v600E) mutation does not significantly reflect tumor aggressiveness in Korean patients with conventional PTC. We consider that BRAF(v600E) mutation does not possess prognostic value in Korea, where it is prevalent, and where most of the PTC types are conventional. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND Despite the limited use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) in Indonesia, they have proven to be cost-effective in family planning programs. This study was aimed to identify the elements of ideas and views that people hold and their association with the use of LARC (intrauterine devices and implants) as a means of improving its utilization in Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB) Province, Indonesia.
   METHODS Data were derived from the Improving Contraceptive Mix Methods survey of 6,384 respondents in Bima District, Central Lombok, and North Lombok, NTB Province, in 2015. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to identify suitable elements of 19 variables and generate three ideation elements on attitude, knowledge, and interpersonal communication. Subsequently, the association of three ideation elements with LARC use in NTB was examined.
   RESULTS Multivariate analysis revealed that LARC use was higher among women with a positive attitude toward LARC and high frequency of interpersonal communication. Women with positive attitudes had 7 times greater odds of using LARC than women with negative attitudes (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 7.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.09-8.55). Women with a high frequency of interpersonal communication were 2.4 times more likely to use LARC than women with low communication frequency (aOR = 2.40; 95% CI = 1.94-2.99).
   CONCLUSIONS To increase the use of LARC in NTB, family planning programs should not only focus on improving women's knowledge but also prioritizing the promotion of positive attitudes toward LARC and facilitating interpersonal communication.

KW  - Surgical mesh
KW  - Hernia repair
KW  - Patient internet self-education
AB  - Background As internet access improves, patient self-education continues to increase. However, patient surgical background, e-literacy, and media exposure potentially influence what information patients search online. This impacts patient concern, healthcare decisions, and subsequent patient-physician interactions. The purpose of this pilot study is to characterize hernia patients' use and the impact of internet self-education regarding surgical mesh. Methods The target population included patients presenting for evaluation of hernia repair with mesh. A total of 30 patients were enrolled. Patients took surveys before and after the initial surgical consult. The surveys evaluated internet use, mesh research completed, the impact on patient opinions/decisions, and the impact of research on the patient-physician interaction. Results The average age of the patients was 58.7 years; sixteen had prior surgery with surgical mesh. 93% of patients were aware of surgical mesh through the media, and 60% were motivated by the media to conduct research. 90% of patients conducted research, and 67% used the internet. Patients with negative attitudes toward mesh had more media exposure in comparison to those with neutral or positive attitudes (p = 0.046), and they were more likely to have researched surgical mesh because of media influence (p = 0.033). This group had the highest rate of perceived knowledge on mesh risks and the lowest regarding benefits (p = 0.013). Patients who had prior surgery without complication had the most positive attitude toward surgical mesh (p = 0.010) and were less likely to plan to do future internet research (p = 0.041) in comparison to patients who had surgery with complications or no prior surgery. Conclusions Patients' attitudes and perceived knowledge regarding surgical mesh are associated with media exposure and internet research. These attributes along with prior surgical experience impact the patient-physician relationship and shared decision-making model regarding patient care.

AB  - Introduction The United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities identified the Chinese blind massage policy as "reserved employment" in its Concluding Observations in 2012. In response, this paper reviewed the policy on blind massage in China and discussed its effectiveness and social impact. Methods: Adopting a historical perspective, this paper describes the development stages of the blind massage policy in China. It reveals the social construction process of the blind massage policy. Government data were provided to help analyze the positive and negative effects of the policy according to the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Results: The blind massage policy is a national strategy involving semi-reserved employment to improve the low employment rate of people with visual impairments in China. It promoted employment of people with visual impairments at the start, but, as the system of the blind massage gradually took shape, it restricted these individuals from choosing a career freely. The blind massage policy has resulted in deep-rooted social prejudices, and it demonstrates disability-based discrimination and charity-oriented practices. Discussion: The Chinese blind massage policy is discriminatory and does not reflect the modern concept of disability rights advocated in the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Implications for practitioners: The Chinese government needs to promote institutional reforms to provide better education and employment for people with visual impairments to change the limited content of vocational training and eliminate discriminatory policies.

AB  - Aim Low participation in cancer clinical trials by culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) patients limits access to cutting-edge treatments and generalizability of results. This is the first study exploring trials knowledge/attitudes and their association with trial participation in Vietnamese- and Anglo-Australian cancer patients. Methods Eligible patients diagnosed with cancer in the past 10 years were invited to complete a self-report questionnaire comprising validated measures of: trials knowledge and attitudes, preferred information amount, preferred decision-making involvement, health literacy, and past and future (i.e. hypothetical) trial participation. Multivariable linear regression evaluated correlates of trials knowledge/attitudes. Multinomial logistic regression estimated the relationship between trials knowledge/attitudes and possible future trial participation. Results Vietnamese-Australian participants (n = 50) had more negative attitudes regarding trials than Anglo-Australians (n = 100;B = -9.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], -17.60 to -0.97;P = 0.029), but similar knowledge (B = -0.91; 95% CI, -2.27 to 0.44;P = 0.18). Future trial participation was associated with positive attitudes (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.12;P < 0.001) and greater knowledge (OR = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04-1.62;P = 0.02), but not Vietnamese background (OR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.27-3.32;P = 0.93). Conclusion Despite poorer attitudes regarding trials in Vietnamese-Australians, Vietnamese background was not associated with less likely future trial participation, suggesting low trial participation by CALD patients may be more due to opportunity barriers. Improving knowledge and attitudes may increase trial participation generally.

KW  - OPEN-ACCESS
AB  - This study examines the reasons why authors publish in 'predatory' OA journals. In total, 50 journals were randomly selected from Beall's list of predatory' journals. Different methods, including WHOIS tracking, were utilized to query basic information about the selected journals, including location and registrant. Then, 300 articles were randomly selected from within selected journals in various scientific fields. Authors of the selected articles were contacted and sent survey questions to complete. A grounded theory qualitative methods approach was used for data collection and analysis. The results demonstrated that most of these journals were located in the developing world, usually Asia or Africa, even when they claimed they were in the USA or UK. Furthermore, four themes emerged after authors' survey responses were coded, categorized, and sub-categorized. The themes were: social identity threat, unawareness, high pressure, and lack of research proficiency. Scholars in the developing world felt that reputable Western journals might be prejudiced against them and sometimes felt more comfortable publishing in journals from the developing world. Other scholars were unaware of the reputation of the journals in which they published and would not have selected them had they known. However, some scholars said they would still have published in the same journals if their institution recognised them. The pressure to 'publish or perish' was another factor influencing many scholars' decisions to publish in these fast-turnaround journals. In some cases, researchers did not have adequate guidance and felt they lacked the knowledge of research to submit to a more reputable journal. More needs to be done by institutions and reputable journals to make researchers aware of the problem of predatory' journals.

AB  - Context Studies involving physicians suggest that unconscious bias may be related to clinical decision making and may predict poor patient-physician interaction. The presence of unconscious race and social class bias and its association with clinical assessments or decision making among medical students is unknown.
   Objective To estimate unconscious race and social class bias among first-year medical students and investigate its relationship with assessments made during clinical vignettes.
   Design, Setting, and Participants A secure Web-based survey was administered to 211 medical students entering classes at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, in August 2009 and August 2010. The survey included the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to assess unconscious preferences, direct questions regarding students' explicit race and social class preferences, and 8 clinical assessment vignettes focused on pain assessment, informed consent, patient reliability, and patient trust. Adjusting for student demographics, multiple logistic regression was used to determine whether responses to the vignettes were associated with unconscious race or social class preferences.
   Main Outcome Measures Association of scores on an established IAT for race and a novel IAT for social class with vignette responses.
   Results Among the 202 students who completed the survey, IAT responses were consistent with an implicit preference toward white persons among 140 students (69%, 95% CI, 61%-75%). Responses were consistent with a preference toward those in the upper class among 174 students (86%, 95% CI, 80%-90%). Assessments generally did not vary by patient race or occupation, and multivariable analyses for all vignettes found no significant relationship between implicit biases and clinical assessments. Regression coefficient for the association between pain assessment and race IAT scores was -0.49 (95% CI, -1.00 to 0.03) and for social class, the coefficient was -0.04 (95% CI, -0.50 to 0.41). Adjusted odds ratios for other vignettes ranged from 0.69 to 3.03 per unit change in IAT score, but none were statistically significant. Analysis stratified by vignette patient race or class status yielded similarly negative results. Tests for interactions between patient race or class status and student IAT D scores in predicting clinical assessments were not statistically significant.
   Conclusions The majority of first-year medical students at a single school had IAT scores consistent with implicit preference for white persons and possibly for those in the upper class. However, overall vignette-based clinical assessments were not associated with patient race or occupation, and no association existed between implicit preferences and the assessments.

TI  - PRESERVING DUE PROCESS: APPLYING MONELL BIFURCATION TO STATE GANG CASES
T2  - UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - State gang statutes deprive criminal Defendants of their 5th and 14th Amendment due process rights by creating a mechanism by which prosecutors admit irrelevant, otherwise inadmissible, hearsay and unduly prejudicial character evidence in criminal trials. This Article asserts that both well-established evidentiary standards and our commitment to fundamental due process protections are jeopardized by state gang statutes. Moreover, state gang statutes were created, and have operated, to incarcerate poor, young men of color-including seasoned gang members, novice gang members, and simply accused gang members-under a peculiar set of legal standards that violate the plain language of the United States Constitution.
   This Article proposes the use of the Monell bifurcation standard to address this problem. Specifically, separating gang allegations from substantive criminal acts in the prosecution's case in chief will ensure criminal Defendants, including gang members, due process of law. This Article proceeds in three parts. Part I provides an overview of state gang statutes by challenging their common justifications, broad reach, and application. Part II explores the effects of state gang statutes upon evidentiary standards and describes how the admission of unduly prejudicial character evidence amounts to a due process violation. Part III proposes the use of something akin to Monell bifurcation to state gang prosecutions to preserve criminal Defendants' fundamental right to a fair trial. A Monell bifurcation requirement would compel state prosecutors to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, the substantive criminal offense, prior to the admission of any gang evidence in the criminal trial. This application of the Monell bifurcation standard in State gang cases would serve to minimize the insurmountable prejudice of gang related evidence.

AB  - Congress passed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with the primary goal of integrating the workforce and eliminating arbitrary bias against minorities and other groups who had been historically excluded. Yet substantial research reveals that racial bias persists and continues to limit opportunities and outcomes for racial minorities in the workplace. Because these denials of opportunity result from myriad individual hiring and promotion decisions made by vast numbers of managers, finding effective strategies to reduce the impact of bias has proven challenging. Some have proposed that a sense of accountability, or "the implicit or explicit expectation that one may be called on to justify one's beliefs, feelings, and actions to others," can decrease bias. This Article examines the conditions under which accountability to a committee of peers reduces racial bias and discrimination.
   More specifically, this Article provides the first empirical test of whether an employment committee's racial composition influences the decision-making process. My experimental results reveal that race does in fact matter. Accountability to a racially diverse committee leads to more hiring and promotion of underrepresented minorities than does accountability to a homogeneous committee. Members of diverse committees were more likely to value diversity, acknowledge structural discrimination, and favor inclusive promotion decisions. This suggests that accountability as a debiasing strategy is more nuanced than previously theorized. If simply changing the racial composition of a committee can indeed nudge less discriminatory behavior, we can encourage these changes through voluntary organizational policies like having an NFL "Rooney Rule" for hiring committees. In addition, Title VII can be interpreted to hold employers liable under a negligence theory to encourage the types of changes that yield inclusive hires and promotions.

AB  - Background: The deterioration of Venezuela's health system in recent years undoubtedly contributes to an increased impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding healthcare workers' (HCWs) knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) toward COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic could inform their medical training and improve their preparedness.
   Methods: A online national cross-sectional survey was conducted between May 26th and May 30th, 2020, to assess KAPs among HCWs in Venezuela.
   Results: A total of 1,441 HCWs from all 24 regions of the country responded to the survey. The mean age of the HCWs was 44 (SD [standard deviation] 14) years; most were women (66.4%). Most HCWs were specialized doctors (48%), followed by nurses (13%) and resident doctors (12.3%). The majority of HCWs had good knowledge (76.3%), obtained information mainly from scientific literature (85.4%); had negative attitudes (53.6%), felt uncomfortable with their work during the current pandemic (59.8%); and reported appropriate practices (76.9%). However, participation in COVID-19 related training was absent in more than half of the HCWs. Positive attitudes were significantly more frequent in frontline workers than in non-frontline workers (p = 0.001). Bioanalysts, students, and doctors were more likely to have good knowledge; participating in training was a predictor for positive attitudes and older age was an appropriate practice predictor.
   Conclusions: HCWs, knowledge in Venezuela could be improved by strengthening education and training programs. Strategies should focus on reducing fear and improving attitudes toward the care of COVID-19 patients, as well as the promotion of preventive practices.

AB  - Communities juxtaposed to protected areas (PAs) often disproportionally accrue the costs of conservation, but they can also receive benefits from the existence of a PA. The extent to which local communities benefit or incur costs as a result of residing next to PAs is of interest to conservationists and policy-makers. (is study sought to understand the costs, benefits, and attitudes of local people living adjacent to Save Valley Conservancy (SVC), Zimbabwe. The purpose was to determine whether benefit and loss accrual has a bearing on the levels of illicit wildlife-based activities experienced in the SVC. Data were collected through a household questionnaire survey and key informant interviews from April to July 2014. A three-stage sampling was adopted: firstly, purposive sampling was employed to select wards adjacent to the SVC; secondly, random sampling was used to select villages within the selected wards; and thirdly, systematic sampling was used to select 71 household questionnaire respondents. Snowball sampling was used to select 9 key informants. The study results show that the majority of locals living close to SVC are not deriving discernable benefits and the costs of conservation are escalating influencing negative attitudes towards wildlife conservation, thus causing them to view wildlife as a nuisance. Overall, our results indicate that conservation losses and benefit accrual by local communities influence their attitudes toward SVC and conservation in general. We conclude that costs incurred outweighed the benefits accrued, a situation that triggers a more negative form of reciprocity towards SVC and wildlife conservation. It is recommended that a more socially and economically inclusive management approach based on a stakeholder-driven access and benefit sharing (ABS) framework be instituted to promote a more positive form of reciprocity towards SVC and nature conservation.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 control measures efforts are affected by the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the public, particularly religious clerics and traditional healers, who have close contact and are widely accepted by a significant number of community members.
   Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted to determine knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 and its associated factors among religious clerics and traditional healers in Gondar town. Study participants who met our inclusion criteria were selected using a simple random sampling technique. Data were collected by trained data collectors through face-to-face interviews. The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Knowledge, attitudes and practices scores were calculated to give the overall knowledge, attitude and practice score. Binary logistic regression was fitted to identify associated factors and odds ratio was used to measure the strength of the association.
   Results: A total of 410 religious clerics and traditional healers were included in the study with a response rate of 97.1%. Of the total participants, 60.7% (95%: CI (56-65%)) had good knowledge, 34.1% (95%: CI (30-39%)) had a positive attitude and 15.6% (95%: CI (12-19%)) had good practices towards prevention and early detection of COVID-19. Less than one third of the participants practiced physical distancing (28%) and facemask use (17.8%). In multivariate logistic regression, age, educational status and marital status were significantly associated with knowledge score. Likewise, age and marital status were significantly associated with the positive attitude score. In addition, age, educational status, and the presence of underlying disease were significantly associated with the good practice score.
   Conclusion: Majority of the participants had poor practice and negative attitudes. Therefore, there should be a sensitization program to fill the gap in the knowledge, attitudes and practice measures of COVID-19 especially for elderly and illiterates.

AB  - Sexual minorities are at greater risk for mental health difficulties than their heterosexual peers, and bisexual and asexual individuals may be at particularly heightened risk. However, the majority of the literature has failed to examine nuanced differences within the sexual minority community. We examined depression, anxiety and happiness as indicators of mental health, and belonging and coping as general psychological processes in 2,424 female and male college students who identified as gay/lesbian, asexual, or bisexual. The findings revealed a significant main effect for sexual orientation such that bisexual individuals scored significantly higher on depression and lower on happiness than asexual and gay/lesbian individuals. Gay/lesbian and bisexual individuals scored significantly higher on anxiety and lower on coping than asexual individuals. Asexual individuals reported greater belonging than bisexual individuals, and gay/lesbian individuals scored in between those groups. The results also revealed a significant main effect for gender such that women had higher levels of depression and anxiety, and lower levels of happiness and coping than men. Finally, gender did not moderate the relationship between sexual orientation and the outcome variables. These findings highlight that the sexual minority community is not a monolithic group in terms of mental health or general psychological processes.

AB  - Introduction People with cancer are at higher risk of serious illness and death from COVID-19 infection. We investigated COVID-19 vaccine uptake among patients with solid organ and blood cancers and explored factors related to hesitancy. Methods Cross-sectional online survey of adults with a history of cancer at three health services across metropolitan and regional Victoria. Vaccine hesitancy was measured by the validated Oxford COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy scale. Results There were 1073 respondents: 56% female; median age 62 years (range 23 - 91). Commonest tumor types included breast 29%, gastrointestinal 19%, hematological 15%, genitourinary 15%, and lung 8%. Thirty-six percent had metastatic disease, and 54% were receiving active anticancer treatment. Eighty-four percent of respondents indicated positive intent toward COVID-19 vaccination, 10% were undecided, and 6% indicated negative attitudes. At least one vaccine dose had been received by 65% of respondents, leaving 35% unvaccinated. Fifty-eight percent of unvaccinated patients answered that they would "definitely" or "probably" take a vaccine. Higher vaccine uptake was significantly associated with older age, male gender, English as first language, longer time since cancer diagnosis, and not being on current anticancer treatment. Concerns regarding vaccine side effects, particularly thrombosis, and the desire for clear medical advice were prominent among unvaccinated respondents. Conclusion Despite being eligible for COVID-19 vaccination since March 2021, a substantial minority of patients with cancer remained unvaccinated as of August 2021. Targeted communication and educational resources addressing vaccine safety in the context of cancer are key to promoting vaccine uptake in this vulnerable population.

AB  - Mammalian carnivores often cause problems for people by preying on domestic stock. Exploring the factors that affect people's attitudes to predators, in particular the circumstances when some degree of loss is tolerated, is needed for developing predator management plans. When more than one species of predator is involved, there may be unexpected interactive effects in shaping people's tolerance. We addressed this hypothesis in a west Asian multi-predator montane landscape with high density of both wild ungulates and livestock harboring two large predators, Persian leopard and grey wolf. A semi-structured questionnaire survey of herders residing around Tandoureh, Salouk and Sarigol National Parks, northeastern Iran was carried out. The perceived role of leopards in depredation was negligible compared with that of wolves which were reported to be more frequent stock raiders and responsible for an average of 5.7 times more annual losses per herd by than were leopards. Non predatory causes of mortality, particularly diseases, were clearly the major threat to livestock. Interviewed herders showed different attitudes toward each predator. Regardless of any recent occurrence of stock raiding by wolves, they were predominantly considered negatively. Although people showed mainly positive attitudes toward leopards, respondents who reported more wolf attacks tended to have more negative attitudes toward leopards. Hence, in multiple predator ecosystems, peoples' attitudes toward each species may be affected by the perceived activity of other predators. Often neglected in conservation programs, this phenomenon is clearly important in sustaining people tolerance particularly if endangered large predators are involved.

AB  - Background and aims: Few studies have examined the stigma of problem gambling and little is known about those who internalize this prejudice as damaging self-stigma. This paper aimed to identify psychological factors, sociodemographic characteristics, and coping mechanisms associated with the self-stigma of problem gambling. Methods: An online survey was conducted on 177 Australian adults with a current gambling problem to measure self-stigma, self-esteem, social anxiety, self-consciousness, psychological distress, symptom severity, most problematic gambling form, stigma coping mechanisms, and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: All variables significantly correlated with self-stigma were considered for inclusion in a regression model. A multivariate linear regression indicated that higher levels of self-stigma were associated with: being female, being older, lower self-esteem, higher problem gambling severity score, and greater use of secrecy (standardized coefficients: 0.16, 0.14, -0.33, 0.23, and 0.15, respectively). Strongest predictors in the model were self-esteem, followed by symptom severity score. Together, predictors in the model accounted for 38.9% of the variance in self-stigma. Discussion and conclusions: These results suggest that the self-stigma of problem gambling may be driven by similar mechanisms as the self-stigma of other mental health disorders, and impact similarly on self-esteem and coping. Thus, self-stigma reduction initiatives used for other mental health conditions may be effective for problem gambling. In contrast, however, the self-stigma of problem gambling increased with female gender and older age, which are associated with gaming machine problems. This group should, therefore, be a target population for efforts to reduce or better cope with the self-stigma of problem gambling.

AB  - The emergence of urban green governance has given prominence to the role of trees in sustainable cities. Earlier ideas of trees as urban adornment and providers of amenity are giving way to understanding of the urban forest as green infrastructure. Urban trees are taking on the normative resonance of 'nature' previously reserved in sustainability discourse for nonurban environments. Yet a governing consensus that urban trees are good is not necessarily accepted by all. Despite extensive research on tree benefits, little is known about social resistance to urban trees. In Australia, anecdotal evidence suggests that many tree lovers perceive a countervailing force of tree haters who are responsible for tree injury and death through acts of revenge, scapegoating, displaced emotion and sheer loathing. This perception frames dislike of trees as social deviance rather than as a legitimate expression of complex intersubjective aspirations and concerns. In investigating the existence or otherwise of anti-arboreal forces, we report on a survey of residents in six eastern Australian cities that explored motivations underlying tree planting and removal. Rather than rejecting trees outright, most respondents expressing negative attitudes towards trees did so in the context of espousing the value of the 'right tree' in the 'right place'. The chief motivations for the removal of healthy trees were aesthetic and lifestyle preferences, linked to wider cultural dynamics of individuation and commodification, followed by moral considerations, linked to wider cultural dynamics related to nativism. The findings suggest that to reduce the turnover of private trees, advocates of the urban forest have to expand their engagement with residents beyond a current focus on technical discourses of tree services and regulatory controls. This expanded engagement needs to account for the full range of subjective factors that influence tree preferences. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As white-tailed deer populations increase in developed and urban areas, lethal management is necessary to control population growth. However, concerns about safety and negative attitudes towards lethal control and using firearms near houses have prompted many communities to pursue nonlethal techniques. Therefore, in 2014 we initiated a 5-year project to attempt to stabilize the local deer population on Bald Head Island (BHI), North Carolina, using the immunocontraceptive GonaCon (TM). Since 2014 we captured and inoculated 77 female deer with GonaCon (TM) From 2017 to 2018 we evaluated the efficacy and cost of GonaCon (TM) at reducing pregnancy in adult female white-tailed deer on BHI. We obtained blood samples from 49 deer that had received either 1 or 2 doses of GonaCon (TM), and from 19 female deer that had received no GonaCon (TM) for pregnancy analysis using the pregnancy specific protein B assay. All untreated deer sampled were pregnant (n = 19), whereas 67% of deer sampled that received only a single dose were pregnant (n = 27), and 14% of deer that received 2 doses (n = 22) were pregnant. Thus, 2 doses of GonaCon (TM) were necessary to reduce pregnancy rates below 50%. The total direct cost of the 5-year immunocontraception project was $320,030.52 and averaged $2,078.12/capture with an overall efficacy of 33% for one dose and 86% for 2 doses of GonaCon (TM) Conversely, the estimated cost for the local government (i.e., Village of Bald Head Island) to cull 30 deer in 2018 was $16,163.63, or $538.79/deer. The estimated deer population was 113 in 2014 and increased to 198 individuals by 2018. Further population projections suggested the white-tailed deer population is projected to reach 342 individuals by 2022. Although 2 doses of GonaCon (TM) were effective at reducing pregnancy, administration across the BHI deer population was not successful in reducing the deer population, and culling will likely be necessary to reduce the population.

TI  - To Share or Not To Share Investigating the Social Aspects of Dynamic Ridesharing
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA  - English
AB  - Transportation network companies (TNCs) have introduced shared-ride versions of their ordinary services, such as UberPool or Lyft Line. The concept is simple: passengers pay less in fares for an incremental increase in time spent picking up and dropping off other riders. This paper focuses on the social and behavioral considerations of shared rides, which have not been explored as thoroughly as time and cost trade-offs in transportation. A survey of TNC users conducted through Mechanical Turk in June and July of 2016, which had 997 respondents across the United States, found that (a) users of dynamic ridesharing services reported that social interactions were relevant to mode choice, although not as much as traditional factors such as time and cost; (b) overall, the possibility of having a negative social interaction was more of a deterrent to use of dynamic ridesharing than the potential of having a positive social interaction was an incentive; (c) there was evidence that a substantial number of riders harbored feelings of prejudice toward passengers of different social class and race, and these passengers were much more likely to prefer having more information about potential future passengers; (d) most dynamic ridesharing users were motivated by ease and speed, compared with walking and public transportation; and (e) safety in dynamic ridesharing was an important issue, especially for women, many of whom reported feeling unsafe and preferred to be matched with passengers of the same sex.

AB  - Background: European nurses are expected to provide appropriate care for patients from diverse cultural backgrounds. However, there is limited knowledge and understanding of this process. The aim of this study was to analyse the perceptions of culture and experiences of caring for patients from diverse cultural backgrounds of a purposive sample of qualified nurses from four European countries, namely Belgium, Portugal, Spain and Turkey. Methods: A qualitative phenomenological approach was selected in order to understand complex phenomena through the participants' lived experiences, meanings and perspectives. Individual interviews and focus groups took place with 28 staff nurses and 11 nurse managers from four European countries. The sociodemographic and cultural characteristics of the sample were described and analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were transcribed verbatim, translated into English and analysed following Braun and Clark's phases for thematic analysis. Results: Five themes and twelve subthemes emerged from thematic analysis of the transcripts. The themes included: (1) relevance of culture for nursing; (2) culture in the healthcare service; (3) qualities of the healthcare professionals; (4) challenges to culturally competent care; (5) becoming a culturally competent nurse. Conclusions: There are challenges to the delivery of culturally congruent care, namely language and communication difficulties, prejudices and stereotyping in the health service, a tendency for ethnocentrism, a lack of education and training in cultural competence and a lack of support from the health service to facilitate new ways of acting.

AB  - Background: Attitudes and beliefs about massage therapy have been explored among health professionals and health profession students, but not for undergraduate preprofessional health sciences students.
   Methods: This cross-sectional survey sought to determine pre-professional health students' attitudes and perceptions toward massage therapy and determine the extent demographic variables such as age, gender, race, along with lifetime massage experience are associated with neutral/negative perceptions.
   Results: N = 129 undergraduate students completed the Attitudes Toward Massage scale and 7 supplemental items pertaining to sexuality and therapist gender preference along with questions regarding lifetime massage utilization. Prevalence of massage therapy utilization was 35.6% (lifetime) and 18.6% (last 12-months). Overall, positive attitudes towards massage therapy was observed with participants reporting massage experience expressing more positive massage attitudes (lifetime; p = 0.0081, the past 12 months; p = 0.0311). Participants with no massage experience were more likely to report neutral/negative attitudes toward massage (p = 0.04). Men were more likely to prefer their massage therapist to be of the opposite sex (38.9%) compared to women (2.1%) (p = < 0.0001). Men were less confident than women in their concern of becoming sexually aroused during massage (p = 0.0001) and in the belief that massage is sexually arousing (p = 0.048). Both genders expressed comfort with female and/or male massage therapists, but if given a choice, both prefer a female massage therapist.
   Conclusions: Undergraduate pre-professional health sciences students have generally positive attitudes towards massage therapy however more research is needed regarding implicit gender bias and/or preferences. This work should inform future research designs examining the impact of attitudes and beliefs on patient referrals to massage therapy.

AB  - ObjectivesPsychological interventions show greater efficacy when evaluated with distressed patients. We report on the feasibility of implementing screening for recruiting distressed cancer patients to a randomized controlled trial of problem-solving therapy (PST), characteristics associated with enrolment, and time investment and challenges of implementing screening.
   MethodsThree medical settings implemented screening of patients, directly after cancer treatment (T1) and 2months later (T2), using Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 and one question about need for services. Distressed patients indicating need for services were interviewed. Eligible patients were offered the possibility to participate in the trial. Consenting patients were randomized to PST or waitlist.
   ResultsAt T1, 366 of 970 screened patients (37%) scored above the cutoff and at T2, 208 of 689 screened patients (30%). At either or both T1 and T2, 423 patients reported distress, of whom 215 indicated need for services. Only 36 (4% of 970) patients consented to trial participation. Twenty-seven patients needed to be screened to recruit a single patient, with 17h required for each patient recruited. Barriers to screening were time constraints and negative attitudes of oncology staff towards screening.
   ConclusionsImplementing screening proved inefficient for recruiting distressed cancer patients post-treatment to a randomized controlled trial on PST, with need for services being much less than anticipated. Consecutively screening patients did not result in a sample representative of the larger pool of distressed patients, which may lower generalizability. An adequately powered intervention trial using screening requires a feasibility study establishing recruitment rates and dedicated, funded staff assistance. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Aims Abbreviations are common in the medical record. Their inappropriate use may ultimately lead to patient harm, yet little is known regarding the extent of their use and their comprehension. Our aim was to assess the extent of their use, their comprehension and physicians' attitudes towards them, using ophthalmology consults in a tertiary hospital as a model.
   Methods We first mapped the frequency with which English abbreviations were used in the departments' computerised databases. We then used the most frequently used abbreviations as part of a cross-sectional survey designed to assess the attitudes of non-ophthalmologist physicians towards the abbreviations and their comprehension of them. Finally, we tested whether an online lecture would improve comprehension.
   Results 4375 records were screened, and 235 physicians responded to the survey. Only 42.5% knew at least 10% of the abbreviations, and no one knew them all. Ninety-two per cent of respondents admitted to searching online for the meanings of abbreviations, and 59.1% believe abbreviations should be prohibited in medical records. A short online lecture improved the number of respondents answering correctly at least 50% of the time from 1.2% to 42% (P<0.001).
   Conclusions Abbreviations are common in medical records and are frequently misinterpreted. Online teaching is a valuable tool for physician education. The majority of respondents believed that misinterpreting abbreviations could negatively impact patient care, and that the use of abbreviations should be prohibited in medical records. Due to low rates of comprehension and negative attitudes towards abbreviations in medical communications, we believe their use should be discouraged.

AB  - Objective: To assess the effect of experienced stigma on depth of multidimensional poverty of persons with severe mental illness (PSMI) in Delhi, India, controlling for gender, age and caste.
   Design: Matching case (hospital)-control (population) study.
   Setting: University Hospital (cases) and National Capital Region (controls), India.
   Participants: A case-control study was conducted from November 2011 to June 2012. 647 cases diagnosed with schizophrenia or affective disorders were recruited and 647 individuals of same age, sex and location of residence were matched as controls at a ratio of 1:2:1. Individuals who refused consent or provided incomplete interview were excluded.
   Main outcome measures: Higher risk of poverty due to stigma among PSMI.
   Results: 38.5% of PSMI compared with 22.2% of controls were found poor on six dimensions or more. The difference in multidimensional poverty index was 69% between groups with employment and income of the main contributors. Multidimensional poverty was strongly associated with stigma (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.27 to 5.31), scheduled castes/scheduled tribes/other backward castes (2.39, 1.39 to 4.08), mental illness (2.07, 1.25 to 3.41) and female gender (1.87, 1.36 to 2.58). A significant interaction between stigma, mental illness and gender or caste indicates female PSMI or PSMI from 'lower castes' were more likely to be poor due to stigma than male controls (p<0.001) or controls from other castes (p<0.001).
   Conclusions: Public stigma and multidimensional poverty linked to SMI are pervasive and intertwined. In particular for low caste and women, it is a strong predictor of poverty. Exclusion from employment linked to negative attitudes and lack of income are the highest contributors to multidimensional poverty, increasing the burden for the family. Mental health professionals need to be aware of and address these issues.

AB  - Lay abstract Cancer patients are considered among the privileged group for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. The investigators conducted a survey assessing the relationship between coronaphobia and related factors and vaccine acceptance among patients with cancer. A total of 300 patients completed a questionnaire assessing the factors affecting vaccine acceptance. Most (86.7%) patients accepted vaccination and have higher levels of fear against COVID-19, while 7% refused vaccination. Patients who have increased age, are retired and married had a higher tendency to accept vaccination against COVID-19. The main reason for acceptance was the willingness to get protection, whereas the main reason for refusal was the fear of adverse effects.
   Aim: This study aimed to assess the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) phobia and related factors on attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine in cancer patients. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted with 300 adult patients using a validated COVID-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S) and related survey to determine the factors affecting vaccine acceptance between May-June 2021. Results: Regarding the COVID-19 vaccine willingness, 86.7% accepted vaccination, 6.3% were hesitant and 7% refused vaccination. Patients that accepted vaccination had significantly higher C19P-S scores in general, and in psychological and psychosomatic subdivisions. Univariate analysis revealed that increased age, being retired, and being married were significantly associated with willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Conclusion: The majority of patients had high coronophobia levels which were associated with increased willingness for the COVID-19 vaccines. Minimizing negative attitudes towards vaccines will most likely be achieved by raising awareness in the cancer population about COVID-19 vaccine.

AB  - Increased global meat consumption has negative impacts on animal welfare, the environment, as well as health. The current study is the first to investigate whether imagined intergroup contact with a farmed animal changes wanting and liking of beef and reduces willingness to consume meat. Collegians [N = 100, 67% female] imagined having a positive experience with either a calf (n = 36), kitten (n = 33), or child (n = 31). Following the imagined interaction, they completed the Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire to measure implicit and explicit wanting and explicit liking of beef and other types of meat relative to other food categories. Participants also indicated their willingness to reduce meat consumption. Results revealed that there were no significant differences between groups in explicit wanting or liking of beef or meat, nor in willingness to reduce future meat consumption. Nevertheless, compared to the kitten and child conditions, participants who imagined interacting with a calf experienced lower levels of implicit wanting and relative preference for beef and other meat products. Our findings suggest that imagined intergroup contact may be an effective manipulation to reduce meat consumption as a part of a broader intervention program.

AB  - In light of increasing rates of overweight and obesity worldwide, there is a critical need for accurate self-report measures of disinhibited and restrained eating behaviors across the weight spectrum. Item response theory was used to determine whether differences in disinhibited and restrained eating between healthy weight and overweight or obese individuals were due to item bias (i.e., differential item functioning). Study 1 participants were healthy weight (n = 510) or overweight or obese (n = 304) adults recruited from the community. Study 2 participants were healthy weight (n = 778) or overweight or obese (n = 320) college students. Study 1 participants completed the Eating Disorder Examination- Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Eating Disorder Inventory-3. Dutch Eating Behaviors Questionnaire, Restraint Scale, and Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire. Study 2 participants completed the Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory (EPSI). Items on the Restraint Scale demonstrated the most evidence for bias (60% of items), whereas the majority of other scales demonstrated low to moderate levels of item bias (17-38% of items). However. EDE-Q Restraint and EPSI Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Excessive Exercise, Muscle Building, and Negative Attitudes Toward Obesity scales did not show any evidence of differential item functioning among weight groups. Participants with the same level of disordered eating responded differently to certain eating disorder self-report items due to weight-bias, rather than true between-groups differences. Nevertheless, EDE-Q Restraint, EPSI Cognitive Restraint, and EPSI Binge Eating did not exhibit any evidence of bias and are ideal for assessing restrained and disinhibited eating across the weight spectrum in both research and clinical settings.

AB  - Natural grasslands are threatened globally. In south-eastern Australia, remnants of critically endangered natural grasslands are increasingly being isolated in urban areas. Urbanisation has led to reduced fire frequency and woody plant encroachment in some patches. Grasslands are currently being managed under the assumption that desirable management actions to address these threats (prescribed burning and removing woody vegetation) (1) lead to improved conservation outcomes and (2) are restricted by negative public attitudes. In this study, we tested these two assumptions in the context of native grassland conservation reserves in Melbourne, Australia. Firstly, we investigated differences in species and functional trait composition between patches that had been recently burnt, patches that were unburnt and patches subject to woody vegetation encroachment. We found that the functional traits of species converged in areas subject to woody plant encroachment and areas frequently disturbed by fire. Burning promoted native species, and patches of woody plants supressed the dominant grass, providing a wider range of habitat conditions. Secondly, we surveyed 477 residents living adjacent to these grassland conservation reserves to measure values, beliefs and attitudes and the acceptance of prescribed burning and removing woody vegetation. We found conflict in people's attitudes to grasslands, with both strongly positive and strongly negative attitudes expressed. The majority of residents found prescribed burning an acceptable management practice (contrary to expectations) and removing trees and shrubs from grasslands to be unacceptable. Both cognitive factors (values and beliefs) and landscape features were important in influencing these opinions. This research provides some guidance for managing urban grassland reserves as a social-ecological system, showing that ecological management, community education and engagement and landscape design features can be integrated to influence social and ecological outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: Practice placements are essential for radiotherapy students to learn and embed the necessary skills for practice; thus, each placement should afford an optimum learning experience. A key finding from the Phase 3 student arm of recent doctoral research suggests that for some students an optimum learning experience is not guaranteed. Using students' own words, this paper seeks to increase radiographers' awareness of how their behaviours can affect students' placement learning, and aims to help improve the placement learning experience for both.
   Method: A three-phase, U.K.-wide, mixed methods study was conducted. In the Phase 3 student arm, qualitative data were gathered via focus groups/interviews from volunteer student radiographers. Data were transcribed, manually coded, and analysed thematically by the Researcher using the applied research methodology Framework Analysis.
   Results: The analysed data were complimentary to radiographers, overall, but common themes were identified criticising certain of their attitudes and behaviours. Students exhibited fragility in response to perceived negative attitudes and behaviours, and failed to develop resilience in response to further similar experiences. This had a negative effect on their placement learning. Positive attitudes from radiographers enhanced students' placement learning. The placement experiences of radiotherapy students are consistent with those of other AHP and nursing students identified in the literature.
   Conclusion: Increasing radiographers' awareness of the negative and positive effects of their behaviours and attitudes will help improve students' placement learning experience. Students' resilience may be improved by teaching them coping strategies to use on placement.
   Implications for practice: The retention of radiotherapy students is an urgent concern for the radiotherapy profession therefore it is important to take steps to improve it. Enhancing students' placement experience may contribute to increased retention. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The College of Radiographers. All rights reserved.

AB  - The 20th anniversary of the National Firearms Agreement (NFA) offers lessons for mental health and public health. Along with similar international legislation, the NFA exemplifies how firearms regulation can prevent firearm mortality and injuries.
   The gun lobby claims that mental illness underpins gun violence and should be a key site for intervention.
   A modest but significant link exists between mental disorders and community violence. However, the vast majority of mentally ill individuals are not violent. Despite media portrayals of their dangerousness, they are more likely to be victims of violence and of suicide.
   Most violent individuals do not have mental illness, and most mass murderers do not have identifiable severe mental illness. Many have maladaptive personality configurations. Gun availability and gun ownership, not severe mental illness, determines most gun homicides.
   Following recent gun massacres in the United States, there have been calls for better resourcing of mental health services to help identify and respond to those at risk and to regulate firearms access.
   Screening mentally ill populations for violence risk is misguided. However, clinicians can play a key role in working with legal authorities to monitor and assist regulation of firearm access, especially among high risk populations.
   Clinician involvement must be complemented by wider gun control measures. The gun lobby's turning the firearms availability debate into a question about whether people with mental illness histories should access such weapons is a calculated appeal to prejudice.

AB  - Background. Self-help groups are beneficial for many people with addiction, predominantly through 12-step models. Yet obstacles to attendance also occur. Objectives. We explored attendance patterns and attitudes toward self-help groups by 165 outpatient females with co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorder (SUD), the first study of its kind. Methods. Cross-sectional self-report data compared adults versus adolescents, and those currently attending self-help versus not attending. We also explored attendance in relation to perceptions of the PTSD/SUD relationship and symptom severity. Results. Adults reported higher attendance at self-help than adolescents, both lifetime and currently. Among current attendees, adults also attended more weekly groups than adolescents. Yet only a minority of both age cohorts attended any self-help in the past week. Adults perceived a stronger relationship between PTSD and SUD than adolescents, but both age groups gave low ratings to the fact that self-help groups do not address PTSD. That item also had low ratings by both those currently attending and not attending self-help. Analysis of those not currently attending identified additional negative attitudes toward self-help (spirituality, addiction as a life-long illness, sayings, and the fellowship). Symptom severity was not associated with attendance, but may reflect a floor effect. Finally, a surprising finding was that all-female groups were not preferred by any subsample. Conclusions/Importance. Creative solutions are needed to address obstacles to self-help among this population. Addressing trauma and PTSD, not just SUD, was valued by females we surveyed, and may be more helpful than all-female groups per se.

AB  - This article analyzes the development of fat activism in Brazil considering two artists, Elisa Queiroz and Fernanda Magalhaes at the end of the twentieth century. Both artists started to develop dialogs related to visual arts and their bodies, reflecting on prejudices still strongly present in Brazil and offering a rethinking and re-envisioning of the fat body. The artists use the body as provocation, as a struggle against the imposition of hegemonic discourses, making a point to stand out as "marginal," rather than striving for normativity. Considering works that address the fat body in European and North American scenarios, I seek to understand the development of fat activism in Latin American territories, recognizing the scarcity of studies focused on the subject. Queer approaches by fat activists are relevant mainly by their antinormative and indefinable character and by the possibility of understanding artistic practices that refuse to normalize the fat body as "harmless." White, patriarchal heteronormativity reinforces hegemonic or rigid body ideals, including mainstream media perpetuating notions of ideal femininity associated with thinness or ideal masculinity associated with muscularity. In response to heteronormativity's regulation of fat bodies, new possibilities of fat transgression are presented in artistic activism, despite the growing medicalization, pathologization, and commodification of bodies out of bounds in medicine and the beauty industry. The results of my studying art as an activist intervention into sizeism indicate the possibility of recognizing a record of fat activism in visual arts in Brazil, allowing the subversion of corporeal standards and making room for emergent discussions about gender, culture, and identities.

AB  - Low organ donation rates are a major obstacle to the expansion of transplant opportunities in the Middle East. Awareness and opinion about organ donation affect willingness to donate. This study aims to evaluate public attitudes and knowledge about deceased organ donation (DOD) in Jordan in support of larger efforts to increase donor rates. A mixed qualitative and quantitative approach was used. Qualitative, one-on-one interviews were used to create a quantitative survey, which was administered to randomly-selected individuals over a 5-month period. The questionnaire used series of statements to evaluate knowledge and attitude about DOD on a scaling system and converted to scores (0-4). A total of 15 qualitative interviews and 500 quantitative surveys (78.4% response rate) were completed. Only 78 (15.6%) knew they could donate their organs after death. Only 49 (9.8%) were registered as donors, although 373 (74.6%) knew about the registration process. Internet (52.2%) and social media (51.0%) were the most common sources of information. The overall knowledge score was moderately high at 68.8% (2.75 +/- 1.31). Misconceptions persisted about body disfigurement, diagnostic accuracy of brain-death, and waiting list equity. The total attitude score was moderately positive at 65.8% (2.63 +/- 0.02). Public awareness campaigns (85.3%, 3.42 +/- 0.95) and regulatory legislation (78.8%, 3.15 +/- 0.99) were considered especially positive, while negative attitudes about religious importance of educational campaigns and regulatory legislation and would likely benefit from information from health-care providers and religious leaders.

AB  - Placebo effects are well-known phenomena in medicine and biology. In fact, placebos are used as control conditions in randomized cross-over clinical trials to validate new treatments. Only recently, however, has it become apparent that the conditioning and/or expectation effects provided by the experience of placebos can influence the results of clinical trials. It seems that combining shams and sequences has prejudiced the conclusions provided by cross-over designs. Frighteningly, this bias is always in the same direction, namely to increase the risk of rejecting potentially valid treatments. New models for clinical trials should be encouraged if we wish to market new and truly valid treatments.
   Are placebo-controlled cross-over designs in clinical trials silently killing new and promising treatments? Raising this question could seem heretic, especially in an age where evidence-based medicine and bias prevention constitute omnipresent concerns. Sadly, this may be happening every day, hiding in plain view of our collective ignorance. The proverbial 'fly in the ointment' seems to be in the nature of the design itself - a design which exposes participants to multiple interventions, often in close succession. Although multiple treatment expositions offer several recognized advantages (e. g., preventing the prejudicial effects provided by inter-individual differences and decreasing the number of participants needed to obtain appropriate statistical power), they also promote unsuspected carry-over effects which can negatively influence the confirmation of new treatments. Cross-over designs, therefore, may be designed to favor bias.

AB  - Background. The fears, concerns, and negative attitudes of pregnant women towards sex during pregnancy can have a negative impact on the sexual relationship and sexual performance of couples.
   Objectives. We aimed to determine the effects of cognitive-behavioral counseling on misconceptions about sexual intercourse during pregnancy in pregnant women.
   Material and methods. In this randomized educational study, five clinics were randomly selected in Arak, Iran. A total of 20 pregnant women who met the inclusion criteria were selected from each clinic. The Misconceptions about Sexual Intercourse during Pregnancy Questionnaire (MSIP-Q) was completed after written informed consent. Finally, twenty-two women with the lowest scores on the MSIP-Q were selected. Eleven subjects were allocated to the intervention group (cognitive-behavioral counseling), while eleven subjects were assigned to the control group. The questionnaire was also completed by the participants over a three-month interval. For statistical analysis, descriptive and inferential statistics (student's t-test, paired t-test and Fisher exact test) were calculated using SPSS software.
   Results. The mean MSIP-Q score was 77.81 +/- 10.03 in the intervention group and 71.27 +/- 8.29 in the control group before the intervention; no significant difference was found between the groups. On the other hand, the mean MSIP-Q score was 113.3 +/- 11.16 in the intervention group and 76.90 +/- 19.07 in the control group following cognitive-behavioral counseling; a significant difference was found between the two groups (p < 0.001). Based on the findings, no significant difference was reported in the intervention group in the three-month follow-up; in fact, the effects of training remained stable.
   Conclusions. This study showed that there are misconceptions about vaginal intercourse during pregnancy in Iranian women. Therefore, providing sexual health services and training during pregnancy are necessary at health clinics.

AB  - Background Pain after spine surgery is difficult to manage, often requiring the use of opioid analgesics. While traditional "deceptive" or concealed placebo has been studied in trials and laboratory experiments, the acceptability and patient experience of taking honestly prescribed placebos, such as "open-label" placebo (non-deceptive placebo), or conditioned placebo (pairing placebo with another active pharmaceutical) is relatively unexamined. Methods Qualitative thematic analysis was performed using semi-structured, post-treatment interviews with spine surgery patients (n = 18) who had received conditioned open-label placebo (COLP) during the first 2-3 weeks after surgery as part of a RCT. Interview transcripts were reviewed by 3 investigators using an immersion/crystallization approach, followed by iterative large-group discussions with additional investigators, to identify, refine, and codify emergent themes. Results Patients' experiences and perceptions of COLP efficacy varied widely. Some emergent themes included the power of the mind over pain, how COLP might provide distraction from or agency over pain, bandwidth required and engagement with COLP, and its modulation of opioid tapering, as well as negative attitudes toward opioids and pill taking in general. Other themes included uncertainty about COLP efficacy, observations of how personality may relate to COLP efficacy, and a recognition of the greater impact of COLP on reduction of opioid use rather than on pain itself. Interestingly, participant uncertainty, disbelief, and skepticism were not necessarily associated with greater opioid consumption or worse pain. Conclusion Participants provided insights into the experience of COLP which may help to guide its future utilization to manage acute pain and tapering from opioids.

AB  - Racial/ethnic and sexual minorities may experience excess stress from social prejudice and structural disadvantage, which is associated with family relationship problems and poorer psychosocial health. There is increasing evidence that certain positive psychological processes can attenuate these negative outcomes at the individual and interpersonal levels; however, the mechanisms of these effects remain poorly understood. Based on previous research and two extant conceptual frameworks, we constructed a preliminary model of how dispositional mindfulness operated in the context of minority stress among Latino/a sexual minority young adults and their families. We then conducted semistructured interviews in a life history format with 21 Latino/a sexual minority young adults and 15 family members to test our preliminary model and refine it. We mixed content analysis and grounded theory techniques, whereby we initially used deductive coding with preestablished codes based on our preliminary model, and subsequently used inductive coding to account for novel categories in the interview data that could not be explained by the preliminary model. The refined model revealed pathways by which 5 constructs of dispositional mindfulness (act with awareness, observe, describe, nonjudge, nonreact) buffered negative effects of minority stress on psychosocial health in young adults and were qualitatively associated with compassion, acceptance of sexual minorities, and closeness among family members. Young adults reporting deficiencies in mindfulness reported greater suffering and negative coping related to minority stress. Our model provides a framework to explore modes of resilience and adaptation to minority stress and offers a basis for further refinement in other affected populations.

KW  - PROTEIN-MALNUTRITION

AB  - Undernutrition can cause important functional and morphological alterations in the hematopoietic bone marrow (HBM). Degeneration of the HBM in malnourished individuals has been observed in the long bones, but none has been described in the cranial bones. Mandibular condyle fracture can lead to determine nutritional effects due to the high catabolism needed for the bone healing added to the difficulties of mastication. The aim of this study is to describe the histological aspect of HBM in the fractured mandibular condyle and in the temporal bone of malnourished rats. Thirty adult rats suffered unilateral mandibular condyle fracture and were divided into well-nourished (FG) and malnourished (MG) groups. In the MG the animals received a hypoproteic diet during the experiment. Histological sections of the temporomandibular joint were stained to visualize and quantify the HBM in this region at 24h, and 7, 15, 30, and 90 days post-fracture. At 24 hours, FG and MG showed hypocellularity and ischemic degeneration in the mandibular condyle and in the temporal bone. At 7 days, FG exhibited high cellularity in comparison with MG in the condyle; the temporal bone of both groups presented hypocellularity and degeneration. At 30 and 90 days, FG exhibited similar characteristics to those of the control; MG maintained the degeneration level mainly in the temporal bone. Malnutrition prejudices the regeneration of the HBM during a fracture healing in the temporomandibular joint. This fact contributes to a complete modification of the bone structure as well as to an impairment of the healing process.

AB  - Aims and objectives. To assess the reliability and validity of a Turkish version of Kogan's Attitudes Toward Older People Scale.
   Background. To explore nursing students' attitudes towards older people, standardised, well-tested instruments are needed. Kogan's Attitudes Toward Older People is a comprehensive instrument for assessment of attitudes toward older adults and has been validated in several languages. However, a validated Turkish version has not been available until now.
   Design. The study used psychometric testing to establish reliability and validity of the Turkish version of Kogan's Attitudes Toward Older People Scale.
   Methods. A convenience sample of 237 nursing students in Turkey was used to collect data regarding attitudes towards older people. Content validity, construct validity, internal consistency and stability reliability of the Kogan's Attitudes Toward Older People were assessed.
   Results. Kogan's Attitudes Toward Older People scores were between 74-224. All of the 34 items were found to have significant item-to-total correlations (p < 0 05). Results of the confirmatory factor analysis established that the scale had a two-factor construct and was appropriate use in this student population. The Cronbach's alpha was 0 89 for the total scale (0 82 for negative, 0 85 for positive). In addition, test-retest correlation was 0 83 (negative subscale 0 77, positive subscale 0 73) (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions. The Turkish version of the Kogan's Attitudes Toward Older People was found to be a reliable and valid tool for assessing Turkish nursing students' attitudes toward older adults.
   Relevance to clinical practice. This study provided evidence that the Kogan's Attitudes Toward Older People is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing Turkish nursing student's positive and negative attitudes toward older adults. It is easy and practical to use for both informants and investigators and acceptable for Turkish Culture.

AB  - Postal delivery workers have substantial sun exposure. In the United Kingdom (UK) a high proportion of workers possesses a sun sensitive skin type. This population is at elevated risk for skin cancer, yet uptake of sun safety practices is low. Studies are needed to identify the underlying factors that contribute to the uptake of occupational sun safety practices that may be targeted during behavior change interventions. This study integrated the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Transtheoretical Model's stages of change (SoC) as guiding frameworks to identify underlying beliefs that influence UK postal delivery workers' uptake of occupational sun safety practices. Thirty-four workers participated in semi-structured interviews that used the SoC to establish current receptiveness to and adoption of two sun safety practices (using sunscreen of at least sun protection factor (SPF) 30 on exposed skin and wearing a wide-brimmed hat when working outdoors in the summer). Beliefs underlying current practices were elicited in accordance with the TPB and stratified by the SoC. For sunscreen use and wearing a wide-brimmed hat, 64% and 3% of participants were in the action or maintenance SoC, respectively. Behavioral and control beliefs differed by SoC, with those in the earlier stages more likely than those in the latter stages to report negative attitudes to, and difficulty enacting, sun safety practices. Normative beliefs concerning the views of colleagues and employers towards sunscreen were relatively consistent across the SoC. This study highlights the need for tailored and targeted behavior change interventions. The SoC-stratified accounts of the influence of TPB components on behavior provide a basis for bespoke interventions that reflect inter-individual and inter-practice differences in their working mechanisms.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to provide updated and more comprehensive data on the correlates and patterns of acupuncture use in the United States, applying a sociobehavioral wellness model of utilization. Predisposing factors, enabling resources, need, and personal health practices were investigated. Patterns of recent usage, including assessing the reason for use based on treatment of a health condition, for wellness, or both, were examined. Also, for the first time, attitudes about acupuncture reported by previous users and never users were presented.
   Design: Data from the 2007 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a cross-sectional, household survey representative of the U. S. civilian population, were used, which included the Complementary and Alternative Medicine supplement. Adults 18 and over (n = 22,512) were analyzed. Bivariate prevalence estimates were obtained and logistic regression models were estimated. In addition, all analyses were weighted.
   Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was recent use of acupuncture, defined as any use in the past 12 months.
   Results: In 2007, 6.8% of adults reported lifetime use of acupuncture and 1.5% reported use in the past 12 months. Multivariate results showed significant effects in the expected directions for multiple variables in each of the four domains of our conceptual model (predisposing factors, enabling resources, need, and personal health practices). Among recent users, close to half reported some mention of wellness as a reason for use. Musculoskeletal conditions and pain were the top health conditions treated and these users, to some extent, integrated conventional and acupuncture care. Negative attitudes or skepticism about acupuncture were not common reasons for nonuse among prior and never users.
   Conclusions: Application of a sociobehavioral wellness model to frame correlates and patterns of recent acupuncture use in the Unites States shows promise.

AB  - Gender stereotypes adversely affect gay men's lives. Although research has linked the degree to which gay men are conscious of masculine stereotypes with symptoms of psychological distress, it is unclear whether different groups of gay men are equally conscious of gender stereotypes. Thus, we compared responses to an online survey between a closely matched group of Latino (n = 54) and White (non-Latino, n = 54) gay men who were U. S. citizens and resided in the U. S. We predicted that Latino men would score higher on questions related to (a) the importance of masculinity, (b) the importance of not being noticeably gay, (c) how conscious they were of their own masculine behavior, (d) negative attitudes toward effeminate gay men, and (e) dimensions related to a gay identity. Results showed that masculinity was equally important to both groups, but Latino men reported it was more important that they and their same-sex partners not be noticeably gay (Cohen's d = 0.40 and 0.62, respectively). Furthermore, both groups expressed an equal degree of negative attitude toward effeminate gay men, but the Latino men were more conscious about their own masculine behavior (d = 0.50). Finally, different dimensions of their gay identity were salient for each group where Latino men were more concerned with keeping their sexual orientation private (d = 0.54) and wanting to be accepted by others (d = 0.57), whereas the White men had more difficulty with their coming-out process (d = 0.40). Further research should consider how one's ethnicity is related to gender stereotypes and well-being among gay men.

AB  - Brexit and the election of Donald Trump can be interpreted as the culmination of a chain of events beginning with neoliberalism. This certainly appears to be the position we critical scholars have adopted. We readily paint neoliberalism as our ideological nemesis and cite it as the reason the developed world faced austerity measures in the late 2000s and early 2010s. And it is austerity, we tell ourselves, that led to the electoral surprises of 2016. In this article, I invoke the epistemological nuance found in Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and Weber to re-evaluate this linear cause-and-effect logic. Linear thinking is borne of a broader epistemological bias, a bias which the world of physics, for example, has long abandoned. However, linear thinking continues to pervade critical management studies, especially where it yields results consistent with our leftist inclinations. As critical management theorists, our ontological predisposition to continually rationalise macrosociological shifts in respect of oversimplified linear thinking reveals crude ideological conviction, political prejudice and identity anxiety. This article suggests that we can usefully reflect on the events of 2016 such that critical management studies can (1) dislodge itself from its ideological biases; (2) move away from overly simplistic cause-and-effect thinking and instead pay greater attention to nonlinear logic including, in particular, the pedagogical potential of paradox; (3) actively engage across disciplinary boundaries; and (4) breathe new life into truly ethnographic endeavours to better understand the sorts of factors that contributed to Brexit and Trump's election in the first place.

AB  - Background Australia is an ethnically diverse nation with one of the largest refugee resettlement programs worldwide, including high numbers of refugees with an Arabic speaking background. Evidence suggests that refugees can demonstrate high levels of psychological distress and are at a higher risk of developing mental illness such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Notwithstanding, research has also shown Arabic speaking refugees have lower levels of professional help-seeking behaviours, postulated to be related to mental health literacy levels. Methods A culturally sensitive mental health literacy (MHL) training program was developed and delivered in Arabic to Arabic speaking religious and community leaders using a 1-day training workshop format. An uncontrolled pre-, and post study design was used to provide a preliminary evaluation of improvement in PTSD-related knowledge, attitudes and help-seeking measures. Results A total of 54 adults were trained, with 52 completing the pre- and post-intervention questionnaire. Significant differences were found post-training in measures such as the ability to recognise mental health problems (p = 0.035) and an increased recognition of the role that medication can play in the treatment of PTSD (p = 0.00). Further, an improvement in negative attitudes such as a desire for social distance (p = 0.042) was noted and participants reported more helpful strategies in line with promoting professional help-seeking following training (p = 0.032). Conclusion Our findings indicated the training led to an improvement of some measures of MHL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the MHL program has been tailored for Arabic speaking religious and community leaders; who assist refugees with an Arabic background. By equipping community leaders with the knowledge to better respond to mental health problems, the overall goal of improving the mental health outcomes of Arabic speaking refugee communities is closer to being realised.

AB  - Purpose: To understand the experience of drug-resistant epilepsy in patients from Argentina, a developing nation.
   Method A qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews was used to gain an in-depth and contextual understanding of the perspectives of 20 patients with DRE. Data collection and analysis were followed by an inductive and interpretive approach informed by the principles of thematic analysis.
   Results: Six main themes emerged: 1) Characteristics of the illness, including seizure features-unpredictability, presence of auras, physical and cognitive consequences- and how patients relate with the use of antiepileptic drugs; 2) interactions with health system, regarding the features of the Argentine's health system, and patient's health-seeking behaviours; 3) beliefs about the illness, including psychosocial, biological and folk explanatory models; 4) beliefs about how other people perceive them, which included prejudice, responsibility and overprotection; 5) self-perception, and 6) impact of the illness on their activities.
   Conclusions: This information might be useful to help in the development of a conceptual model of the impact epilepsy on patients' lives. Many of the topics mentioned as relevant in Argentina coincide with those highlighted in studies that were carried out in first-world countries. However, additional topics were also reported including the role of traditional healing in health-seeking behaviour and explanatory models of illness. It is important to understand these perspectives to develop appropriate psychosocial interventions for this specific population.

AB  - Objective To examine in depth the views and experiences of continence service leads in England on key service and continence management characteristics in order to identify and to improve our understanding of barriers to a good-quality service and potential facilitators to develop and to improve services for older people with urinary incontinence (UI).
   Design Qualitative semistructured interviews using a purposive sample recruited across 16 continence services.
   Setting 3 acute and 13 primary care National Health Service Trusts in England.
   Participants 16 continence service leads in England actively treating and managing older people with UI.
   Results In terms of barriers to a good-quality service, participants highlighted a failure on the part of commissioners, managers and other health professionals in recognising the problem of UI and in acknowledging the importance of continence for older people and prevalent negative attitudes towards continence and older people. Patient assessment and continence promotion regardless of age, rather than pad provision, were identified as important steps for a good-quality service for older people with UI. More rapid and appropriate patient referral pathways, investment in service capacity, for example, more trained staff and strengthened interservice collaborations and a higher profile within medical and nurse training were specified as being important facilitators for delivering an equitable and high-quality continence service. There is a need, however, to consider the accounts given by our participants as perhaps serving the interests of their professional group within the context of interprofessional work.
   Conclusions Our data point to important barriers and facilitators of a good-quality service for older people with UI, from the perspective of continence service leads. Further research should address the views of other stakeholders, and explore options for the empirical evaluation of the effectiveness of identified service facilitators.

AB  - Background. With the rising prevalence of end-stage kidney disease worldwide, the proportion of the general community who might subsequently be called upon to consider living related kidney donation is also increasing. Knowledge about the attitudes and beliefs among the general public about living kidney donation is limited. We aimed to describe public perspectives on living kidney donation.
   Methods. Participants were recruited from three states in Australia to participate in 12 focus groups (n=113). Transcripts were analyzed thematically.
   Results. We identified six themes: expected benefits (saving and improving life, societal gain, donor satisfaction, reassurance and control), consciousness of donor risks (compromised health, lifestyle limitations, financial consequences, relationship tensions, devastation), social precariousness (fear of the unknown, exploitative connotation, recipient deservingness, protecting conscience, potential regret), upholding fairness (equal access to transplantation, reciprocity, prevent prejudice, donor safety net), decisional autonomy (body ownership, right to know, valid relationships), and assumed duty of care (facilitate informed decision-making, safeguard against coercion, ensure psychological safety, justifiable risk, objectivity, warranted disclosure).
   Conclusion. The expected benefits for recipients bolster public support for living kidney donor transplantation; however, ethical dilemmas and concerns for the donor instilled ambivalence about living donation. Protecting equity and autonomy, and an implicit trust in health professionals to protect donors and recipients mitigated some of these uncertainties. Developing interventions, practices, and policies that address community skepticism and values may promote awareness and trust in living kidney donation.

AB  - Two decades have passed since the September 11 attacks by Islamist militants that shocked the world. Despite this, Islamophobia remains a common phenomenon. In Taiwan, the 2014 12-year Basic Education Curriculum amendments emphasize cultural and global understanding as core competencies. With more than 6 years of implementation, it would be therefore interesting to learn what elementary school students think of Islam. Anchoring on the concepts of intercultural competency development, stereotypes are said to be related to cognitive knowledge, intercultural behavioral abilities, and attitudes. A survey instrument was developed and validated to collect information on stereotypes, skills in intercultural interaction, and attitudes toward Islam. Additionally, cognitive knowledge of Islam was also tested. A total of 712 students participated in the study. Structural equation modelling was used to test the mediating role of cognitive knowledge and intercultural behavioral skills within the relationship between cultural stereotypes and intercultural affects. Findings show that behavioral skills alone are not enough to diminish the negative aspects of stereotypes. Importantly, it is only with the help of cognitive knowledge that the relationship between stereotypes and intercultural affects are improved. It is hoped that by understanding the importance of proper curriculum content, more sustainable coexistence can be established.

AB  - ObjectivesWe examined the associations between treatment attitudes and beliefs with race-gender differences in antidepressant adherence.
   MethodsSubjects (n=186) were African-American and White subjects aged 60years, diagnosed with clinically significant depression, and had a new outpatient primary care recommendation for antidepressant treatment. Antidepressant adherence was assessed using the Brief Medication Questionnaire. Attitudes and beliefs were assessed using the Patients Attitudes Toward and Ratings of Care for Depression, two items rating perceived medication importance, and a modified version of the Stigma Scale for Receiving Psychological Help.
   ResultsAfrican-American men and women had significantly greater concerns about antidepressants and significantly less understanding about treatment than White women. African-American men had significantly more negative attitudes toward healthcare providers than African-American and White women. African-American women were more likely than White men and women to endorse a medication other than their antidepressant as most important. Whereas some race-gender differences were found in personal spirituality, no group differences were found in perceived stigma. In a logistic regression model adjusted for key baseline variables, White women were significantly more adherent to antidepressants than African-American women (OR=3.05, 95% CI=1.06-8.81). Fewer concerns about antidepressants and indicating the antidepressant as the most important medication were both significantly associated with adherence. After including either of these two variables, the adherence difference between White women and African-American women was no longer significant (OR=2.56, 95% CI=0.84-7.80).
   ConclusionsConcerns about antidepressants and the importance of antidepressant medication are associated with adherence and are potentially modifiable through improved patient-provider communication, psycho-education, and therapeutic interventions. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Serbia, and at least 14,000-16,000 patients experience moderate-to-severe cancer pain every year. Cancer pain relief has been impeded by inadequate availability of opioid analgesics and barriers to their accessibility. In 2006, a Serbian oncologist was selected as an International Pain Policy Fellow. The fellow identified barriers to opioid availability in Serbia and implemented an action plan to address the unavailability of oral morphine, attitudinal and knowledge barriers about opioids, and barriers in the national opioid control policy, in collaboration with the government, local partners, and international experts, including those from the World Health Organization. Collaborative efforts resulted in availability of immediate-release oral morphine, registration of controlled-release hydromorphone, and reimbursement of oral methadone for cancer pain; numerous educational activities aimed at changing inadequate knowledge and negative attitudes toward opioids; recognition of opioids as essential medicines for palliative care in a new National Palliative Care Strategy; and recognition of the medical use of opioids as psychoactive-controlled substances for the relief of pain included in a new national law on psychoactive-controlled substances, and the development of recommendations for updating regulations on prescribing and dispensing opioids. An increase in opioid consumption at the institutional and national levels also was observed. This article outlines a multifaceted approach to improving access to strong opioids for cancer pain management and palliative care in a middle-income country and offers a potential road map to success.

AB  - Objective: Many studies point to the negative impact of discrimination on the psychological and social functioning of ethnic minority persons. The realization of these studies across multiple European countries enables a systematization of this knowledge, which is our goal in the present work. Method: This study presents a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the correlates of perceived ethnic discrimination among ethnic minority persons living in European countries. Results: The analyses of 121 effect sizes reveal that discrimination is positively associated with symptoms of psychiatric disturbances, depression, psychosis, perceived stress, and externalizing behavior. Discrimination is also negatively associated with the self-esteem, positive evaluation of life, self-efficacy/mastery, well-being, and psychological adaptation of migrants. The results show that the strength of these relationships is, in some cases, moderated by persons' gender, age, and ethnicity and countries' multicultural preference and countries' rating in the Migrant Integration Policies Index (MIPEX), namely, in regard to labor market mobility, permanent residence, and antidiscrimination policies. Conclusions: The detrimental effect of discrimination on many psychosocial dimensions emphasizes the need for governmental agencies to develop systemic and concrete interventions to decrease ethnic prejudice in Europe. Moreover, the results show that fostering multiculturalism, and implementing broad antidiscrimination policies has a protective function in the face of discrimination. Enforcing the implementation of these policies can be a fundamental way to promote the psychological adjustment of ethnic minority persons.

AB  - Increasing numbers of second-generation Muslims are highly qualified and locally embedded in today's European cities. This does not protect them, however, from experiencing discrimination in intergroup encounters in school, at work, or in the street. Taking an approach from local intergroup relations between ethnic minorities and the majority society, we draw on the TIES (The Integration of the European Second Generation) surveys to compare Turkish and Moroccan minorities and majority Belgians in Antwerp, Belgium. Our research aims (1) to establish minority and majority perspectives on (reverse) personal discrimination (2) in different life domains, and (3) to differentiate internally between gender, socioeconomic attainments, and local climates. Structural equation models show minority and majority group perspectives on discrimination as gendered and situated intergroup encounters in socioeconomic and civic domains of life.

AB  - One of the challenges related to aging is ageism, age-based prejudice, stereotyping and discrimination against a particular age group, most commonly expressed against older adults. There is a general agreement that ageism is present in healthcare settings. This study intends to evaluate to what extent institutional ageism is perceived in the Portuguese healthcare system while developing an initial validation of the Portuguese version of the EVE discrimination questionnaire (EVE-D). First, the questionnaire was translated to Portuguese. Then, a sample of 500 physicians aged between 24 and 71 years old (M = 35.39; SD = 10.94), from 41 different medical specialties, responded to an online version of the Portuguese version of the EVE-D. The EVE-D showed good internal consistency (alpha = .844) and an exploratory factor analysis of the EVE-D revealed the existence of three main factors: 1. Perceived direct discrimination, with the exclusion of older adults from high-cost programs; 2. Perceived indirect discrimination, with the postponement of treatments/exams or the proposal of less complete treatments; and 3. Perceived discriminatory communication, with the infringement of the older adult's personal freedom and autonomy. Concerning the level of the perceived institutional ageism, physicians perceived higher levels of ageism in situations related to discriminatory forms of communication. Overall, our results highlight the need to rethink practices and implement measures in order to eradicate all forms of ageism in healthcare settings. Further validation studies are needed to refine this questionnaire.

AB  - Objectives Edication management is a process in which medications are selected, procured, delivered, prescribed, reviewed, administered and monitored to assure high-quality patient care and safety. This paper explores clinicians' attitudes towards medication management which is both open to influence and strongly linked to successful changes in mediation behaviour. We aimed to investigate effects of engaging in participatory action research to improve emergency medicine clinicians' attitudes to safety in medication management. Setting Emergency department of one university affiliated hospital. Participants A total of 85 clinicians including nurses and physicians partook as participants. Eight managers and clinicians participated as representatives. Design Data are drawn from two-cycle participatory action research. Initially, a situation analysis on the current medication management and clinician views regarding medication management was conducted using three focus groups. Evaluation and reflection data were obtained through qualitative interviews. All qualitative data were analysed using content analysis. Results Clinicians initially expressed negative attitudes towards existing and new plans for medication management, in that they were critical of current medication-related policy and procedures, as well as wary of the potential relevance and utility of potential changes to medication management. Through the action research, improvement actions were implemented including interprofessional courses, pharmacist-led interventions and the development of new guidelines regarding medication management. Participants and their representatives were engaged in all participatory action research stages with different levels of involvement. Extracted results from evaluation and reflection stages revealed that by engaging in the action research and practice new interventions, clinicians' attitude towards medication management was improved. Conclusions The results support the impact of participatory action research on enhancing clinicians' positive attitudes through their involvement in planning and implementing safety enhancing aspects of medication management.

AB  - In revisiting the historical circumstances leading up to the birth of satyagraha in the Transvaal in September 1906, this article seeks to place white popular protests against Asians within the same frame of analysis as Indian active nonviolence. In doing so it makes two interrelated arguments. First, I suggest that the evolution of satyagraha is better understood when examined in tandem with racial populism. Indian resistance to Transvaal laws was forged in a hostile, violent and racially charged environment. Gandhi and his followers were well aware of the power of white populism and its political influence over the Transvaal administration, and came to realise that some form of mass action of their own would be needed to counter this influence and achieve their political objectives. Second, I argue that it was the express intention of both white racial populists and the Gandhian resistance movement to exploit the competing imperial priorities of the Transvaal and British governments. The widespread agitation led by the White League and other organisations threatened the stability and authority of the colonial state; and so governors Milner and Selborne sought to appease settler opinion by enacting discriminatory legislation. However, London's and Calcutta's sensitivity to prejudice directed against British Indians in southern Africa also opened the door to anti-colonial protest, with Gandhi and his supporters generating support and sympathy in Britain and India by agitating for the repeal of unjust laws. The Transvaal administration was therefore forced to pick its way between white populists, Indian protesters, and imperial oversight and censure; and its anti-Indian policies were shaped by these contradictory pressures.

AB  - Purpose of Review Implicit bias is a fundamental contributor to widespread healthcare inequalities. This review aims to shed light on known healthcare disparities in the surgical field, to discuss the role of implicit bias in both patient care and the development of a diverse surgical workforce, and to generate discussion on how surgeons can mitigate implicit biases in order to improve patient outcomes and the future of academic surgery. Recent Findings National reports consistently demonstrate that patients in minority groups have worse care as judged by multiple quality measures when compared to non-minority peers. Provider bias is significantly associated with differences in treatment decisions, treatment adherence, and patient health outcomes. Overall, healthcare providers demonstrate more negative implicit biases toward Black/African American, Hispanic, and Native American patients compared with white patients. Controlled experiments reveal that treatment recommendations for minority patients differ significantly from those made for non-minority patients presenting with the same symptoms, and that providers implicitly associate minority patients with poor compliance and poor cooperation. Providers who belong to the same minority group as their patients are reported to have improved patient satisfaction and better quality of care by several measures. Although embracing efforts to enhance diversity in the workforce, the surgical field is still dominated by white males. The training, hiring, and promotions processes all suffer from the negative consequences of implicit bias. A more diverse surgical workforce would allow for improvements in patient care by decreasing the impact of implicit bias on patient interactions. Recognizing and proactively addressing provider-derived biases presents an opportunity to lessen the well-documented disparities in surgical care and to broadly improve outcomes. Building a more diverse surgical workforce will strengthen this effort, ultimately contributing to the advancement of surgical care for all patients.

AB  - Aims.
   To describe difficulties encountered by older widows in Taiwan and the impact of intrinsic or extrinsic religiosity on their coping strategies during early widowhood.
   Background.
   There is very limited information about how Taiwan's widows cope with their bereavement and no studies reporting the relationship between religious beliefs and healthy adjustment during this distressing period.
   Design.
   Between-method qualitative and quantitative triangulation was used. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and transcribed data were analysed by critical thematic analysis.
   Results.
   Twenty women in Taiwan, > 65 years old, (mean = 72 center dot 95) were interviewed within three years of being widowed. There were two informant groups: those with intrinsic religious beliefs and those with extrinsic religious beliefs. They all reported intrapersonal and interpersonal problems. Several major coping strategies arose: 'practising positive or negative attitudes for adaptation'; 'using person-focused actions'; and 'taking the initiative or passively seeking help from others or helping others'. Informants with intrinsic religious beliefs reported fewer coping problems by holding positive attitudes and taking multiple actions for adaptation. The extrinsic religious group had more negative adaptation attitudes, such as withdrawal and low self-esteem and practised less faith religious activities in worshipping ancestors, experiencing fatalism and using divination. They reported more coping problems than the intrinsic religious group.
   Conclusion.
   Widows in Taiwan have different coping problems and strategies in postbereavement adjustment, affected by their different religious beliefs systems. More research is required to establish the generalisabilty of these findings.
   Relevance to clinical practice.
   Widows in Taiwan need to be assessed for their religious belief systems and how this affects their ability to cope during bereavement. Clinicians should actively provide grief support and encourage new methods of social adaptation, especially with widows with extrinsic religious beliefs who may have less self-esteem and negative adaptation behaviours.

AB  - Introduction: Little is known about patients' perceptions of electronic inhaler reminders, which have emerged in recent years as adherence promotion aids. This study explored asthma patients' attitudes toward the acceptability and utility of inhaler reminders.
   Methods: Participants from a 6-month cluster randomized controlled trial who received reminders for missed doses via SmartTrack adherence monitors (Adherium Ltd) were interviewed to explore their perceptions; interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically.
   Results: 18 participants (50% male, mean age 39 years [range 17-681) were interviewed. Three themes were identified. Acceptability and Feasibility: Interviewees found the monitor easy to use. For some, concerns about the monitor itself affected adherence, e.g. leaving it at home to avoid breakage. Positive features included that reminders played only for missed doses, and the choice of reminder tunes. Utility and Behavioural Impact: Interviewees described reminders as an effective "training" tool for adherence, encouraging habit-formation, behaviour change and attitude change. Reminders were considered less acceptable or useful by participants who preferred taking medication only when symptomatic or who doubted the necessity or safety of their medication. Sustainability: Some interviewees reported sustained behaviour change, supported by reminders, through the establishment of routine or via experiential learning that good adherence improved their asthma. Other interviewees wanted ongoing support (i.e. reminders or substitute adherence cues) after study end.
   Conclusion: Patients with asthma found 6-months' use of reminders and adherence feedback acceptable and useful for improving their adherence attitudes, adherence behaviours and confidence in asthma self management. Some patients may benefit from ongoing adherence support. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective To gain exploratory insights into the multifaceted, lived experience impact of COVID-19 on a small sample of ethnic minority healthcare staff to cocreate a module of questions for follow-up online surveys on the well-being of healthcare staff during the pandemic. Design A cross-sectional design using two online focus groups among ethnic minority healthcare workers who worked in care or supportive roles in a hospital, community health or primary care setting for at least 12 months. Participants Thirteen healthcare workers (11 female) aged 26-62 years from diverse ethnic minority backgrounds, 11 working in clinical roles. Results Five primary thematic domains emerged: (1) viral vulnerability, centring around perceived individual risk and vulnerability perceptions; (2) risk assessment, comprising pressures to comply, perception of a tick-box exercise and issues with risk and resource stratification; (3) interpersonal relations in the workplace, highlighting deficient consultation of ethnic minority staff, cultural insensitivity, need for support and collegiate judgement; (4) lived experience of racial inequality, consisting of job insecurity and the exacerbation of systemic racism and its emotional burden; (5) community attitudes, including public prejudice and judgement, and patient appreciation. Conclusions Our novel study has shown ethnic minority National Health Service (NHS) staff have experienced COVID-19 in a complex, multidimensional manner. Future research with a larger sample should further examine the complexity of these experiences and should enumerate the extent to which these varied thematic experiences are shared among ethnic minority NHS workers so that more empathetic and supportive management and related occupational practices can be instituted.

AB  - Background: In Uganda, perinatal mortality is 38 per 1000 pregnancies. One-third of these deaths are due to birth asphyxia. Adequate fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring during labor may detect birth asphyxia but little is known about monitoring practices in low resource settings. Objective: To explore FHR monitoring practices among health workers at a public hospital in Northern Uganda. Methods: A sequential explanatory mixed methods study was conducted by reviewing 251 maternal records and conducting 11 interviews and two focus group discussions with health workers complemented by observations of 42 women in labor until delivery. Quantitative data were summarized using frequencies and percentages. Content analysis was used for qualitative data. Results: FHR was assessed in 235/251 (93.6%) of records at admission. Health workers documented the FHR at least once in 175/228 (76.8%) of cases during the first stage of labor compared to observed 17/25 (68.0%) cases. Median intervals between FHR monitoring were 30 (IQR 30-120) minutes in patients' records versus 139 (IQR 87-662) minutes according to observations. Observations suggested no monitoring of FHR during the second stage of labor but records indicated monitoring in 3.2% of cases. Reported barriers to adequate FHR monitoring were inadequate number of staff and monitoring devices, institutional challenges such as few beds, documentation problems and perceived non-compliant women not reporting for repeated checks during the first stage of labor. Health workers demonstrated knowledge of national FHR monitoring guidelines and acknowledged that practice was different. Conclusions: When compared to national and international guidelines, FHR monitoring is sub-optimal in the studied setting. Approximately one in four women was not monitored during the first stage of labor. Barriers to appropriate FHR monitoring included shortage of staff and devices, institutional challenges and mother's negative attitudes. These barriers need to be addressed in order to reduce neonatal mortality.

AB  - Background Trans and gender-diverse people face multiple barriers within health care. Primary care practitioners are key to providing health care to trans and gender-diverse people but they often lack training in, and understanding of, trans identities and healthcare options. Few studies have examined health professionals' understanding of the barriers that exist in health care for trans and gender-diverse people. Aim To map out barriers to providing good-quality health care to trans and gender-diverse people, and explore ways to address them. Design and setting A qualitative interview study involving 20 health professionals working with young trans and gender-diverse people. Method Participants were recruited through purposive and snowball sampling. Data were generated using semi-structured qualitative interviews. A thematic analysis involved coding and categorising data using NVivo (version 12) software and further conceptual analysis in which developing themes were identified. Results Four barrier domains to good-quality care for trans and gender-diverse people were identified: structural (related to lack of guidelines, long waiting times, and shortage of specialist centres); educational (based on lack of training on trans health); cultural and social (reflecting negative attitudes towards trans people); and technical (related to information systems and technology). Conclusion There is an urgent need to address the barriers trans and gender-diverse people face in health care. Structural-level solutions include health policy, professional education, and standards; at the practice level, GPs can act as potential drivers of change in addressing the cultural and technical barriers to better meet the needs of their trans and gender-diverse patients.

AB  - This study examined whether killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor by current or former law enforcement officers in 2020 were followed by shifts in public sentiment toward Black people. Methods: Google searches for the names "Ahmaud Arbery," "Breonna Taylor," and "George Floyd" were obtained from the Google Health Application Programming Interface (API). Using the Twitter API, we collected a 1% random sample of publicly available U.S. race-related tweets from November 2019-September 2020 (N = 3,380,616). Sentiment analysis was performed using Support Vector Machines, a supervised machine learning model. A qualitative content analysis was conducted on a random sample of 3,000 tweets to understand themes in discussions of race and racism and inform interpretation of the quantitative trends. Results: The highest rate of Google searches for any of the three names was for George Floyd during the week of May 31 to June 6, the week after his murder. The percent of tweets referencing Black people that were negative decreased by 32% (from 49.33% in November 4-9 to 33.66% in June 1-7) (p < 0.001), but this decline was temporary, lasting just a few weeks. Themes that emerged during the content analysis included discussion of race or racism in positive (14%) or negative (38%) tones, call for action related to racism (18%), and counter movement/arguments against racism-related changes (6%). Conclusion: Although there was a sharp decline in negative Black sentiment and increased public awareness of structural racism and desire for long-lasting social change, these shifts were transitory and returned to baseline after several weeks. Findings suggest that negative attitudes towards Black people remain deeply entrenched.

AB  - There are no published abattoir bovine hepatic lesion prevalence studies in cattle in Rwanda. This study estimated that 12.3% of the livers (n = 4751) examined at Nyabugogo slaughterhouse in Kigali were condemned. Condemnation prejudiced the nation of 3492.00 kg of meat with attendant economic losses of US$8932.40 during the study period. Risk factors for these lesions were also assessed. Male and female animals from 11 districts were used in this study. Hepatic lesions were higher in females (14.6%; n = 1494) than in males (11.1%; n = 3257). About 78.7% of the condemnations were due to fascioliasis, followed by abscesses (5.7%), hepatitis (5.3%), cirrhosis (4%) and other lesions (6.3%). Female animal livers showed more fascioliasis and abscesses (82.2% and 9.5%) than male animal livers (73.3% and 3.3%). The highest rate of condemnation was observed from Kayonza (40.2%; n = 413) and the least was from Gakenke district (0.9%; n = 1031). Cattle from the Eastern Province showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher prevalence of condemnations (26.8%) than the rest of the provinces. Liver specimens of animals below 3 years and above 6 years of age had a significantly higher (P < 0.05) condemnation rate (14.4%) (n = 3000 and n = 769) than the 3-6 year age-group at 4.1% (n = 982). We conclude that fascioliasis was responsible for a significant proportion of the liver condemnations at Nyabugogo slaughterhouse. Being a zoonosis, we recommend an epidemio-surveillance, implementation of control measures and anthelmintic resistance investigation for fascioliasis in Rwanda. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Stigma and discrimination experienced by nurses infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) potentially undermine their positions. The aim of this study was to determine the factors associated with nurses' attitudes towards accepting co-workers with HIV, HBV, or HCV. The study design was descriptive and cross-sectional. Four hundred Vietnamese nurses participated in this study using stratified random sampling at two public hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam. A self-administrated questionnaire was used to obtain data. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression was performed to analyze data. Nine percent of nurses had experienced a needle-stick or sharps injury (NSI) from a patient infected with HIV, and 15.8% of respondents reported having a previous NSI from a patient infected with HBV or HCV. Some nurses reported that they could not accept contact between patients and nurses infected with HIV (25.2%) and HBV or HCV (12.7%). Older age and a belief that colleagues should disclose their infection status were associated with positive attitudes towards HIV-, HBV-, or HCV-positive colleagues. Fear of transmission was associated with negative attitudes towards HIV-positive co-workers. Infected employees disclosure of their status may help their colleagues to be more accepting by providing appropriate workplace adjustments for infected employees. HIV is generally a more stigmatized infection, and therefore attitudes towards HIV-positive co-workers might be affected by fear of transmission. Providing education to recognize infectious risk may be effective in improving nurses' attitudes in Vietnam, as elsewhere.

AB  - Background: The context of the study is the increased assessment and treatment of persons with mental illness in general hospital settings by general health staff, as the move away from mental hospitals gathers pace in low and middle income countries. The purpose of the study was to examine whether general attitudes of hospital staff towards persons with mental illness, and extent of mental health training and clinical experience, are associated with different attitudes and behaviours towards a patient with mental illness than towards a patients with a general health problem - diabetes.
   Methods: General hospital health professionals in Malaysia were randomly allocated one of two vignettes, one describing a patient with mental illness and the other a patient with diabetes, and invited to complete a questionnaire examining attitudes and health care practices in relation to the case. The questionnaires completed by respondents included questions on demographics, training in mental health, exposure in clinical practice to people with mental illness, attitudes and expected health care behaviour towards the patient in the vignette, and a general questionnaire exploring negative attitudes towards people with mental illness. Questionnaires with complete responses were received from 654 study participants.
   Results: Stigmatising attitudes towards persons with mental illness were common. Those responding to the mental illness vignette (N = 356) gave significantly lower ratings on care and support and higher ratings on avoidance and negative stereotype expectations compared with those responding the diabetes vignette (N = 298).
   Conclusions: Results support the view that, in the Malaysian setting, patients with mental illness may receive differential care from general hospital staff and that general stigmatising attitudes among professionals may influence their care practices. More direct measurement of clinician behaviours than able to be implemented through survey method is required to support these conclusions.

AB  - Background: The Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool (CSNAT) intervention is an evidence-based, person-centered approach to carer assessment and support within palliative care. As such, it requires a change in practice from a practitioner- to a carer-led assessment and support process. A paucity of research has investigated factors affecting implementation of evidence-based interventions within palliative care.
   Objective: To examine differences between high and low adopters of the CSNAT intervention in terms of practitioner attitudes to the intervention and organizational context.
   Methods: Phase IV study of the implementation of the CSNAT intervention at scale in 36 UK palliative care services over 6months. Survey at baseline and 6months of practitioners at implementation sites, informed by the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) Framework. Survey tools: (a) questionnaire to assess attitudes to the CSNAT intervention; (b) Alberta Context Tool (ACT) to assess organizational context. Monthly data on intervention use enabled service classification as "high" or "low" adopters.
   Results: Surveys returned at baseline were 157/462 and at 6 months were 69/462. Compared with low adoption services, high adopters were more likely to be hospice, at home, and day services; have a higher ratio of internal facilitators to total staff numbers; and higher scores for ACT "informal interactions" denoting more discussions about care between colleagues. Both had similarly positive attitudes to the CSNAT intervention pre-implementation, but by 6months low adoption services developed significantly more negative attitudes, while high adoption services attitudes mostly remained the same or improved.
   Linking Evidence to Action: Implementation may be more successful for services that offer regular opportunities to use the intervention in practice, have sufficient levels of facilitators, stimulate more staff discussion, and encourage maintenance of positive motivation. Implementation of person-centered interventions needs to plan for such factors. This has informed an implementation toolkit for the CSNAT intervention.

AB  - Local attitudes towards wildlife species are key for the coexistence between humans and wildlife. To assess how economic, social, and psychological factors affect human perception of wildlife species we conducted questionnaire surveys in two ecologically and culturally distinct rural areas of Northern Tanzania (Mbulu Plateau highlands and Rift Valley lowlands). Using responses of 356 individuals we determined local preferences for population sizes of 31 wildlife species. For five of these species or species groups (rodents, hyena, birds of prey, African elephant, jackal), more than 30% of participants desired a population decline. To investigate correlates for desired population reductions of these species, we ran species specific (five listed species and African lion) and study area-specific generalized linear mixed models that accounted for spatial autocorrelation. Using these models we assessed relationships between the likelihood of respondents desiring a population decline and six hypothesized explanatory variables: gender; age; ethnicity, and wealth of participant; perceived frequency of negative interactions with; and fear of each species. In both the highland and lowland and for all species, participants that perceived higher instances of negative interactions with wildlife were more likely to prefer smaller future populations, but relationships between perceived frequency of negative interactions and attitudes were often nonlinear. People who feared a species were also more likely to desire a population decline. Other variables (gender, age, ethnicity, wealth) showed species- and area-level variations, and we observed substantial spatial variation in expressed attitudes towards species. Thus, negative attitudes towards wildlife appear to be mainly associated with past (negative) experiences and fear, but not necessarily with associated costs or socio-demographic variables. To ensure coexistence between wildlife and humans, we suggest (1) wildlife damage prevention through technical measures and (2) educational initiatives to increase positive attitudes towards wildlife.

AB  - The impacts of this pandemic have not been felt equally. The current pandemic has aggravated preexisting prejudices and shed light on long-standing social, economic, and health inequities that have been and continue to be perpetuated by systems of oppression. Psychologists are in a unique position to collaboratively work with marginalized individuals navigating pandemic threat, discrimination, and oppressive systems. This paper presents best practice recommendations for U.S.-based psychologists working with marginalized populations impacted by COVID-19. Psychologists are encouraged to synchronously develop the following three areas of evidence-based practice, as they relate to the impacts of COVID-19: (a) self-reflection and self-awareness in a COVID-19 context (i.e., reflecting on one's identities and one's knowledge and attitudes toward sociohistorical inequities), (b) knowledge acquisition (i.e., adopting an attitude of cultural humility, identifying "emotional contagion," identifying impacts of systemic injustice that may be compounded by COVID-19, and recognizing racial trauma in clients of color), and (c) collaboration with clients (i.e., identify the mental health toll of oppressive systems, explore COVID-19 relevant and culturally responsive methods of healing, encourage virtual community engagement, and incorporate ethnic and racial identity development in personal and professional work). Engaging with these best practice recommendations should result in the psychologist's improved ability to identify and address the consequences of systemic oppression that have been highlighted and exacerbated by COVID-19 on their own behavior and their clients' mental health. Furthermore, psychologists engaged with these best practice recommendations should find themselves better prepared to utilize culturally responsive interventions despite barriers created by COVID-19.

AB  - Studies have indicated that social stigma related to podoconiosis (endemic non-filarial elephantiasis) has a major impact on the psychosocial wellbeing of patients. However, little effort has been made so far to quantify the level of both felt and enacted stigma in a range of domains of life. We used a recently developed podoconiosis stigma assessment scale to measure levels of stigma as recalled over the previous 12 months. One hundred and fifty patients with podoconiosis rated the levels of stigma they perceived and experienced in 'interpersonal interactions', 'major life areas' and 'community, social and civic life'. High levels of stigma were observed on both felt and enacted stigma scales. The overall average stigma score was 40.7 (range 0 to 96). Enacted stigma was scored higher than felt stigma (mean score 21.2 vs. 19.5, respectively). The mean enacted stigma score was higher in 'major life areas', and 'community, social and civic life' than 'interpersonal interactions', while felt stigma was experienced most at the interpersonal level. Over half of patients reported that they had considered suicide in response to discrimination and prejudice, particularly in interpersonal interactions. Forced divorce, dissolution of marriage plan, insults and exclusion at social events were some of the most commonly mentioned forms of enacted stigma reported by affected individuals. Scores for overall level of stigma and enacted stigma increased significantly with stage of podoconiosis while the association observed in relation to felt stigma was only marginally significant (p = 0.085). Appropriate stigma reduction strategies must be identified and implemented in communities highly endemic for podoconiosis.

AB  - Background: Migrant populations are at high risk of Human Immuno Deficiency Virus infection (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Studies of HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudes and practices among fishermen in developing countries have shown gaps in knowledge and fear of contagion with ambivalent attitudes towards HIV/AIDS and inconsistent universal precautions adherence. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge, attitude and practices regarding HIV/AIDS among adult fishermen in a coastal area of Karachi, Pakistan.
   Methods: Community based cross sectional study was conducted among fishermen in coastal area of Karachi from June to September 2012. A total of 297 adult fishermen were selected by using simple random sampling technique from different sectors of coastal village. Data were collected using a structured validated questionnaire. The frequency distribution of both dependent and independent variables were worked out. Comparisons of knowledge, attitude and practices regarding HIV/AIDS by socio-demographic characteristics were made using logistic regression.
   Results: Out of 297 fishermen, majority had in-appropriate knowledge (93.6%), negative attitude (75.8%) and less adherent sexual practices (91.6%). In univariate analysis, lower education and higher income were significantly associated (OR 2.25, 95% CI, 1.11, 4.55), (OR = 3.04 CI 1.03-9.02, p value 0.04) with negative attitude and un-safe practices towards HIV/AIDS respectively, whereas no significant association of socio-economic characteristics with knowledge, attitude and practices were observed in multivariate analysis.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that fishermen had very poor knowledge, negative attitudes towards HIV and AIDS and had unsafe sexual practices which suggest that they lack the basic understanding of HIV/AIDS infection. Extensive health education campaign should be provided to the vulnerable sections of the society for the control of HIV/AIDS.

AB  - Background: Health professionals from high-income countries are increasingly becoming involved in international service-learning trips in low and low/middle-income countries. While much has been written about the ethics and curricular guidelines related to such endeavors, scant attention has been paid to the attitudes with which trainees and clinicians enter into or return from them. In this essay the authors explore how attitudes contribute to the success or failure of international service-learning trips.
   Discussion: The authors submit that the attitudes with which visiting health professionals approach international service-learning trips are much more critical to the success of these experiences than their demonstrated knowledge base or specialized skill sets. They list five attitudes that can aid those participating in international service-learning trips. They list five troubling attitudes that, while common, those participating in international service-learning trips can learn to recognize and avoid. They suggest five strategies key to learning respectful attitudes that can foster success in such cross-cultural activities. Lastly, the authors review several concepts related to attitude development in short or long-term global health work.
   Summary: The attitudes with which visiting health professionals approach international service-learning activities can be important components of the success or failure of the experiences. Through thoughtful consideration of attitudes and approaches, participants on such trips can build a framework for rich and rewarding experiences in global medicine and global health.

AB  - This study proposed a path model linking boyhood gender nonconformity and parental disapproval of self-expression to public self-consciousness, attempts to cover or down-play the visibility and relevance of one's sexual minority identity, and anxious affect in the daily lives of young gay male college students (mean age = 20.56, SD = 2.13). To establish the relevance of boyhood gender nonconformity and parental disapproval of self-expression in gay men's lives, gay participants' (n = 136) scores on these variables were first compared with the scores of a similar sample of young heterosexual men (n = 56) and then linked to reports of public self-consciousness, covering, and anxious affect measured over the course of nine days. As hypothesized, gay men reported experiencing these developmental stressors to a higher degree than their heterosexual peers. The best fitting path model in the sample of gay men established the mediating role of daily public self-consciousness and sexual orientation covering in the relationship between parental disapproval of self-expression and daily anxiety. This final model connects etiological models of anxiety to the developmental stressors faced by some gay men. The results suggest routes through which gay-related stress may begin earlier in development than commonly assumed, while continuing to impact gay men's open self-expression, and ultimately their experience of anxiety, into young adulthood. Public self-consciousness and sexual orientation covering are discussed as psychotherapeutic targets to address in order to alleviate anxious symptoms among young gay men.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Negative attitudes toward vaginal delivery are an important reason for pregnant women to undergo a cesarean section. Therefore, this study was performed to evaluate the effect of motivational interviewing on attitude and choice of primigravida women on type of delivery in requesting elective cesarean section. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-blind clinical trial, 120 primigravida women in 28-31 weeks of gestation with normal pregnancy determined by a multistage sampling were randomly chosen from ten health centers of Zahedan city in 2019 and were divided into two groups. Motivational interviewing was performed in four sessions within 90 min in the experimental group, and the control group received routine care service. Attitude (before and 1 month after the intervention) and performance (after delivery) were evaluated using a valid and reliable researcher-made questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed using different proportions, paired t-test, independent t-test, covariance analysis, and Shapiro-Wilk and the Chi-square methods. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the attitude of participants between the two groups after the intervention (P = 0.001). The mean difference of pre- and posttest was significant in relation to attitude scores in the two groups (P = 0.001), and the difference between the two groups was also statistically significant between the two groups in terms of delivery type (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: We conclude that motivational interviewing can be a useful tool to change the attitude and decrease the rate of unnecessary cesarean among pregnant women. It is recommended to examine the impact of this method on women from different societies who have various educational backgrounds and cultures.

AB  - Background: It is important that health workers understand intimate partner violence (IPV) and its link with ill health. Increasing their awareness will help them play a stronger role in identifying survivors and providing appropriate health care. We assessed the knowledge and attitude of health workers towards IPV survivors taking into account their professional roles.
   Methods: Data was collected in 2018 in 12 health centers and 55 health posts located in 3 districts of the former Sidama zone using a self-administered questionnaire. The main outcome variable was proportion of wrong responses of the knowledge questions. We also calculated scores from the 10 knowledge questions and 10 Likert items of attitude. Proportions of wrong responses were compared between health post and health center staff. Mean knowledge score was compared using an independent samples t-test and a one-way analysis of variance. A Tukey's honestly significant difference test was performed to determine significant analysis of variance results.
   Results: There were 139 participants. Most (78%) of them were females. Nurses and midwives accounted for 54% of the total. Few (13%) of the participants had received previous training regarding IPV. More than half of the participants were not confident about how to care for women exposed to IPV. "Wrong responses" (incorrect or "don't know") ranged from 5.8% to 30.9%. The mean knowledge score was higher for women older than 30 years (p = 0.03). Negative attitudes ranged from 4 to 47%. One-third of the participants believed that they could not suspect IPV unless they saw physical injuries. More knowledge about IPV was associated with better attitude scores.
   Conclusion: Around half of the health workers felt unprepared to provide care to IPV survivors, and a third would not consider IPV unless they saw physical evidence. Increasing knowledge may improve attitudes and support for IPV survivors.

AB  - Background: To explore university students' Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) testing knowledge, psychosocial and demographic predictors of past STI testing behaviour, intentions to have an STI test, and high risk sexual behaviour, to inform interventions promoting STI testing in this population.
   Methods: A cross-sectional, quantitative online survey was conducted in March 2016, recruiting university students from North East Scotland via an all-student email. The anonymous questionnaire assessed student demographics (e.g. sex, ethnicity, age), STI testing behaviours, sexual risk behaviours, knowledge and five psychological constructs thought to be predictive of STI testing from theory and past research: attitudes, perceived susceptibility to STIs, social norms, social fear and self-efficacy.
   Results: The sample contained 1294 sexually active students (response rate 10%) aged 18-63, mean age = 23.61 (SD 6.39), 888 (69%) were female. Amongst participants, knowledge of STIs and testing was relatively high, and students held generally favourable attitudes. 52% reported ever having an STI test, 13% intended to have one in the next month; 16% reported unprotected sex with more than one 'casual' partner in the last six months. Being female, older, a postgraduate, longer UK residence, STI knowledge, perceived susceptibility, subjective norms, attitudes and self-efficacy all positively predicted past STI testing behaviour (p < 0.01). Perceived susceptibility to STIs and social norms positively predicted intentions to have an STI test in the next month (p < 0.05); perceived susceptibility also predicted past high-risk sexual behaviour (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Several psychosocial predictors of past STI testing, of high-risk sexual behaviour and future STI intentions were identified. Health promotion STI testing interventions could focus on male students and target knowledge, attitude change, and increasing perceived susceptibility to STIs, social norms and self-efficacy towards STI-testing.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The use of plant species for different therapeutic/medicinal purposes is well-entrenched in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Aim of the review: To provide a critical and updated review of the enormous medicinal plant heritage in sub-Saharan Africa with regards to the abundance, importance, conservation status and potential means to help sustain their availability for future generations.
   Methods: A comprehensive literature search involving different online databases, books and theses were conducted in order to obtain, collate and synthesize available information on various fundamental aspects pertaining to African medicinal plants.
   Results: African biodiversity hotspots are endowed with a high level of endemic species with a significant portion possessing medicinal value. Apart from the extensive ethnobotanical uses of medicinal plants found in Africa, scientific validation of their biological potential such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic properties have been recognized. Together with the demand arising from their biological efficacies, other anthropogenic factors are exerting conservation strains of the wild population of these medicinal plants. Even though researchers have acknowledged the importance and value of conserving these medicinal plants, several challenges have hampered these efforts on the Continent as a whole.
   Conclusions: The rich flora occurring in sub-Saharan Africa suggests enormous potential for discovery of new chemical entity with therapeutic value. However, concerted efforts focused on documenting the conservation status of African medicinal plants are pertinent. Application of different biotechnological techniques is needed to sustain these valuable botanical entities, especially to meet increasing pharmaceutical demand. Most importantly, increased public enlightenment and awareness may help eradicate the prejudice against cultivation of medicinal plants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Freezing of liquid water occurs in many natural phenomena and affects countless human activities. The freezing process mainly involves ice nucleation and continuous growth, which are determined by the energy and structure fluctuation in supercooled water. Herein, considering the surface hydrophilicity and crystal structure differences between metal and graphene, we proposed a kind of surface configuration design, which was realized by graphene nanosheets being alternately anchored on a metal substrate. Ice nucleation and growth were investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. The surface configuration could induce ice nucleation to occur preferentially on the metal substrate where the surface hydrophilicity was higher than the lateral graphene nanosheet. However, ice nucleation could be delayed to a certain extent under the hindering effect of the interfacial water layer formed by the high surface hydrophilicity of the metal substrate. Furthermore, the graphene nanosheets restricted lateral expansion of the ice nucleus at the clearance, leading to the formation of a curved surface of the ice nucleus as it grew. As a result, ice growth was suppressed effectively due to the Gibbs-Thomson effect, and the growth rate decreased by 71.08% compared to the pure metal surface. Meanwhile, boundary misorientation between ice crystals was an important issue, which also prejudiced the growth of the ice crystal. The present results reveal the microscopic details of ice nucleation and growth inhibition of the special surface configuration and provide guidelines for the rational design of an anti-icing surface.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Burnout, a syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a decreased sense of efficacy, is common among resident physicians, and negative emotional states may increase the expression of prejudices, which are associated with racial disparities in health care. Whether racial bias varies by symptoms of burnout among resident physicians is unknown.
   OBJECTIVE To assess the association between burnout and explicit and implicit racial biases toward black people in resident physicians.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study obtained data from surveys completed by first-year medical students and resident physicians in the United States as part of the Cognitive Habits and Growth Evaluation Study. Participants were followed up from enrollment in 2010 to 2011 through 2017. Participants completed questionnaires at year 4 of medical school as well as at the second and third years of residency. Only data from resident physicians who self-identified as belonging to a racial group other than black (n = 3392) were included in the analyses because of scarce evidence of racial bias in the care provided to black patients by black physicians. Resident physicians training in radiology or pathology were excluded because they provided less direct patient interaction.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Burnout symptoms were measured by 2 single-item measures from the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Explicit attitudes about white and black people were measured by a feeling thermometer (FT, from 0 to 100 points, ranging from very cold or unfavorable [lowest score] to very warm or favorable [highest score]; included in the second-year [R2] and third-year [R3] questionnaires). The R2 Questionnaire included a racial Implicit Association Test (IAT; range: -2 to 2).
   RESULTS Among the 3392 nonblack resident physician respondents, 1693 (49.9%) were male, 1964 (57.9%) were younger than 30 years, and 2362 (69.6%) self-identified as belonging to the white race. In this cohort, 1529 of 3380 resident physicians (45.2%) had symptoms of burnout and 1394 of 3377 resident physicians (41.3%) had depression. From this group, 12 did not complete the burnout items and 15 did not complete the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) items. The mean (SD) FT score toward black people was 77.9 (21.0) and toward white people was 81.1 (20.1), and the mean (SD) racial IAT score was 0.4 (0.4). Burnout at the R2 Questionnaire time point was associated with greater explicit and implicit racial biases. In multivariable analyses adjusting for demographics, specialty, depression, and FT scores toward white people, resident physicians with burnout had greater explicit racial bias (difference in FT score, -2.40; 95% CI, -3.42 to -1.37; P <.001) and implicit racial bias (difference in IAT score, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.02-0.08; P =.002). A dose-response association was found between change in depersonalization from R2 to R3 Questionnaire and R3 Questionnaire explicit bias (for each 1-point increase the difference in R3 FT score decreased, -0.73; 95% CI, -1.23 to -0.23; P =.004) and change in explicit bias.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among resident physicians, symptoms of burnout appeared to be associated with greater explicit and implicit racial biases; given the high prevalence of burnout and the negative implications of bias for medical care, symptoms of burnout may be factors in racial disparities in health care.

AB  - The 2007-2008 French National Travel Survey (FNTS) included questions about the trip experience for a random subsample of the respondents' daily travel, offering a rare opportunity to examine a national profile of attitudes toward travel. This study analyzes the self-reported (mental and/or physical) fatigue associated with the selected trip, and its (un)pleasantness. Only 8 % of trips were tiring, and fewer than 4 % were unpleasant, indicating that travel is by no means universally distasteful. We present a bivariate probit model of the mental and physical fatigue associated with the trip, and binary logit models of whether the trip was pleasant (yes/no) or unpleasant (yes/no). For the most part, socioeconomic variables and indicators of trip length, distance, purpose, and mode have logical relationships to fatigue and pleasantness. However, 11 variables out of 31 common to both sets of models have impacts on fatigue that are opposite to those on un/pleasantness, pointing to conditions under which a trip can be fatiguing but pleasant, or conversely. Accordingly, a key contribution of the research is to demonstrate the value of jointly considering both constructs in order to more comprehensively capture the overall attitudes toward the travelling activity. It is also of interest that activities conducted during the trip appear in both sets of models. In particular, the results suggest that although listening to the radio/music decreases the tendency to rate the trip as mentally fatiguing, it tends to be seen as ameliorating the disutility of a tedious trip more than increasing the pleasantness of the trip. Among the policy-relevant findings, we note the especially negative attitudes towards multimodal trips and trips mainly involving driving cars.

AB  - Background It has been recommended that critically ill patients start mobilization as early as possible. However, the clinical utilization rate of early mobilization remains low in the intensive care unit (ICU), and respiratory therapists and nurses are the primary practitioners of early mobilization in China.
   Aim The aim of this study is to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and perceived barriers of ICU nurses regarding the early mobilization of ICU patients.
   Design A descriptive and cross-sectional design was used.
   Methods A cross-sectional design was used, with an e-questionnaire for ICU nurses (n = 227) to assess knowledge and attitudes regarding early mobilization via the "Tencent WeChat" app on their smart phones.
   Results As the primary implementers of the early mobilization of ICU patients in China, more than half of ICU nurses passed the knowledge test (scored >= 20/25 points) and had positive attitudes (scored 45/55 points) regarding early mobilization. Nurses had good knowledge (more than 96.5%) of the benefits and stopping indications of early mobilization; however, they had a poor understanding (less than 51.1%) of the population in which early mobilization is applicable and monitoring indicators during early mobilization, and 39.2% of nurses did not support routine implementation of early mobilization for patients in the ICU. The major barriers that they perceived were very heavy workload (76.8%), insufficient equipment and devices (50.2%), lack of written protocols or guidelines (50.2%), inadequate training (47.1%), potential work risks (42.3%), and limited staffing (41.4%).
   Conclusions Although over half of ICU nurses exhibited relatively comprehensive knowledge of and positive attitudes to early mobilization, some misunderstandings, negativity, and barriers remain.
   Relevance to clinical practice Training programmes should be conducted continuously, especially focused on common misunderstandings and negative attitudes. Organizational support is required to overcome barriers to the implementation of early mobilization.

AB  - Female genital mutilation (FGM) is still a common practice in many countries in Africa and the Middle East. Understanding the determinants of FGM can lead to more active interventions to prevent this harmful practice. The goal of this study is to explore factors associated with FGM behavior among Iranian mothers and their daughters. Based on Ajzen's theory of planned behavior, we examined the predictive value of attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and several socio-demographic variables in relation to mothers' intentions to mutilate their daughters. A paper-and-pencil survey was conducted among 300 mothers (mean age = 33.20, SD = 9.09) who had at least one daughter and who lived in Ravansar, a county in Kermanshah Province in Iran. Structural equation modeling was used to investigate the relationships among the study variables. Our results indicate that attitude is the strongest predictor of mothers' intentions to allow their daughters to undergo FGM, followed by subjective norms. Compared to younger mothers, older mothers have more positive attitudes toward FGM, perceive themselves as having more control over their behavior and demonstrate a greater intention to allow their daughter to undergo FGM. Furthermore, we found that less educated mothers and mothers living in rural areas had more positive attitudes toward FGM and feel more social pressure to allow FGM. The model accounts for 93 percent of the variance in the mothers' intentions to allow their daughters to undergo FGM. Intervention programs that want to decrease FGM might focus primarily on converting mothers' neutral or positive feelings toward FGM into negative attitudes and on alleviating the perceived social pressure to mutilate one's daughter. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations about how to curtail mothers' intentions to allow their daughters to undergo FGM.

AB  - The current research presents an overall performance-based analysis of Trihexyltetradecylphosphonium Chloride [[CH3-(CH2)5]P(Cl)(CH2)13CH3] ionic fluid mixed with organic coconut oil (OCO) during turning of hardened D2 steel. The application of cutting fluid on the cutting interface was performed through Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL) approach keeping an eye on the detrimental consequences of conventional flood cooling. PVD coated (TiN/TiCN/TiN) cermet tool was employed in the current experimental work. Taguchi's L9 orthogonal array and TOPSIS are executed to analysis the influences, significance and optimum parameter settings for predefined process parameters. The prime objective of the current work is to analyse the influence of OCO based Trihexyltetradecylphosphonium Chloride ionic fluid on flank wear, surface roughness, material removal rate, and chip morphology. Better quality of finish (Ra=0.2 to 1.82 mu m) was found with 1% weight fraction but it is not sufficient to control the wear growth. Abrasion, chipping, groove wear, and catastrophic tool tip breakage are recognized as foremost tool failure mechanisms. The significance of responses have been studied with the help of probability plots, main effect plots, contour plots, and surface plots and the correlation between the input and output parameters have been analysed using regression model. Feed rate and depth of cut are equally influenced (48.98%) the surface finish while cutting speed attributed the strongest influence (90.1%). The material removal rate is strongly prejudiced by cutting speed (69.39%) followed by feed rate (28.94%) whereas chip reduction coefficient is strongly influenced through the depth of cut (63.4%) succeeded by feed (28.8%). TOPSIS significantly optimised the responses with 67.1% gain in closeness coefficient.

AB  - The fish can be driven by the sarcomere at different locations of the body. To study the hydrodynamic performance of the fish in this process, the self-propulsion of a composite plate driving on two points was investigated. It is supposed that the forces were exerted on the junction point to maintain a given pitch motion of the rigid portion, and an additional external moment was exerted at a point on the flexible plate. The ratio between the lengths of the rigid portion and the flexible portion was fixed as 1/9, which was reasonable for a real fish. The acting point and phase angle of the additional external moment was varying to study the cooperation of the forces on different points. It was found that the additional external moment was not always promoting the propulsion velocity and efficiency of the composite plate. The additional external moment near the joint point was most suitable for improve the propulsive velocity and efficiency of the composite plate. The anti-phase additional external moment was prejudicing the propulsion of the plate. The additional external moment could change the vibration shape of the flexible plate and the flow structure around it. As phi = pi, the amplitude and the gradient of the deformation was largely reduced, and the wake became long and narrow. The hydrodynamic forces at the head and tail portion of the flexible plate were hindering the propulsion of the plate, while the thrust was mainly produced on the intermediate portion. It was expected that our investigation can be helpful for the design of the soft robotic fish.

AB  - One key factor that appears to be crucial in the rejection of quarantines, isolation and other social controls during epidemic outbreaks is trust-or rather distrust. Much like news reporting and social media, popular culture such as fictional novels, television shows and films can influence people's trust, especially given that the information provided about an epidemic disease is sometimes seen as grounded in 'scientific fact' by societies. As well as providing information on the 'correct science' behind disease transmission, spread and illness in films and literature, popular culture can also inform societies about how to feel and how to react during epidemics-that is to say create some expectations about the kinds of societal responses that could potentially occur. In this article we closely analyse three films that centre around epidemic diseases-Contagion (Steven Soderbergh, 2011), Blindness (Fernando Meirelles, 2008) and The Painted Veil (John Curran, 2006)-in order to highlight three categories of distrust that have recently been identified and conceptualised in broader discussions regarding trust and health: institutional, social and interpersonal. These films raise two key issues about trust and social responses during epidemics. First, while certain aspects of trust are badly diminished during epidemic disease outbreaks, epidemics can also interact with pre-existing structural inequalities within society-based on race, gender or wealth-to create mixed outcomes of discord, prejudice and fear that coexist with new forms of cohesion. Second, the breakdown in trust seen at certain levels during epidemics, such as at the institutional level between communities and authorities or elites, might be mediated or negotiated, perhaps even compensated for, by heightened solidity of trust at the social level, within or between communities.

AB  - Background: High levels of stigma towards people who inject drugs (PWID) and people living with HIV (PLWH) exist in Kazakhstan, yet little is known about the role of stigma in harm reduction service settings. In this paper, we use a mixed method design to explore and describe the actionable drivers and facilitators of stigma among harm reduction service providers. Additionally, we describe the manifestations of stigma among PWID who are living with HIV (PWID/LWH), and the impact that stigma has on harm reduction and healthcare service utilization.
   Methods: Eight focus groups with 57 PWID/LWH were convened between March 2016 and July 2016 to describe manifestations of stigma from the perspective of syringe exchange program (SEP) clients. Additionally, we surveyed 80 nurses, social workers, outreach workers, and providers of HIV care at SEPs between January 2017 and July 2017 to assess stigmatizing attitudes among staff within the SEP environment. Joint displays were used to integrate quantitative and qualitative data.
   Results: The actionable drivers of stigma identified in this study include negative opinions and moral judgements towards PWID/LWH. Facilitators identified included stigmatization as a social norm within the service provision environment, a lack of awareness of anti-discrimination policies, and lack of enforcement of anti-discrimination policies. Qualitative findings highlight manifestations of stigma in which PWID/LWH experienced denial of services, perceived negative attitudes, and avoidance from service provision staff. PWID/LWH also described segregation in healthcare settings, the use of unnecessary precautions by providers, and unauthorized disclosure of HIV status.
   Conclusions: This paper highlights the urgent need to address stigma in the harm reduction and HIV service settings in Kazakhstan. These findings have implications for informing an actionable model for stigma reduction for providers who deliver services to PWID/LWH in Kazakhstan. Drivers, facilitators, and manifestations of stigma are multifaceted and addressing them will require a multilevel approach.

AB  - Background Antipsychotic medication can reduce psychotic symptoms and risk of relapse in people with schizophrenia and related disorders, but it is not always effective and adverse effects can be significant. We know little of patients' views about continuing or discontinuing antipsychotic treatment. Aims To explore the views of people with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders about continuing their antipsychotic medication or attempting to reduce or discontinue this medication with clinical support. Methods We collected quantitative and qualitative data by conducting semi-structured interviews in London, UK. Factors predicting a desire to discontinue medication were explored. Content analysis of qualitative data was undertaken. Results We interviewed 269 participants. 33% (95% CI, 27 to 39%) were content with taking long-term antipsychotic medication. Others reported they took it reluctantly (19%), accepted it on a temporary basis (24%) or actively disliked it (18%). 31% (95% CI, 25 to 37%) said they would like to try to stop medication with professional support, and 45% (95% CI, 39 to 51%) wanted the opportunity to reduce medication. People who wanted to discontinue had more negative attitudes towards the medication but were otherwise similar to other participants. Wanting to stop or reduce medication was motivated mainly by adverse effects and health concerns. Professional support was identified as potentially helpful to achieve reduction. Conclusions This large study reveals that patients are commonly unhappy about the idea of taking antipsychotics on a continuing or life-long basis. Professional support for people who want to try to reduce or stop medication is valued.

AB  - Objective: To gain insight into how communication vulnerable people and health-care professionals experience the communication in dialogue conversations, and how they adjust their conversation using augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) or other communication strategies.
   Methods: Communication vulnerable clients and health-care professionals in a long-term care institution were observed during a dialogue conversation (n = 11) and subsequently interviewed (n = 22) about their experiences with the conversation. The clients had various communication difficulties due to different underlying aetiologies, such as acquired brain injury or learning disorder.
   Results from the observations and interviews were analysed using conventional content analysis. Results: Seven key themes emerged regarding the experiences of clients and professionals: clients blame themselves for miscommunications; the relevance of both parties preparing the conversation; a quiet and familiar environment benefitting communication; giving clients enough time; the importance and complexity of nonverbal communication; the need to tailor communication to the client; prejudices and inexperience regarding AAC. The observations showed that some professionals had difficulties using appropriate communication strategies and all professionals relied mostly on verbal or nonverbal communication strategies.
   Conclusion: Professionals were aware of the importance of preparation, sufficient time, a suitable environment and considering nonverbal communication in dialogue conversations. However, they struggled with adequate use of communication strategies, such as verbal communication and AAC. There is a lack of knowledge about AAC, and professionals and clients need to be informed about the potential of AAC and how this can help them achieve equal participation in dialogue conversations in addition to other communication strategies.

AB  - This study assessed the acceptance and awareness of an Australian MPA (Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park) post implementation by recreational fishers using the MPA, and identified factors that influenced the perception of this group towards the MPA. Recreational fishers were interviewed in a multiple-use MPA to investigate their perceptions, attitudes, and support towards the MPA six years after implementation. Almost two thirds of recreational fishers supported the MPA and had positive attitudes towards the concept of MPAs. This is a key result since a similar pre-implementation survey of recreational fishers found only 12% would support the creation of PSGLMP due to fears the MPA would negatively impact their fishing activities and ability to catch fish. However, there was a sub-group of fishers who opposed the MPA and were more inclined to have negative attitudes towards the rationale behind MPAs, despite the common perception that no-take zones were for fisheries management purposes and could increase fish stocks in the MPA. More experienced fishers were inclined to oppose the MPA, as well as fishers who believed management zones did not provide clear rules for activities, penalties for non-compliance were too harsh, or that no-take zones did not increase fish stocks. An important perceived threat to the MPA was from commercial fishing due to perceptions of over-exploitation and issues of non-compliance. In contrast, the majority of recreational fishers did not believe the collective actions of recreational fishers negatively impacted the marine environment and fish stocks, or the number of fish available for capture in the future. An improved understanding of these social aspects is important to target ongoing management in order to increase acceptance, success and long-term existence of MPAs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: 'Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) has been endorsed by the United States Preventive Services Task Force as an evidence-based strategy to address risky alcohol use among adults in primary care. Nevertheless, very few healthcare professionals report using SBIRT in their practice. The purpose of this study was to explore attitudes regarding addressing substance use; perceptions of effectiveness, role responsibility, and self-efficacy; and current SBIRT practice among primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants to identify factors which may impact routine delivery of SBIRT in primary care.
   Study design: A cross-sectional design was used to meet study objectives. Responses of physicians and non-physician providers (nurse practitioners and physician assistants) were compared.
   Methods: Primary care members of three New York State physician, nurse practitioner, and physician assistant professional organizations were surveyed between October 2013 and November 2013.
   Results: Barely half of participants (57%) reported screening their patients for substance use, and less than half provided brief intervention (46%) or referral to treatment (47%). Using a standardized tool to screen patients for risky substance use and assessing readiness to change were practised least frequently. Compared to physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants felt less responsible for addressing substance use (P = 0.019), felt less comfortable discussing substance use (P = 0.004), had more negative attitudes toward addressing substance use (P = 0.015), and were less likely to conduct brief intervention (52% vs 32%; P < 0.0005) and referral to treatment (50% vs 70%; P = 0.001).
   Conclusions: This study identifies important attitudinal and perceptual differences between physicians and non-physician providers which may be targeted by education and training and underscores an opportunity for using non-physician providers to conduct SBIRT.

AB  - Background and Objectives Addiction is increasingly considered a chronic, relapsing brain disease; however, many scholars still disagree with the brain disease model of addiction. We set out to provide evidence of attorneys' and physicians' beliefs regarding the model. First, we asked the following question: do attorneys and physicians affirm the full brain disease model, or its modified form, or do they believe that addiction is driven by deficits in self-control or moral weakness? Second, we evaluated the extent to which such beliefs correspond to attitudes toward individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs).
   Methods A questionnaire was sent to resident physicians (N = 301) and criminal defense attorneys (N = 483) practicing in the United States. It was comprised of (i) an attitudes measure, (ii) a measure regarding conceptions of addiction, and (iii) demographic questions.
   Results Attorneys were more likely to believe that individuals with SUDs had "practically no choice" about whether to seek and use, whereas physicians were more likely to believe that such individuals had "genuine choice." For both groups of participants, the rejection of the full brain disease model of addiction was associated with more negative attitudes toward individuals with SUDs.
   Conclusion and Scientific Significance These results represent an important advance, as past research has neglected attorneys' attitudes and is inconclusive regarding the manner in which beliefs about the brain disease model of addiction are related to attitudes toward individuals with SUDs. Educating practitioners regarding this relationship would raise awareness regarding when and to what extent stigma is likely to be present, which may in turn provide a foundation from which to address stigma.

AB  - Background: For the Korean Burden of Disease (KBD) 2015 study, we have amended disability weights for causes of disease adapting the methodology of the KBD disability weight 2012 study.
   Methods: We conducted a self-administered web-based survey in Korea using ranking five causes of disease. A total of 605 physicians and medical college students who were attending in third or fourth grade of a regular course performed the survey. We converted the ranked data into paired comparison data and ran a probit regression. The predicted probabilities for each cause of disease were calculated from the coefficient estimates of the probit regression. 'Being dead (1)' and 'Full health (0)' were utilized as anchor points to rescale the predicted probability on a scale from 0 to 1.
   Results: As a result, disability weights for a total of 289 causes of disease were estimated. In particular, we calculated the disability weights of 60 causes of disease considering severity level. These results show that prejudice about the severity of cause of disease itself can affect the estimation of disability weight, when estimating the disability weight for causes of disease without consideration of severity. Furthermore, we have shown that disability weights can be estimated based on a ranking method which can maximize efficiency of data collection.
   Conclusion: Disability weights from this study can be used to estimate disability adjusted life year and healthy life expectancy. Furthermore, we expected that the use of the ranking method will increase gradually in disability weight studies.

TI  - The Legitimacy of Judicial Climate Engagement
T2  - ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY
LA  - English
KW  - STATE
AB  - Courts in key climate change cases have abdicated their constitutional responsibility to protect a prejudiced and disenfranchised group (nonvoting minors and future generations) and remedy an insidious pathology in public discourse and the political process: the industry funded climate disinformation campaign. This Article posits that this abdication results from courts' uneasiness about displacing the prerogatives of democratically elected bodies. This uneasiness is misplaced. Court engagement with climate cases would strengthen democracy in accord with widely accepted justifications for countermajoritarian judicial review. This Article first describes in detail how courts exhibit a frustrating reticence to accept jurisdiction over cases that present questions relating to core climate policy, such as whether large emitters or fossil fuel producers have common law liability for climate harms and whether the government has a common law or constitutional duty to address climate change. In not a single case raising such claims (and they number well over thirty) has a court permitted the case to proceed to trial. Courts dismiss these claims under the mantle of a variety of justiciability doctrines (standing, political question doctrine, displacement); these doctrines often serve as vessels for courts to exercise judicial restraint, and courts' language and reasoning in the climate cases confirms that the courts are, indeed, motivated by concerns of judicial overreach. The Article then offers a positive account for why judicial engagement in the climate cases is consistent with our system of democracy, even as understood by seminal scholars who define relatively narrow boundaries for countermajoritarian judicial review. In particular, the Article will situate arguments for judicial review in climate cases within the work of John Hart Ely, Jurgen Habermas, and Frank Michelman.

AB  - This exploratory online questionnaire-based study confirms the findings from earlier studies in the pre-smart phone era regarding consumers' negative attitudes towards mobile marketing communications. This study shows that these attitudes persist despite increasing frequency of use and increased functionality of mobile phones in the smart phone era. Consumers perceive their mobile device to be for personal communication, and prefer to be able to exercise control over their interaction with organisations. Findings suggest that acceptance can be enhanced by permission marketing, trust-building, creating a sense of being in control, and useful and entertaining website content. Accordingly, pull technologies seem to hold particular promise for mobile marketing communications. This study, therefore, proceeds to explore use of and attitudes towards an important pull technology, QR codes. QR codes, two-dimensional bar codes, can be scanned to provide access to websites, information and applications. Despite their potential, uptake is low. Users in this study who had scanned a QR code had used them to access a variety of different content on different types of items and in different locations. The most frequently accessed type of content was information on a web site, the two most common locations for a scanned QR code were a newspaper or magazine advert, or outdoor advert or poster, and the two most common locations at which scanning was performed were in the street and at home. Ease of use, utility and incentives are drivers to continued use whilst lack of knowledge about how-to scan or of the benefits of QR codes may hinder adoption. Recommendations are offered for practice and for further research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the case of weight stigma, the possible positions range from encouraging the intentional use of weight stigma as an obesity prevention and reduction strategy to arguing not only that this is harmful but that weight stigma, independent of obesity, needs to be actively challenged and reduced. Using weight stigma as an illustrative example, we draw on prior theoretical work on stigma mechanisms and intervention strategies to develop a framework for improving the understanding, evaluation, and planning of anti-stigma interventions. This framework has the potential to help public health actors to map out how protest, contact, education, and regulation strategies can be used to reduce direct discrimination, structural discrimination, and internalized stigma (self-stigma).

AB  - Waiting, whether for services, for someone, or for something, is an inescapable part of life. This paper addresses a gap in the waiting time literature by examining previously sparsely studied relationships between individual- and travel-related characteristics and attitudes toward waiting using a revealed preference dataset of Northern California commuters (N = 2617). Correlational analyses, followed by a trivariate seemingly unrelated regression equations model, are developed for three waiting attitudinal constructs: general tolerance toward waiting, and attitudes toward equipped and expected waiting. Socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, time use perceptions and preferences, personality traits, multitasking attitudes (polychronicity), commute preferences and expectations, and general attitudes (e.g. pro-technology) are all seen to have significant effects on waiting attitudes. As this survey was executed on commuters, it also facilitates a unique simultaneous exploration of travel and wait time attributes, time uses that are often similarly viewed in day-to-day life. From this perspective, we see that longer commute times and distances are correlated with negative attitudes toward waiting, while commuters with pro-transit, pro-density, and pro-active transportation attitudes tend to have positive attitudes toward waiting. Additionally, we see that those with preferences for multitasking in general or at their jobs can tolerate waiting better. Overall, this study constitutes a distinctive contribution to the waiting time literature, capitalizing on a rich dataset to make important connections between related time uses and a multitude of other variables-key among them polychronicity, with its potential ability to reduce the negative perception and experience of waiting. Findings from this study may also benefit transportation and other service providers by facilitating an understanding of how various consumer groups/demographics view waiting, thus enabling providers to better cater to diverse needs/populations.

AB  - Background: In Australia, temporary visa holders are ineligible for Medicare and subsidised antiretroviral drugs. Additionally, HIV testing is not mandatory for visas unless applicants seek work in the health sector. We sought to understand the impact of HIV and issues of access and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in people holding temporary visas and permanent residents. Methods: Data were gathered from interviews with 22 participants. Information concerning medication adherence, side effects, CD4 T-cell count, viral load and rate of response to generic drugs were collected. Results: The mean age was 33.4 years (+/- s.d. = 6.0), 21 out of 22 were from HIV-prevalent areas in East Africa and Asia, 14 out of 22 were on temporary visas, 12 were ineligible for Medicare, 14 out of 22 were diagnosed during health screening, 19 out of 22 risk exposures were in country of origin, 8 out of 17 were taking generic ART at an average cost of $180 per month, adherence was excellent and self-reported side-effects were relatively infrequent. Participants applying for visa continuations and permanent residency were fearful, believing their HIV serostatus would prejudice their applications. Patients cited belief in ART efficacy, were motivated to maintain therapy and were anxious about lack of access to treatment in their countries of origin. Conclusion: Adherence to antiretroviral drugs in Medicare-ineligible HIV-infected individuals is excellent despite limited access to treatment. The threat of visa non-renewal and the likely failure of applications for permanent residency result in considerable anxiety and confidentiality concerns.

AB  - Background: Implicit bias is prejudice shown towards an individual or group without consciously meaning to do so. This bias may occur due to age, race, and gender among other factors. Implicit bias has been examined and identified in a variety of health care professionals, primarily using Implicit Association Tests. To date, literature has not examined implicit bias using covert simulated patients in a naturalistic setting, or in practicing community pharmacists.
   Objective: To develop and pilot a novel method for exploring and reporting on implicit racial bias by community pharmacists in their practice setting.
   Methods: Four female actors of different racial and ethnic backgrounds (Caucasian Australian, East Asian, Middle Eastern, South Asian) completed simulated patient visits at eight community pharmacies in Sydney, Australia between February-March 2019. Actors provided scripted requests for assistance with symptoms or products relating to women's health ailments (cystitis, dysmenorrhea, emergency contraception, vaginal thrush) at a rate of one visit per pharmacy per week. Visits were audio-recorded. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with actors immediately post-visit. Transcriptions of visits and interviews were analyzed through discourse analysis.
   Results: Thirty-two vists were completed. Discourse analysis identified 3 discursive frames of 'caring', 'neutral, and 'abrupt' and enabled identification of potential differences between pharmacists when responding to actors of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. Consultation length, number of products sold, and number of questions asked did not significantly differ between visits.
   Conclusions: This novel method proved feasible and future work could adapt this method to different practitioners and simulated patient demographics to explore different types of implicit bias in a number of naturalistic settings.

   The aim of the study was to investigate the psychological status and the psychosocial experiences of HIV-positive people using Symptom Check List 90 (SCL-90) in eastern China.
   Methods
   Two hundred and fourteen HIV-positive people and 200 controls were recruited to the study. Participants were given an anonymous questionnaire which included questions pertaining to demography, SCL-90 and psychosocial experiences.
   Results
   The mean subscale scores for SCL-90 in the HIV-positive group were all higher than those of the control group (P < 0.001), especially for depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and hostility. Female HIV-positive individuals had significantly higher depression and anxiety scores (P < 0.05) and more scores higher than 2.0 than male HIV-positive individuals. The average number of subscales with mean scores higher than 2.0 was 4.1 for female HIV-positive individuals and 3.7 for male HIV-positive individuals. The most common psychosocial experiences related to HIV infection were fear (36.9%) and helplessness (31.8%). 90.2% of HIV-positive people would not tell others about their disease because of fear of discrimination against family members (42.2%), exclusion by community members (26.9%) and abandonment (23.3%). Discrimination from acquaintances (38.8%) was a main stressor in the HIV-positive individuals' daily life. Most members of HIV-positive individuals' communities expressed negative attitudes: alienation, coldness, aversion and fear. 38.3% of the HIV-positive participants reported that their family members had been discriminated against.
   Conclusions
   The results demonstrate that HIV-positive people in eastern China live in a negative psychosocial environment and suffer from psychological distress. It is necessary to provide psychological interventions for people living with AIDS and to educate community members in order to improve the psychosocial environment.

AB  - China has updated its national guideline recommending antiretroviral therapy (ART) to all people living with HIV (PLWH) since 2016. This study was to investigate the prevalence of behavioral intention to initiate ART among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) with CD4 levels >350 cells/mm(3), who had just become eligible to receive free ART in China. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 262 eligible HIV-infected MSM who had never received ART. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) was used to guide the variable selection. The prevalence of behavioral intention to initiate ART was 69.9%. After adjusting for significant background variables, all five constructs of TPB were significantly associated with behavioral intention to initiate ART. These significant constructs were: positive attitudes (adjusted odds ratios, AOR: 1.14; 95% CI [1.06, 1.24]) and negative attitudes (AOR: 0.89; 95% CI [0.82, 0.97]) toward immediate ART initiation; perceived their significant others would support them to initiate ART immediately (perceived subjective norm; AOR: 1.14; 95% CI [1.03, 1.25]); perceived high proportion of PLWH having similar CD4 cell levels were on ART (perceived descriptive norm; AOR: 2.22, 95% CI [1.16, 4.24]); and being confident in initiating ART immediately (perceived behavioral control; AOR: 1.21; 95% CI [1.04, 1.39]). Prevalence of behavioral intention to initiate ART was high among this group of MSM. Effective health promotion is needed to translate behavioral intention into related action. TPB may be a useful framework for developing future health promotion increasing ART coverage in this group.

AB  - BACKGROUND From 2002 to 2011, there were more than 17,000 shootings in Philadelphia. Turning Point, Temple University Hospital's inpatient violence intervention program, takes advantage of the teachable moment that occurs after violent injury. In addition to receiving traditional social work services, Turning Point patients watch their trauma bay resuscitation video and a movie about violence, meet with a gunshot wound survivor and an outpatient case manager, and also undergo psychiatric assessment. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of Turning Point in changing attitudes toward guns and violence among victims of penetrating trauma.
   METHODS This prospective randomized study was conducted from January 2012 to January 2014. Patients who sustained a gunshot or stab wound were randomized to standard of care, which involved traditional social work services only, or Turning Point. The Attitudes Toward Guns and Violence Questionnaire was administered to assess attitude change. Analysis was performed with repeated-measures analysis of variance. A p < 0.05 was significant.
   RESULTS A total of 80 of a potential 829 patients completed the study (40 standard of care, 40 Turning Point). The most common reason for exclusion was anticipated length of stay being less than 48 hours. The two groups were similar with respect to most demographics. Unlike the standard-of-care group, the Turning Point group demonstrated a 50% reduction in aggressive response to shame, a 29% reduction in comfort with aggression, and a 19% reduction in overall proclivity toward violence.
   CONCLUSIONS Turning Point is effective in changing attitudes toward guns and violence among victims of penetrating trauma. Longer follow-up is necessary to determine if this program can truly be a turning point in patients' lives.

AB  - Recent demographic changes in the forest-owner structure are suspected to have led to the increasing number of owners with no specific objectives for their forests. In addition, the continuous fragmentation of the forest holdings has increased the threat of the passiveness related to forest management. To decrease the tendency towards passiveness, new policy tools and initiatives have been suggested. In the Finnish context, the idea of an investor-based jointly owned forest has been introduced as facilitating the effective utilization of the forest resource. However, collective ownership has faced prejudice and scepticism among private forest owners. In order to expand, the forest owners need to see the idea of jointly owned forests as a socially legitimate. Thus, by adopting Van Leeuwen's framework for analyzing the legitimation of new social practices, we examine how Finnish forest owners legitimate their participation in jointly owned forests. The qualitative data of the study consist of 20 in-depth interviews with private forest owners who have joined a jointly owned forest. Our study contributes to the recent discussion on jointly owned forests. We show how a change in the type of ownership results in moral, authoritative and rational justifications over the decision while simultaneously renewing the identity of the forest owner. Accordingly, we suggest that forest ownership is not only driven by rational prospects, but the moral and emotional nature of ownership should be better taken into account at the policy level and in structural designs when discussing the promotion of new types of forest ownership.

AB  - After decades of relatively high inflows of foreign nationals, immigration is now at the center of substantial political divisions in most European countries and has been implicated in one of the most vexing developments in European politics, the rise of the xenophobic right. However, it is not clear whether high levels of immigration actually do cause a public backlash, or whether publics become habituated to, and supportive of, immigration. This study tests these backlash and habituation theories using novel measures of immigration mood and immigration concern produced by combining over 4,000 opinion datapoints across twenty-nine years and thirty countries. The authors find evidence of a public backlash in the short to medium run, where mood turns negative and concern about immigration rises. Yet the study also finds evidence of a longer-run process of habituation that cancels out the backlash effect within one (concern) to three (mood) decades.

AB  - BackgroundAlthough there are effective methods for the treatment and management of various mental illnesses, some individuals still do not seek psychiatric treatment. Various factors could affect this reluctance toward treatment, one of which is the public's lack of mental health literacy. This survey aimed to measure and compare mental health literacy in Cambodia's urban and rural areas. MethodTours were held to hold seminars that provided information about mental health in the health centers around Phnom Penh (PP) and Siem Reap (SR), and a survey was conducted on mental health literacy for the participants before the seminar at each location. Anthony Jorm's vignette of psychosis (young adult) and Angermeyer's questionnaire were used. After the participants were classified into the "agree group" and "disagree group" for each item, the answers for each item given by the participants in PP and SR were compared using the chi-square test and the odds rate was calculated. ResultsThe participants in SR were more likely to give reasons such as inherited causes, economic problems, stress at work, or family problems as the cause of schizophrenia. The percentage of these beliefs about schizophrenia was relatively lower in PP than in SR. Regarding attitudes toward schizophrenia, the participants in SR were more likely to have negative views and predict negative prognoses than the participants in PP. As for participants' feelings about schizophrenia, the participants in SR reacted more strongly than those in PP. Even though the participants in SR reacted more negatively, they were sympathetic toward individuals with schizophrenia. ConclusionOverall, the participants in the SR group were more likely to have negative attitudes toward schizophrenia than those in the PP group. These results support our hypothesis that mental health literacy represents the maturity of community mental health in a targeted area.

TI  - Predicting Reoffending Using the Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth (SAVRY): A 5-Year Follow-Up Study of Male Juvenile Offenders in Hunan Province, China

AB  - Background
   Juvenile violent offending is a serious worldwide public health issue.
   Objective
   The study examined whether the Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth (SAVRY) can be used to predict violent reoffending in Chinese male juvenile offenders, and to determine which risk/protective domains (items) are associated with violent recidivism.
   Methods
   A total of 246 male juvenile offenders were recruited. SAVRY domains were scored by trained raters based on file review and interviews with participants and their legal guardians. Information on further arrests, charges, or convictions for violent offences were collected from police records over a five year follow-up.
   Results
   Over the course of the five year follow-up periods, 63 (25.6%) juvenile offenders were re-arrested for a further violent reoffence. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses showed Areas Under the Curve (AUCs) ranging from 0.60 to 0.68 for the SAVRY total, risk and protective score domains. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that 7 of the 30 SAVRY items were significantly associated with reoffending; explaining 36.2% of the variance. Backward stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis showed the independently predictive items were items 2 ('history of non-violent offending'), 17 ('negative attitudes'), 18 ('risk-taking/impulsivity'), and 20 ('anger management problems'). Together these four items explained 25.0% of the variance in reoffending.
   Conclusions
   The results suggested that the SAVRY can be meaningfully used to inform the development and evaluation of effective violence risk assessment and management approaches for male juvenile offenders detained in a Youth Detention Center in Hunan province, China.

AB  - Medication non-adherence is a major public health problem that has been termed an 'invisible epidemic.' Non-adherence is not only associated with negative clinical consequences but can also result in substantial healthcare costs. Up to now, effective adherence interventions are scarce and a more comprehensive model of adherence determinants is required to target the determinants for not taking the medication as prescribed. Current approaches only included explicit attitudes such as self reported evaluations of medication as determinants, neglecting the role of associative processes that shape implicit attitudes. Implicit processes can predict daily behavior more accurately than explicit attitudes. Our aim is to assess explicit and implicit attitudes toward medication and explore the relation with beliefs, adherence and clinical (laboratory) outcomes in chronically ill patients. Fifty two Rheumatic Arthritis (RA) patients' attitudes toward Methotrexate (MTX) were explicitly (self-reported) and implicitly (Single-Category Implicit Association Test) assessed and related to the Beliefs about Medicine Questionnaire, the Compliance Questionnaire on Rheumatology and laboratory parameters [Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-Reactive Protein (CRP)]. Results show that explicit attitudes were positive and health-related. Implicit attitudes were, however, negative and sickness-related. Half of the patients displayed explicitly positive but implicitly negative attitudes. Explicit attitudes were positively related to ESR. A positive relationship between implicit attitudes and disease duration was observed. In this study, we have obtained evidence suggesting that the measurement of implicit attitudes and associations provides different information than explicit, self reported attitudes toward medication. Since patients' implicit attitudes deviated from explicit attitudes, we can conclude that the relationship between implicit attitudes and medication adherence is worthwhile to be further explored. With this information we can improve our understanding of the subconscious, automatic processes underlying adherence and we can develop interventions that target these implicit attitudes.

AB  - Background The sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinical encounter is an opportunity to identify current and prevent new HIV and STI infections. We examined knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding STIs and HIV among public and private providers in a large province in South Africa with a high disease burden.
   Methods From November 2008 to March 2009, 611 doctors and nurses from 120 public and 52 private clinics serving patients with STIs in Gauteng Province completed an anonymous, self-administered survey. Responses were compared by clinic location, provider type, and level of training.
   Results Most respondents were nurses (91%) and female (89%), were from public clinics (91%), and had received formal STI training (67%). Most (88%) correctly identified all of the common STI syndromes (i.e., genital ulcer syndrome, urethral discharge syndrome, and vaginal discharge syndrome). However, almost none correctly identified the most common etiologies for all 3 of these syndromes (0.8%), or the recommended first or alternative treatment regimens for all syndromes (0.8%). Very few (6%) providers correctly answered the 14 basic STI knowledge questions. Providers reporting formal STI training were more likely to identify correctly all 3 STI syndromes (P = 0.034) as well as answer correctly all 14 general STI knowledge questions (P = 0.016) compared with those not reporting STI training. In addition, several providers reported negative attitudes about patients with STI that may have affected their ability to practice optimal STI management.
   Conclusions Sexually transmitted infection general knowledge was suboptimal, particularly among providers without STI training. Provider training and brief refresher courses on specific aspects of diagnosis and management may benefit HIV/STI clinical care and prevention in Gauteng Province.

AB  - This study examined attitudes towards weak and strong assimilation in a sample of 3,121 pupils from 70 secondary schools in Brussels with a multilevel linear analysis. Controlling for socio-demographic variables, members of some ethnic minority groups endorsed weak assimilation to a greater extent than the majority. Within members of the majority, the French-speaking Belgians held similar attitudes towards assimilation to the Dutch-speaking Belgians. Among ethnic minorities, the identification of pupils from some foreign-origin countries with the mainstream society was positively associated with the endorsement of strong assimilation, while their ethnic identification remained non-significant. Intergroup friendship among pupils of foreign origin was positively related to strong assimilation. Moreover, pupils of foreign origin who experienced institutional discrimination against ethnic minorities in favour of the majority endorsed strong assimilationism to a lesser extent. Among the majority, the perception that people of foreign origin are victims of discrimination was positively related to the endorsement of weak assimilation. However, this association was mediated by the experience by the majority of institutional discrimination against the majority and in favour of ethnic minorities. In-group identification among the majority was not associated with the endorsement of assimilation. The results and their implications for future research and policy makers are discussed.

AB  - Although some persons with minority sexual orientations do not identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB), Minority Stress Theory (Meyer, 2003) has largely been developed utilizing LGB-identified samples. We examined a sample (n. 274) of sexual minorities with diverse religious and sexual identity labels to determine if those rejecting versus adopting an LGB identity were different in terms of religious, sexual, relational, and health characteristics. Results suggested those who reject an LGB identity are more likely to be religiously active, full members of their church, and highly intrinsic and theologically conservative in their religious viewpoint. They further reported having slightly more lifetime heterosexual attractions, fantasies, and behaviors; greater internalized homonegativity; and being more interested in having children and a child-centered family life. They were also more likely to be single and celibate or in a heterosexual relationship. Contrary to expectations, these differences were not associated with health differences in depression, anxiety, and social flourishing. LGB-identified participants did report higher life satisfaction than those rejecting an LGB identity, but this difference was not interpretively meaningful when considered in reference to population norms. We conclude with a discussion of the potential implications of our findings for research, legal and professional advocacy, and clinical care.

AB  - The article evaluates the perceptions of Jewish power among the Czechoslovak exiles in Britain during the Second World War. The analysis documents the apparent persistence of prejudices against the Jewish minority among the Czechoslovak non-Jewish authorities that eventually formed the government-in-exile (1940-5), under the presidency of Edvard Bene (1884-1948). The Czechoslovak exiles believed that the Jewish minority, in particular the Jewish nationalists (Zionists), had vehement supporters within Jewish circles in Western countries. Furthermore, they believed that the Jewish press played a significant role in the formation of public opinion in Britain and especially in the United States. In the early 1940s, the government-in-exile embarked on a policy of national homogenisation of post-war Czechoslovakia and was anxious to give concessions to the political representatives of the ethnic minority groups in exile, in particular the Germans, Hungarians and Jews. Yet the concerns about Jewish influence in liberal democracies granted several political concessions to the Jewish minority, in particular the appointment of a Zionist representative, Arnot Frischer (1887-1954), to the exile parliament. This notwithstanding, by analysing the internal situation among the Czechoslovak Jewish groups in London, the article documents the internal weakness and disputes among the Jewish groups which gradually revealed the utter powerlessness of the Jewish exiles during their negotiations with the Czechoslovak authorities. The Jewish groups (the assimilationists, Orthodox and secular nationalists) were divided by mutual as well as internal disputes which were not concealed from outside observers and were utilised by the exile government. What emerges from the analysis is an impression of quarrelling groups that could not agree on any of the fundamental issues and whose only power was the ability to court the support of Western Jewish groups, which were perceived by the non-Jewish exiles as influential actors in US and British society.

AB  - Objective. To evaluate the introduction of 10 Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS) sessions into year 2 of a Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) program with the aim of assisting students in developing the skills and attitudes required for inclusive practice. Methods. The evaluation used a cross-sectional study design. All members of the first two successive student cohorts to complete multiple VTS sessions completed a 38-item online reflective questionnaire exploring student perceptions of competency development, transference, and session acceptability. Students were asked for their consent to include their responses in a research study. Closed-question responses were analyzed to produce descriptive statistics. Free-text responses were categorized and quantified using an inductive approach and manifest content analysis. Results. Fifty-six percent of the students (98 of 174) allowed their responses to be included in the study. Students generally believed the sessions had supported their development of person-centred communication, cultural competence, and critical thinking skills. The minimum level of agreement that improvement in an area occurred was 74.5%. Free-text responses revealed the perception of additional skill and attitude development. Sixty percent of participants had thought about the VTS questions or used what they had learned in the VTS sessions in other settings. Eighty-six percent of students agreed that content on VTS should remain in the BPharm curriculum. Conclusion. Incorporating regular VTS sessions into the second year of a BPharm program was acceptable to students. Data suggest that inclusion of multiple VTS sessions is a valuable addition to the pharmacy curriculum, offering affective learning experiences which support development and transference of key skills and attitudes relating to the provision of inclusive person-centred care.

AB  - Psychological essentialism has played an important role in social psychology, informing influential theories of stereotyping and prejudice as well as questions about wrongdoers' accountability and their ability to change. In the existing literature, essentialism is often tied to beliefs in shared biology-that is, the extent to which members of a social group are seen as having the same underlying biological features. Here we investigate the possibility of "value-based essentialism" in which people think of certain social groups in terms of an underlying essence, but that essence is understood as a value. Study 1 explored beliefs about a wide range of social groups and found that both groups with shared biology (e.g., women) and shared values (e.g., hippies) elicited similar general essentialist beliefs relative to more incidental social categories (e.g., English-speakers). In Studies 2-4, participants who read about a group either as being based in biology or in values reported higher general essentialist beliefs compared with a control condition. Because biological essences about social groups have been connected to a number of downstream consequences, we also investigated two test cases concerning value-based essentialism. In Study 3, beliefs about both shared biology and shared values increased inductive generalizations about the social group relative to control, but in Study 4, only the shared biology condition reduced blame for wrongdoing. Together these findings join with recent work to support a broader theoretical framework of essentialism about social groups that can be arrived at through multiple pathways, including, in the present case, shared values.

AB  - Background People with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) continue to struggle to have their condition recognised as disabling in the face of public and professional prejudice and discrimination.
   Objective The aim of this study was to compare the functional status and well-being of people with well-characterised ME/CFS with people with multiple sclerosis (PWMS), as well as healthy controls (HCs).
   Methods In this cross-sectional study, we used data collected as part of the UK ME/CFS Biobank to compare actual participant scores from the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36 v2 (TM) (SF-36v2 (TM)) between groups, as a proxy for impact of disability, and from a bespoke questionnaire seeking data on employment and income.
   Results People with ME/CFS scored significantly lower than PWMS or HCs in almost all SF-36v2 (TM) areas. Prominent were lower scores for people with ME/CFS in the Physical Component Summary and Role Physical and Social Function domains, while the smallest differences were seen in the Mental Health domain. Responses to the bespoke questionnaire indicated that people with ME/CFS in this study work fewer hours and have lower incomes compared with people in the other two groups.
   Conclusions Using SF-36v2 (TM) scores as a proxy, people with ME/CFS were measurably more disabled than PWMS or HCs in this study population. Furthermore, employment and income data are consistent with loss of functional status. These findings should encourage the health community to recognise the disabling effects of ME/CFS, to advocate for the needs of people with ME/CFS, and to investigate strategies to address the cost of the disease to both individuals and society.

AB  - Cancer pain is a common symptom experienced by patients, caused either by the disease or its treatment. Morphine remains the most effective and recommended treatment for cancer pain. However, cancer patients still do not receive appropriate management for their pain, and under-treatment is common. Lack of knowledge and negative attitudes towards cancer pain and analgesia among professionals, patients and family caregivers are reported as one of the most common barriers to effective cancer pain management (CPM). To systematically review research on the nature and impact of attitudes and knowledge towards CPM, a systematic literature search of 6 databases (the Cochrane library, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science and EMBASE) was undertaken in July 2018. Additionally, hand-searching of Google, Google Scholar and reference lists was conducted. The inclusion criteria were adult (18-65 years of age), studies which included attitudes and knowledge towards CPM, studies written in English, published literature only and cross-sectional design. Included studies were critically appraised by two researchers independently using the Joanna Briggs Institute Analytical Cross Sectional Studies Assessment (JBI-ACSSA). A total of 36 studies met the inclusion criteria. The main finding was that among professionals, patients, caregivers and the public there were similar attitudinal barriers to effective CPM. The most commonly cited barriers were fear of drug addiction, tolerance of medication and side effects of opioids. We also found differences between professional groups (physicians versus nurses) and between different countries based on their potential exposure to palliative care training and services. There are still barriers to effective CPM, which might result in unrelieved cancer pain. Therefore, more educational programmes and training for professionals on CPM are needed. Furthermore, patients, caregivers, and the public need more general awareness and adequate level of knowledge about CPM.

KW  - BORDERLINE PERSONALITY-DISORDER
AB  - Background: Brief admission (BA) is an adjunctive treatment option for individuals with self-harming behavior, having traits of borderline personality disorder (BPD). It is offered alongside outpatient psychotherapy for the purpose of strengthening autonomy, self-reflection and self-care and to increase the likelihood of being able to stay in therapy by avoiding lengthy inpatient hospitalizations.Aims: To investigate participants' experiences with BA during the pilot phase of the Brief Admission Skane Randomized Controlled Trial (BASRCT), in order to detect possible strengths and limitations of the intervention and gain knowledge to facilitate implementation of BA at other treatment centers.Method: Eight participants randomized to BA were interviewed to obtain their experience of BA, or alternatively their reasons for choosing not to use BA. Thematic analysis was conducted upon their transcribed interviews.Results: Reported as most helpful by the participants was the structure/routines at the ward and the positive attitudes from the staff. However, some individuals reported problems with perceived negative attitudes from the staff administering BA and negative rumination about themselves. The reported reasons to request BA were: preventing urges to self-harm from escalating; ending isolation; preventing longer admissions and forced admission; feelings of emotional exhaustion, and the need for rest and support in re-creating a daily routine. Reasons for not requesting BA were fear of rejection, questioning the method; presumed room shortage; difficulties in deciding whether one's problems are serious enough; experiencing the situation to be too clinically acute.Conclusion: The results from this study indicated the importance of repeated staff education on all aspects of BA when it is being newly implemented, as well as the importance of working with attitudes of staff delivering BA. These were the key ingredients in making BA implementation successful. Our findings may be of value to other treatment centers implementing BA for the first time.Trial registration: NCT02985047.

AB  - Background: Although acupuncture is a highly effective treatment for pain management, it suffers from lack of reproducibility of results. One of the many variables involved in achieving reproducible clinical results is the specificity of an anatomical structure being stimulated. Lack of target specificity obscures scientific understanding of how acupuncture works, leading to skepticism about the efficacy of acupuncture within the medical community and prejudice regarding the wisdom imparted through classical acupuncture texts.
   Objectives: The goals of this study were to test the hypothesis that classical acupoint locations described in the classics have a strong foundation in neuroanatomy and to promote a consensus among practitioners about neuroanatomy-based acupuncture.
   Methods: Acupoint locations for TE 1-TE 10 described in the Systematic Classic were transliterated, and each acupoint neuroanatomical target was determined by literature review, dissection, and/or electrical stimulation. An objective comparison was made between classical acupoint location and acupoint descriptions in a contemporary Chinese acupuncture textbook.
   Results: Classical acupoints TE 1-TE 10 had specific neuroanatomical targets. Neuroanatomical differences of the TE acupoints were found between classical and contemporary descriptions. Of the ten contemporary acupoints, 60% of targets were ambiguous (TE 1 and TE 5-TE 9) while 40% (TE 2-TE 4, and TE10) missed the corroborated neuroanatomical targets completely.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that each acupoint between TE1 and TE10 targets a distinct nerve and/or muscle enabling the achievement of feedback of highly distinct tissue stimulation, without any target redundancy. The transmission of erroneous and ambiguous anatomical targets found in contemporary texts highlights the urgency in advancing a science-based approach to study the neuroanatomical intents of other acupoints.

AB  - Recent studies demonstrating epigenetic and developmental sensitivity to early environments, as exemplified by fields like the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) and environmental epigenetics, are bringing new data and models to bear on debates about race, genetics, and society. Here, we first survey the historical prominence of models of environmental determinism in early formulations of racial thinking to illustrate how notions of direct environmental effects on bodies have been used to naturalize racial hierarchy and inequalities in the past. Next, we conduct a scoping review of postgenomic work in environmental epigenetics and DOHaD that looks at the role of race/ethnicity in human health (2000-2021). Although there is substantial heterogeneity in how race is conceptualized and interpreted across studies, we observe practices that may unwittingly encourage typological thinking, including: using DNA methylation as a novel marker of racial classification; neglect of variation and reversibility within supposedly homogenous racial groups; and a tendency to label and reify whole groups as pathologized or impaired. Even in the very different politico-economic and epistemic context of contemporary postgenomic science, these trends echo deeply held beliefs in Western thinking which claimed that different environments shape different bodies and then used this logic to argue for essential differences between Europeans and non-Europeans. We conclude with a series of suggestions on interpreting and reporting findings in these fields that we feel will help researchers harness this work to benefit disadvantaged groups while avoiding the inadvertent dissemination of new and old forms of stigma or prejudice.

AB  - Citizenship representations within national populations have mainly been deduced from state policies on migration. Yet, at the individual level, no studies have investigated whether citizenship representations are reliably associated with preferences for specific migration policies (i.e. the underlying assumption for deducing citizenship representations from state policies). Because several studies have shown that state policies may not reflect understandings of citizenship within national populations, it may be more relevant to study citizenship representations at the individual level, in relation to personal preferences regarding migration policies. This study examined how ethnic, cultural and civic citizenship representations relate to migration policy preferences at the individual level among majority group high-school students (N = 1,734) in seven EU countries. Findings add to the understanding of citizenship representations and may have implications for the implementation of migration policies.

AB  - Objectives Using the Health Belief Model as a conceptual framework, we investigated the association between attitudes towards COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccinations, and vaccine hesitancy and change in these variables over a 9-month period in a UK cohort. Methods The COPE study cohort (n = 11,113) was recruited via an online survey at enrolment in March/April 2020. The study was advertised via the HealthWise Wales research registry and social media. Follow-up data were available for 6942 people at 3 months (June/July 2020) and 5037 at 12 months (March/April 2021) post-enrolment. Measures included demographics, perceived threat of COVID-19, perceived control, intention to accept or decline a COVID-19 vaccination, and attitudes towards vaccination. Logistic regression models were fitted cross-sectionally at 3 and 12 months to assess the association between motivational factors and vaccine hesitancy. Longitudinal changes in motivational variables for vaccine-hesitant and non-hesitant groups were examined using mixed-effect analysis of variance models. Results Fear of COVID-19, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, and perceived personal control over COVID-19 infection transmission decreased between the 3- and 12-month surveys. Vaccine hesitancy at 12 months was independently associated with low fear of the disease and more negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Specific barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake included concerns about safety and efficacy in light of its rapid development, mistrust of government and pharmaceutical companies, dislike of coercive policies, and perceived lack of relaxation in COVID-19-related restrictions as the vaccination programme progressed. Conclusions Decreasing fear of COVID-19, perceived susceptibility to the disease, and perceptions of personal control over reducing infection-transmission may impact future COVID-19 vaccination uptake.

AB  - This intervention study explored the effects of a newly developed intergenerational encounter program on cross-generational age stereotyping (CGAS). Based on a biographical-narrative approach, participants (secondary school students and nursing home residents) were invited to share ideas about existential questions of life (e.g., about one's core experiences, future plans, and personal values). Therefore, the dyadic Life Story Interview (LSI) had been translated into a group format (the Life Story Encounter Program, LSEP), consisting of 10 90-min sessions. Analyses verified that LSEP participants of both generations showed more favorable CGAS immediately after, but also 3 months after the program end. Such change in CGAS was absent in a control group (no LSEP participation). The LSEP-driven short- and long-term effects on CGAS could be partially explained by two program benefits, the feeling of comfort with and the experience of learning from the other generation.

AB  - Pregnancy is associated with major physiological and future psychosocial changes, and maternal adaptation to these changes is crucial for normal foetal development. Psychological stress in pregnancy predicts an earlier birth and lower birth weight. Pregnancy-specific stress contributes directly to preterm delivery. The importance of nutrition and exercise during pregnancy with regard to pregnancy outcome has long been acknowledged. This importance has only been further emphasized by the recent changes in food quality and availability, lifestyle changes and a new understanding of foetal programming's effects on adult outcomes. We hypothesised that for a successful pregnancy certain events at a nutritional, immune, psycho-emotional and genetic level should be tightly linked. Therefore, in this study we followed an 'integrative' approach to investigate how maternal stress, nutrition, pregnancy planning and exercise influence pregnancy outcome. A key finding of our study is that there was a significant reduction in the intake of alcohol, caffeine-containing and sugary drinks during pregnancy. However, passive smoking in the household remained unchanged. In terms of immune profile, a significant inverse correlation was noted between difficulty to 'fight' an infection and number of colds (r=-0.289, P=0.003) as well as the number of infections (r=-0.446, P<0.0001) during pregnancy. The vast majority of the pregnant women acquired a more sedentary lifestyle in the third trimester. In planned, but not in unplanned, pregnancies stress predicted infant weight, independent of age and body mass index (BMI). Notably, in mothers with negative attitudes towards the pregnancy, those with an unplanned pregnancy gave birth to infants with significantly higher weights than those with planned pregnancies. Collectively these data suggest that there is a higher order of complexity, possibly involving gene-environment interactions that work together to ensure a positive outcome for the mother as well as the foetus.

AB  - Objectives:
   Increasing dentists' visibility in the media to make the case for sugary beverage taxes can help advance public policy that improves oral health outcomes. We assessed California dentists' media engagement behaviors related to sugar restriction policies for dental caries prevention and correlates of engaging in such behavior.
   Methods:
   Survey items related to sugar policies and media engagement were embedded in an electronically distributed statewide survey of dentists' tobacco cessation counseling behaviors. Descriptive statistics were calculated for respondent characteristics, perceived professional responsibility to discuss selected topics with patients, and attitudes and behaviors related to sugar restriction policy and media communication. Multivariable models identified independent correlates of media engagement.
   Results:
   Of 624 respondents, most had never talked to traditional media (78%) or posted to social media (64%) about sugar or sugar policies for dental caries prevention. Respondents with the highest level of media engagement were more likely to agree that sugary beverage taxes are effective at reducing dental caries, that they had support from dental professional organizations to talk to the media, that it is realistic for patients to reduce their sugar consumption, and that sugar and sugary drinks are extremely harmful to health.
   Conclusions:
   Efforts to increase dentists' media engagement related to sugar restriction policies for dental caries prevention should address dentists' negative attitudes toward the effectiveness of sugar restriction policies and may require increased support from dental professional societies.
   Knowledge Transfer Statement:
   Study findings identify dentists' low engagement in media advocacy to support sugar restriction policy adoption. The results identify correlates of media engagement and of dentists' willingness and confidence to act, which could serve to inform interventions to support and enhance engagement.

AB  - Background: In order to fully understand the frontier hotspots and development trends of ideological and cultural psychology research in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic.
   Subjects and methods: We used the software CiteSpace to analyze the literature on ideological and cultural psychology research from the core database in Web of Science under the COVID-19 context.
   Results: The country/institution visualization network graph includes 58 nodes and 85 connections; The visual network graph of the research institution includes 109 nodes and 61 connections; 156 nodes and 552 connections are obtained, as shown in keyword co-occurrence graph and keyword cluster graph analysis; Keyword time-zone graph and keyword timeline graph are obtained.
   Conclusions: Relevant conclusions were drawn. First, the research on ideological and cultural psychology in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic began in 2020. The number of relevant literatures in 2021 has grown substantially. In 2022, the academic community still pays much attention to this field. Second, countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and China are at the forefront in terms of the number and influence of documents issued. Research institutions such as Duke Univ, Univ Gothenburg, and Univ British Columbia ranks top in terms of documents number issued. Third, the research literature in this field can be divided into 11 clusters with relatively concentrated themes. Fourth, after the research hotspots explosively increased in this field in 2021, there have been fewer new hotspots in 2022. Future hotspots are likely to emerge on the basis of conservatism-prejudice. The current shortcomings of this research field are also discussed in this paper, namely, lack of innovation and less generation of new research hotspots. The above conclusions comprehensively demonstrate the current situation and development trend of ideological and cultural psychology research in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic and provide a basis for further related research.

AB  - Background: Meeting the complex care needs of an ageing population is a global issue and long term care settings, such as care homes, play an essential role. However, there is a crisis in the recruitment of registered nurses within care homes. Higher educational institutions have a critical part to play in addressing the crisis in recruitment in care homes and it is argued that student nurses can have a significant role to play in co-creating curricular content responsive to population need.
   Objective: To co-create curricular content on care home nursing with student nurses.
   Design: Co-creation through collaborative enquiry and a three stage thematic analysis.
   Setting Undergraduate, preregistration nursing programme in a university in the United Kingdom.
   Participants: Student nurses from Years One to Four undertaking a Bachelor in Nursing with Honours degree. Methods: Six focus groups and two one to one interviews.
   Results: Findings revealed predominantly negative attitudes towards care home nursing. Teaching and practice placements appeared to play a minor role in shaping students' attitudes but rather, gave the unspoken message that for the acquisition of necessary knowledge and skills, care homes were less important than other settings. Most students were initially averse to care home nursing as a career choice. During focus groups/interviews, views shifted from seeing care homes as places where you 'lose clinical skills' to places where there is 'a lot of responsibility', and also a potentially rewarding career choice. From this attitudinal shift, students made suggestions for developing better curricular content and more positive learning opportunities.
   Conclusions: A co-creative framework can create a space for mutual learning between students and staff about challenges and opportunities for equipping nurses to meet the needs of ageing populations. Student nurses are open to learning about care home nursing as part of their education and keen to have a more positive exposure.

AB  - Background: Ageism, a form of prejudice in which one relates negatively to people due to their age, exists throughout life. However, no attempt has been made to compare ageist attitudes across the life cycle, from young adulthood to old age. Consequently, the current study examined age and gender differences in ageism throughout adulthood.
   Methods: 955 Israeli participants (age range: 18-98 years) were divided into three age-groups: young (18-39), middle-aged (40-67), and old (68-98), and were administered the Fraboni Scale of Ageism. Age and gender differences were examined both for the three groups and for subgroups within the older adult cohort.
   Results: Multivariate analysis of variance revealed that middle-aged participants were significantly more ageist than younger and older groups. Across all age groups, men exhibited more avoidance and stereotypical attitudes toward older adults than women. Among the old age group, participants aged 81-98 held more ageist stereotypes and reported more avoidance of older adults than those aged 68-73. Within the older adult cohort, gender was a significant predictor for ageist attitudes among those aged 68-73 and 81-98, but not for people aged 74-80.
   Conclusions: Ageism demonstrates a changing pattern across the life span. While gender differences remain stable, ageist attitudes toward growing old as we age ourselves are constantly changing. In order to gain a better understanding of ageism as a general and global phenomenon, we need to consider the role of such attitudes in different stages of life.

AB  - Discussions concerning if and how immigrants should acculturate into Finnish society have become popular especially in the aftermath of the refugee crisis. Despite the abundance of research on acculturation preferences of majority members towards immigrant groups, research on the stability of majority acculturation preferences in adolescence does not exist. In a sample of early (11-13 years, n = 157), middle (14-16 years, n = 362) and late (17-19 years, n = 279) adolescents, this study investigated the stability of acculturation preferences as adolescents age, and the extent to which men and women differed. Contrary to expectations, results indicated support for integration increased with age while support for assimilation decreased with age. Moreover, women were more supportive of integration and less supportive of assimilation when compared to men. Implications and future directions are discussed.

AB  - The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes the rights of persons with disabilities' access to health care, including primary health care (PHC). However, growing evidence indicates that individuals in rural areas generally experience health access issues, and these issues are even worse for those with physical disabilities. Knowledge about such experiences is critical for policy design and clinical practice to promote PHC access for persons with physical disabilities in rural areas. This study seeks to explore the experiences of persons with physical disabilities in accessing PHC services in the predominantly rural Upper West Region of Ghana. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 participants living with physical disabilities, and used both deductive and inductive approaches to analyze the data. Participants shared experiences at three broad levels: the health system level, individual level and health-seeking behaviors level. Within the health system level, we identified three main categories: service availability (presence of health facilities, deficient drug supply and lack of providers), acceptability (positive and negative attitudes of providers and perceived high and low quality of care) and accommodation (inaccessible health facilities and equipment). The experiences at the individual level included financial constraints and mobility to health care facilities. Health-seeking behaviors related to how the individual reacted and responded to access barriers, which included searching for traditional healing, resorting to self-medication, making sacrifices in managing their conditions and relying on spiritual means. The information provided in this study is potentially important to policy makers and PHC providers as It presents evidence on the barriers and facilitators to PHC access in a rural setting. In particular, understanding individuals' experiences and how they develop health-seeking behaviors to overcome access barriers will be critical for policy design and client-centered service delivery in rural Ghana and potentially other low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - Background and purpose: Identify and analyze pharmacy students' perceptions about their own implicit racial biases.
   Educational activity and setting: First year pharmacy students (n= 97) enrolled in a Pharmacy Practice course completed a test, Harvard Race Implicit Association Test (IAT), for homework to uncover their unconscious black-white racial bias. All students then wrote at least one paragraph reflecting on if they agreed or disagreed with their results and why. At the beginning of class, students were given a brief survey to capture their IAT results and demographic information. Retrospectively and following Institutional Review Board approval, pharmacy students' reflections were subjected to thematic analysis with the assistance of NVivo 10 and descriptive analyses were completed of their demographic info.
   Findings: Out of the 97 students enrolled in this course, all completed the self-reflection. But only 90 completed the survey. From those that completed the survey, 54% (N = 49) self-identified as women. The average age was 22.6 years old. Most of the students (77%) identified themselves as White Non-Hispanic. Six percent (N = 5) identified as Black. Most students (66%) reported that their results from the Race IAT indicated some level of preference for European Americans; 13% of the students reported some level of preference for African-Americans.
   All students' reflections were categorized by their agreement or lack of agreement with their implicit association test results. Those that agreed with their results cited family, friends, and community contributing to their implicit biases. Students who did not agree with their results were subcategorized as denying their results, believing that their implicit association did not affect their behavior, or believing that the Race IAT was invalid.
   Discussion/summary: Many pharmacy students were found to be unaware of their implicit biases and some do not believe that these biases will negatively affect the treatment of others. Pharmacy curricula should be developed to provide adequate self-awareness training and space in the curriculum so students can challenge these unconscious beliefs.

AB  - The impact of prison upon incarcerated individuals is considerably destructive and may lead to low mental health resiliency. Despite a large body of literature on resiliency, little is known about the process that the elderly go through in developing resiliency in the penal settinghence, this grounded theory investigation. The overall intent of this investigation is to describe the process by which older male adults develop resiliency while in prison. The study used a grounded theory design. To gather the needed data, a two-part research instrument that included a robotfoto and a semistructured interview was employed. A total of 25 incarcerated Filipino elderly in New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa City, Philippines were purposively selected. Field text was subjected to thematic analysis following Corbin and Strauss coding procedure. Interestingly, this study yielded the Maze Theory of Resiliency, which describes the Filipino elderly's road to achieving resiliency. Initially, they go through the sending up phase in which they feel condemnation and uncertainty. The sending off phase captures the moments in which prisoners show signs of optimism and readiness to experience life in their new environment. Lastly, the sending in phase, prisoners became accustomed to the dynamics of penal environmentthus, achieving their sense of resiliency. The emerged theory from this study could help nurses in the early recognition of psychological deterioration and in providing counseling services to the incarcerated elderly without any prejudice. And at the same time, the theory could help implement nursing interventions appropriate for each stage of resiliency.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Health professionals increasingly recognize the role that social determinants play in health disparities. However, little focus is placed on how health care professionals themselves contribute to disparities through biased care. We have developed a curriculum based on an antioppression framework which encourages health professionals to evaluate their biases and combat health care disparities through an active process of allyship.
   METHODS: Teaching methods emphasize skill building and include lectures, guided reflections, and facilitated discussions. Pre- and postsurveys were administered to assess participants' confidence level to recognize unconscious bias and to be an ally to colleagues, patients, and staff. In total, we conducted 20 workshops with a total of 468 participants across multiple disciplines.
   RESULTS: The survey response rate was 80%. Using a paired t-test, the mean difference in the pre- and postsurveys revealed a statistically significant improvement across all measures. Participants showed the greatest improvements (large effect size d>0.8) in their understanding of the process of allyship, their ability to describe strategies to address, assess, and recognize unconscious bias, and their knowledge of managing situations in which prejudice, power, and privilege are involved.
   CONCLUSIONS: Results show that an antioppression curriculum can enhance health professionals' confidence in addressing bias in health care through allyship. For those who value social justice and equity, moving from the role of bystander to a place of awareness and solidarity allows for one's behaviors to mirror these values. Allyship is an accessible tool that all health professionals can use in order to facilitate this process.

AB  - Critical consciousness (CC) has emerged as a framework for understanding how low-income and racial/ethnic minority youth recognize, interpret, and work to change the experiences and systems of oppression that they face in their daily lives. Despite this, relatively little is known about how youths' experiences with economic hardship and structural oppression shape how they "read their world" and motivate participation in critical action behaviors. We explore this issue using a mixed-methods design and present our findings in two studies. In Study 1 we examine the types of issues that a sample of low-income and predominantly racial/ethnic minority youth (ages 13-17) living in the Chicago area discuss when asked to reflect on issues that are important to them. The most commonly mentioned themes were community violence (59%), prejudice and intolerance (31%), world issues (25%), and economic disparities (18%). In Study 2 we examine youths' quantitative reports of engaging in critical action behavior; more than 65% had participated in at least one activity targeting social change in the previous 6 months. We then examined relationships between youths' experiences with poverty within their households and neighborhoods, neighborhood income inequality, and exposure to violence and youths' likelihood of participating in critical action behaviors. Greater exposure to violence and neighborhood income inequality were related to an increased likelihood of engaging in critical action behaviors. This work highlights the diverse ways that low-income and racial/ethnic minority youth reflect on societal inequality and their commitment to effecting change through sociopolitical participation.

AB  - Background
   Norms and stigma regarding pregnancy decisions (parenting, adoption, and abortion) are salient to maternal well-being, particularly for groups disproportionately affected by unintended pregnancy. However, there are few validated measures of individual-level perceptions of norms and stigma around pregnancy decisions. Additionally, little is known about variation in the content of norms regarding pregnancy decisions, and in stigma related to violations of these norms, across socio-demographic groups.
   Methods
   To create measures of perceived norms and stigma around pregnancy decisions, we developed and pre-tested 97 survey items using a mixed methods approach. The resulting survey was administered to 642 young adult women recruited from health department clinics and a public university campus in Birmingham, Alabama. Principal components factor analyses, reliability analyses, independent t-tests, and correlation analyses were conducted to establish the reliability and validity of scales. Additionally, multiple linear regression was used to identify demographic predictors of higher scale scores.
   Results
   Factor analyses revealed four subscales for each pregnancy decision: conditional acceptability, anticipated reactions, stereotypes/misperceptions, and attitudes. The total scales and their subscales demonstrated good internal reliability (alpha coefficients 0.72-0.94). The mean scores for each scale were significantly associated with each other, with related measures, and differed by sociodemographic characteristics. Specifically, in adjusted analyses, women in the university setting and White women expressed more negative attitudes and stigma around parenting. Minority women endorsed more negative norms and stigma around adoption. Finally, women from the health department, White women, and religious women expressed more negative norms and stigma around abortion.
   Conclusion
   Findings suggest that our multidimensional measures have good psychometric properties in our sample of young women in the U.S. South, and highlight the importance of conceptualizing and measuring norms and stigmas around all pregnancy decisions. These scales may be of use in research on pregnancy decision-making and evaluation of stigma-reduction interventions.

AB  - Courts and commentators routinely assume that "bias" on the jury encompasses any source of influence upon jurors that does not come directly from the evidence presented at trial. This sweeping conception of juror bias is flawed because it fails to distinguish the prejudices and affinities that infect jury decisionmaking from the experiences and perspectives that enrich it. This Article uses a thought experiment informed by the neuroscience of bias to illuminate the complexity of juror influences that go by the name of bias. I distinguish four distinct categories of juror influence: personal interests, community interests, case-specific beliefs, and case-general beliefs. I apply this spectrum of juror bias to provide a sounder way to think about what kind of juries we want.
   I argue that trial courts should limit the interrogation and disqualification of prospective jurors to personal interests in the case whether social or financial and to case-specific beliefs arising from pretrial facts or rumors about the parties or events. By contrast, I would permit no such wholesale exclusion, either for community interests, which range from principles of justice to desires for vengeance, or for case-general beliefs about social causes or groups, which span scruples to dogmatism, and empathy to bigotry. My proposal to abolish challenges for these latter categories of outside influence raises the serious concern that accommodating their presence on the jury risks facilitating unjust outcomes, jury nullification, and hung juries. Trial courts should mitigate these risks by adopting two bias-tempering measures. First, jury pools should be diversified in ways that social cognition research suggests would attenuate the influence of unreflexive or objectionable attitudes. Second, judges should instruct deliberating jurors to express, along with their own position, the strongest counterarguments to it, so as to disrupt exaggerated assumptions of division and facilitate openness to persuasion.

AB  - The World Health Organization has considered sexual health as a major dimension of global health and a sexual right. However, the sexual health of people with physical disabilities is still poorly addressed by health and social care professionals, and it is very stigmatized by society. This study aimed to assess the perspectives of Portuguese people living with physical disabilities regarding issues affecting their sexual health. Nine women and 17 men with different physical disabilities participated in the study. Participants were recruited from a professional rehabilitation facility located in the North of Portugal and were assigned to four groups in one-hour sessions. Three main categories emerged from the content analysis: (1) meanings and beliefs regarding sexuality; (2) experiences of sexuality; (3) necessary changes. Despite the positive social changes towards sexuality, participants expressed that their sexual rights are still unfulfilled, as they live in a context that perpetuates their dependency. They pointed out low self-esteem, prejudice and social isolation, poor architectural accessibility and scarcity of financial support as some of the barriers to their lives and their sexual health. Finally, participants identified the main needs regarding their sexual health, such as: access to specialized information; training for health professionals. This study gives voice to people with physical disabilities and sheds light into both individual and contextual factors affecting their sexual health. Of utmost importance, this study draws attention to the need for reinforcing sexuality of people with disabilities in the social agenda and brings implications for future research and practice.

AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a global issue that causes significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, this study aims to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of the general Saudi populations toward antibiotics use.
   Design and method: A cross-sectional, anonymous online survey was conducted from January 1 to May 11, 2020, across five major regions of Saudi Arabia. Participants (aged >= 18 years) were invited through social media to complete an online self-structured questionnaire. All data were analyzed by Statistical Package (SPSS v. 25). Descriptive statistics, Pearson's Chi-squared, t-tests, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Pearson correlation analyses were conducted.
   Results: Out of 443 participants, the majority (n=309, 69.8%) were females, 294 (64.4%) were married, 176 (39.7%) were 25-34 years of age, 338 (76.3%) were living in the Eastern Province, 313 (70.7%) had college or higher education, 139 (31.4%) were not working, and 163 (36.8%) had a monthly income of USD 8001330. Overall, most participants demonstrated good knowledge and practice (88% and 85.6%, respectively). However, 76.8%had inadequate attitude score levels towards antibiotics use. Of all the respondents, 74.9% knew that not completing a full course of antibiotics may cause antibiotics resistance, 91.33% did not agree that antibiotics should be accessed without a prescription, and 94.04% will not hand over leftover antibiotics to family members. Factors associated with adequate knowledge were female, medical jobs, and higher income (p<0.05).
   Conclusions: Our findings revealed that while most participants were aware of antibiotics use and demonstrated good knowledge, good practices, they had negative attitudes towards antibiotics use.

AB  - Aim: Dental health professionals, including dental students, are at high risk of exposure to infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) through occupational percutaneous injuries and eye exposure. Further, fear of HCV infection is associated with discriminatory attitudes. The current study aimed to evaluate the knowledge about HCV infection amongst dental students and their attitudes towards patients infected with HCV.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted amongst 340 Brazilian dental students from two public universities using an instrument containing information regarding demographic characteristics, knowledge of HCV and attitudes towards patients with HCV infection. Descriptive statistics, Fisher's exact test, Student's t-tests, Mann-Whitney U-test and multiple logistic regression (MLR) were carried out (P < 0.05 was considered significant).
   Results: Response rate was 90% (n = 306), and more than half (54%, n = 165) of participants had high knowledge level (above the mean); 97.7% (n = 299) demonstrated positive attitudes. MLR showed that high knowledge of dental students regarding HCV was substantially influenced by advancement in year of study (last year; P < 0.001) and type of university (federal; P = 0.049). Positive attitude towards HCV-infected patients was mainly influenced by age (P = 0.004) and male gender (P = 0.022).
   Conclusions: These results demonstrated a satisfactory knowledge about HCV infection amongst dental students, but some gaps were observed, suggesting the importance of continuous education about HCV in this population to prevent HCV infection as well as discrimination and prejudice towards patients with hepatitis C.

AB  - Purpose - The participation and productivity of women in Oman's labor force are very low and heavily skewed toward the government sector. There are few women in the private sector and the reasons for this are not well-known. The challenges that women workers face specifically in the Arab World are worth understanding from a participation and policy perspective. The purpose of this paper is to explore employers' perceptions of women workers and the major challenges they face in Oman in the context of government efforts to develop the female workforce in this Middle East region.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data collected by interviewing the top executives (employers) from 28 organizations in two major cities in Oman were analyzed qualitatively, grouped into emerging themes, triangulated, and discussed.
   Findings - The results indicated that employers, in general, are impressed by women workers in Oman. However, they identify a number of challenges women face. This study synthesized and grouped employers' perceptions of these challenges in the following categories: women's natural and physiological composition, their attitude at work, post-marital challenges, socio-cultural barriers, nature and place of work, organizational preparedness and governance, biases or prejudices of employers, and work-life balance (WLB) issues facing them.
   Practical implications - This study suggests that since female participation in the government sector in Oman is substantial, women can also be attracted to work in the private sector if policies are formulated to safeguard their interests.
   Originality/value - There is an absolute dearth of studies about female participation in the Omani workforce; this study is one of the pioneering efforts. Whereas the extant literature on WLB issues represents mostly the western perspective, this study highlights the major WLB issues in Oman and fills some important gaps between the West and the Middle East by focusing on women, WLB, and policies triangle.

AB  - A tightly controlled activity of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) including renin, angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACEs), and angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors is critical not only for maintaining systemic hemodynamics and blood volume but also for controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue remodeling in target organs. ACE inhibitors or Ang II receptor type 1 (AT1R) blockers are widely used as first line drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases that are caused by chronical activation of RAS. However, about 15% of patients using ACE inhibitors develop side effects in the skin and the underlying mechanisms have been poorly understood or even neglected. Herein we show an endogenous RAS in maintaining self-renewal and regeneration potential of epidermal stem cells (ESCs) thereby contributing to wound healing. Firstly, we found that ESCs may express ACE, and its members in wound edges were positively associated with wound healing in Captopril-treated rats. Secondly, we demonstrated that human ESCs had a functional RAS including ACE1, ACE2, Ang II, AT1R, and AT2R. ACE-Mg II axis maintains human ESC function via activation of both AT1R and AT2R, which are negatively regulated by each other. Ang II-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)1 and STAT3 was mediated by the negative cross-talk between AT1R and AT2R in human ESCs. These results suggest that Ang II is a critical regulator of ESC function and ESC-mediated epidermal regeneration. Inappropriate interruption of Ang II-operated signaling may prejudice ESC function leading to impaired skin wound healing or even disease.

AB  - Purpose
   This study aims to explore the effect of two digital nudging technologies that is overt digital nudging (ODN) and covert digital nudging (CDN), on consumers' choices of nudged options in the context of online customization systems (OCS).
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper designed a 2 (ODN: yes/no) by 2 (CDN: yes/no) full factor between-subject lab experiment in the context of online travel package customization. This paper collected and analyzed the number of nudged options (the intermediate options) of choices among consumers in these four scenarios.
   Findings
   ODN and CDN have positive effects on consumers' choices of nudged options in online customization (OC). In addition, mixed nudge (a combination of ODN and CDN) has a more significant effect on consumers' choices of nudged options in OC than using CDN only.
   Research limitations/implications
   This study focused only on the choice behavior of consumers in the customization context and did not analyze their attitude change. The present study used vendor recommendation as the proxy variable of ODN and default option as the proxy variable of CDN. A future study could explore other instances of ODN and CDN.
   Practical implications
   This study explores the effects of digital nudging technologies in the context of OCS. The study provides clear guidance for customization vendors on whether to use digital nudging tools and their combinations, and which tools should be preferred.
   Social implications
   Vendors can adopt digital nudging technology to persuade consumers to choose nudged options. This nudging effect can make consumers' choices predictable and less uncertain, thus adding profits for vendors.
   Originality/value
   First, the study focuses on the impact of digital nudging on consumers' choices and enriches the understanding of the impact of customization system design on consumers' choices. Second, this paper put forward a new classification method for digital nudging and proposed, respectively, the effect mechanisms on consumers' customization choices. Third, this study explores the effect of combining multiple nudging tools in OC context on consumers' choices, which deepens the understanding of the interactive effects of different types of nudging tools.

AB  - Bisexual individuals experience prejudice specifically related to their bisexual identity, and these experiences may compound extant risk for disordered eating behaviors and body esteem concerns. However, little is known about how sexual minority stress related to bisexual orientation is associated with emotional eating and body esteem. The current study examined the associations between bisexual-specific minority stress and emotional eating and body esteem in a sample of bisexual plus (bi+) adults (including bisexual, pansexual, queer, and those with attractions to more than one gender regardless of identity), and tested the moderating effects of identity centrality, affirmation, and community connectedness as potential protective factors. This study leveraged data from an online survey of 498 adults (77.46% cisgender women; 79.7% White), ages 18 to 64 years (M = 28.5; SD = 9.59). Bisexual-specific minority stress was associated with more emotional eating (8 = 0.15, p = .013) and lower body esteem (8 = -0.16, p = .005), while controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, body mass index, and heterosexist minority stress. This finding remained the same when sensitivity analyses were conducted with participants who identified specifically as bisexual. Identity centrality and affirmation and community connectedness did not demonstrate moderating effects but they had main effects, such that they were positively associated with body esteem (8 = 0.16, p = .001; 8 = 0.21, p < .001; 8 = 0.13, p = .004, respectively). Results suggest that anti-bisexual minority stress has a unique association with bi+ individuals' emotional eating and body esteem, and identified potential individual- and community-level protective factors for body esteem. These findings inform future research and interventions for this understudied population.

AB  - The energy security landscape that we envisage in 2050 will be different from that of today. Meeting the future energy needs of the armed forces will be a key challenge, not least for military security. The World Energy Council's World Energy Scenarios forecast that the world's population will rise to 10 billion by 2050, which will also necessitate an increase in the size of the armed forces. In this context, energy extraction, distribution, and storage become essential to stabilizing the imbalance between production and demand. Among the available solutions, Power to Hydrogen (P2H) is one of the most appealing options. However, despite the potential, many obstacles currently hinder the development of the P2H market. This article aims to identify and analyse existing barriers to the introduction of P2H technologies that use hydrogen. The holistic approach used, which was based on a literature survey, identified obstacles and possible strategies for overcoming them. The research conducted presents an original research contribution at the level of hydrogen strategies considered in leading countries around the world. The research findings identified unresolved regulatory issues and sources of uncertainty in the armed forces. There is a lack of knowledge in the armed forces of some countries about the process of producing hydrogen energy and its benefits, which raises concerns about the consistency of its exploitation. Negative attitudes towards hydrogen fuel energy can be a significant barrier to its deployment in the armed forces. Possible approaches and solutions have also been proposed to eliminate obstacles and to support decision makers in defining and implementing a strategy for hydrogen as a clean energy carrier. There are decisive and unresolved obstacles to its deployment, not only in the armed forces.

AB  - Background: With professional midwives being introduced in Bangladesh in 2013, the aim of this study was to describe midwifery students perceptions on midwives' realities in Bangladesh, based on their own experiences.
   Method: Data were collected through 14 focus group discussions that included a total of 67 third-year diploma midwifery students at public nursing institutes/colleges in different parts of Bangladesh. Data were analyzed deductively using an analytical framework identifying social, professional and economical barriers to the provision of quality care by midwifery personnel.
   Results: The social barriers preventing midwifery quality care falls outside the parameters of Bangladeshi cultural norms that have been shaped by beliefs associated with religion, society, and gender norms. This puts midwives in a vulnerable position due to cultural prejudice. Professional barriers include heavy workloads with a shortage of staff who were not utilized to their full capacity within the health system. The reason for this was a lack of recognition in the medical hierarchy, leaving midwives with low levels of autonomy. Economical barriers were reflected by lack of supplies and hospital beds, midwives earning only low and/or irregular salaries, a lack of opportunities for recreation, and personal insecurity related to lack of housing and transportation.
   Conclusion: Without adequate support for midwives, to strengthen their self-confidence through education and through continuous professional and economic development, little can be achieved in terms of improving quality care of women during the period around early and late pregnancy including childbirth.The findings can be used for discussions aimed to mobilize a midwifery workforce across the continuum of care to deliver quality reproductive health care services. No matter how much adequate support is provided to midwives, to strengthen their self-confidence through education, continuous professional and economic development, addressing the social barriers is a prerequisite for provision of quality care.

AB  - This article examines the indirect impacts of hate crimes on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and Muslim communities in the United Kingdom. Based on 34 qualitative interviews, we explore both the perceived meaning of 'community' in the context of targeted victimization and the emotional and behavioural effects that anti-lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and Islamophobic hate crimes have on other members of the victim's group. Building on previous quantitative data undertaken as part of a larger programme of research, this study helps to explain how and why hate crimes have significant indirect consequences on two distinct but commonly targeted communities. The focus on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and Muslim communities allowed us to draw out similarities and commonalities across different groups, further enhancing the understanding of the impacts of hate crime. In particular, the article highlights how for many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and Muslim people feelings of anger and anxiety about hate crimes were linked to enhanced levels of empathy towards those that they share a group identity with. These empathic bonds often gave rise to a sense of 'shared suffering', with participants frequently feeling connected to group members worldwide through their common experiences of hate and prejudice. Although group identity was important to many participants' sense of belonging to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender or Muslim communities, it was clear that the most profound impacts of hate crime were experienced when incidents occurred within someone's local area. This highlighted the importance of location as a key variable in understanding both the meaning of 'community' and the indirect impacts of hate crime.

AB  - Teachers' attitudes toward their students have been associated with differential teachers' expectations and, in turn, with students' educational pathways. Theories of social cognition can explain the link between attitudes and behavior. In this regard, the distinction between implicit and explicit attitudes is worth to be considered, whereby implicit attitudes are automatically activated when the attitude object is present and guide automatic behavior. In contrast, explicit attitudes infer deliberation and reflection, hence affecting controlled behavior. As teachers often are required to act immediately in situations that do not allow for thoughtful reflection due to time restraints, teachers' implicit attitudes concerning different student groups with shared characteristics, such as gender or ethnicity, may be especially important when considering teachers' behavior in relation to students' educational pathways. This notion is reflected by an increased interest in adopting implicit methodology in the educational domain. Over the last 10 years, several studies have been conducted in different countries, involving in- and pre-service teachers and investigating their attitudes toward different student groups. Estimates of effects have varied and may be affected by sampling bias. To systematically review and integrate data from different studies, this meta-analysis focuses on teachers' implicit attitudes. Following the systematic search of the database and initial screening, 43 articles were identified from which 22, describing 34 studies, were retained for the meta-analysis after further inspection. First analyses revealed an estimated average effect size of 0.56 for implicit attitudes in favor of non-marginalized groups. As there was a large extent of heterogeneity between studies, several moderator variables were investigated. Results showed that the employed implicit measure and stimulus materials as well as the student target group affected the effect sizes. Low or non-significant relationships were reported between implicit and explicit attitudes. Findings are discussed in terms of theory and future research.

AB  - This research, conducted in the Netherlands, examines whether native adolescents' tolerance of practices by Muslim immigrants (e. g., the founding of Islamic schools) is affected by the type of considerations (e. g., educational freedom vs. integration of Muslims in Dutch society). Using an experimental questionnaire design (N = 970), the findings show that adolescents (13-17 years) became less tolerant when considerations against these practices were presented, whereas tolerance was not affected by considerations in favor of the practices. In addition, the level of tolerance of adolescents who strongly identified as Dutch was not affected by the different considerations, but lower identifiers were less tolerant when considerations against the practices were given. The effects of the different considerations did not differ for age and for educational level. The implications of this research for improving adolescent's tolerance of practices by Muslim actors are discussed.

AB  - Patients and families each present unique microcultures, mixing and blending numerous broadly conceptualized cultural identity groups. Within individuals and families, cultural identities are experienced and enacted as complex matrices of intersecting identities that, to varying degrees, complement, assimilate, accommodate, or clash. In these patterns, individuals' relationships to cultures are not necessarily categorically distinct ("multicultural"). Instead, they are often "polycultural," defined as partial and plural; rather than interpreting different cultural traditions as separate and independent, they are, within the lives of individuals and families, better understood as systems that interact with and influence one another.
   Cultural identity groups extend beyond those traditionally considered by transcultural psychiatry-that is, beyond ethnic, racial, and language groups. They encompass (in alphabetical order) educational, ethnic, extended family, gender-oriented, generational, geographic, language and dialect, organizational, physical or psychiatric disability, political, professional, racial, religious, sect, social class, and vocational identity groups, among others. Simplistic assumptions and generalities about identity groups risk cultural stereotyping that may negatively bias clinical assessments. Therefore, practitioners striving for cultural sensitivity need to adopt nuanced strategies for approaching broad polycultural identity questions in clinical practice. Accordingly, this article suggests frameworks and strategies for (1) assessing and confronting one's own cultural preconceptions and prejudices, and (2) developing etic (objective quantitative data) and emic (insiders' experiential worldviews) perspectives pertinent to clinical anthropathology. Both etic and emic perspectives are necessary for polyculturally nuanced, respectful, comprehensive inquiries pertinent to patients' and family's health beliefs, psychiatric difficulties, and health practices. Supplementary material from the DSM-5 section on cultural formulation is adapted and discussed, along with the implications of polycultural psychiatry for education and training in psychiatry.

TI  - Rectifying 'the Great Australian Silence'? Creative representations of Australian Indigenous Second World War service
T2  - AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - Until the publication of Robert Hall's landmark book The Black Diggers in 1989, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were essentially 'written out' of Australia's Second World War history. Still, more than 20 years since the publication of Hall's book, Australian Indigenous participation in the war effort as servicemen and women, labourers and scouts, in wartime industries and in various other capacities, continues to be on the periphery of Australia's war history. The Second World War remains part of what WEH Stanner referred to in 1969 as 'the Great Australian Silence' of Indigenous history.
   Notwithstanding the lack of significant academic histories of Indigenous military history, there have been a few creative depictions of Aboriginal participation in the Second World War. Both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people have used creative mediums, such as poetry, short fiction, film, musical theatre and music, to portray Aboriginal Second World War service. This paper examines these creative cultural representations and how they position Australian Indigenous war service within a wider narrative of the Second World War and Indigenous history. Though the portrayals of Aboriginal service vary, the majority of creative works present the Second World War as central to Australian Indigenous history. Moreover, the creative representations depict Indigenous servicemen's hopes for a better life after the war, only to be crushed when they returned to ongoing discrimination. Even so, the creative depictions use the Second World War as an early marker of reconciliation in Australia, portraying the conflict as a time when ideals of liberty and equality overruled prejudice to unite Australia. Such a message continues to resonate, as creative representations of the Second World War contribute to contemporary understandings of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander citizenship and reconciliation.

AB  - The authors analyze from an ethical and legal point of view the case of a 37 year old man, hospitalized for four days because of a "dissociative syndrome", who had introduced in both his orbits a portable radio antenna. Most likely, he completed the self-enuclation using his own hands. He was brought to the Ophtalmic Hospital by nurses who handed the two eyeballs to the physicians who ascertained that the corneas were intact. Then, they performed the conservative extraction. In the following days those corneas were transplanted (keratoplasty) on two subjects on the waiting list at that hospital. The case raises the question of whether it is lawful and ethically acceptable to take, for transplant use, the corneas of a mentally incapable patient who has excised his own eyeballs. The authors analyze the case from the angle of the Italian law and Oviedo Convention. Neither of them has a specific regulation on this topic. It is therefore necessary to apply general principles that holdvalidfor Italy and a variety of countries worldwide. Particularly, the choice to use the corneas for transplant did not prejudice the physical integrity of the patient, who could no longer utilize his own eyeballs. His self-determination has not been affected; in fact, he was not in the position to make a conscious decision. Additionally, the so-called "implied consent" could be applied. Therefore, the principle of human solidarity, which is the moral duty to benefit others, seems to prevail in the case at hand.

AB  - The occurrence of popular social events causes fluctuations and changes of public emotions, while the rapid development of online social platforms and networks has made individual interactions more intense and further escalated public emotions into public opinion. However, there is a lack of consideration of individual emotions in the current research on online public opinion. Based on this, this paper firstly expounds the quantitative representation of attitude and emotion, analyzes the formation and propagation process of online public opinion by combining individual's expression willingness, individual's expression ability, attitude perception value, attitude change probability and other factors, and constructs a network public opinion propagation model that takes individual emotion into consideration. Finally, the main factors affecting the formation and propagation of network public opinion are discussed through simulation experiments. The results demonstrate that: (1) fear is conducive to the formation of online public opinion, but the speed is relatively slow; sadness is not conducive to the formation, but once enough people participate in the exchange of views, the formation of online public opinion will be faster; (2) the influence of online public opinion on individual emotions expands with the increase of the number of individual interactions; (3) different network structures impact differently on the propagation of public opinion. Among them, BA (BA network is a scale-free network model proposed by Barabasi and Albert in order to explain the generation mechanism of power law, BA model has two characteristics: growth and priority connection mechanism) and ER (ER network is a network with random connectivity proposed by Erdos-Renyi) random networks can promote the propagation of online public opinion, which is prone to "one-sided" online public opinion. WS small-world networks (proposed by Watts and Strogatz. It is a kind of network with short average path length and high clustering coefficient) and fully-connected networks have an inhibitory effect on the spread of online public opinion, easily maintaining the multi-dimensional nature of online public opinion.

AB  - Trans and nonbinary individuals experience high rates of identity-based stigma and stress (minority stress) in U.S. society. Despite research empirically linking minority stress with adverse mental health outcomes, the extent to which minority stress experiences are discussed in psychotherapy and how therapists respond is unknown. The primary aim of the present study was to develop and test an observational coding scheme, the Minority Stress Experiences and Interactions (MSEI) scheme. With this scheme, observational data from psychotherapy sessions with 19 transgender and nonbinary adult psychotherapy client participants were coded to provide pilot data for the initial development of the MSEI coding scheme. A total of 19 clients' entire 50-min psychotherapy sessions were coded over 3 phases of psychotherapy: beginning (Session 1), middle (Session 2), and end (Session 10/11). Results indicate that the MSEI scheme was reliable for most codes. Codes revealed that all (N= 19; 100%) clients in the study reported at least 1 minority stress event (MSE) over the course of the 3 sessions, with the mean number of MSEs being 7 per client. The most frequent proximal stressor reported by clients was related to internalized stigma and the most frequent distal stressor reported by clients was prejudice. A total of 2 clients' clinical exchanges with their therapists centered on MSEs are highlighted to demonstrate the nuance of how MSEs are discussed in session. specifically regarding multiple minority identities. Implications for the current study include the need for therapist training regarding minority stress interventions and attention to power and oppression within sessions.

AB  - AimMuch research on attitudes towards older adults has used younger adults as participants and identified a range of negative attitudes towards older persons. Comparatively little literature has explored the attitudes of older adults themselves towards their own age cohort.
   MethodsThe present study explicitly compared attitudes towards other older adults from samples of 195 older adults in Australia and 172 older Canadians. Attitudinal measures included the Aging Attitudes Questionnaire (assesses older adults' attitudes toward other older adults), Fraboni Scale of Ageism (assesses younger adults' attitudes toward older adults) and the Reactions to Aging Questionnaire (assesses attitudes toward one's own aging), as well as a scale measuring knowledge of aging, the Facts on Aging Quiz, adapted for Australia and Canada. Responses on the three attitudinal measures were subjected to principal components analysis.
   ResultsTwo components emerged in both samples, one defined by the Reactions to Aging Questionnaire and Aging Attitudes Questionnaire scales and the second by the Fraboni Scale of Ageism scales. Regression analyses to ascertain prediction of scores on the Facts on Aging Quiz, adapted for Australia and Facts on Aging Quiz, adapted for Canada showed that only the Aging Attitudes Questionnaire scale for Physical Changes predicted scores on the Facts on Aging Quiz, adapted for Australia and no attitudes predicted Facts on Aging Quiz, adapted for Canada scores.
   ConclusionsIt appears that older adults distinguish between their own aging and aging in others. Knowledge of aging appears to be predicted only by attitudes toward physical changes. Given increasing proportions of older adults in the population, as well as increasing access to aging information available to older cohorts, continued research on how older adults view themselves and the aging process is important, and will almost certainly continue to evolve over time.

AB  - To date very little literature exists examining theoretically-based models applied to day-to-day positive and negative affective well-being among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Grounded in the perspective of Meyer, I. H. (2003). Prejudice, social stress, and mental health in lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations: Conceptual issues and research evidence. Psychological Bulletin, 129, 674-697. Minority Stress Model, the present study examined HIV- and sexual orientation-related factors influencing affective well-being (i.e., positive affect, negative affect, life satisfaction, and stress). Participants were 154 HIV-positive LGB adults from an urban area in the southwestern United States. Data were drawn from an archival database (i.e., Project Legacy). The study methodology featured a cross-sectional self-report survey of minority stress, victimization, coping, and emotional well-being, among other subjects. Primary regression results were: (1) males reported less general stress than females; (2) higher internalized HIV-related stigma was associated with elevated negative affect; (3) higher internalized homophobia was associated with elevations in negative affect and general stress; (4) higher coping self-efficacy was associated with lesser negative affect, lesser general stress, greater positive affect, and greater satisfaction with life; (5) a significant interaction between HIV-related victimization and coping self-efficacy showed that coping self-efficacy was positively associated with positive affect only (only for non-victims). Contrary to expectations, coping self-efficacy demonstrated the largest main effects on affective well-being. Results are discussed with regard to potential need for theoretical refinement of Minority Stress Model applied to PLWHA and affective well-being outcomes. Recommendations are offered for future research.

AB  - A best evidence topic in thoracic surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was whether intraoperative conversions to thoracotomy have an impact on long-term survival for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy initially. A total of 461 papers were found using the reported search, of which 6 retrospective cohort studies represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, date of publication, journal, country of the authors, patient group, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers were tabulated. Five cohort studies clarified that conversion did not compromise long-term survival, whereas 1 cohort study reported worse long-term outcomes after conversion to thoracotomy. However, the limited samples, different characteristics between groups and selection bias due to inherent design made it difficult to make a conclusion. Based on the current evidence, we concluded that intraoperative conversion from video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) to thoracotomy for non-small-cell lung cancer might not impact long-term survival compared to a successful VATS lobectomy. In-hospital mortality might not be prejudiced, whereas longer hospitalizations were observed. However, whether conversion would adversely affect postoperative complication rates remained unclear because of the conflicting results. Moreover, 3 studies reported no statistical differences in short- and long-term survival between emergency and non-emergency conversions. Therefore, we suggest that thoracic surgeons should not hesitate to convert VATS into thoracotomy in the case of blood vessel injury or difficult hilum.
   A best evidence topic was constructed according to a structured protocol.

AB  - Background: Nurses must be highly knowledgeable and skilled regarding pain and its management to ensure optimal pain relief. However, nurses worldwide were found to have knowledge deficits and poor attitudes toward pain. Thus identifying the major areas of knowledge deficit regarding pain and incorporating these areas in nursing undergraduate education and nursing continuing training could improve nurses' knowledge and attitude toward pain.
   Aims: The purpose of this study was to assess Jordanian nurses' knowledge and attitude toward pain using the Nurses' Knowledge and Attitudes Survey (NKAS) and to identify the areas of deficit in nursing knowledge toward pain among Jordanian nurses.
   Design: Cross sectional descriptive study.
   Settings: Four Jordanian hospitals (governmental, private, teaching and royal medical services).
   Participants/Subjects: Nurses working in intensive care units (ICUs), emergency department, and surgical, medical and oncology wards in.
   Methods: This descriptive study used data from 417 nurses who completed the NKAS tool. The passing score for the NKAS survey was individually calculated for each nurse. Moreover, we examined each item to identify the percentage of correct answers for each of the 39 questions.
   Results: The percentage of correct response ranged from 18% to 92%. Only four nurses achieved an overall score of 80% or greater and none of them achieved a 100% correct response. We revealed extensive knowledge deficits among Jordanian nurses, particularly in pain assessment and its pharmacotherapeutics components. Moreover, we found that Jordanian nurses held many negative attitudes and misconceptions about pain.
   Conclusions: Insufficient knowledge and attitudes among nurses toward pain is a worldwide problem. However, recognizing the areas of knowledge deficit and establishing educational interventions based on these deficits could improve nurses' knowledge and attitudes regarding pain and their clinical practice.

AB  - Purpose: The study aims to analyse the reasons underpinning women's refusal to undertake Down's syndrome screening (DSS) by maternal serum testing (MST).Methods: A retrospective, mixed methods sequential approach was used. An online survey on women's experience of prenatal testing followed by in-depth interviews were conducted, with women over 18 years old, who had been pregnant within five years prior to the study. Altogether, 1726 responses were gathered, of which 217 related to women who had refused MST. The study compares the women who refused MST with women who accepted it on sociodemographic characteristics, the evolution and experience of the pregnancy, their knowledge about Down's syndrome (DS). It also utilises survey comments and five in-depth interviews to explore, using Thematic Analysis, the reasons for refusing MST.Results: To refuse MST is cognitively demanding. Indeed, women who refused MST were better educated, knew more about prenatal diagnosis sequences and DS than women who accepted it. This position is also emotionally challenging as women's interactions with practitioners can put them in difficult situations, where they have to defend their point of view. Reasons for refusing MST go beyond religious beliefs, negative attitudes towards abortion and/or medicalisation of pregnancy. Rather, women's position appears to be driven by a holistic conception of care-based monitoring, values of inclusivity and a desire to remain in control of their pregnancy. Conclusions: It is essential that women feel accepted and supported in their choice to refuse MST. Consequently, it is important for professionals to remain cognisant of the diversity of factors underpinning women's decision, the pressure this position generates and the challenges that come with it.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Problematic alcohol-use affect the physical and mental well-being of hospitalised individuals and may receive screening and brief-intervention during treatment. Non-psychiatric doctors and nurses might respond inadequately due to negative attitudes and beliefs. This study aimed to examine these attitudes of non-psychiatric workers in the medical and surgical wards.
   METHODS: A total of 457 doctors and 1643 nurses were recruited from the medical, surgical and orthopaedic disciplines over a period of 4 months. Three questionnaires were administered: demographics, Alcohol & Alcohol-Problems Perceptions Questionnaire (AAPPQ) and Staff Perception of Alcohol Treatment Resources.
   RESULTS: About 128 doctors and 785 nurses responded. Around 75.5% doctors and 51.9% nurses endorsed role-legitimacy in the AAPPQ. Both the doctor (86.7%) and nurse (77.6%) groups agreed on the importance to initiate intervention for patients with problematic alcohol-use in daily work. Both groups were sceptical and negative towards these patients endorsing low-level role-adequacy (41.2%), role-support (36.9%), motivation (36.5%), task-specific self-esteem (25.1) as well as work satisfaction (20.5%).
   CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION: Doctors and nurses demonstrated low levels of therapeutic commitments towards patients with problematic alcohol-use thereby necessitating the introduction of in-house programmes to educate, empower and emphasise the importance of therapeutic contact with patients for alcohol intervention.
   SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: The prompt identification and treatment of patients with alcohol problems are contingent on the workers' attitudes towards them. This study's results should spark a nation-wide interest to improve the training and recognition of such patients and providing adequate educational resources.

AB  - Background: The prevailing sex education (SE) model falls within a neoliberal prevention- and risk-oriented paradigm. This model ignores the identity dimension of sexuality, is based on the cis-heteronormative and ethnocentric matrix and stigmatizes sexual and cultural diversity; this has significant consequences for sexually and culturally diverse adolescents and youth. In this study, we explored the potential of the identity dimension of SE to prevent violence toward sexual and cultural diversity. Specifically, our objective was to identify the influence of heteronormative and ethnocentric variables on violence exerted against trans* and gender-diverse people and people from minority ethnic groups. Methods: A total of 623 Spanish adolescents with a mean age of 14.73 years and an age range of 13 to 18 years participated in the study. Students completed a questionnaire that included measures regarding violence toward sexual and cultural diversity, gender stereotypes, sexist attitudes and rejection of sexual and cultural diversity. We performed two hierarchical linear regression models. Results: Students who exerted the highest amount of violence toward trans* and gender-diverse people were those who showed the lowest endorsement of expressive traits and the highest endorsement of instrumental traits as well as the highest level of hostile sexist, heteronormative and hostile racist attitudes (the five predictor variables explained 29.1% of the variance of gender-bashing). These same variables-except expressiveness-and benevolent sexism explained 46.1% of the variance of rejection of minority ethnic groups. Conclusions: There is a need for a comprehensive, intercultural, critical and queer SE aimed at transforming the classroom into a space that promotes social transformation through an educational practice that is transgressive and critical of cis-heteronormativity and normative ethnocentrism.

KW  - STUDENTS
AB  - ContextAttitudinal objectives are difficult to formulate, teach and assess; yet good attitudes are fundamental to good practice. For instance, studies highlight negative attitudes to disability in the medical student community that contrast with the self-conceptions of disabled persons. This study was designed to better understand attitudinal learning, inadequately addressed by contemporary programmes, through the application of Mezirow's transformative learning theory' (TLT) to a novel educational intervention.
   MethodsParticipating students went to sea, for voyages of 5-7days, in tall ships operated by the Jubilee Sailing Trust. Each student was buddied with another sailor living with disability. Disabilities included cerebral palsy, loss of sight, loss of limbs and paraplegia. Students recorded their experiences using audio diaries, written logs, formal voyage reports and art work and in post-voyage seminars. The data were analysed using interpretive phenomenological analysis, and the results are considered under five themes suggested by Mezirow.
   ResultsSixteen students were recruited, with four students sailing on each of four separate voyages. Each student recorded audio-diary entries, which had a total duration of between 10 and 212minutes. For seven of the 16 students, the five key elements of TLT were demonstrable, suggesting that transformative learning, as described by Mezirow, was occurring. Drawing on diverse qualitative data, insights into different aspects of this transformation areprovided.
   ConclusionsTLT can be used to characterise, and thus design, educational interventions to meet attitudinal learning objectives. Students can be helped to discover their less helpful frames of reference. In safe environments these frames can be challenged and subjected to personal and communal reflection. Drawing on audio diaries and other evidence, and in answer to critiques of contemporary medical teaching on disability, we demonstrate such transformation in students at sea with disability', highlighting elements that couldpotentially be transferred to the mainstream curriculum.

AB  - Objectives: Stroke survivors experience poor oral health when discharged from the hospital to the community. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based oral care training programme on knowledge, attitude, self-efficacy and practice behaviour of family caregivers. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted. The experimental group consisted of 48 family caregivers who received the home-based oral care training programme, and the control group consisted of 46 family caregivers who received routine oral care education. The outcomes were measured by the Knowledge of Oral Care, Attitude towards Oral Care, Self-Efficacy of Oral Care and Behaviour of Oral Care before the training programme, and at one and two months afterwards. The data were analysed using mixed model ANOVA to determine differences in the outcomes between the two groups. Results: The findings demonstrated that the intervention group had more knowledge (t = 8.80, P < 0. 001), greater self-efficacy (t = 3.53, P < 0.01) and better oral care behaviour (t = 11.93, P < 0.001) than the control group at one and two months, with statistically significant differences in oral care knowledge, self-efficacy and behaviour outcome over time. The attitude of the intervention group towards oral care practice was generally positive (mean of baseline and two month = 12.9 and 14.7), but no significant difference in attitude change between the control and intervention groups (t = 1.56, P = 0.12). The treatment interaction effect was significant for the family caregivers' behaviour of oral care at one and two months of the intervention for both groups. Conclusion: Our individualized home-based oral care education can achieve significant improvements in oral care knowledge and self-efficacy among family caregivers of stroke survivors, and it can sufficiently empower them to modify their oral care practices in a home-based healthcare environment.

T2  - BIOTECHNOLOGY LAW REPORT
LA  - English
AB  - Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. (PacBio) sued Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Inc. and Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Ltd. (collectively, Oxford), accusing Oxford of infringing several of its patents, including U.S. Patent Nos. 9,546,400 and 9,772,323. The patents describe and claim methods for using nanopore technology to sequence DNA and other nucleic acids. A jury found all asserted claims infringed but also determined that they are invalid under 35 U.S.C. 112 for lack of enablement. The district court denied PacBio's motion for judgment as a matter of law (and for a new trial) on enablement. The district court also denied PacBio's request that the court grant a new trial because of Oxford's improper remarks during opening, remarks that included references to the potential applications of its accused products to the then-emerging global COVID-19 crisis. PacBio argued that the remarks caused prejudice that could not be remedied by the curative instruction the district court gave at PacBio's request. On appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed. Regarding enablement, the court noted that it is not enough that relevant artisans knew how to perform some "nanopore sequencing'' before the priority date of the patents, and that the jury had substantial evidence of non-enablement of the full claim scope. Notably, PacBio had no evidence of actual reduction to practice of its own that would undermine Oxford's evidence of non-enablement. As PacBio acknowledged, its reduction to practice was constructive only, i.e., took the form of its description in patent applications, without any accompanying real-world reduction to practice. The Federal Circuit did not see a basis for disturbing the district court's assessment that there was an insufficient likelihood that the improper opening remarks had an adverse impact on the ultimate verdict to justify a new trial in this case.

AB  - People diagnosed with schizophrenia (PDS) will find seamlessly coordinated services and care in their communities if they are delivered with a high level of continuity of care (COC). Most studies of COC were conducted in Western countries that initiated deinstitutionalisation several decades ago. Limited studies highlight experiences of COC among PDS who live in societies still heavily relying on institutionalised care, such as prolonged hospitalisation, like South Korea where PDS stay in psychiatric hospitals over 100 days on average. This qualitative study explored COC that PDS experienced in South Korea. We focused on cross-boundary COC, which refers to service coordination at a given moment, and longitudinal COC, which refers to care over a period of time. Twenty-one PDS completed in-depth interviews from June to August 2017. Fifteen participants were male (71.4%), and ages ranged from 26 to 71. We used grounded theory techniques for data analysis, including initial open coding, in vivo coding, constant comparison and axial coding. Findings include that PDS experienced poor longitudinal COC when discharge planning during hospitalisation was absent, which undermined their ability to live independently. Poor employment support effectively undermined recovery even if PDS worked hard to attain economic self-sufficiency. As for cross-boundary COC, poor communication between psychiatrists and providers offering psychiatric rehabilitation services was a barrier. PDS in general had difficulties locating needed psychiatric rehabilitation services in the community. The lack of COC appeared to arise from particular sociocultural contexts, including poor self-determination in consumer-provider relationships, families' lack of knowledge and support, and discrimination and prejudice. Despite experiences with discrimination, no participants appeared to have internalised messages that they are 'less than' those without mental illnesses. Findings highlight the significance of multi-pronged approaches to increase COC, which can effectively link PDS, families, psychiatrists and psychiatric rehabilitation service providers.

AB  - Gay panic refers to a heterosexual man violently responding to unwanted sexual advances from a gay man. In court, the defendant may argue he was provoked or temporarily insane. This study utilized 352 jury-eligible citizens to assess differences across mediums of gay panic. Participants were asked to read vignettes depicting a control, gay panic as provocation, or gay panic as insanity condition and provide verdicts and ratings of blame and responsibility. Participants also completed measures assessing political orientation and homonegativity. Data were analyzed via a MANCOVA, a chi-square goodness-of-fit test, and general linear modeling. Verdicts, victim blame, and ratings of responsibility differed across vignette conditions, with an observed leniency effect when gay panic was claimed in either context. Homonegativity also exacerbated patterns of prodefendant views, as participants higher in homonegativity assigned higher victim blame, lower defendant responsibility, and more lenient verdicts in the gay panic conditions. The effect of political orientation was nuanced, as only republicans in the provocation condition followed the anticipated pattern in rendering more lenient verdicts. Results provide additional support for the notion gay panic defenses may be, in part, fueled by political beliefs and prejudicial beliefs against persons of sexual minority status. Drawing from a justification-suppression model, it may be that in cases of gay panic, a context is created in which prejudiced ideologies can be openly expressed via leniency on the defendant. Implications may be relevant to future criminal law policies and practices, particularly advocacy and policy efforts, judicial training, and trial consultation to attorneys for juror selection and development of trial strategy.

AB  - A field study was conducted in the Italian context to examine the longitudinal effects of contact on improved intergroup relations, and to test whether the effects were different for majority and minority group members. Furthermore, we examined the processes underlying contact effects. Participants were 68 Italian (majority) and 31 immigrant (minority) secondary school students, who completed a questionnaire at two time points. The results of regression analyses showed that, consistent with the contact hypothesis (Allport, 1954), quantity and quality of contact longitudinally improved outgroup evaluation and increased the attribution of positive stereotypes to the outgroup; the reverse paths were non-significant. Notably, whereas quantity of contact improved intergroup attitudes and stereotypes for both majority and minority participants, quality of contact had reliable effects only for the majority group. Intergroup anxiety and empathy mediated the longitudinal effects of quantity of contact for both Italians and immigrants; the cross-lagged effects of contact quality on criterion variables for the Italian group were mediated by intergroup empathy. The theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Surplus Property occurs when some assets are retained by an entity, but they are not currently being fully utilized because they are obsolete, out of date or simply they are no longer providing the service they were built or procured for. Thus, these assets remain fully or partially idle. This is a typical effect affecting some public entities being Port Authorities one of them and Aids to Navigation one of their most affected properties. However, lighthouses are located in unique geographical locations, being widely visited spaces and with a high potential of attractiveness for new complementary uses. A stepped methodology to effectively manage public assets is presented with the goal of selecting those assets to be included in a Surplus Property Plan and to find the best suitable uses to be implemented in them. A real case on Ferrol - San Cibrao Port Authority located in the Northwest of Spain is presented in order to illustrate the practical application of such methodology in a set of lighthouses and other Aids to Navigation owned and managed by this Entity. Lighthouses and other aids to navigation can contribute to public coastal conservation goals if a structured plan is put in place. Otherwise, the contrary effect occurs and deterioration of these assets due to lack of use may prejudice severely the coast and public image of their owners, frequently Port Authorities. The methodology successfully used in Ferrol - San Cibrao Port Authority (Spain) can be easily extrapolated to other environments contributing to meet the Sustainable Development Goals included in the Agenda 2030 and other international commitments related to the conservation of cultural heritage as the Faro Convention of the Council of Europe.

Method Cross-sectional data from Health Survey for England (2014) were analysed using multilevel models. The exposure of interest was the deprivation level of the small area in which an individual resides as measured by Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) score. The primary outcome was an individual's overall attitude towards mental illness, measured using a 12 item version of the Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill (CAMI) scale. Further outcomes were the two subscales of the CAMI, reflecting attitudes of (1) prejudice and exclusion and (2) tolerance and support. Individuals were nested within household and small geographical area. Results 5820 participants were included. Results from unadjusted models found strong evidence that individuals residing in the most deprived areas of England have worse attitudes towards mental illness compared to individuals living in the least deprived areas (estimated difference = - 3.5 points; 95% CI - 4.8 to - 2.2; P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, education level, ethnicity and weekly income there was no longer evidence for this association (adjusted difference = - 0.1 points, 95% CI - 1.3 to 1.2; P = 0.931). Similar patterns of results were found for the CAMI subscales. Conclusions The relationship between small area-level deprivation and attitudes towards mental illness is no longer observed when controlling for certain individual-level characteristics.

AB  - While most of the more frequently used self-report measures of cultural competence in health professionals are targeted to practicing physicians and mental health providers from the majority-white population, no measures have been specifically developed for minority pharmacy students. With the objective to find a suitable tool to be used for curriculum development in cultural competence, this study applied a modified version of the California Brief Multicultural Competence Scale (CBMCS) to 467 pharmacy students at the Xavier University of Louisiana, a Historically Black University. Confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses were conducted to examine if the CBMCS factor structure was replicated using a modified tool and a different population and Cronbach alphas were calculated to determine internal consistency reliability. The CBMCS's original factor structure was not replicated, perhaps because of modifications introduced in the original tool or because of differences between the sample population in this study (minority pharmacy students) and the population used in the original CBMCS study (majority-white mental health providers). However, results show that a modified factor structure fits the data well. The primary difference between the factors found in this study and the CBMCS factors is the appearance of a new factor composed of three items related to interpersonal and racial dynamics, which includes racial discrimination, white privilege, and power imbalance. The significant relationships (p < 0.001) found between respondents' race and these three items suggest that the wording in these items should be modified when the respondents do not belong to the majority population. Results imply that racism, prejudice and bias are not just issues of the majority-white health providers and point to the need for more racially diverse samples. The unique results in this study advance research on racial dynamics and self-assessment of cultural competence of minority health professionals.

AB  - In this work the habitual behaviour of low pH in environmental organic trace analysis is challenged by investigating the full potential of building a multi-component UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS method adapted to cover common emerging contaminants of many different polarities, minimizing the elements of compromise in the performance of the final analytical separation and detection. Contributes have been made by taking advantage of common commercially available technology in understanding the impact from solvent components and the ionization of analytes which can facilitate future development of robust, sensitive and precise UHPLC-MS/MS methods. All contaminants were evaluated and optimized without prejudices regarding historical residence in terms of chromatographic conditions and ESI mode; increasing multi-method's flexibility that can be implemented in routine analysis in response to new requests as well as to emerging contaminants yet to be discovered. Our data strongly supports the questioning of the assumption that equilibrium concentrations of ions in solution reflect those produced during the electrospray process. ESI responses of [M+H](+) and limits of detection were comparable, or often better at high pH compared to acidic eluents. Presence of nitrogen basic groups such as tertiary and secondary amines in a compound increased the intensity of the ESI+ signal, and was even further elevated in basic eluent. The proton affinity probably changes for many nitrogen-containing compounds during the ionization process, making the gas-phase processes very important in generation of these ions by ESI+. There were also an unexpected large number of compounds showing their highest response at pH 7 and weak ionic strength. A flow optimized, buffert free, neutral UHPLC-MS/MS method enhanced the sensitivity for the environmental important synthetic hormone ethinyl estradiol significantly. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Universities have embraced a culture of inclusivity and diversity when recruiting students for professional degrees (degree study that is likely to result in accreditation to a profession-specific body). Gender, ethnicity, background and disability should no longer be considered a barrier to the offer to undertake study within a HE institution. Students identified as autistic are part of this group; however, anecdotally, when undertaking work-based learning (WBL), attrition rates are high. This phenomenological study examined the WBL experiences of undergraduate students identified as autistic who have chosen professional degree study. Despite the demonstration of immense personal attributes that any profession would value, this group faces discrimination and stereotyping of their persona. Research was conducted with participants all identified as autistic; drawn from a range of undergraduate professional degrees: policing, teaching, journalism, social work and psychology. A number of themes emerged that offer insight into the barriers for success for these individuals, and the personal cost of being autistic in organisations heavily influenced by a deficit model of disability. Points of interest This work examines the experiences of autistic university students on work-based learning placements as part of a professional degree. This research includes only the voices of autistic individuals, describing their experiences and the challenges they faced, rather than the thoughts and opinions of those who support students. This work offers insight into the prejudice faced by autistic individuals wanting to enter a graduate profession, the challenges they face, the efforts they make to appear 'normal' and the constant need to explain themselves in order to 'fit in'. This research suggests that students with autism can be of great benefit to their chosen profession. Autistic individuals display a strong work ethic, pushing against boundaries and displaying the courage to stand up and make a professional difference to other people's lives,

AB  - 'Nanako Nakajima in Conversation with Yvonne Rainer' was the document used during the lecture-conversation event that was held on 28 January 2019. Nakajima's innovative project 'Performative Exhibition of Yvonne Rainer's Work' was held at the Kyoto Art Theater (Shunjuza) from 11 - 15 October 2017 in collaboration with the postmodern choreographer and filmmaker, Yvonne Rainer, a co-founding member of the Judson Dance Theater in New York. Nakajima examines how various dramaturgies related to ageing and dance were interwoven into this exhibition in order to go beyond the typical dance presentation in a museum. Moreover, to reverse the current 'dancing museum' trend, this project revived the postmodern works of Rainer and combined their dramaturgical qualities with those of the traditional Japanese theatre for the purpose of connecting the past with the present. Nakajima explained her attempt to utilise archival materials to represent the postmodern oeuvre to the audience in Kyoto. She reconstructed stage sets and props of Rainer's legendary piece to demonstrate the working process on stage. Professional dancers of different ages and with varied training backgrounds were also employed to re-perform Rainer's seminal work of Trio A, including a Noh performer in his 80s. Inspired by the Noh performer in Trio A and Yvonne Rainer's Trio A Geriatric Version, Nakajima built up a dance dramaturgy and spectatorship of ageing, engaging with the premise of Trio A and the aesthetics of the Noh theatre. Nakajima's lecture was followed by a conversation with Yvonne Rainer, which revealed the condition and aesthetic prejudice of dancers regarding ageing in the American postmodern dance context that Rainer had been confronting. Rainer also discussed her private stories with the legends of American modern dance such as Ruth St Denis and Martha Graham by continuously returning to her own past and allowing her past to return to her.

AB  - Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) continues to be a pervasive health and social problem in the United States with serious short-and long-term consequences. Women in rural areas face particular challenges. Health care providers can play an important role in the lives of women who experience IPV; yet among providers, lack of knowledge, negative attitudes and beliefs, and low rates of screening are common. Objective: Though a large body of research exists regarding health care providers' IPV-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, little is known specifically with regard to rural providers. Given the challenges faced by rural women and the potential influence of their providers, it's important to understand rural providers' IPV-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. We conducted a study to learn more. Methods: Health care providers working in a large rural health network were asked to complete electronic surveys that examined their IPV-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Descriptive and correlational statistical analyses of the data were conducted. Results: A total of 93 health care providers returned completed surveys. In general the respondents demonstrated good overall knowledge, judicious attitudes, and beliefs congruent with the available evidence related to IPV. Of concern were their knowledge and practice gaps regarding the prevalence of IPV, the higher risk of injury faced by women who leave their abusers, the ability of women to make appropriate choices about their situations, and what actions to take when someone discloses abuse. Conclusion: The results of this study were encouraging with regard to the IPV-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of rural health care providers. But the findings also indicated important knowledge and practice gaps. Preparing providers to deliver compassionate, effective care to women who experience IPV is essential for the health and well-being of women and their families.

AB  - Background Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death among Cameroon women. The burden of cervical cancer is in part traceable to the inadequate understanding of socio-contextual determinants of access to screening and prevention opportunities. We explored multilevel individual, community and structural factors that facilitate or inhibit cervical cancer prevention in women at risk in a low-income, high HIV prevalence context. Methods We utilized an exploratory qualitative approach to obtain data through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews from May to August, 2018. A two-stage purposive sampling strategy was used to select 80 women and 20 men who participated in 8 focus group discussions and 8 in-depth interviews. The socio-ecological model guided data analyses to identify micro-, meso-, and macro-level determinants of cervical cancer screening. Results Micro-level factors including lack of awareness and knowledge about cervical cancer, lack of access to information, excessive cost of cervical cancer screening, low risk perceptions, and poor health seeking behaviors were major barriers for women seeking cervical cancer screening. Meso-level factors, such as social networks, socio-cultural norms, perceptions of the role of men and HIV-related stigma when screening is integrated into HIV care, also engender negative attitudes and behaviors. Macro-level barriers to cervical cancer screening included poorly equipped health facilities and a lack of national cancer prevention policies and programs. Conclusion In the context of the call for elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem, our findings highlight challenges and opportunities that should be considered when implementing interventions to increase uptake of cervical cancer screening in low-middle income settings.

AB  - Social adjustment, and feeling isolated, is one of the critical issues faced by the Hijra's from our society, due to sexual prejudices and stigmas. However, no one bothers how they actually feel, how they see themselves? The idea behind the paper is to identify the impact of looking-glass self (self-concept) on happiness, self-esteem, and satisfaction with life, among transgender from Hijra community, to accentuate the reality of how they feel, what is their self-concept, and its relationship with the mentioned constructs. The current study was conducted in India; snowball sampling is used to contact the respondents of the mentioned category, and variance-based structural equation modeling techniques on second-order construct, using two-stage approach, were used to study the relationships between the constructs used for the current study. The outcome of the study depicts that there is a presence of significant relationships between the mentioned variables, which show that the respondents are strongly maintaining their self-concept but that does not mean anyway that they are also happy and enjoying the social treatment given to them. This study is for the social workers, government as well as for the society, who pretends as a flag bearer of quality and promotes diversity in India. It will be an eye-opener for all those who really want to support such marginalized community as they have already achieved a place in the gender column under the gender category as other "Third Gender." The current study is original and contributes in understanding the truth behind the real journey of the mentioned community. How they feel, what they expect is still untapped; this paper will raise voice for them to contribute in respectful living in Indian society.

AB  - Background. Although terminal cancer is a widely used term, its meaning varies, which may lead to different attitudes toward end-of-life issues. The study was conducted to investigate differences in the understanding of terminal cancer and determine the relationship between this understanding and attitudes toward end-of-life issues. Methods. A questionnaire survey was performed between 2008 and 2009. A total of 1242 cancer patients, 1289 family caregivers, 303 oncologists from 17 hospitals, and 1006 participants from the general population responded. Results. A 6-month life expectancy was the most common understanding of terminal cancer (45.6%), followed by treatment refractoriness (21.1%), metastatic/recurrent disease (19.4%), survival of a few days/weeks (11.4%), and locally advanced disease (2.5%). The combined proportion of treatment refractoriness and 6-month life expectancy differed significantly between oncologists and the other groups combined (76.0% v. 65.9%, P = 0.0003). Multivariate analyses showed that patients and caregivers who understood terminal cancer as survival of a few days/weeks showed more negative attitudes toward disclosure of terminal status compared with participants who chose treatment refractoriness (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22-0.79 for patients; aOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.18-0.63 for caregivers). Caregivers who understood terminal cancer as locally advanced or metastatic/recurrent disease showed a significantly lower percentage of agreement with withdrawal of futile life-sustaining treatment compared with those who chose treatment refractoriness (aOR 0.19, 95% CI 0.07-0.54 for locally advanced; aOR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21-0.72 for metastatic/recurrent). Conclusions. The understanding of terminal cancer varied among the 4 participant groups. It was associated with different preferences regarding end-of-life issues. Standardization of these terms is needed to better understand end-of-life care.

AB  - Pro se plaintiff, a former employee of the University of Massachusetts (UMass), sued UMass and the Carnegie Institution of Washington (Carnegie) seeking to be added as a co-inventor to multiple patents generally directed towards RNA interference (RNAi), an invention that resulted in a Nobel Prize in 2006 for two of the named co-inventors, CraigC. Mello ofUMass and Andrew Fire of Carnegie. The plaintiff also soughtmonetary damages from UMass for this alleged omission. The U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon dismissed UMass based on sovereign immunity under the 11th amendment, and then transferred the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia after concluding that the Oregon court did not have personal jurisdiction over Carnegie. The DC court then dismissed the case in whole, after concluding that Carnegie would be prejudiced by UMass's absence from the case. The Federal Circuit affirmed, rejecting plaintiff's argument that UMass waived sovereign immunity when, in return for federal funding under the Bayh-Dole Act, it allegedly signed a contract controlled by and consistent with the Bayh-Dole Act and expressly declared that it would be amenable to suit in federal court. The court noted that the plaintiff could have amended his complaint to name UMass officials (to which sovereign immunity does not apply) as parties, but had failed to do so. In a concurring opinion, Judge Dyk pointed out that while ordinary property disputes between individual and state entities are resolved in state court, patent inventorship claims can only be resolved in federal court. While joining the majority opinion, Judge Dyk suggested that in a future case the court should determine how the federal joinder rules should apply to a claimfor inventorship, given the lack of any alternative remedy.

AB  - Whilst Parkinson's disease (PD) is typically thought of as a motor disease, a significant number of individuals also experience cognitive impairment (CI), ranging from mild-CI to dementia. One technique that may prove effective in delaying the onset of CI in PD is cognitive training (CT); however, evidence to date is variable. This may be due to the implementation of CT in this population, with the motor impairments of PD potentially hampering the ability to use standard equipment, such as pen-and-paper or a computer mouse. This may, in turn, promote negative attitudes toward the CT paradigm, which may correlate with poorer outcomes. Consequently, optimizing a system for the delivery of CT in the PD population may improve the accessibility of and engagement with the CT paradigm, subsequently leading to better outcomes. To achieve this, the NeuroOrb Gaming System was designed, coupling a novel accessible controller, specifically developed for use with people with motor impairments, with a "Serious Games" software suite, custom-designed to target the cognitive domains typically affected in PD. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the usability of the NeuroOrb through a reiterative co-design process, in order to optimize the system for future use in clinical trials of CT in individuals with PD. Individuals with PD (n = 13; mean age = 68.15 years; mean disease duration = 8 years) were recruited from the community and participated in three co-design loops. After implementation of key stakeholder feedback to make significant modifications to the system, system usability was improved and participant attitudes toward the NeuroOrb were very positive. Taken together, this provides rationale for moving forward with a future clinical trial investigating the utility of the NeuroOrb as a tool to deliver CT in PD.

AB  - The present studies investigated the out-group homogeneity effect in 5- and 8-year-old Israeli and German children (n = 150) and adults (n = 96). Participants were asked to infer whether a given property (either biological or psychological) was true of an entire group-either the participants' in-group ("Jews" or "Germans") or their out-group ("Arabs" or "Turks"). To that end, participants had to select either a homogenous or a heterogeneous sample of group members. It was found that across ages and countries, participants selected heterogeneous samples less often when inferring the biological properties of out-compared to in-group members. No effect was found regarding psychological properties. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the origins of intergroup bias.

KW  - FIELD
AB  - Background. We use Social Identity Theory as a theoretical framework, specifically focusing on strategies of identity management. The study is based on the following theoretical assumptions. First, identity management strategies might serve as mediators between different identity threats and behavioral patterns in intergroup relations. Second, identity management strategies help to make the shift from the individual to the group level of analysis, allowing us to take the consequences of intergroup behavior for a group entitativity into consideration. Third, identity management strategies strongly depend on the social context of intergroup relations.
   Objective. In the current study, we look into the relationships between identity management strategies of the ethnic Russian majority and their attitudes towards multiculturalism to identify whether certain strategies are helpful or harmful for the acceptance of multiculturalism in Russia.
   Design. We use Russia vs. the West comparison to evoke the perception of identity threat. We measure strategies of identity management based on this comparison, as well as attitudes towards multiculturalism in a survey of 307 Russian participants.
   Results. The findings suggest that identity management strategies are indeed related to attitudes towards cultural diversity and equality in Russia, as well as to acculturation expectations of whether minorities should adopt the mainstream Russian culture or keep their own. We find that strategies of individualization, individual mobility and assimilation have mostly negative consequences for acculturation expectations, as they all show patterns that support assimilation of minorities instead of integration. We also find support for the "scapegoat" hypothesis, showing that choosing the strategy of changing the comparison group results in more negative attitudes toward cultural diversity and equality for all in Russia. The strategies of social creativity (change of the categorization dimension, temporal comparison, comparison with a standard, etc.) seem to be irrelevant for attitudes towards multiculturalism.
   Conclusion. Our findings suggest that none of the strategies of identity management promote acceptance of multiculturalism. However, strategies of social creativity are the only ones that do not have negative consequences for support of multiculturalism. Theoretical and practical implications for multiculturalism policy adoption in Russia are discussed.

AB  - This review addresses the interplay between obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular diseases. It is proposed that obesity, generally defined by an excess of body fat causing prejudice to health, can no longer be evaluated solely by the body mass index (expressed in kg/m(2)) because it represents a heterogeneous entity. For instance, several cardiometabolic imaging studies have shown that some individuals who have a normal weight or who are overweight are at high risk if they have an excess of visceral adipose tissue-a condition often accompanied by accumulation of fat in normally lean tissues (ectopic fat deposition in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, etc). On the other hand, individuals who are overweight or obese can nevertheless be at much lower risk than expected when faced with excess energy intake if they have the ability to expand their subcutaneous adipose tissue mass, particularly in the gluteal-femoral area. Hence, excessive amounts of visceral adipose tissue and of ectopic fat largely define the cardiovascular disease risk of overweight and moderate obesity. There is also a rapidly expanding subgroup of patients characterized by a high accumulation of body fat (severe obesity). Severe obesity is characterized by specific additional cardiovascular health issues that should receive attention. Because of the difficulties of normalizing body fat content in patients with severe obesity, more aggressive treatments have been studied in this subgroup of individuals such as obesity surgery, also referred to as metabolic surgery. On the basis of the above, we propose that we should refer to obesities rather than obesity.

AB  - This study investigated the factor which influences rural women's income after participation in small-scale agricultural farming, their contribution to the household, as well as their empowerment status. This research was conducted in Jinaigati upazila of Sherpur district in Bangladesh. A total of 80 respondents (women) from this upazilla of Sherpur were selected purposively using simple random sampling. The quantitative data were collected by in depth interviewing of the 80 respondents through personal interview. The quantitative analytical tools used to attain specific objectives included various descriptive statistics, functional analysis, multiple regression co-efficient, used to identify the factors of influencing women's income through small-scale agricultural farming. Problem Confrontation Index (PCI) used through different problems identified scores. In accordance with the results of the educational level of woman, other sources of income, experience and training, access to credit, decision-making ability have an positive impact on rural women's income. These variables were statistically significant. From the Problem Confrontation Index, it was found that lack of capital was the first ranked problem, need-based training the second ranked problem, high interest rate the third ranked problem, insufficient farm size the fourth ranked problem, and lack of quality of seed the fifth ranked problem. Their income from this brought remarkable positive change in their life and they had better control over their decisions and income. Finally, their active economical participation in small-scale farming assists them to overcome prejudice, socio-economic barriers, and highest empowerment attainment in the context of Bangladesh-and, if the government takes proper initiative in terms of gender policy, then rural women's income and livelihood status will be increased remarkably.

AB  - Background. The endemic nature of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Sub-Saharan Africa is a significant public health problem that places health care providers (medical students inclusive) at increased risk of occupational exposure. However vaccination against HBV is not systematic among medical students in Cameroon. Thus, we sought to evaluate awareness and HBV vaccine coverage among medical students in Cameroon. Methods. Using semistructured questionnaire and a cross-sectional approach, medical students from 3 State Universities in Cameroon were evaluated for their knowledge, attitudes, and vaccination status against the HBV. Data were collected over a 3-month period. HBV vaccine status was defined as complete (3 doses), partial (1 and 2 doses), and unvaccinated. Data were entered and analyzed using Epi-info 7. Results. There were 714 respondents among whom 186 (26.05%) had been vaccinated at least once against HBV. Sixty-six (9.24%) were partially vaccinated and 120 (16.81%) completely vaccinated. No student had done postvaccination serologic testing to confirm full immunisation. Eighty-three percent (83.00%) of respondents had adequate knowledge on HBV infection and vaccine, while 90.00% had adequate knowledge on HBV transmission. Most medical students had a positive attitude towards the HBV vaccine. The most common negative attitudes were worries about the side effects and fears of being infected by the vaccine. Conclusion. Despite adequate knowledge on HBV infection and vaccination only about 1 in 6 medical students had completed the HBV vaccination series. This highlights the need for better health policies aimed at increasing access and coverage of the HBV in at-risk populations like medical students.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes of patient relatives about organ donation for patients with brain death diagnosis and to identify the cause of negative attitudes related to donation.
   Methods: A retrospective examination was made of the archived records of patients with brain death (BD) diagnosis from September 2007 to August 2018 in Anesthesia Reanimation Intensive Care Unit. Demographic factors of the cases with BD such as age, gender, and admission diagnosis were recorded. The patient families were then contacted by telephone and organ donation acceptance or rejection was assessed in terms of reasons.
   Results: A total of 86 cases with brain death diagnosis were identified. When cases were assessed in terms of admission diagnoses, post-CPR hypoxic brain was the most common diagnosis (30.2%). The organ donation rate was identified as 12.8% (n=11). The mean age of patients was 31.09 +/- 20.98 years in those who donated organs, and 35.62 +/- 21.45 years in those whose families rejected donation (p=0.614). When the factors causing brain death of patients with organ donation were assessed, 54.4% died due to traumatic reasons. The two most important factors identified in the study for families rejecting organ donation were religious beliefs (41.3%) and beliefs about not disrupting the integrity of the body after death (37.3%). The most important factor for acceptance was the wish to help other people (91%).
   Conclusion: In our study, religious beliefs were found as the main reason for rejection of organ donation. To be able to increase cadaver-sourced donation rates, there is a need for society to be informed by religious leaders, family interviews should be held with an experienced and trained organ donation co-ordinator and families should definitely be fully informed about the sensitivity shown to bodily integrity during the organ donation procedure and surgical procedures.

Furthermore, there is minimal published research examining the process of policy and guideline development, that is, the translation of published research to usable practice guidance.
   Aims: The aims of phase three of a larger study were to explore midwives knowledge, experiences and support for the option of water immersion for labour and birth in practice and their involvement, if any, in development of policy and guidelines pertaining to the option.
   Methods: Phase three of a three phased mixed methods study included a web based survey of 234 Australian midwives who had facilitated and/or been involved in the development of policies and/or guidelines relating to the practice of water immersion.
   Findings: Midwives who participated in this study were supportive of both water immersion for labour and birth reiterating documented benefits of reduced pain, maternal relaxation and a positive birth experience. The most significant concerns were maternal collapse, the difficulty of estimating blood loss and postpartum haemorrhage whilst barriers included lack of accredited staff, lifting equipment and negative attitudes. Midwives indicated that policy/guideline documents limited their ability to facilitate water immersion and did not always to support women's informed choice.
   Conclusion: Midwives who participated in this study supported the practice of water immersion reiterating the benefits documented in the literature and minimal risk to the woman and baby.
   Ethical considerations: The Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of South Australia approved the research. (c) 2017 Australian College of Midwives. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Negative attitudes and discrimination against Latinos exist in the dominant U.S. culture and in healthcare systems, contributing to ongoing health disparities.
   This article provides findings of a pilot test of Yo Veo Salud (I See Health), an intervention designed to positively modify attitudes toward Latinos among medical trainees. The research question was: Compared to the comparison group, did the intervention group show lower levels of implicit bias against Latinos versus Whites, and higher levels of ethnocultural empathy, healthcare empathy, and patient-centeredness?
   We used a sequential cohort, post-test design to evaluate Yo Veo Salud with a sample of 69 medical trainees. The intervention setting was an academic medical institution in a Southeastern U.S. state with a fast-growing Latino population. The intervention was delivered, and data were collected online, between July and December of 2014.
   Participants in the intervention group showed greater ethnocultural empathy, healthcare empathy, and patient-centeredness, compared to the comparison group. The implicit measure assessed four attitudinal dimensions (pleasantness, responsibility, compliance, and safety). Comparisons between our intervention and comparison groups did not find any average differences in implicit anti-Latino bias between the groups. However, in a subset analysis of White participants, White participants in the intervention group demonstrated a significantly decreased level of implicit bias in terms of pleasantness. A dose response was also founded indicating that participants involved in more parts of the intervention showed more change on all measures.
   Our findings, while modest in size, provide proof of concept for Yo Veo Salud as a means for increasing ethno-cultural and physician empathy, and patient-centeredness among medical residents and decreasing implicit provider bias toward Latinos. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stigma related to mental health and substance use (MHSU) is a well-established construct that describes how inequitable health outcomes can result from prejudice, discrimination, and marginalization. Although there is a body of literature on educational approaches to reduce stigma, antistigma education for MHSU has primarily focused on stigma at the social, interpersonal/public, and personal (self-stigma) levels, with little attention to the problem of structural stigma. Structural stigma refers to how inequity is manifested through rules, policies, and procedures embedded within organizations and society at large. Structural stigma is also prominent within clinical learning environments and can be transmitted through role modeling, resulting in inequitable treatment of vulnerable patient populations. Addressing structural stigma through education, therefore, has the potential to improve equity and enhance care. A promising educational approach for addressing structural stigma is structural competency, which aims to enhance health professionals' ability to recognize and respond to social and structural determinants that produce or maintain health disparities. In this article, the authors propose a framework for addressing structural MHSU stigma in health professions education that has 4 key components and is rooted in structural humility: recognizing structural forms of stigma; reflecting critically on one's own assumptions, values, and biases; reframing language away from stereotyping toward empathic terms; and responding with actions that actively dismantle structural MHSU stigma. The authors propose evidence-informed and practical suggestions on how structural competency may be applied within clinical learning environments to dismantle structural MHSU stigma in organizations and society at large.

AB  - Objectives: Several studies indicate that general practitioners (GPs) are not taking the issue of obesity as seriously as they should. Therefore, the aim of this study was to understand GPs' views about obesity and obese people and how these professionals perceive their role in the treatment of this disease.
   Study design: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews.
   Methods: Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with Portuguese GPs. Data were analyzed according to thematic analysis procedures.
   Results: GPs are negative about their own role in obesity treatment. Although they believe it is part of their job to advise obese patients on the health risks of obesity, the majority of doctors think they are not making any difference in getting their patients to make long term lifestyle changes. GPs hold negative attitudes towards these patients blaming them for being unmotivated and non-compliant and are also pessimistic about their ability to lose weight. Doctors are facing a dilemma in their practices: they want to play an active role but, due to a set of negative beliefs and perceived barriers, they are playing a relatively passive role, feeling defeated and unmotivated, which is reflected in a decrease of efforts and a willing to give up on most of the cases.
   Conclusions: This issue should be taken in to account during physicians' education since doctors should be aware of how their own beliefs and attitudes influence their behaviour and practices, compromising, therefore, the adherence to and the success in obesity treatment. They seem to need more precise guidelines and better tools for screening and management of obesity, more referral options, and improved coordination with other specialities.

AB  - Whilst common sense knowledge has been well researched in terms of intelligence and (in particular) artificial intelligence, specific, factual knowledge also plays a critical part in practice. When it comes to testing for intelligence, testing for factual knowledge is, in every-day life, frequently used as a front line tool. This paper presents new results which were the outcome of a series of practical Turing tests held on 23rd June 2012 at Bletchley Park, England. The focus of this paper is on the employment of specific knowledge testing by interrogators. Of interest are prejudiced assumptions made by interrogators as to what they believe should be widely known and subsequently the conclusions drawn if an entity does or does not appear to know a particular fact known to the interrogator. The paper is not at all about the performance of machines or hidden humans but rather the strategies based on assumptions of Turing test interrogators. Full, unedited transcripts from the tests are shown for the reader as working examples. As a result, it might be possible to draw critical conclusions with regard to the nature of human concepts of intelligence, in terms of the role played by specific, factual knowledge in our understanding of intelligence, whether this is exhibited by a human or a machine. This is specifically intended as a position paper, firstly by claiming that practicalising Turing's test is a useful exercise throwing light on how we humans think, and secondly, by taking a potentially controversial stance, because some interrogators adopt a solipsist questioning style of hidden entities with a view that it is a thinking intelligent human if it thinks like them and knows what they know. The paper is aimed at opening discussion with regard to the different aspects considered.

AB  - A quest orientation to religion is characterized by a search for answers to complex existential questions, a perception of religious doubt as positive, and an openness to change one's religious views as one grows and changes. This orientation is inversely related to fundamentalism, authoritarianism, and prejudice and directly related to cognitive complexity, openness to experience, and prosociality. To date, the neural correlates of religious quest have not been investigated. This study assessed the relationships between measures linked to white-matter integrity and quest religious orientation among 24 healthy participants using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and the quest scale. A tract-based spatial statistical analysis whole-brain-corrected initially employing an accepted threshold (p(TFCE) < 0.05) and then applying a Bonferroni correction (p(TFCE) < 0.0042) identified a region of the genu of the corpus callosum as showing radial diffusivity measures being related to openness to change religious beliefs. When not employing a Bonferroni correction (p(TFCE) < 0.05), the openness-to-change subscale of the quest scale negatively correlated with radial diffusivity and mean diffusivity measures in extensive white-matter regions in both hemispheres that include the corpus callosum body, genu, and splenium, superior longitudinal fasciculus, forceps minor, external capsule, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. No relationships were found with the other subscales. These findings suggest that a greater openness to change one's religious views is associated with better white-matter integrity specifically in the genu of the corpus callosum and likely in a more extensive set of white-matter structures interconnecting widespread cortical and subcortical regions in the brain across hemispheres. They, furthermore, suggest structural similarities that may link this tendency to associated positive psychological traits, including creative cognition and post-traumatic growth.

AB  - Aims and objectivesThis paper examines the qualitative results of two studies of Black African new settler communities in New Zealand. The analysis investigates the issues of stigma and microaggressions and their effects on Black African communities.
   BackgroundPrevious work that investigated experiences of stigma faced by relatively early Black African new settlers to New Zealand found that new settlers experienced stigma, and their resulting isolation had negative implications for access to health and social services, regardless of HIV status.
   DesignThis paper is a meta-analysis of two published studies, using original qualitative data from each.
   MethodsResearchers for the first study, Standing in the Fire, interviewed 13 Black Africans living with HIV who were new settlers to New Zealand. The second study, AfricaNZ Care, was a national mixed method study which surveyed 703 Black African new settlers, and included 131 participants in 23 different focus groups. The present analysis includes only the qualitative data from the second study. Some, but not most, participants of the second study were living with HIV.
   ResultsBlack African identity is used as a proxy for HIV status among non-HIV specialist health care workers. Participants reported experiences of stigma and microaggressions based on their race, and a lack of knowledge about HIV in non-HIV specialist nurses and other health care workers. They also experienced poor health care and education practices, professional prejudice against colleagues living with HIV and institutional challenges including failure to protect patient confidentiality.
   ConclusionsHIV-related stigma and microaggressions remain significant problems, not only for people living with HIV but also for those perceived to be at high risk for HIV.
   Relevance to clinical practiceExperiences of stigmatising behaviour by health care professionals have a broad and significant range of impacts on patients' health outcomes.

AB  - This study explores the factors contributing to the prolonged psychological distress of frontline nurses and physicians caring for COVID-19 patients in hospitals in Singapore and Japan. A cross-sectional survey between September and December 2020 yielded 1,644 responses (23.8%), from 62 nurses and 64 physicians in Singapore and 1,280 nurses and 238 physicians in Japan. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that significant risk factors for prolonged psychological distress included being a frontline nurse [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24-4.66], having an underlying medical condition (aOR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.22-2.46), experiencing prejudice because they undertook COVID-19 patient care (aOR = 3.05, 95% CI: 2.23-4.18), having trouble dealing with panicked or uncooperative patients (aOR = 2.36, 95% CI: 1.71-3.25), and experiencing an outbreak of COVID-19 in the hospital (aOR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.38-3.04). Factors inversely associated with psychological distress included age (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-1.00), number of beds in the hospital (aOR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.57-0.94), clinical practice of carefully putting on and taking off personal protective equipment in daily COVID-19 patient care (aOR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.37-0.73), and knowledge on COVID-19 (aOR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.72-0.94). These results could help us identify vulnerable healthcare providers who need urgent mental care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Measures that may reduce psychological strain include adequate supply of medical resources, education on precautionary measures, and communication strategies to combat discrimination against frontline healthcare providers.

AB  - The ever-increasing human migration with fast-eroding bonds often leads to development of social clusters which tend to produce stereotypes about other groups of people. One among the many factors responsible for such ghettoization is not ignorance but a version of knowledge that does not take us beyond ourselves. Speaking about the role of writer as "the conscience of the nation," S. Yizhar, an Israeli writer and politician, says that a writer is a mutation. Literature is one such powerful tool to transcend cultural boundaries which takes us beyond ourselves and reaches to the other side. Holding the case of Israeli-Palestinian contestation as one such manifestation of cultural ghettoization, the article argues for the need to render open the mental borders to move beyond prejudices. Taking A. B. Yehoshua's Facing the Forests as a point of departure, it highlights the potential of dialog as a powerful antidote to social violence between the two communities of Arabs and Israelis and lays bare its importance in the direction of peaceful coexistence.
   The article is divided into three sections; the first section introduces the cultural location of Yehoshua and his narrative set in the Israeli landscape of the 1960s. The second section explores the use of symbolism in the narrative to cull out the dormant meanings and analyzes the multiple layers of the text. The third and last section projects the idea of re-narrativization as an important tool of re-inscribing history with alternative versions. It draws strength from those Arab-Jewish encounters that are not necessarily troubling.The conclusion sums up the essential findings of the study, elucidating the role of literature and intellectuals in difficult times.

AB  - Aims To understand how the social patterns about death influence end-of-life care from the perspective of healthcare professionals.
   Design A qualitative study according to the theory of Glaser and Strauss.
   Methods A purposeful sample of 47 participants with different roles (nurses, physicians and clinical psychologists) were involved in four focus groups and 17 interviews in 2017-2019. Responses were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using computer-assisted qualitative data.
   Results A core category 'the theory of social patterns about death' emerged, which is explained by three categories: the culture of concealment and stubbornness towards death, the effort and internal work to make death a part of existence, and the influence of the social patterns of coping with death on end-of life care and healthcare professionals. Our results suggest that social coping with death is affected by a network of concealment and obstinacy towards death.
   Conclusion Recognizing death as part of life and thinking about death itself are social coping strategies. Although healthcare professionals occupy a privileged place in this process, the culture of concealment of death influences end-of-life care.
   Impact The social process that leads to the loneliness of the dying in our days has been theorized. However, social acceptance of death also influences healthcare professionals' attitudes towards death. Thus, healthcare professionals' own attitudes may affect the end-of-life care given to dying individuals and their families. The social patterns of death may contribute to the healthcare professionals' negative attitudes towards death. The concept of dignified death has been linked to the notion of humanization of healthcare. Death should be approached from a more naturalistic perspective by healthcare professionals, healthcare and academic institutions.

AB  - Aims. This survey explored issues of ethnicity and culture in nursing homes in one English region. Background. The older black and minority ethnic population in the UK is increasing, and this is the first detailed study of numbers of black and minority ethnic residents in nursing homes and of managers perceptions of their abilities to respond to residents needs. Design. Mixed methods. Methods. Date were collected in 2008. A postal survey was sent to all nursing homes in the region. A sub-sample of managers participated in semi-structured telephone interviews. Results. A hundred and one homes responded to the survey, and 13 managers were interviewed. One-third of homes had black and minority ethnic residents, and 95% had staff from these groups. Managers underlying philosophies of care were to treat each resident individually and not by category. It was felt that individualised care plans resulted in residents needs being met appropriately. Culturally sensitive care delivery varied. Some homes had established systems that were responsive to residents diversity, while others responded to the needs of black and minority ethnic residents on an as-required basis. Managers identified advantages in having staff from diverse backgrounds, although prejudice from residents towards staff emerged as a theme and managers responses varied. Staff training in the provision of appropriate end-of-life care was identified as a need. Conclusion. Black and minority ethnic residents form a small but growing minority of nursing home residents. Predicted increases in this resident group mean that managers must consider the delivery of culturally sensitive services. Future research is needed to explore the perspectives of black and minority ethnic residents. Relevance to clinical practice. Nursing homes in England are increasingly diverse communities, and staff training needs must be addressed to promote quality care for all residents.

AB  - Specialty palliative care (PC) is underused for patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD). We sought to examine attitudes of hepatologists and gastroenterologists about PC for patients with ESLD. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of these specialists who provide care to patients with ESLD. Participants were recruited from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases membership directory. Using a questionnaire adapted from prior studies, we examined physicians' attitudes about PC and whether these attitudes varied based on patients' candidacy for liver transplantation. We identified predictors of physicians' attitudes about PC using linear regression. Approximately one-third of eligible physicians (396/1236, 32%) completed the survey. Most (95%) believed that centers providing care to patients with ESLD should have PC services, and 86% trusted PC clinicians to care for their patients. Only a minority reported collaborating frequently with inpatient (32%) or outpatient (11%) PC services. Most believed that when patients hear the term PC, they feel scared (94%) and anxious (87%). Most (83%) believed that patients would think nothing more could be done for their underlying disease if a PC referral was suggested. Physicians who believed that ESLD is a terminal condition (B = 1.09; P = 0.006) reported more positive attitudes about PC. Conversely, physicians with negative perceptions of PC for transplant candidates (B = -0.22; standard error = 0.05; P < 0.001) reported more negative attitudes toward PC. In conclusion, although most hepatologists and gastroenterologists believe that patients with ESLD should have access to PC, they reported rarely collaborating with PC teams and had substantial concerns about patients' perceptions of PC. Interventions are needed to overcome misperceptions of PC and to promote collaboration with PC clinicians for patients with ESLD.

AB  - HIV/AIDS stigma and homophobia are associated with significant negative health and social outcomes among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and those at risk of infection. Intervedtions to decrease HIV stigma have focused on providing information and education, changing attitudes and values, and increasing contact with people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), activities that act to reduce stereotyped beliefs and prejudice, as well as acts of discrimination. Most anti-homophobia interventions have focused on bullying reduction and have been implemented at the secondary and post-secondary education levels. Few interventions address HIV stigma and homophobia and operate at the community level. Project CHHANGE, Challenge HIV Stigma and Homophobia and Gain Empowerment, was a community-level, multi component anti-HIV/AIDS stigma and homophobia intervention designed to reduce HIV stigma and homophobia thus increasing access to HIV prevention and treatment access. The theory-based intervention included three primary components: workshops and trainings with local residents, businesses and community-based organizations (CBO); space-based events at a CBO-partner drop-in storefront and "pop-up" street-based events and outreach; and a bus shelter ad campaign. This paper describes the intervention design process, resultant intervention and the study team's experiences working with the community. We conclude that CHHANGE was feasible and acceptable to the community. Promoting the labeling of gay and/or HIV-related "space" as a non-stigmatized, community resource, as well as providing opportunities for residents to have contact with targeted groups and to understand how HIV stigma and homophobia relate to HIV/AIDS prevalence in their neighborhood may be crucial components of successful anti-stigma and discrimination programming.

AB  - This article sets out an alternative approach to the assessment and regulation of technology and innovation, situated in and aiming at degrowth and building on an idea first put forward in the late 1970s by Langdon Winner called "methodological Luddism". Methodological Luddism does not have the original meaning of destroying machines, nor does it reflect a prejudiced attitude or a negative view of technology. As outlined in this article, it sets out to overcome the presumption that technology is value neutral and to lower the inflated expectations with which it is generally associated. Technology and forms of life are mutually interdependent, and this implies examining the constructive possibilities for withdrawing from some technologies and adopting others, while ensuring that their role is limited to means designed to achieve certain predefined ends. The article draws on the work of Hans Jonas and Albert Borgmann, authors yet to be acknowledged by the degrowth literature. Jonas' principle of responsibility is a response to the excessive prowess of modern technologies, while Borgmann suggests a reform of technology through focal things and practices. Building on these concepts, methodological Luddism advocates reassessing and reorienting technologies so that informed decisions may be taken as to how they should be designed and developed as means to socially equitable and ecologically sustainable ends. In this way the technological sphere may become an important ally in the transformative change in society which is required to fulfil the axiological parameters of degrowth. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has recently been classified as possible or probable. Although direct attributable mortality has been difficult to prove, delay in instituting appropriate therapy has been reported to increase morbidity and mortality. Recent literature suggests that in possible VAP, instituting directed therapy while awaiting microbiological culture does not prejudice outcome compared with best-guess empirical therapy.
   Objectives. To ascertain outcomes of directed v. empirical therapy in possible and probable VAP, respectively.
   Methods. Endotracheal aspirates were obtained from patients with suspected VAR Those considered to have possible VAP were given directed therapy following culture results, whereas patients with more convincing evidence of VAP were classed as having probable VAP and commenced on empirical antimicrobials based on microbiological surveillance.
   Results. Pneumonia was suspected in 106 (36.8%) of 288 patients admitted during January - December 2014. Of these, 13 did not, fulfil the criteria for VAR Of the remaining 93 (32.2%), 31 (33.3%) were considered to have probable and 62 (66.7%) possible VAP. The former were commenced on empirical antimicrobials, with 28 (90.3%) receiving appropriate therapy. Of those with possible VAR 34 (54.8%) were given directed therapy and in 28 (45.2%) no antimicrobials were prescribed. Of the latter, 24 recovered without antimicrobials and 4 died, 3 from severe traumatic brain injury and due to overwhelming intra-abdominal sepsis. No death was directly attributable to failure to treat VAR. No significant difference in mortality was found between the 34 patients with possible VAP who were commenced on directed therapy and the 31 with probable VAP who were commenced on empirical antimicrobials (p=0.75).
   Conclusions. Delaying antimicrobial therapy for VAP where clinical doubt exists does not adversely affect outcome. Furthermore, this policy limits the use of antimicrobials in patients with possible VAP following improvement in their clinical condition despite no-therapy.

AB  - In dryland Africa, access to land and water resources are central to pastoral livelihood activities. Policy intervention in these regions represents the outcome of concerted post-independence processes in which countries have committed to land tenure transformation as a policy objective. This was meant to create private, liberal property rights to replace communal customary tenure systems which were considered to be a constraint to development. Despite these efforts, decades of scientific research indicate that countries are still struggling to meet environmental sustainability objectives. Land degradation where it existed has not been halted and traditional pastoral livelihoods have been disrupted. The overall evidence base for policymaking remains weak as deficiencies in data or information on which management decisions were based led to poor policy performance. In a bid to strengthen understanding in this area, this study has a dual aim: 1. Using a systematic review of the literature, we examine the impact of land tenure transformation in pastoral areas in sub-Saharan Africa; 2. We analyse user-perspectives on land tenure transformation and pastoralists' rights in Ngamiland, Botswana, so as to draw out the salient issues that must be addressed in order to reconcile pastoral tenure conflicts and land management in sub-Saharan Africa. Results from meta-analysis and case study show that land tenure transformation policies across pastoral areas are subject to similar challenges and consequences. Protecting pastoral land rights requires deliberate policy interventions that recognise pastoralism as a productive and efficient use of resources. Policymakers need to overcome anti-pastoral prejudice and focus on Sustainable Land Management goals. This entails establishing negotiated and flexible tenure frameworks that strengthen pastoralists' participation in decision-making arenas by working with pastoral communities on the basis of understanding their livelihood system.

AB  - Background: The presence of family in the patient care area during resuscitation events is a matter of current debate among health care professionals in many communities. Family presence is highly recommended by many health organizations worldwide for several reasons including patient and family rights. There are no policies or guidelines in Saudi Arabia to guide health professionals in their practice regarding the option of family being present during resuscitations. The purpose of this study was to identify the attitudes of nurses towards family presence during resuscitation in the Muslim community of Saudi Arabia. Design: This is a descriptive survey using data from a convenience sample of 132 nurses using a self-administered questionnaire. The study took place in two major trauma centres in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia. Results: The analysis of the data revealed that nurses (n = 132) had negative attitudes towards family presence during resuscitation. A high percentage (77.2%) agreed that witnessing resuscitation is a traumatic experience for the family members. Almost all participants (92.3%) disagreed with the statement that the practice of allowing family members to be present during the resuscitation of a loved one would benefit the patient and 78% disagreed with the statement that it would benefit families. The majority of the participants (65%) revealed that the presence of family would negatively affect the performance of the resuscitation team. However, almost half of the sample (43.8%) would prefer a written policy allowing the option of family presence during resuscitation in Saudi Arabia. Conclusion: The findings of the study strongly suggest the need for the development of written policies offering families the option to remain with patients during resuscitation in Saudi Arabia. The study further recommends the development of education programs for staff and public for the safe implementation of the practice.

AB  - Rebranding men's dietary choices in the mind of the mainstream Australians to include more plant-based options, is a difficult task. Eating meat is a way to satisfy nutritional requirements but also has an embedded symbolism of power to which Australian men are accustomed. Vegetarian men are seen by the majority of the male population and the social discourse surrounding gendered food as betraying the social expectations about masculine behavior despite research showing the need for higher intake of fiber to reduce non-communicable diseases and improve planetary health. Those who have adopted vegetarian diets are exposed to ridicule and may face social isolation because of their unorthodox food choices. In order to reshape the meat consumption of men in Australia, we must recognize the gendered dynamics of dietary choices that associate meat consumption with masculinity. This research examines the power of the current food discourse and social constrains imposed on vegetarian men based on a 2019 survey in Sydney, Australia with 1053 male participants who have different frequencies of meat consumption. The participants were asked to express their opinion about vegetarian dietary choices, and the dominant view is that they provoke non-acceptance and various degrees of aversion. Instead of practicing overt dietary choices, those who embrace vegetarianism prefer to be unidentifiable as such to avoid social prejudice. While individual dislike may change over time, the current mass perception of vegetarianism is of unmanly behavior. A new role for institutions and policies related to public health, environmental wellbeing and use of resources in motivating a greater uptake of plant-based food choices, is also needed.

AB  - Several factors influence how we interpret the behavior of another individual. In the current study, we investigated the effect of level of animal empathy, as well as the level of experience with dogs, on the interpretation of dog behavior. Forty-seven veterinary students participated in the study. Each student filled out a printed questionnaire on their experiences and skills with dogs, and then completed the Animal Empathy Scale. They were shown five 2-minute videos of dogs, and asked to cross off 19 visual analogue scales after each video clip, assessing 19 adjectives for each of the dogs. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on all of the visual analogue scale scores for each of the five videos. For every PCA, one of the components retained related to aggressiveness. For students with no prior responsibility for a dog, animal empathy score showed significant inverse correlations with the aggressiveness-component for four of the five videos watched by the students (r = -0.38, p = 0.044; r = 0.39, p = 0.039; r = -0.38, p = 0.047; r = -0.51, p = 0.005). Animal empathy did not show any significant correlation with components related to other types of emotion or behavior. There was no effect of any of the self-reported skills with dogs on the interpretation of dog behavior, and having had a dog in the family as a child only had sporadic effects. These results indicate that people with a low level of animal empathy and no prior responsibility for a dog assess dog behavior and emotion related to aggressiveness as more pronounced than people with a high level of animal empathy. The results also point to possible interactions between animal empathy, experience with dogs, and interpretation of dog behavior.

AB  - CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Care for patients with disorders of sex development (DSD) should be provided in integrated-care centers by a multidisciplinary team. Implementation of this project within the teaching clinic routine presents several challenges: 1) difficulties in relationships between the medical team and patients and their families; 2) age, ethnic and cultural differences; 3) DSD-related prejudice; and 4) physicians' anxiety. We report on a psychologist's work strategy that focused on creating arrangements that could contribute towards development of the relationship between the medical team and patients and their families, as a way of preparing the clinical staff to manage treatment of adult DSD patients.
   DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective qualitative study.
   METHODS: Between February 2010 and April 2015, we conducted a qualitative study in the Adrenal Outpatient Clinic of Escola Paulista de Medicina (Sao Paulo, Brazil), based on interviews, team discussions and group dynamics with resident physicians, postgraduate students and attending physicians.
   RESULTS: Implementation of the project allowed residents to build a story of differentiated care for their patients, thus facilitating dialog between them and making it possible to address taboo topics. Sequential care provided by the same resident led patients to feel that their doctor cared for them, with individuality, continuity and a sense of interest in their story.
   CONCLUSION: Presence of a psychologist in the outpatient routine enabled inclusion of subjective factors in the routine of medical consultations, thus broadening the notion of healthcare for patients with DSD, facilitating bonds and providing support for difficulties faced.

AB  - Cross-border mobility has long been seen as a mechanism to promote a collective political identity; however, the results of empirical studies on young people have been inconsistent. The present work extends previous research on the effect of cross-border mobility by considering the effect of cross-border friendships drawing on the intergroup contact theory of Allport as well as the common ingroup identity model of Gaertner and Dovidio. This longitudinal study examines the role of cross-border friendships in the development of a sense of transnational political community that transcends national boundaries, i.e. the European Union. The results rely on a two-wave sample of 1294 Italian adolescents and young adults. Cross-border friendships significantly predicted identification as European, attitudes toward the European Union, political beliefs about the European Union, trust in the European Union, (negatively) political alienation, and political participation at the European level and intention to vote at the next European Parliament elections, even after including baseline levels of outcomes as well as relevant socio-demographic factors (i.e. gender, age, majority/minority status, educational qualification, parents' education level, family income, and socioeconomic status) in the model.

AB  - Background: Despite their disparately high HIV incidence and voiced willingness to use pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), Black cisgender women's knowledge and uptake of PrEP are low, especially relative to White cisgender women and men who have sex with men. Mounting evidence demonstrates that health care provider recommendations are a critical factor in women's awareness, willingness, and ability to uptake PrEP. Health care providers may make clinical judgments about who is (not) a good candidate for PrEP based on unconscious and conscious stereotypes and prejudice. Setting: We conducted an online experiment among N = 160 health care providers with prescribing privileges in the 48 HIV hotspot counties. Method: Providers received 1 of 4 vignettes about a PrEP eligible woman. Vignettes varied by patient race and substance use status. Then, providers reported their willingness to discuss PrEP with the patient and willingness to prescribe PrEP to her. Results: We tested 2 models predicting providers (1) willingness to discuss and (2) willingness to prescribe PrEP, contingent on their racial attitudes. Providers who scored high on a modern racism measure were less willing to discuss and prescribe PrEP to the Black patient. These effects were mediated by provider perceptions of patients' abilities to adhere to PrEP, but not their expectations of risk compensatory behaviors. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance of applying an intersectional lens in documenting the processes that exacerbate inequities in PrEP use. This study provides evidence to support the development of interventions that address the mechanisms that work to thwart optimal care.

AB  - Background: Stroke-related stigma can have a negative effect on patients, and is associated with stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination; however, the exact stigma experienced by patients remains ambiguous. Objectives: To evaluate the stigma experienced by patients with stroke, determine associated factors, and explore relationships between stigma and early rehabilitation. Methods: Overall, we examined 288 patients with stroke. Patient characteristics were determined through medical records and investigations, while stigma status (comprising total stigma, internalized stigma, and enacted stigma), depression level, functional independence, and functional outcome were also assessed. Demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated through univariate analysis, and significant variables were further analyzed through linear regression. The relationships between stigma and early rehabilitation (depression, functional independence, and functional outcomes) were also analyzed. Results: The sample's total stigma, internalized stigma, and enacted stigma scores were 47.76 +/- 18.00, 30.07 +/- 12.25, and 17.69 +/- 6.37, respectively. Employment status before stroke, caregivers, physical impairment, and number of impairments were all relevant to all types of stigma (P< .05). The regression analysis showed that caregivers and physical impairment are the two main predictors of total, internalized, and enacted stigma (P< .01). The correlation analysis revealed that stigma is associated with depression (r = 0.671 similar to 0.690, P< .001), functional independence (r = -0.562 similar to-0.707, P< .001), and functional outcomes (r = 0.436 similar to 0.637, P< .001). Conclusions: Stigma was moderate, and internalized stigma may be more apparent; therefore, physicians should pay more attention to patients who report or show signs of experiencing stroke-related stigma.

AB  - Introduction: More than one third of patients with eating disorders report NSSI. Moreover, negative attitudes and feelings toward the body, body dissatisfaction, and body image disturbances have been linked to NSSI in community and clinical samples. However, there is a lack of studies exploring NSSI frequency and functions and the specific relationship between multidimensional body image dimensions and NSSI in eating disorder patients.
   Objectives: First, we explored the frequency, types, and functions of NSSI in a sample of 226 Spanish female participants with eating disorders (ED). Second, we explored differences in NSSI and body image depending on the ED restrictive-purgative subtype; and third, we explored differences in body dissatisfaction, body image orientation, and body investment in eating disorder patients without NSS1 (n = 144), with NSSI in their lifetime (n = 19), and (b) with NSSI in the previous year (n = 63).
   Results: Of the overall sample, 37.1% (n = 89) had a history of self-injury during their lifetime, and 27.1% (n = 65) had self-injured in the previous year. Among the types of ongoing NSSI, the most frequent were banging (64.6%) and cutting (56.9%). Restrictive vs purgative patients differed on NSSI lifetime, Appearance Evaluation, Body Areas Satisfaction, Body Protection and Feelings and Attitudes toward the Body. Moreover, significant differences were found on Appearance Evaluation, Body Areas Satisfaction, Positive Feelings and Attitudes towards the Body, Body Protection, and Comfort with physical contact, between participants without a history of self-injury and both NSSI groups.
   Discussion: Body dissatisfaction and body investment have been found to be variables related to NSSI. Thus, the present study highlights the importance of working on body image in ED patients to reduce the frequency of NSSI. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is disagreement in the literature as to whether biological attribution increases or decreases stigma. This study investigated the effect of an online biological intervention on stigma and help-seeking intentions for depression among adolescents. A three-arm, pre-post test, double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) was used to compare the effects of a biological and a psychosocial intervention delivered online. Participants comprised secondary school students (N = 327) aged 16-19 years. Outcome measures included anticipated self-stigma for depression (primary), personal stigma, help-seeking intention for depression, and biological and psychosocial attribution. Neither the biological nor the psychosocial educational intervention significantly reduced anticipated self-stigma or personal stigma for depression relative to the control. However, a small increase in help-seeking intention for depression relative to the control was found for the biological educational condition. The study was undertaken over a single session and it is unknown whether the intervention effect on help-seeking intentions was sustained or would translate into help-seeking behaviour. A brief online biological education intervention did not alter stigma, but did promote a small increase in help-seeking intentions for depression among adolescents. This type of intervention may be a practical means for facilitating help-seeking among adolescents with current or future depression treatment needs.

AB  - Purpose We conducted a population-based study of epilepsy in Prey Veng (Cambodia) to explore self-esteem, fear, discrimination, knowledge-attitude-practice (KAP), social-support, stigma, coping strategies, seizure-provoking factors, and patient-derived factors associated with quality of life (QOL).
   Methods The results are based on a cohort of 96 cases and matched controls (n=192), randomly selected from the same source population. Various questionnaires were developed and validated for internal consistency (by split-half, Spearman-Brown prophecy, Kuder-Richardson 20), content clarity and soundness. Summary, descriptive statistics, classical tests of hypothesis were conducted. Uncorrected chi-square was used. Group comparison was done to determine statistically significant factors, for each domain, by conducting logistic regression; 95% confidence interval (CI) with 5% (two-sided) statistical significance was used.
   Key Findings All questionnaires had high internal consistency. Stress was relevant in 14.0% cases, concealment in 6.2%, denial in 8.3%, negative feelings in public in 3.0%. Mean self-esteem was 7.5, range 0-8, related to seizure frequency. Mean discrimination was least during social interactions. Coping strategies were positive (e.g. look for treatment). Postictal headache, anger, no nearby health facility, etc. were associated with QOL.
   Significance The reliability of our questionnaires was high. A positive social environment was noted with many infrequent social and personal prejudices. Not all populations should (by default) be considered as stigmatized or equipped with poor KAP. We addressed themes that have been incompletely evaluated, and our approach could therefore become a model for other projects.

AB  - Background: Nurse educators are exploring how mobile technology can support students in clinical practice. However, the view of nursing students on the use of smartphones and mobile applications (apps) to enhance clinical education has not been explored. Their opinions are vital to capture if the right technology is to be designed, evaluated, implemented and used.
   Method: A self-reported questionnaire, based on a review of the literature, was used to understand the opinions of undergraduate nursing students towards the use of smartphones and mobile apps to support learning in clinical environments. Descriptive statistics were utilised to describe participants and the mobile devices and apps they currently use. Thematic analysis was employed to code open-ended questions and explore students' perspective on how mobile apps can support learning and how best to implement and use them in practice.
   Results: Two hundred nursing students across a four-year Bachelor of Nursing programme responded to the questionnaire. Most reported owning a smartphone but just under half used mobile apps to help them learn in clinical practice. A range of educational apps such as calculators, drug reference guides and medical dictionaries were used with varying frequency. Nursing students reported numerous benefits of mobile technology such as better access to educational material, improvements in knowledge and confidence, and reduced levels of anxiety around learning in practice. Barriers such as negative attitudes of nursing staff, poor Wi-Fi connectivity, and the quality of educational content available on mobile apps were identified as some of the issues preventing the adoption of mobile learning in clinical nursing education.
   Conclusions: Nursing students have a unique perspective on how smartphones and mobile apps can support learning in clinical practice. Nursing faculty need to undertake more rigorous research to determine if mobile technology can improve learning outcomes, how best to personalise mobile apps to students needs and ensure both hardware devices and educational software can be integrated in practice to support clinical training.

AB  - Evidence-based practice (EBP) means integrating the best available scientific evidence with clinical experience and patient values. Although perceived as important by many psychotherapists, there still seems to be reluctance to use empirically supported therapies in clinical practice. We aimed to assess the attitudes of psychotherapists in Austria toward EBP in psychotherapy as well as factors influencing the implementation of EBP. We conducted an online survey. To investigate attitudes toward EBP, we used two subscales ("Limitations" and "Balance") of a translated and validated short version of the Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale-36 (EBPAS-36). Participants provided perceived barriers and facilitators as answers to open-ended questions. We analyzed the responses mainly using descriptive statistics. Open answers were analyzed using a thematic analysis. In total, 238 psychotherapists completed our survey (mean age 51.0 years, standard deviation [SD] = 9.9, 76.9% female). Psychotherapists scored on average 2.62 (SD = 0.89) on the reversed EBPAS-36 subscale "Limitations," indicating that the majority do not perceive EBP as limiting their practice as psychotherapists. They scored 1.43 (SD = 0.69) on the reversed EBPAS-36 subscale "Balance," indicating that psychotherapists on average put a higher value on the art of psychotherapy than on evidence-based approaches. Organizational factors such as lack of time and access to research studies as well as negative attitudes toward research and a lack of skills and knowledge kept respondents from implementing EBP. Our study highlights that EBP is still not very popular within the psychotherapy community in Austria. The academization of psychotherapy training might change this in the future.

AB  - Background In this study, we investigated the powerlessness of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), and described the structure of powerlessness that these individuals experienced. In order for patients to recover from this state, we recommend that they take steps to regain their power.
   Methods Fifteen Japanese adults with T1D participated in this study. Data were collected from all subjects between July 2013 and March 2014 via in-depth semi-structured interviews. Qualitative data analysis was conducted according to a grounded theory approach. Finally, the core category was identified, which allowed us to build a new powerlessness structure for T1D.
   Results The results suggested a core category, 'Wandering a tangled path,' comprising four categories, eight subcategories, and twenty-six concepts. These four categories were as follows: 'being burdened by T1D,' 'suffering from insulin-related troubles,' 'being unable to cope with difficulties in self-management,' and 'facing social prejudice.' In the state of powerlessness, negative emotional experiences snowballed, with patients feeling more and more depressed until they ultimately reached 'rock bottom.'
   Conclusion We found that as negative emotional experiences related to powerlessness increased, negative feelings intensified until the patients reached rock bottom. Powerlessness is like 'wandering a tangled path,' a state in which T1D patients struggle to cope with reality on their own when faced with both internal and external events. 'Wandering a tangled path' is at the core of powerlessness. A primary characteristic of the structure of powerlessness is suffering from confusing experiences. To help patients cope with T1D without being crushed by powerlessness, nurses must pay attention to signs of powerlessness. Powerlessness is not just an emotional state, but a combination of feelings, perceptions, and thoughts; therefore, it is important to comprehensively understand patients' narratives.

AB  - The stress of migration as well as social factors and changes related to the receiving society may lead to the manifestation of psychiatric disorders in vulnerable individuals after migration. The diversity of cultures, ethnicities, races and reasons for migration poses a challenge for those seeking to understand how illness is experienced by immigrants whose backgrounds differ significantly from their clinicians. Cultural competence represents good clinical practice and can be defined as such that a clinician regards each patient in the context of the patient's own culture as well as from the perspective of the clinician's cultural values and prejudices. The EPA Guidance on cultural competence training outlines some of the key issues related to cultural competence and how to deal with these. It points out that cultural competence represents a comprehensive response to the mental health care needs of immigrant patients and requires knowledge, skills and attitudes which can improve the effectiveness of psychiatric treatment. To reach these aims, both individual and organizational competence are needed, as well as teaching competence in terms of educational leadership. The WPA Guidance on Mental Health and Mental Health Care for Migrants and the EPA Guidance on Mental Health Care for Migrants list a series of recommendations for policy makers, service providers and clinicians; these are aimed at improving mental health care for immigrants. The authors of this paper would like to underline these recommendations and, focusing on cultural competency and training, believe that they will be of positive value. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Objectives Undiagnosed HIV presents great potential for the spread of infection. The authors identify the prevalence and correlates of never testing and being unaware of HIV infection in Beijing men who have sex with men (MSM).
   Methods Cross-sectional biological and behavioural survey using respondent-driven sampling; 500 MSM were included.
   Results HIV prevalence was 7.2% with 86.1% unaware of their infection; 33.2% had never tested. Never testing was associated with lower educational (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.6, 95% CI (CI) 1.1 to 2.5), living in Beijing for <= 3 years (AOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.3), unprotected anal intercourse with most recent male partner (AOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.4), being unaware of the most recent male partner's HIV status (AOR 3.6, 95% CI 2.1 to 6.1) and holding stigmatised attitudes towards persons with HIV (AOR 1.1 per scale point, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.1). Predictors of having undiagnosed HIV infection were being married (AOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.0 to 5.4), living in Beijing for <= 3 years (AOR 3.6, 95% CI 1.5 to 8.4), being unaware of the most recent male partner's HIV status (AOR 6.8, 95% CI 0.9 to 51.6) and holding negative attitudes towards safe sex (AOR 1.1 per scale point, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.1).
   Conclusions Recent attention has focused on HIV prevention interventions that depend upon knowing one's serostatus, including viral load suppression, prevention with positives, pre-exposure prophylaxis and seroadaptation. Until the low level of testing and resulting high level of undiagnosed HIV infection are addressed, these tools are not likely to be effective for MSM in China.

AB  - The stigmatization of people with pedophilic sexual interests is a topic of growing academic and professional consideration, owing to its potential role in moderating pedophiles' emotional well-being, and motivation and engagement in child abuse prevention schemes. Thus, improving attitudes and reducing stigmatization toward this group is of paramount importance. Prior research has suggested that narrative humanization-presenting personal stories of self-identified non-offending pedophiles-could be one route to doing this. However, this work has only been conducted with students or trainee psychotherapists, meaning the public generalizability of this method is still unknown. In this study, we compared two stigma interventions to test whether narratives reduce stigma toward people with pedophilic interests more effectively than an informative alternative (scientific information about pedophilia). Using a longitudinal experimental design with a lack of non-intervention control (initial N = 950; final N = 539), we found that narratives had consistently positive effects on all measured aspects of stigmatization (dangerousness, intentionality), whereas an informative alternative had mixed results, and actually increased perceptions of pedophiles' levels of deviance. These effects were still present four months after the initial presentation. We discuss these data in relation to ongoing debates about treating pedophilia as a public health issue requiring a broad societal approach to well-being and child abuse prevention.

AB  - Introduction Sexual minority women (SMW) may have different experiences of macro-level events, such as changes in marriage laws or election outcomes, related to their multiple identities. African American, Latina/x, and White identities intersect with gender/sex and sexual identity to influence experiences at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, social, and political levels of the socio-ecological environment. Methods Participants include 100 African American, 35 Latina/x, and 164 White SMW (N = 299) in wave 4 (2017-2019) of a longitudinal study of SMW's health conducted in the USA (Chicago Health and Life Experiences of Women Study). Responses to nine open-ended survey questions about marriage equality and the 2016 Presidential election were examined. Results Thematic analysis noted similarities across groups and focused on group differences in four areas: (1) personal well-being (including fear and anxiety about discrimination; risk associated with masculine presentation; and religion as stress and support); (2) interpersonal relationships (including relationships with partners, family, and in a community); (3) societal discrimination and prejudice (including harassment in public spaces and concerns about travel); and (4) civil rights, government harassment, and police-state violence. Conclusions Emerging differences emphasized the impact of race/ethnicity and the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender on experiences of marriage equality and the 2016 election. Policy Implications Findings suggest that a more nuanced understanding of the experiences of individuals with different racial/racialized identities and the intersection of race/ethnicity with sexual identities is essential to creating culturally competent and effective supports for SMW.

TI  - Police Responses to Diversity: A Social Representational Study of Rural British Policing in a Changing Representational Context

AB  - In the first decade of the 21st century, British policing faced two new challenges in how it responded to social diversity: As well as instituting reforms in response to a highly publicized report describing the British police as 'institutionally racist' (Macpherson, 1999), they faced challenges associated with rapid increases in numbers of immigrants into the UK. Studying social representations at such times of change allows access into processes, themes and value systems that may otherwise remain hidden. This paper uses social representations theory to explore interview accounts provided by regular police officers of interactions with members of minority groups. Empirically, we focus on an area of diversity policing that has received relatively little previous attention: Police work in a rural context that has recently played host to large numbers of migrant workers. Our analysis shows that interviews operate as a site of resistance in which respondents attempt to rework hegemonic representations of the police as prejudiced and to re-present themselves and their work as able to respond appropriately to diversity. Fairness as a defining characteristic of good police practice is a central representational theme that links identity construction processes to police work with minority groups. Recent immigrant groups are represented as both needing and deserving help to assimilate into British culture: Their lack of acculturation and language difficulties provide additional challenges to police work and to how this is judged as 'fair'. We discuss the broader origins and implications of police officers' understandings of fairness and the use of social representations theory to study representational fields within organizational settings.

AB  - Racial disparities in pain treatment pose a significant public health and scientific problem. Prior studies have demonstrated that clinicians and nonclinicians are less perceptive of, and suggest less treatment for, the pain of African Americans relative to European Americans. Here we investigate the effects of explicit/implicit patient race presentation, patient race, and perceiver race on pain perception and response. African American and European American participants rated pain perception, empathy, helping motivation, and treatment suggestion in response to vignettes about patients' pain. Vignettes were accompanied by a rapid (implicit) or static (explicit) presentation of an African or European American patient's face. Participants perceived and responded more to European American patients in the implicit prime condition, when the effect of patient race was below the level of conscious regulation. This effect was reversed when patient race was presented explicitly. Additionally, female participants perceived and responded more to the pain of all patients, relative to male participants, and in the implicit prime condition, African American participants were more perceptive and responsive than European Americans to the pain of all patients. Taken together, these results suggest that known disparities in pain treatment may be largely due to automatic (below the level of conscious regulation) rather than deliberate (subject to conscious regulation) biases. These biases were not associated with traditional implicit measures of racial attitudes, suggesting that biases in pain perception and response may be independent of general prejudice.
   Perspective: Results suggest that racial biases in pain perception and treatment are at least partially due to automatic processes. When the relevance of patient race is made explicit, however, biases are attenuated and even reversed. We also find preliminary evidence that African Americans may be more sensitive to the pain of others than are European Americans. (C) 2014 by the American Pain Society

AB  - Background: The International Labour Organization (ILO, 2000) has defined stress and exhaustion from working shifts and night work, and psychological and organizational stressors conditions that create health risks for surgical nurses. Among the OR nurses/ technicians 41.9% reported that causes of their stress included inadequate teamwork, ineffective communication, and especially surgeons' negative attitudes.
   Subjects and methods: The stuudie has been held in Clinical Hospital Centre Split, the sample consists of a total of 62 out of 109 possible respondents participated in the study. A total of 23 (37%) anesthesiology technicians and 39 (63%) ICU nurses / technicians participated in the survey. In the empirical part of this research, the importance of selected stressors was tested using quantitative methods in biomedicine.The existence of stress was tested by the Wilcoxon test.
   Stress level in the ICU was tested by T-test The analysis was elaborated in the statistical software STATISTICA 12. Conclusions were made at a significance level of 5%. The research was conducted through the questionnaire taken from the paper Milan Milosevi entitled: "Development of a measuring instrument of stress in the workplace hospital health professionals and an assessment of its use value" (2010).
   Results: Based on the empirical t value of 3.42 at 59 degrees of freedom the conclusion is that there was found a statistically significant difference in the level of stressors in the workplace between nurses / technicians in the ICU and anesthesiology technicians. The conclusion was reached at an empirical level of significance <0.001.
   Conclusion: The highest level of stress among medical staff is caused by the factor of insufficient number of employees, followed by work overload, inadequate material resources for work (financial constraints), poor organization at work, and the factor of poor communication with superiors.

AB  - Purpose To assess the level of knowledge and attitudes of nurses and midwives in Cyprus toward vaccinations and provide new insights into the determinants that influence them. Methods An online cross-sectional study was carried out during the period between December 08 and 28 2020. Participants included registered nurses and midwives working in public or private service provision. A self-administered questionnaire was used with questions about sociodemographic characteristics, questions assessing attitudes and beliefs toward vaccination, and participants' general vaccine knowledge. Findings A total of 437 responders answered the survey, with 93% being nurses and 7% midwives. Around two-thirds (67.3%) of the participants had a high vaccination knowledge, while the remaining have moderate (30.7%), and low (2.1%), respectively. Most of the participants agreed that by vaccinating they protect themselves and those around them (80.5%) and that when most people are not vaccinated, epidemics can easily initiate (74%). Oppositely, many participants disagreed with vaccination and avoided it due to a fear of injections (95.4%) or the belief that it is better to get sick rather than be vaccinated (69.1%). Neutral attitudes toward vaccine-mediated side effects (43.1%) and vaccination safety (41.7%) were observed. Sociodemographic factors such as age, educational status, and work setting significantly affected the nurses' and midwives' knowledge and attitudes toward vaccination (p < 0.05). Conclusions The findings indicate that the overall vaccination knowledge of participants was high, however, gaps in vaccination knowledge were observed. Individuals who adopted a neutral stance toward vaccination can be prone to changes either toward positive or negative attitudes. Implications for nursing practice The survey findings suggest implementing educational strategies and targeted interventions in clinical settings to enhance nurses' and midwives' vaccination knowledge and awareness.

AB  - Aim
   To investigate cycling participation and barriers, and facilitators in adults with a lower limb amputation in Thailand.
   Method
   Questionnaires were given to 424 adults with uni/bilateral lower limb amputation from mid-foot to hip disarticulation level at five public hospitals in Bangkok and prosthetic mobile units in Thailand. Participant characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. Variables associated with cycling (p<0.1) were entered in a logistic regression model.
   Results
   Participants who cycled (46.7%, N = 197), mostly used their walking prostheses (91.9%, n = 188). Of cyclists, 92.4% had cycled before the amputation. Cyclists started cycling after the amputation by themselves (86.7%) mostly in order to increase/maintain health (67.0%). Most cyclists cycled on quiet roads. The most frequent destination was shops/market (64.1%). More facilitators were reported than barriers. Most reported barriers were related to health problems and negative attitudes toward cycling. Most reported facilitators were related to perceived health benefits and positive attitude toward cycling. The likelihood of cycling after the amputation increased in people who cycled before the amputation, were amputated lower than the knee, used a prosthetic foot with axis/axes, were amputated due to trauma, had income higher than 415 euro/month, and who reported a higher numbers of facilitators.
   Conclusion
   After a lower limb amputation, nearly half of people cycled. People with a below knee amputation due to trauma with prior cycling experience and higher income tended to cycle after the amputation. People who perceived more facilitators were more likely to cycle. Although cyclists could use a walking prosthesis to cycle, a prosthetic foot with a greater range of motion than the SACH increased the cycling likelihood.

TI  - Discriminatory cardiac arrest care? Patients with low socioeconomic status receive delayed cardiopulmonary resuscitation and are less likely to survive an in-hospital cardiac arrest

AB  - Aims Individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) face widespread prejudice in society. Whether SES disparities exist in treatment and survival following in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is unclear. The aim of the current retrospective registry study was to examine SES disparities in IHCA treatment and survival, assessing SES at the patient level, and adjusting for major demographic, clinical, and contextual factors.
   Methods and results In total, 24 217 IHCAs from the Swedish Register of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation were analysed. Education and income constituted SES proxies. Controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, comorbidity, heart rhythm, aetiology, hospital, and year, primary analyses showed that high (vs. low) SES patients were significantly less likely to receive delayed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (highly educated: OR = 0.89, and high income: OR = 0.98). Furthermore, patients with high SES were significantly more likely to survive CPR (high income: OR = 1.02), to survive to hospital discharge with good neurological outcome (highly educated: OR = 1.27; high income: OR = 1.06), and to survive to 30 days (highly educated: OR = 1.21; and high income: OR = 1.05). Secondary analyses showed that patients with high SES were also significantly more likely to receive prophylactic heart rhythm monitoring (highly educated: OR = 1.16; high income: OR = 1.02), and this seems to partially explain the observed SES differences in CPR delay.
   Conclusion There are clear SES differences in IHCA treatment and survival, even when controlling for major sociodemographic, clinical, and contextual factors. This suggests that patients with low SES could be subject to discrimination when suffering IHCA.

AB  - Objective: The concept of stigma refers to problems of knowledge (ignorance), attitudes ( prejudice), and behavior (discrimination). Stigma may hinder access to care, housing, and work. In the context of implementation of programs such as "housing first" or "individual placement and support" in French speaking regions, validated instruments measuring stigma are necessary. "Attitudes to Mental Illness 2011" is a questionnaire that includes three scales measuring stigma through these three dimensions. This study aimed to translate, adapt, and validate these three scales in French.
   Methods: The "Attitudes to Mental Illness 2011" questionnaire was translated into French and back-translated into English by an expert. Two hundred and sixty-eight nursing students completed the questionnaire. Content validity, face validity, internal validity, and convergent validity were assessed. Long-term reliability was also estimated over a three-month period.
   Results: Experts and participants found that the questionnaire's content validity and face validity were appropriate. The internal validities of the three scales were also considered adequate. Convergent validity indicated that the scales did indeed measure what they were supposed to. Long-term stability estimates were moderate; this pattern of results suggested that the construct targeted by the three scales is adequately measured but does not necessarily represent stable and enduring traits.
   Conclusion: Because of their good psychometric properties, these three scales can be used in French, either separately, to measure one specific dimension of stigma, or together, to assess stigma in its three dimensions. This would seem of paramount importance in evaluating campaigns against stigma since it allows measures to be adapted according to campaign goals and the target population.

AB  - Introduction: Depression is a serious and common mental disease that causes low mood and loss of interest in activities. Nelumbinis semen (NS) has been widely used as a treatment for depression for hundreds of years in many Asian countries. Water extract of nelumbinis semen (WNS) is a standardized herbal medicine made from NS. Methods: The objective of the present research was to perform a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to estimate the efficacy of WNS for improving depressive and stress symptoms using Beck depression inventory (BDI) and the stress response inventory (SRI) in 45 adults diagnosed with major depression or other forms of depressive disorders. They were randomized to either a placebo-treated group, a 2.4 g per day WNS-treated group, or a 4.8 g per day WNS-treated group. BDI and SRI were determined in order to evaluate changes in depression before and after two weeks of WNS treatment. Results: The average BDI and SRI of the 2.4 g WNS-treated group were significantly (p < 0.05) improved compared to those of the placebo-treated group. Their BDI subscale A (negative attitudes towards self) and subscale C (somatic disturbances), SRI E, and depression subscale of SRI were substantially shorter (p < 0.05). In addition, an analysis of collected EEG data of participants showed a significant increase in alpha/beta activity in the 4.8 g WNS-treated group, which might be explained as an advancement of their depression symptoms (p < 0.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that WNS treatment can decrease depression. Our study provides preliminary evidence for the safety of WNS and its potential to decrease depression.

AB  - Implicit racial biases are one of the most vexing problems facing current society. These split-second judgments are not only widely prevalent, but also are notoriously difficult to overcome. Perhaps most concerning, implicit racial biases can have consequential impacts on decisions in the courtroom, where scholars have been unable to provide a viable mitigation strategy. This article examines the influence of a short virtual reality paradigm on implicit racial biases and evaluations of legal scenarios. After embodying a black avatar in the virtual world, participants produced significantly lower implicit racial bias scores than those who experienced a sham version of the virtual reality paradigm. Additionally, these participants more conservatively evaluated an ambiguous legal case, rating vague evidence as less indicative of guilt and rendering more Not Guilty verdicts. As the first experiment of its kind, this study demonstrates the potential of virtual reality to address implicit racial bias in the courtroom setting.

AB  - Objective: To explore women's experiences of symptoms potentially indicative of gynaecological cancer in a community-based sample without imposing a cancer perspective.
   Design: A qualitative interview study with thematic analysis of transcripts.
   Participants: 26 women aged >= 30 years, who had experienced a symptom that might indicate gynaecological cancer in the past 3 months, were recruited using a screening questionnaire distributed online and in community settings.
   Setting: London, UK.
   Results: Women attributed gynaecological symptoms to existing illnesses/conditions or considered themselves to be predisposed to them, either through their 'genes' or previous personal experience. Normalising symptoms by attributing them to demographic characteristics (eg, age, sex) was common, as was considering them a side effect of hormonal contraception. When women raised cancer as a possible cause, they often dismissed it as unlikely. Responses to symptoms included self-management (eg, self-medicating, making lifestyle changes), adopting a 'lay system of care', or consulting a healthcare professional. Triggers to help-seeking included persistent, painful or debilitating symptoms, concern about symptom seriousness, and feeling that help-seeking was legitimised. Barriers to help-seeking included lack of concern, vague symptoms, unusual symptom location, competing time demands, previous negative experiences with the healthcare system, and not wanting to be perceived as a time-waster.
   Conclusions: Attributions of symptoms potentially indicative of a gynaecological cancer were varied, but most often involved women fitting symptoms into their expectations of what was 'normal'. Normalising acted as a barrier to seeking help from a healthcare professional, alongside competing time demands and negative attitudes towards help-seeking. These barriers may lead to later diagnosis and poorer cancer survival. Our findings could be used to inform the development of interventions to encourage appropriate help-seeking.

AB  - The Stolen Generations are Indigenous Australians who were taken from their homes by the State and placed in children's homes or foster care. This study investigated relations between the values held by Non-Indigenous Australians and willingness to support a hypothetical organization set up to repair the damage caused. Participants (N = 235) completed the Schwartz Portrait Values Questionnaire followed by items concerning their perceived responsibility; Indigenous deservingness; feelings of pleasure, anger, guilt, regret, shame, and sympathy; their support for the organization; and how efficacious they expected their support would be. It was found at the bivariate level that support was positively associated with self-transcendence values (universalism, benevolence) and negatively associated with both self-enhancement (power, achievement, hedonism) and security values. A path analysis implied that universalism values influenced support via the justice-related variables of perceived responsibility and undeserved treatment, outcome expectations, negative emotions, and sympathy. This study contributes new information about the effects of values on personal willingness to repair past wrongs.

AB  - Background: The latest amendment to the ban on smoking in public places in Israel was implemented in 2007, adding pubs and bars (P&B) to the list of public places in which smoking is prohibited. However, smoking in most P&B continued. The aim of the study was to identify the theoretically plausible reasons for the partial success of a public ban on smoking in P&B settings. Explanations provided by P&B owners were interpreted as probable causal factors based on the Behavioral Ecological Model (BEM).
   Methods: Qualitative interviews were performed with 36 P&B owners in Tel-Aviv and 18 Israeli towns and cities of various population size.
   Results: P&B owners reported a variety of situational factors (i.e., contingencies) and reinforcers as likely explanations of the partial failure of the legislated ban on smoking in public places, particularly P&B. The major reinforcers for non-adherence with the law were no or low frequency of inspections and low penalties from authorities. P&B owners also feared loss of customers and revenue if bans were enforced in their own establishment but not in competing establishments. Finally, owners reported social norms prevailing among some Israeli patrons supporting smoking in P&B settings, in part to express opposition to the new law.
   Conclusions: Qualitative assessment can uncover probable social situations that operate to prevent greater adherence to smoking bans. The results warrant confirmation by quantitative analyses. Policies with mandated inspections and penalty requirements that are implemented in all bars without prejudice could lead to greater adherence to smoking bans. Positive reinforcing consequences that encourage adherence (such as publicity and support from non-smokers) would be more likely to generate both greater adherence to the policy and good will toward the government. Principles of behavior outlined in the BEM offer guidance for designing quantitative confirmation analyses of future bans.

AB  - Background Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) cancer patients experience substantial health disparities, including poorer overall health and lower satisfaction with their cancer care than their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, which may be due in part to a lack of culturally competent providers. To address these disparities, a web-based LGBT cultural competency training tailored to oncologists was developed by an interdisciplinary team of scientists, LGBT cancer survivors, cultural competency experts, oncologists, a web designer, and an instructional designer. Methods Oncologists (n = 44) were recruited from 3 academic cancer centers in Florida. Participants were administered the LGBT cultural competency training Curriculum for Oncologists on LGBT populations to Optimize Relevance and Skills (COLORS) and completed pre- and posttraining measures regarding LGBT-related knowledge, attitudes (including general negative attitudes and health care-related attitudes), and clinical practices. After the training, participants completed training acceptability measures. Results Of the 44 participants, 33 (75%) completed the COLORS training. Participants were 55% non-Hispanic white, 63% male, and had a mean age of 47 years. Participants demonstrated significant improvements in LGBT-related knowledge (t = -4.9,P < .001), attitudes (Z = -3.0,P = .002;t = -2.5,P = .019), and clinical practices (Z = -3.5,P < .001) after completing the COLORS training (Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used for nonnormally distributed variables). Moreover, training acceptability was high, with 82% of participants rating the training as high quality, and 97% being willing to recommend the training to a colleague. Conclusion The COLORS training is both feasible to administer and acceptable for use with oncologists, and may improve oncologists' LGBT-related knowledge, attitudes, and clinical practices. Larger trials are needed to examine the training's effectiveness in reducing LGBT cancer disparities, as well as its applicability to other types of care providers.

AB  - As human population increase, human-wildlife conflicts have reached unprecedented levels, often resulting in negative attitudes toward regional conservation initiatives, and thus are of concern for conservation communities. From April to May 2011, we carried out a survey to quantify carnivore-induced livestock losses perceived by local pastoralists in the Qinghai Lake region on the pastoral Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and examined the ecological and socio-economic dimensions in the conflict. We finished 286 in-person interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire with mixed closed-and open-ended questions. Our results showed that 93.7% of the respondents reported livestock depredations by carnivores from March 2010 to March 2011. The perceived losses represented 3.7% of total standing value of livestock in the region. The losses were positively correlated with livestock number in each household and showed significant seasonal and diurnal difference. Adult sheep and goats were the mostly killed (54.9%), followed by lambs (21.0%), adult yaks and cattle (19.1%), calves (4.9%) and horses (0.1%). More than 80% of the respondents reported that they could not tolerate the contemporaneous depredations and nearly two thirds expected compensations for their losses. Wolf Canis lupus was blamed for most of the killings (76.0%) and was perceived most negative followed by brown bear Ursus arctos, Tibetan fox Vulpes ferrilata, red fox Vulpes vulpes and raptors. Attitudes toward the problem carnivores were positively correlated with livestock size but negatively with magnitudes of the depredations. The attitudes also varied among the three survey sites, which may be attributed to the different extent of openness and livelihood dependence on animal husbandry. In the light of our results, we suggested possible measures to mitigate the conflict and maintain coexistence between human and wild carnivores on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - Objective: Wright (1983) described 20 "value-laden beliefs and principles" that form the foundational principles of rehabilitation psychology, and the education and training of rehabilitation psychologists necessitates that they acquire the specialty-specific knowledge and attitudes/values related to these principles. This article addresses 2 questions about how these principles can be taught in rehabilitation psychology training: (a) What are the core theories and evidence supporting these foundational principles, and what should be the content of a "core curriculum" for teaching these?; and (b) What is known about the most effective methods for teaching these foundational principles, including questions of how to teach values? Method: The foundational principles were grouped into 3 categories: individual psychological processes, social psychological processes, and values related to social integration. A literature review was conducted in these 3 categories, and the results are summarized and discussed. Results: A core curriculum is discussed for teaching about disability-specific individual psychological processes, social psychological processes, and values related to social integration, including methods to reduce group prejudice and promote values relevant to the foundational principles. Specific suggestions for training program content and methods are provided. Conclusions: It is hoped that effective teaching of Wright's (1983) value-laden beliefs and principles will help rehabilitation psychology trainers and trainees focus on the key knowledge and attitude-value competencies that are to be acquired in training.
   Impact and Implications
   This article reviews the existing literature relevant to teaching the foundational principles of rehabilitation psychology, both in terms of teaching content and teaching methods. It provides information regarding concepts and practices that can be used to effectively teach Wright's (1983) value-laden beliefs and principles, and to help rehabilitation psychology trainers and trainees focus on the key knowledge and attitude-value competencies that are to be acquired in training.

AB  - Background.& nbsp; & nbsp; The attitudes of the health care workers (HCWs) are essential in influencing organ donation rate. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of an educational intervention on attitudes toward organ donation among HCWs.Methods.& nbsp; & nbsp; A questionnaire-based interventional study was conducted with 458 HCW from 5 hospitals in Malaysia. A 26-item self-administered questionnaire was distributed online as a pre intervention test. Respondents then went through website-based educational materials followed by a post-intervention questionnaire.& nbsp;Results.& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;A total of 345 (75.3%) respondents completed the tests. Their attitude toward organ donation was positive preintervention. After the intervention, respondents expressed an increase willingness to donate their own organs (P = .008) and their relatives' organs (P < .001) after death; were more willing to adopt organ donation as part of end-of-life care (P =.002); were more comfortable talking to relatives about organ donation (P =.001); and expressed an increase consideration to execute the action at any time (P =.001). There was increased willingness to admit to the intensive care unit for facilitating organ donation (P =.007); to employ the same resources to maintain a potential brain-dead donor (P < .001); and to support organ donation in case they or their relatives were diagnosed with end-stage organ failure (P =.008). However, there was an increase in negative attitudes regarding the association between organ donation with health care failure (P =.004) and with pain (P =.003). Positive attitude scores were higher after the intervention (P < .001).Conclusion.& nbsp; & nbsp; An educational website-based intervention was able to improve the attitudes of HCWs toward organ donation.

AB  - This educational intervention takes place when the population of older people with dementia is increasing. Health and Social care professionals must work jointly in increasingly complex contexts. Negative attitudes towards older people are cited as a contributor to poor care delivery, including the use of dismissive and/or patronising language, failing to meet fundamental needs and afford choice. Sliding Doors to Personal Futures' is a joint, drama-based, educational initiative between NHS Education Scotland and the Scottish Social Services Council, delivered using interprofessional education (IPE) towards encouraging person-centred health and social care.
   This paper considers whether 'Sliding Doors' had an impact on social work and nursing students' attitudes to older people, person-centred care and interprofessional collaboration. Two groups of third year students were studied; one from nursing and one from social work. A mixed methods approach was taken and attitudes and attitudinal shifts measured and discussed.
   Quantitative results demonstrated that social work students made positive attitudinal shifts in some questionnaire items and collectively the social work students were more person-centred than nursing students in their care approaches. The qualitative data however, drawn from focus groups, illuminated these results and highlighted the link between the ability for a professional to be person-centred and the conceptual view Of risk within the particular profession. Risk acceptance, the theoretical position of social work, may facilitate person-centred care, whereas the perceived risk-averse nature of the nursing profession may inhibit it Students' attempts to understand the quantitative results, without understanding the restrictions and parameters of each other's profession, led them to revert to stereotypes and negative views of each other as practitioners.
   The paper concludes that there is an important difference between nurses' and social workers' frames of reference. It is suggested that IPE in its current form will not impact positively on outcomes for older people, unless both professions can openly acknowledge the reality of their professional contexts and develop an understanding of each other's professional restrictions, opportunities and aspirations.

AB  - IntroductionMalnutrition is an internationally prevalent healthcare phenomenon in nursing home residents entailing serious consequences for those who are affected. Lack of knowledge among nursing staff is often discussed as a reason for deficits in nutritional practice. For this reason, a valid and reliable tool is necessary to assess knowledge of malnutrition (KoM) care. The objective of this study was to develop and psychometrically evaluate a questionnaire aimed at assessing the KoM care among nursing staff in Austrian nursing homes.
   MethodsThis study follows a psychometric methodological design. The dimensions and items of the questionnaire were derived from a literature review. The content validity was evaluated using a Delphi technique with eight international experts in the field of malnutrition. Item validity in terms of distribution of response alternatives, item difficulty and discrimination index, construct validity in terms of a comparison between predefined known groups and internal consistency using Kuder-Richardson 20 were analysed in a sample of 1152 registered nurses/nurse aides from 66 Austrian nursing homes.
   ResultsThe Knowledge of Malnutrition - Geriatric (KoM-G) questionnaire consists of 20 items with six answer options including I don't know' with established content validity. The quality of response alternatives ranged from 0.3 to 96.9%. The item difficulty of the total questionnaire was 59.3% and the discrimination index was 0.37, whereas one item had a discrimination index below 0.20 and was therefore deleted. Significant differences in percentage of correct answers between registered nurses and nurse aides, nursing staff with training in nutrition and without as well as between nursing staff with positive attitudes towards nutritional care and neutral or negative attitudes were found. The Kuder-Richardson 20 was 0.69.
   ConclusionThe KoM-G shows acceptable psychometric properties covering a wide range of items regarding malnutrition and can be applied in nursing home practice, education and research.

AB  - COVID-19 is unique in that it is spread through everyday contact with other people. Therefore, social protective measures, beyond medical protective measures, such as social distancing, lockdowns, border closures, and human tracing are initiated to control the spread of COVID-19. Such responses have produced secondary issues such as drastic changes in people's way of life and work, housing instability, economic shock, and privacy issues. This paper examines the four domains of urban and regional issues related to the secondary impact of COVID-19, including (1) social distancing, urban structure, community, and density; (2) housing affordability; (3) lockdowns, border closures, reshoring, and regional economic recovery; and (4) smart city technology, contact tracing, and privacy. The following six recommendations have been proposed. First, institutional and cultural factors are more important than urban features, such as population density. To handle infectious diseases such as COVID-19, it is important to build systems, technology, infrastructure, and urban structures that can strengthen resilience instead of implementing a directionless policy of dispersion. Second, it is necessary to improve accessibility to essential services at the community level, including medical facilities and food supply. Third, continuous effort should be made to boost housing affordability, as it is directly related to people's basic life. Fourth, measures are needed to protect those people who are socioeconomically disadvantaged. There is also the need to restore global trade and economic relations. Fifth, since data technology-based COVID-19 control raises the human tracing and privacy issue, we must ensure the principles of privacy management, such as transparency and voluntary consent, are being met. Finally, since COVID-19 is spread through people, individuals may become anxious and fearful of others without grounds; this may increase prejudice and hatred, including xenophobia. Significant social effort is needed to overcome such ill-defined anxiety and fear and maintain a healthy civil society.

AB  - Background: By 2040, the predicted global cancer burden is expected to be more than 27 million new cancer cases per year. Understanding primary health care workers' (HCWs) perception on cancer can highlight new ways in which cancer advocacy can be increased. This study aimed to explore the perceptions of primary HCWs in Lautoka, Fiji, towards common cancers with focus on knowledge, risk perceptions, barriers and preventive approaches. Methods: The study used a qualitative method approach. The study was conducted among primary HCWs at four purposively selected health centres in Lautoka Subdivision, Fiji, from 1 March 2021 to 1 April 2021. Focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with primary HCWs. A semi-structured open-ended questionnaire was used to collect data, and the FGDs were audio-recorded. These audio recordings were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: The responses from the four FGDs with six primary HCWs in each group emerged four major themes. These themes were cancer knowledge, health professional training, barriers and challenges and awareness strategies. Primary HCWs were not fully aware about common cancers and were not confident to discuss about cancer with their patients which is an important role of primary HCWs in cancer management. This lack of knowledge was attributed to less training received in primary care setting. Barriers to accessing cancer screening included misconceptions about cancer, negative attitudes from patients, stigmatization, lack of resources at health facility and less informed health staff. Community outreach programmes, opportunistic screening, community HCWs and the concept of a cancer hub centre were awareness strategies highlighted by primary HCWs. Conclusions: Lack of knowledge about common cancers among primary HCWs is a concern that is depicted well in this study. This low knowledge was attributed to lack of training on cancers received by primary HCWs. Guidelines on cancer screening and diagnosis can be developed by the health ministry to assist primary HCWs in detecting patients at pre-cancerous stage.

AB  - Existing research suggests that, in contemporary liberal democracies, complaints of racism are routinely rejected and prejudice may be both expressed and disavowed in the same breath. Surveys and historical research have established that - both in democratic states and in those of the Soviet Bloc (while it existed) - antisemitism has long been related to or expressed in the form of statements about Israel or 'Zionist', permitting anti-Jewish attitudes to circulate under cover of political critique. This article looks at how the findings of a survey of anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli attitudes were rejected by users of three Facebook pages associated with the British Left. Through thematic discourse analysis, three recurrent repertoires are identified: firstly, what David Hirsh calls the 'Livingstone Formulation' (i.e. the argument that complaints of antisemitism are made in bad faith to protect Israel and/or attack the Left), secondly, accusations of flawed methodology similar to those with which UK Labour Party supporters routinely dismiss the findings of unfavourable opinion polls, and thirdly, the argument that, because certain classically antisemitic beliefs pertain to a supposed Jewish or 'Zionist' elite and not to Jews in general, they are not antisemitic. In one case, the latter repertoire facilitates virtually unopposed apologism for Adolf Hitler. Contextual evidence suggests that the dominance of such repertoires within one very large UK Labour Party-aligned group may be the result of action on the part of certain 'admins' or moderators. It is argued that awareness of the repertoires used to express and defend antisemitic attitudes should inform the design of quantitative research into the latter, and be taken account of in the formulation of policy measures aiming to restrict or counter hate speech (in social media and elsewhere).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Many patients with a chronic disease are dissatisfied with the information they are given. A brief questionnaire completed by patients would assist health professionals to identify areas of information needed to be provided, tailored to the patient's mental condition. AIM: The aim of our study was to assess how often thyroid patients report being adequately informed about iodine treatment in connection with their real need thereof, emotional state and acceptance of the disease. METHODS: One hundred outpatients who had presented subclinical hyperthyroidism "[19 men (19%), 81 women (81%); mean (SD+/-) age 53+/-14,range 18-77 yr] treated with radioiodine (RAT) responded to an Experimental Questionnaire, 54 of them answered to AIS, HADS-M and Beck Inventory measuring their acceptance of the illness and depressive symptoms, 37 of them answered the Patient Request Form (PRF). RESULTS: The obtained results indicated that about 50% of patients treated with 131I therapy did not receive suitable information about their treatment. Neither written information prepared by the specialist, nor verbal information given by physicians were adequate for specific problems of study group. The examined patients presented with a comparable intensity of three distinct types of requests: for explanation and reassurance, for emotional support, and for investigation and treatment. The acceptance of their disease was mediocre for most of the study group. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the reported lack of satisfaction with medical information in study group was associated with depressive symptoms influencing cognitive efficiency, patients' great need of emotional and cognitive support, influencing the acceptance of their disease, and social prejudice to radioiodine (as a method of treatment), worrying them additionally. All thyroid patients even these with subclinical symptoms of hyperthyroidism should be treated with specific attention by physicians, especially during information process.

TI  - Love and breakup letter methodology: A new research technique for medical education
T2  - MEDICAL EDUCATION
LA  - English
AB  - In everyday life, feelings are important to us, influencing our decision-making and motivating our actions. This is equally true within medicine and medical education, where feelings influence key aspects such as clinical decision-making, empathy, resilience, professional identity, reflection, team dynamics, career choices and questions of prejudice and bias. Feelings are therefore legitimate targets in medical education research, but asking research participants to talk openly about feelings can be challenging for participants and researchers alike. Within the disciple of User Experience (UX)-a relatively new research discipline used in the world of technology-researchers also seek to understand their customer's feelings, which are central to aspects of brand loyalty and choice of software platforms. UX researchers have developed innovative ways to explore feelings, in particular through the use of Love and Breakup Methodology (LBM)-participants are asked to write love and breakup letters to the product or app under study, and the letters are then used to guide the focus group discussion that follows. Methods: In this article, we describe the theoretical underpinnings of LBM, including ontological considerations. We also consider how LBM can be successfully used in medical education research and outline how we have adapted it in our own research studies and programme evaluations. Conclusions: Love and breakup letters are creative ways of understanding participants' positive and negative emotions about the matter under study. LBM has been utilised extensively by UX researchers in technology, but has been little used in medical education. It has rich potential to enhance research approaches to aspects of medicine that are influenced by feelings, including empathy and resilience, team working and many other aspects of professional practice. Although principally a focus group research tool, it can be adapted to other approaches, including questionnaire surveys and individual interviews.

AB  - Immigration is a contentious topic that continues to elicit debates among scholars, practitioners, and the general public. Research on the relationship between immigration and crime has been at the center stage of social science inquiry for many years; however, the evidence is mixed. The aim of the present study is to supplement prior efforts to better understand the immigration-crime nexus. By analyzing aggregate-level data obtained from 21 European countries, we assessed the effects of three types of variables-percent of immigrants, immigrants with no citizenship, and refugees-on three different types of violent crimes. Overall, the results indicated a null relationship between immigration and crime, suggesting that immigration is unrelated to all the three types of crimes assessed. Based on these results, it is recommended that immigration-related policies will be based on fact and evidence, and not on sentiments and perceptions.

AB  - Currently, the Han and Uygur ethnicities in Xinjiang, China are generally in a peaceful state; however, there are also disagreements and conflicts. Through three studies, this article explores intergroup attributional bias (in-group favoring and out-group derogating pattern of attribution) between the Hans and Uygurs in Xinjiang, China, and the reducing effect of positive imagined intergroup contact on intergroup attributional bias. Using high school students from Han and Uygur as participants, Study 1 investigated participants' attributional patterns for in-group and out-group members presenting desirable or undesirable behaviors in daily situations. The results revealed that both Hans and Uygurs demonstrate an in-group favoring pattern of attribution, but not an out-group derogating pattern. Study 2 added a brief positive imagined intergroup contact (experimental group) or a brief positive imagination of an outdoor scene (control group) before participants completed the same questionnaire as in Study 1 and found a weaker intergroup attributional bias in the experimental group. In Study 3, Han students who had a positive imagined contact with a Uygur demonstrated a closer distance and reported more positive attitudes toward Uygurs than Han students who had imagined contact with a nonspecific stranger. Studies 2 and 3 together indicated a reducing effect of imagined contact on intergroup attributional bias through improvement of intergroup attitudes. The conclusion of this research is particularly meaningful for the Hans and Uygurs, as it implies that properly implemented positive imagined intergroup contacts might be a useful remedy for reducing potential conflicts.

AB  - Background: Treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly effective, but access is limited and care is often fragmented. Treatment in primary care can improve access to treatment and address psychiatric and physical co-morbidities in a holistic, efficient, and non-stigmatizing way. The Collaborative Care Model (CCM) of behavioral health integration into primary care has been widely disseminated and shown to improve outcomes and lower costs when studied for depression, but its use in treating substance use disorders has not been well documented. Methods: We used a mixed-methods approach to examine the impact of implementing multidisciplinary treatment of OUD in our health system's five primary care clinics using the framework of the CCM, with care shared between the primary care clinician (PCP), behavioral health clinician, and medical assistant. The implementation included staff education, creation of electronic health record tools, and implementation support, and was evaluated using data from the electronic health record, the medical staff office, and a clinician survey. Results: Over the last 2 years of implementation, the number of waivered providers increased from 11 to 35, providers prescribing for 5 or more patients increased from 2 to 18, and patients initiated on buprenorphine increased from 4/month to 18/month. 180-day treatment retention was 53%, and 81% of patients had consistently negative urine drug testing. Psychiatric and medical comorbidities were common, 70 and 44%, respectively. Although PCPs who prescribed buprenorphine found working in this model enjoyable and effective, the majority of non-waivered PCPs remained reluctant to participate. Conclusions: In our experience, treatment of OUD in primary care utilizing the CCM effectively addresses OUD and commonly comorbid anxiety and depression, and leads to an expansion of treatment. Successful implementation of OUD treatment requires addressing negative attitudes and perceptions.

AB  - Background: Stigmatizing attitudes toward depression and toward help-seeking are important barriers for people with mental health problems to obtain adequate professional help. This study aimed to examine: (1) population attitudes toward depression and toward seeking professional help in four European countries; (2) the relation between depression stigma and attitudes toward help-seeking; (3) the relation between both attitudes and socio-demographic characteristics; and (4) differences in attitudes across countries.
   Methods: A representative general population survey (n=4011) was conducted in Germany, Hungary, Ireland, and Portugal, assessing attitudes toward depression and toward help-seeking, and a number of socio-demographic variables.
   Results: Respondents showed a moderate degree of personal stigma toward depression and a strikingly higher degree of perceived stigma. Although a substantial majority showed openness to seek professional help, only half of the people perceived professional help as valuable. More negative attitudes were found in Hungary and were associated with male gender, older age, lower educational level and living alone. Also, personal stigma was related to less openness to and less perceived value of professional treatment.
   Limitations: The survey was cross-sectional, so no causal inferences could be drawn.
   Conclusions: Personal and perceived stigma toward depression deserves public health attention, since they impact upon the intention of people with depression to seek professional help. Public media campaigns should focus on the credibility of the mental health care sector, and target males, older people, and those with a lower educational level and living alone. The content of each campaign should be adapted to the cultural norms of the country for which it is intended. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose Ukraine has one of the fastest growing HIV epidemics globally. Due to their engagement in high-risk behaviors, adolescents and emerging adults involved with the penitentiary system are at a particularly high risk of HIV-acquisition. To address the epidemic, young males (aged 14 to 20 years) in penitentiary institutions across Ukraine participated in a ten-week, group-based HIV-prevention intervention (STEPS). The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors analyzed clinical and programmatic services data collected as part of an evaluation of the STEPS intervention. Paired t-tests and (2) were used to examine pre- and post-intervention differences in HV knowledge, attitudes, and risk behaviors and alcohol and other drug use knowledge.
   Findings In total, 105 male youths participated in the ten-session STEPS intervention. At baseline, males reported high frequencies of risk behaviors (e.g. unprotected sexual activity, injection drug use), moderate levels of HIV-related knowledge, and negative attitudes toward HIV and people living with HIV. At follow-up (immediately following the last STEPS session), participants' HIV-related knowledge substantially improved and participants tended to have more favorable attitudes toward HIV.
   Research limitations/implications Outcomes suggest that knowledge and attitudes about HIV among Ukrainian incarcerated youth can improve as a result of group-based HIV-prevention intervention.
   Originality/value In Ukraine, individuals involved with the criminal justice system are one of the populations most-at-risk for HIV; criminal justice-involved adolescents and young adults are disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. Research among this sub-population is limited. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating an on-going group-based HIV-prevention program designed to reduce adolescent risk of HIV.

KW  - Early Adolescents
KW  - Parenting Practices
KW  - Sexual behavior
KW  - Urban
AB  - Background: There is a scientific prejudice related to the impact of parenting practices on early adolescents' sexual behavior in Indonesia. The missing aspects of parental get into mischief or risky sexual behavior among youth while sexual education itself is considered taboo in urban areas. This study intended to investigate the correlative pattern between parenting practices toward sexual behavior of early adolescents.
   Methods: This quantitative, cross-sectional-analytical study enrolled 290 early adolescents aged 10-14 years in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, from May-June 2021. A validated and reliable questionnaire of 30 questions was used to get the Parenting Practice (Permissive, Authoritarian, Democratic) from the adolescent's perspective. The sexual behavior was collected using 37 questions to categorize the adolescents into Risky, Medium Risk and Non-Risky. The correlative analysis was used to determine the significance (p<0.05), strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.
   Result: It was reported that 184 (63.4%) adolescents had a democratic parenting practice and non-risky sexual behavior. Significant correlation was found (p=<0.001; r=0.978) and strength of correlation (r) was considered strong. A positive correlation was obtained to show that the Democratic Parenting Practice aligns with Non-Risky sexual behavior among early adolescents.
   Conclusion: Significant findings of this study lead to a general description that democratic parenting practice applied in early adolescents could lead to non-risky sexual behavior. Further study that involves another stage of adolescence (middle adolescence and late adolescence/young adulthood) is required.

AB  - BackgroundMales are less likely to seek help for mental health difficulties compared to females. Despite considerable interest, a paucity of evidence-based solutions exists to address this. Concerns about students' mental health has led to the United Kingdom's Department of Education to make this a priority. Studies have shown that male students hold more negative attitudes towards the use of psychological services compared to female students and are less likely to seek help. A major concern is that male students make up 69% of university suicides, which is often associated with lower rates of help-seeking. This focus group study therefore sought to identify potential approaches that would be relevant to improving mental health help-seeking in male students.MethodsThree focus groups comprising of 24 male students at a London University were conducted. Participants were asked questions exploring: the barriers to seeking help, what would encourage help-seeking, how an appropriate intervention should be designed, and how to publicise this intervention to male students. Thematic analysis was conducted to evaluate participants responses.ResultsFive distinct themes were identified. These were: 1) protecting male vulnerability, 2) providing a masculine narrative of help-seeking, 3) differences over intervention format, 4) difficulty knowing when and how to seek help, and 5) strategies to sensitively engage male students.ConclusionsThese themes represent important considerations that can be used, together with the existing literature about male help-seeking, to develop more male friendly interventions that are suitable for male students. This could help improve help-seeking attitudes and the uptake of mental health interventions for male students experiencing emotional distress.

AB  - Purpose Immigration is considered a stressful process that causes many problems such as social isolation, prejudice, unemployment, minority status and intergenerational tensions. This study aims to determine the opinions of the leaders of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in Germany about the experiences of individuals who immigrated from Turkey to Germany. Design/methodology/approach In this study, a qualitative method was used. This study was conducted between April and May 2014 with leaders of CSOs who were living in Germany. Informed consent forms were signed by all the participants. Purposeful sampling was used to select the leaders of CSOs to be included in the sample. In-depth interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview format. The data reached saturation for the 30 leaders of CSOs. The data were collected through in-depth interviews and evaluated through thematic analysis. Findings Four main themes were identified: "Difficulties experienced", "Recommendations to cope with/solve the difficulties experienced," "Medical tourism" and "Use of health services." Research limitations/implications This study has some limitations that should be taken into consideration during the interpretation of the results. A majority of the leaders of CSOs had bachelor's degrees, and were middle-aged and older, which might affect the variety required in qualitative studies. Thus, it remains unclear whether the results could be generalized to all Turkish immigrants in Germany. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first qualitative study conducted with different Turkish CSO leaders living in Germany. This study outlines perspectives of CSO leaders' migration-related challenges that Turkish immigrants struggle with to integrate into German societies. As a consequence, Turkish immigrants' socio-cultural values, beliefs, difficulties they experienced, and legal rights should be taken into consideration in health care and tourism interactions. Possible found experiences could help to provide evidence on how to improve migrants' situations.

AB  - Despite the recognized benefits of sexual expression and its importance in the lives of people living with dementia, research demonstrates that there are multiple barriers to its positive expression (e.g., expression that is pleasurable and free of coercion, discrimination, and violence) in RLTC homes. These barriers constitute a form of discrimination based on age and ability, and violate the rights of persons living with dementia to dignity, autonomy, and participation in everyday life and society. Drawing on a human rights approach to dementia and sexual expression, we explored the experiences of diverse professionals, family members, and persons living with dementia with explicit attention to the ways in which macro-level dynamics are influencing the support, or lack thereof, for sexual expression at the micro level. Focus groups and in-depth interviews were conducted with 27 participants, and the collected data were analyzed thematically. While all participants acknowledged that intimacy and sexual expression of persons living with dementia should be supported, rarely is such expression supported in practice. Micro-level factors included negative attitudes of professionals toward sexual expression by persons living with dementia, their discomfort with facilitating intimacy and sexual expression in the context of their professional roles, their anxieties regarding potential negative reactions from family members, and concerns about sanctions for failing to prevent abuse. In our analysis, we importantly trace these micro-level factors to macro-level factors. The latter include the cultural stigma associated with dementia, ageism, ableism, and erotophobia, all of which are reproduced in, and reinforced by, professionals' education, as well as legal and professional standards that exclusively focus on managing and safeguarding residents from abuse. Our analysis demonstrates a complexity that has enormous potential to inform future research that is critically needed for the development of educational initiatives and to promote policy changes in this area.

AB  - Ethnic minority students face many disadvantages in school, which might be due in part to teachers' stereotypical expectations and attitudes. Dual process theories of impression and judgment formation specify person information that confirms or disconfirms stereotypical expectations as determinants of how judgments are formed. While expectation-confirming information should result in stereotype-based judgments, expectation-disconfirming information should lead to more information-integrating processes. Moreover, attitudes should also be affected in a positive way when a person encounters expectation-disconfirming information. The current study experimentally investigated these hypotheses with regard to stereotypical expectations about ethnic minority students. Eighty-three experienced teachers were randomly divided into four different groups. One group judged a below-average ethnic minority student (confirming) and another group a below-average ethnic majority student. Two other groups judged either an above-average ethnic minority (disconfirming) or ethnic majority student. When assessing a below-average student, teachers judged the confirming ethnic minority student as less proficient in language than the ethnic majority student. These differences could not be found for mathematical achievement or between the above-average ethnic minority and majority students. Attitudes toward ethnic minority students were not affected in the expected way. Findings are discussed with respect to their implications for future research.

AB  - Purpose: Epilepsy not only is a medical disorder characterized by seizures, but is also associated with stigma and a neurological disorder that affects quality of life. Insufficient knowledge and misconceptions about epilepsy that causes the development of negative attitudes towards patients with epilepsy increase the stigmatization and psychosocial problems and impact the quality of life. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between epilepsy knowledge, attitude, stigma, anxiety and depression, and quality of life within the framework of structural equation modeling.
   Method: This research was carried out between May 2015 and May 2016 at the Epilepsy Outpatient Clinic of Istanbul University Istanbul Faculty of Medicine. The Epilepsy Knowledge Scale, Epilepsy Attitude Scale, Stigma Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Quality of Life in Epilepsy Scale-10 (QOLIE-10) were used. To determine the relationship between the concepts, research hypotheses were created, and structural equation modeling was made.
   Results: Two hundred five patients were included in the study, 53.7% were women, and the mean age was 32.5. It was found that 72.2% had generalized seizures, and 46.3% had more than one seizure per month. According to our proposed model, knowledge had a moderate relationship with attitude (including stigma) (r = 0.50) that, in turn, had a strong relationship with mental health (r = -0.62) while a moderate relationship with quality of life (r = 0.45). Our findings revealed that proposed model accounted for 20% of the variance in quality of life and 39% of the variance in mental health (anxiety and depression).
   Conclusion: Mental health and quality of life of patient with epilepsy are closely related to the knowledge, attitude, and perceived stigma of the patients. Therefore, educating/supporting patients can help increase the mental health and quality of life. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biotechnology describes a range of human activities in medicine, agriculture, and environmental management. One biotechnology in particular, gene technology, continues to evolve both in capacity and potential to benefit and harm society. The purpose of this article is to offer a policy bridge from unproductive descriptions of gene technology to useful methods for identifying sources of significant biological and socioeconomic risk in complex food systems. Farmers and the public could be voluntarily and involuntarily interacting with new techniques of genome editing and gene silencing in entirely new ways, limiting the usefulness of previous gene technology histories to predict safety. What we believe is a more consistent, verifiable, and practical approach is to identify the critical control points that emerge where the scale effects of a human activity diverge between risk and safety. These critical control points are where technical experts can collaborate with publics with different expertise to identify and manage the technology. The use of technical terminology describing biochemical-level phenomena discourages publics that are not technical experts from contesting the embedded cultural perspectives and uncertainty in "scientific" concepts and prejudice the risk discourse by ignoring other issues of significance to society. From our perspective as gene technologists, we confront the use of pseudo-scale language in risk discourse and propose an escape path from clashes over whether risks that arise spontaneously (from nature) can be perfectly mimicked by gene technology to a discussion on how to best control the risks created by human activity. Scale is conceptually implicit and explicit in gene technology regulation, but there is no agreement about what scales are most useful to managing risk and social expectations. Both differentiated governance (risk-tiered) and responsible research and innovation models could accommodate the critical control points mechanism that we describe.

AB  - Detection and documentation of petro-structural features such as alignment features of minerals/grains, and extraction of such spatial property data are two fundamental steps for structural geology. Such tasks were mostly carried out manually. However, manual analysis is laborious and potentially biased. These drawbacks are less obvious when the foliation is well developed and the amount of platy mineral is higher. For samples with weakly developed foliation and low platy mineral content, automatic method is required for subjective interpretation. A semi-automatic computerized method of 3D foliation orientation reconstruction via two-dimensional petrographic-shape fabric analysis from serial oriented digital microphotograph has been developed and demonstrated in this study. The foliation is reconstructed by fitting a best fitting plane to the maximum modal peaks of micro textural parameters (SPO) for different mineral groups of platy and granular minerals from each thin section on a stereonet for four coarse grained biotite gneiss samples collected along the Jialie fault, SE Tibet, China. Regardless of platy or granular mineral aggregates, the reconstructed foliations showed similar orientation within 10 degrees angular variation to the field measurement. The 10 degrees angular variation can be maintained if the foliations are reconstructed by consecutive thin section groupings <= 50 degrees angular intervals and a horizontal thin section. The angular spread increased to 30 degrees for thin section groupings with > 50 degrees to 100 degrees angular intervals with a horizontal thin section. Major advantages of the computerized photometric methods demonstrated by this study are: the reduction of human prejudice and obtaining quantified and repeatable data sets. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Despite considerable efforts, the determinants of firm growth and financial market volatility have not been definitively identified, yet sets of stylized facts - most notably power-law distributions - relating to firm size and market returns suggest both evolve as part of a complex system. This scenario implies that a positive feedback loop between firms and investors exists and may be responsible for prejudicing the way management allocates their resources, with firm, and economic, growth adversely affected. Further, there are growing real-world concerns that the management of publicly listed firms is becoming too concerned with the movement of their firm's share price, which is adversely influencing resource allocation decisions. A related concern is that agents, in general, within financial markets are placing a disproportionate focus on short-term factors. To investigate the ramifications of the proposed feedback loop on firm growth and market volatility, this paper implements a novel agent-based artificial stock market where management can consider the movements of their firm's endogenously determined share price when allocating resources between sales and margin growth. The results highlight an inferior outcome regarding firm growth, and various other financial metrics, if management is overly concerned with share price movements. The growth of the firms (and market) is also affected by the mixture of the investor classes initiated due to the divergent levels of volatility they create. Additionally, the model presents insights into how and why the extent to which agents consider past outcomes in their decision-making process becomes influential. Notably, the model's results emulate an extensive set of global micro-level firm data. By providing significant insights on the effects of the stock market on management decision-making and its ramifications for firm growth, this paper provides crucial insights into the mechanisms responsible for inefficient behavior by market participants.

AB  - Background: Self-stigma is a dimension of stigma concerning how individuals internalize negative attributes and discriminate against their own selves. Dementia is a stigmatizing condition, and there is a paucity of research exploring the manifestations and implications of self- stigma in people living with dementia in various contexts. Aim: To examine how self-stigma manifests in the experiences of people living with early-stage dementia in Santiago, Chile. Participants: Six men and five women living with early-stage dementia of the Alzheimer's type, aged between 64 and 82 years old (mean = 70). Methods: One-on-one interviews were conducted, focusing on the experience of people living with early-stage dementia to provide insights on how self-stigma manifests. Interviews were analyzed with a qualitative content analysis approach using Corrigan's social cognitive model of self-stigma (2016). Results: Self-stigma manifested as devaluation and blame at a cognitive level, and as restriction of participation at a behavioral level. Families and dementia education emerged as contextual elements that influenced the internalization of negative attributes in the participants' experiences. Conclusions: Consistent with previous qualitative research, we found that self-stigma has negative consequences as it concerns emotions, self-prejudices, and self-discrimination. This study provides distinctive insights on the process of internalization of stigma and the influence of external elements. Self-stigma remains an understudied but important feature of the dementia experience, an understanding of which can lead to developing and testing supportive approaches upon diagnosis to minimize its adverse effects.

AB  - The mid-infrared spectra of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) contain a variety of spectral features that can be used as diagnostics to characterize the spectra. However, such diagnostics are biased by our prior prejudices on the origin of the features. Moreover, by using only part of the spectrum they do not utilize the full information content of the spectra. Blind statistical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) consider the whole spectrum, find correlated features and separate them out into distinct components. We further investigate the principal components (PCs) of ULIRGs derived in Wang et al. We quantitatively show that five PCs are optimal for describing the Infrared Spectrograph spectra. These five components (PC1PC5) and the mean spectrum provide a template basis set that reproduces spectra of all z < 0.35 ULIRGs within the noise. For comparison, the spectra are also modelled with a combination of radiative transfer models of both starbursts and the dusty torus surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGN). The five PCs typically provide better fits than the models. We argue that the radiative transfer models require a colder dust component and have difficulty in modelling strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon features. Aided by the models we also interpret the physical processes that the PCs represent. The third PC is shown to indicate the nature of the dominant power source, while PC1 is related to the inclination of the AGN torus. Finally, we use the five PCs to define a new classification scheme using 5D Gaussian mixture modelling and trained on widely used optical classifications. The five PCs, average spectra for the four classifications and the code to classify objects are made available at: .

AB  - For developing sustainable travel policies, it may be helpful to identify multimodal travelers, that is, travelers who make use of more than one mode of transport within a given period of time. Of special interest is identifying car drivers who also use public transport and/or bicycle, as this group is more likely to respond to policies that stimulate the use of those modes. It is suggested in the literature that this group may have,less biased perceptions and different attitudes towards those modes. This supposition is examined in this paper by conducting a latent class cluster analysis, which identifies (multi)modal travel groups based on the self-reported frequency of mode use. Simultaneously, a membership function is estimated to predict the probability of belonging to each of the five identified (multi)modal travel groups, as a function of attitudinal variables in addition to structural variables. The results indicate that the (near) solo car drivers indeed have more negative attitudes towards public transport and bicycle, while frequent car drivers who also use public transport have less negative public transport attitudes. Although the results suggest that in four of the five identified travel groups, attitudes are congruent with travel mode use, this is not the case for the group who uses public transport most often. This group has relatively favorable car attitudes, and given that many young, low-income travelers belong to this group, it may be expected that at least part of this group will start using car more often once they can afford it. Based on the results, challenges for sustainable policies are formulated for each of the identified (multi)modal travel groups. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Introduction and Aims. Staff interactions with their clients are an important factor in the quality of care that is provided to people in drug treatment. Yet there is very little research that addresses staff attitudes or clients' perceptions of discrimination and prejudice by staff with regard to treatment outcomes. This research aimed to assess whether perceptions of discrimination by staff predict drug treatment completion. Design and Methods. The study used a mixed methods approach. Ninety-two clients in residential rehabilitation facilities in Sydney were administered a series of quantitative measures assessing drug history, severity of drug use, treatment history, perceptions of staff discrimination and treatment motivation. Clients were followed up regularly until an outcome (dropout or completion) was obtained for the full sample. Results. Perceptions of discrimination were a significant predictor of treatment completion, with greater perceived discrimination associated with increased dropout. Qualitative interviews with 13 clients and eight health-care workers from these treatment services were then conducted to gain insight into how perceived discrimination may impact on treatment experiences. Clients and staff discussed how they would address the issue of perceived discrimination during the current treatment experience. Discussion and Conclusions. Adopting a mixed methods approach facilitated exploration of the impact of perceived discrimination on treatment from both clients' and health-care workers' perspectives. This methodology may also enhance interpretation and utilisation of these findings in drug treatment. [Brener L, von Hippel W, von Hippel C, Resnick I, Treloar C.

AB  - The ever-increasing presence of immigrants in Italian schools make these contexts important for the study of young peoples' attitudes towards those who are new to a country. We analysed the metaphors regarding immigrants produced by a sample of 840 eighth-grade students. The results of a content analysis showed nine complex attitudes referring to different conceptual frames, such as adolescents' perception of immigrants as part of a primary social group, as a source of possible wealth, as something troublesome or annoying, as a transient phenomenon that is unlikely to be integrated into society and various others. The results of a multinomial logistic regression indicated that boys have more feelings of annoyance as regard immigrants than girls. A higher socioeconomic background is associated with ambivalent attitudes toward immigrants (who are seen as being needy, as a resource but also as a threat). Possible behavioural implications of the adolescents' views of minority social and cultural groups are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was through a survey of awareness of cancer and cancer screening of Korean community residents to identify the stereotypes of cancer and bases for development of improved screening programs for early detection. Subjects were residing in South Korea Gangwon-Province and were over 30 years and under 69 years old. The total was 2,700 persons which underwent structured telephone survey questionnaires considered with specific rates of gender, region, and age. For statistical analysis, PASW Statistics 17.0 WIN was utilized. Frequency analysis, the Chi-square (x(2)) test for univariate analysis, and logistic regression analysis were performed. The awareness of cancer and cancer screening in subjects differed by gender, region and age. For the idea of cancer, women thought about death less than men (OR: 0.73, p<0.001). On the other hand, women had negative thoughts - fear/terror/suffering/pain/pain - more than their male counterparts (OR: 2.04, p<0.001). Next, for the idea of cancer screening, women recognized fear/terror more than men (OR: 1.38, p<0.01). The higher age, the more tension/anxiety/worry/burden/irritated/pressure (OR: 1.43, p<0.01, OR: 2.15, p<0.001, OR: 2.49, p<0.001)). People may be reminded of fear and death for cancer and of fear, terror, tension and anxiety for cancer screening. To change vague fear and negative attitudes of cancer could increase the rate of cancer screening as well as help to improve the quality of life for community cancer survivors and facilitate return to normal social life. Therefore, it is necessary to provide promotion and education to improve the awareness of cancer and cancer screening.

AB  - Aims and objectives To evaluate and explore mental health nurses' responses to and experience of an educational intervention to improve attitudes towards people with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Report findings are concordant with relevant EQUATOR guidelines (STROBE and COREQ). Background Attitudes towards people with a diagnosis of BPD are poorer than for people with other diagnoses. There is limited evidence about what might improve this situation. One intervention with reportedly good effect uses an underlying biosocial model of BPD. No previous intervention has been co-produced with an expert by experience. We developed and delivered a 1-day intervention comprising these elements. Design A mixed-methods design was used comprising prospective within-subjects cohort intervention and qualitative elements. Participants were mental health nursing staff working in inpatient and community settings in one NHS Board in Scotland, UK. Methods Measurement of cognitive and emotional attitudes to people with a diagnosis of BPD at pre- and postintervention (N = 28) and at 4-month follow-up. Focus groups were used to explore participants' experiences of the intervention (N = 11). Results Quantitative evaluation revealed some sustained changes consistent with expected attitudinal gains in relation to the perceived treatment characteristics of this group, the perception of their suicidal tendencies and negative attitudes in general. Qualitative findings revealed some hostility towards the underpinning biosocial model and positive appreciation for the involvement of an expert by experience. Conclusions Sustained benefits of an educational intervention for people working with people diagnosed with BPD in some but not all areas. Participants provided contrasting messages about what they think will be useful. Relevance to clinical practice The study provides further evidence for incorporation of a biosocial model into staff training as well as the benefits of expert by experience co-production. Mental health nurses, however, believe that more well-resourced services are the key to improving care.

AB  - Background: Nurses play a pivotal role in pain management. Knowing more about nurses' knowledge and attitudes regarding pain is important as we develop multidisciplinary pain services. Therefore, this study aimed to assess knowledge and attitudes regarding pain management among nurses in a geriatric hospital and its associated factors.
   Subjects and Methods: A survey was conducted of nurses worked at the National Geriatric Hospital over a 3-month period. The Knowledge and Attitudes Survey Regarding Pain (KASRP) was utilized to assess nurses' knowledge and attitudes toward pain management. Four domains were defined based on KASRP, included cancer-related pain, pain assessment, pharmacology and substance abuse and physical dependence. Knowledge and attitudes regarding pain were classified as poor, fair, or good (<= 50%, 50% - 75%, or >= 75% of the KASRP score). Multivariate Tobit regression models were applied to identify factors associated with the knowledge and attitudes regarding pain management.
   Results: Of 154 participants completed the survey, 72.2% (111 participants) had poor knowledge and attitudes regarding pain management. The participants had a correct mean score of 45.2% (SD = 2.2). Nurses' knowledge of pain assessment was poor, with the proportion of correct answers to nine questions ranging from 2.6% to 50%. 44.8% of nurses reported never or rarely using pain assessment tools. Nurses who had previous training regarding pain at medical universities had significantly higher scores of knowledge and attitudes compared to those without training. Nurses who often use pain assessment tools had a significantly higher level of knowledge and attitudes than those who never or rarely use them.
   Conclusion: This study highlights significant deficits of knowledge and negative attitudes regarding pain management among nurses. The subject of pain management should be applied and enhanced in the nursing undergraduate curriculum. Nurses' active participation in pain management should be encouraged by healthcare providers for older patients.

AB  - Background
   Exposure to biomass smoke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Africa. Commercial food vendors in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa are commonly exposed to biomass smoke from open fire cooking both at work and home. Little is known about the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of food vendors about the health hazards of biomass smoke exposure in Nigeria.
   Methods
   We did a descriptive cross sectional survey of the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of commercial food vendors in the cities of Benin and Calabar in Nigeria. We recruited respondents using a multi-stage approach. Structured interviewer-administered questionnaires were used for data collection.
   Results
   We recruited 308 participants (164, 53.2% female). The majority 185(60.2%) were married and had post-primary education 206(67.4%). The average monthly income was <30,000 Naira (US$150). Most 198(64.4%) were not aware that biomass smoke exposure is harmful to human health. About three-quarters (221; 71.8%) were unconcerned as to the effect of exposure to fumes from biomass fuels on their health. Less than half of respondents (110, 41.6%) believed biomass smoke was harmful to health. Male gender, being single, having post-primary education and preferring electricity or gas fuels were associated with good knowledge of the adverse health effects of biomass smoke exposure whilst female gender and having good knowledge of the adverse health effects of biomass smoke were associated with positive attitudes towards preventing exposure.
   Conclusion
   Commercial food vendors in our study had limited knowledge about the adverse health effects of biomass smoke exposure and negative attitudes towards preventing these adverse health effects. We suggest an educational intervention is needed to improve this knowledge.

AB  - Different sampling strategies, analytic alternatives, and estimators have been proposed to better assess the characteristics of different hard-to-reach populations and their respective infection rates (as well as their sociodemographic characteristics, associated harms, and needs) in the context of studies based on respondent-driven sampling (RDS). Despite several methodological advances and hundreds of empirical studies implemented worldwide, some inchoate findings and methodological challenges remain. The in-depth assessment of the local structure of networks and the performance of the available estimators are particularly relevant when the target populations are sparse and highly stigmatized. In such populations, bottlenecks as well as other sources of biases (for instance, due to homophily and/or too sparse or fragmented groups of individuals) may be frequent, affecting the estimates.In the present study, data were derived from a cross-sectional, multicity RDS study, carried out in 12 Brazilian cities with transgender women (TGW). Overall, infection rates for HIV and syphilis were very high, with some variation between different cities. Notwithstanding, findings are of great concern, considering the fact that female TGW are not only very hard-to-reach but also face deeply-entrenched prejudice and have been out of the reach of most therapeutic and preventive programs and projects.We cross-compared findings adjusted using 2 estimators (the classic estimator usually known as estimator II, originally proposed by Volz and Heckathorn) and a brand new strategy to adjust data generated by RDS, partially based on Bayesian statistics, called for the sake of this paper, the RDS-B estimator. Adjusted prevalence was cross-compared with estimates generated by non-weighted analyses, using what has been called by us a naive estimator or rough estimates.

AB  - Background: Evidence-based guidelines for pressure ulcer prevention have been developed and promoted by authoritative organizations. However, nonadherence to these guidelines is frequently reported. Negative attitudes and lack of knowledge may act as barriers to using guidelines in clinical practice.
   Aims: To study the knowledge and attitudes of nurses about pressure ulcer prevention in Belgian hospitals and to explore the correlation between knowledge, attitudes, and the application of adequate prevention.
   Methods: A cross-sectional multicenter study was performed in a random sample of 14 Belgian hospitals, representing 207 wards. Out of that group, 94 wards were randomly selected (2105 patients). Clinical observations were performed to assess the adequacy of pressure ulcer prevention and pressure ulcer prevalence. From each participating ward, a random selection of at least five nurses completed an extensively validated knowledge and attitude instrument. In total, 553 nurses participated. A logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation between knowledge, attitudes, and the application of adequate prevention.
   Results: Pressure ulcer prevalence (Category I-IV) was 13.5% (284/2105). Approximately 30% (625/2105) of the patients were at risk (Bradenscore <17 and/or presence of pressure ulcer). Only 13.9% (87/625) of these patients received fully adequate prevention whilst in bed and when seated. The mean knowledge and attitude scores were 49.7% and 71.3%, respectively. The application of adequate prevention on a nursing ward was significantly correlated with the attitudes of the nurses (OR = 3.07, p = .05). No independent correlation was found between knowledge and the application of adequate prevention (OR = 0.75, p = .71).
   Conclusions: Knowledge of nurses in Belgian hospitals about the prevention of pressure ulcers is inadequate. The attitudes of nurses toward pressure ulcers are significantly correlated with the application of adequate prevention. No correlation was found between knowledge and the application of adequate prevention.

AB  - The power Bonferroni mean (PBM) operator is a hybrid structure and can take the advantage of a power average (PA) operator, which can reduce the impact of inappropriate data given by the prejudiced decision makers (DMs) and Bonferroni mean (BM) operator, which can take into account the correlation between two attributes. In recent years, many researchers have extended the PBM operator to handle fuzzy information. The Dombi operations of T-conorm (TCN) and T-norm (TN), proposed by Dombi, have the supremacy of outstanding flexibility with general parameters. However, in the existing literature, PBM and the Dombi operations have not been combined for the above advantages for interval-neutrosophic sets (INSs). In this article, we first define some operational laws for interval neutrosophic numbers (INNs) based on Dombi TN and TCN and discuss several desirable properties of these operational rules. Secondly, we extend the PBM operator based on Dombi operations to develop an interval-neutrosophic Dombi PBM (INDPBM) operator, an interval-neutrosophic weighted Dombi PBM (INWDPBM) operator, an interval-neutrosophic Dombi power geometric Bonferroni mean (INDPGBM) operator and an interval-neutrosophic weighted Dombi power geometric Bonferroni mean (INWDPGBM) operator, and discuss several properties of these aggregation operators. Then we develop a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) method, based on these proposed aggregation operators, to deal with interval neutrosophic (IN) information. Lastly, an illustrative example is provided to show the usefulness and realism of the proposed MADM method. The developed aggregation operators are very practical for solving MADM problems, as it considers the interaction among two input arguments and removes the influence of awkward data in the decision-making process at the same time. The other advantage of the proposed aggregation operators is that they are flexible due to general parameter.

AB  - The Indian government provides free antiretroviral treatment (ART) for people living with HIV. To assist in developing policies and programs to advance equity in ART access, we explored barriers to ART access among kothis (men who have sex with men [MSM] whose gender expression is feminine) and aravanis (transgender women, also known as hijras) living with HIV in Chennai. In the last quarter of 2007, we conducted six focus groups and four key-informant interviews. Data were explored using framework analysis to identify categories and derive themes. We identified barriers to ART access at the family/social-level, health care system-level, and individual-level; however, we found these barriers to be highly interrelated. The primary individual-level barrier was integrally linked to the family/social and health care levels: many kothis and aravanis feared serious adverse consequences if their HIV-positive status were revealed to others. Strong motivations to keep one's HIV-positive status and same-sex attraction secret were interconnected with sexual prejudice against MSM and transgenders, and HIV stigma prevalent in families, the health care system, and the larger society. HIV stigma was present within kothi and aravani communities as well. Consequences of disclosure, including rejection by family, eviction from home, social isolation, loss of subsistence income, and maltreatment (although improving) within the health care system, presented powerful disincentives to accessing ART. Given the multi-level barriers to ART access related to stigma and discrimination, interventions to facilitate ART uptake should address multiple constituencies: the general public, health care providers, and the kothi and aravani communities. India needs a national policy and action plan to address barriers to ART access at family/social, health care system, and individual levels for aravanis, kothis, other subgroups of MSM and other marginalized groups.

AB  - Background: Research about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), its epidemiology and socio-economic impact on populations worldwide has gained attention. However, there is dearth of empirical knowledge in low-and middle income settings about the pandemic's impact on survivors, particularly the tension of their everyday life arising from the experiences and consequences of stigma, discrimination and social exclusion, and how they cope with these behavioral adversities. Methods: Realist qualitative approach drawing data from people clinically diagnosed positive of COVID-19, admitted into therapy in a designated treatment facility, and subsequently recovered and discharged for or without follow-up domiciliary care. In-depth interviews were conducted by maintaining a code book for identifying and documenting thematic categories in a progression leading to thematic saturation with 45 participants. Data were transcribed and coded deductively for broad themes at the start before systematically nesting emerging themes into the broad ones with the aid of NVivo 12 software. Results: Everyday lived experiences of the participants were disrupted with acts of indirect stigmatization (against relatives and family members), direct stigmatization (labeling, prejudices and stereotyping), barriers to realizing full social life and discriminatory behaviors across socio-ecological structures (workplace, community, family, and social institutions). These behavioral adversities were associated with self-reported poor health, anxiety and psychological disorders, and frustrations among others. Consequently, supplicatory prayers, societal and organizational withdrawal, aggressive behaviors, supportive counseling, and self-assertive behaviors were adopted to cope and modify the adverse behaviors driven by misinformation and fearful perceptions of the COVID-19 and its contagious proportions. Conclusion: In the face of the analysis, social campaigns and dissemination of toolkits that can trigger behavior change and responsible behaviors toward COVID-19 survivors are proposed to be implemented by health stakeholders, policy and decision makers in partnership with social influencers, the media, and telecoms.

AB  - This paper introduces a novel framework for understanding the relationship between implicit and explicit preferences and political cognition. Existing work in political psychology focuses primarily on comparing the main effects of implicit versus explicit attitude measures. This paper rethinks the role of implicit cognition by acknowledging the correspondence between implicit and explicit preferences (i.e., the distance between implicitly and explicitly measured attitudes). Data from the 2008 American National Election Study are used to examine implicit racial ambivalence, or the gap between one's implicit and explicit racial preferences, as it exists in the United States. Results indicate implicit racial ambivalence, which has been shown to yield effortful thinking related to race, is negatively related to education and Need for Cognition, and predicts race-related policy attitudes as well as vote choice in the 2008 election. Furthermore, implicit ambivalence moderates the influence of ideology on political attitudes, including attitudes toward outcomes that are only covertly related to race and cannot be predicted directly by implicit or explicit racial attitudes alone.

AB  - Objectives and Background: The aim of this study was to characterize equity and inclusion in acute care surgery (ACS) with a survey to examine the demographics of ACS surgeons, the exclusionary or biased behaviors they witnessed and experienced, and where those behaviors happen. A major initiative of the Equity, Quality, and Inclusion in Trauma Surgery Practice Ad Hoc Task Force of the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma was to characterize equity and inclusion in ACS. To do so, a survey was created with the above objectives. Methods: A cross-sectional, mixed-methods anonymous online survey was sent to all EAST members. Closed-ended questions are reported as percentages with a cutoff of alpha = 0.05 for significance. Quantitative results were analyzed focusing on mistreatment and bias. Results: Most respondents identified as white, non-Hispanic and male. In the past 12 months, 57.5% of females witnessed or experienced sexual harassment, whereas 48.6% of surgeons of color witnessed or experienced racial/ethnic discrimination. Sexual harassment, racial/ethnic prejudice, or discrimination based on sexual orientation/sex identity was more frequent in the workplace than at academic conferences or in ACS. Females were more likely than males to report unfair treatment due to age, appearance or sex in the workplace and ACS (P <= 0.002). Surgeons of color were more likely than white, non-Hispanics to report unfair treatment in the workplace and ACS due to race/ethnicity (P < 0.001). Conclusions: This is the first survey of ACS surgeons on equity and inclusion. Perceptions of bias are prevalent. Minorities reported more inequity than their white male counterparts. Behavior in the workplace was worse than at academic conferences or ACS. Ensuring equity and inclusion may help ACS attract and retain the best and brightest without fear of unfair treatment.

AB  - Structural prejudices and unconscious biases within the construction industry have negatively impacted the construction workforce. Workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion are major concerns in the construction industry. The goal of the present study is to enable the assessment of workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion in the construction industry by identifying and determining the level of influence of applicable indicators revealing diversity, equity, and inclusion at the workforce level. A two-round survey and a panel of 16 experts were utilized to achieve the research goal. After collecting and analyzing the responses, 10 indicators were found to be influential in terms of achieving a diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environment and were therefore considered measures of workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion. These indicators are (1) ethnic and racial diversity at the company level; (2) gender diversity and inclusion at the workforce level; (3) a corporate policy statement on diversity and inclusion; (4) gender/ethnic diversity in leadership/management positions; (5) knowledge and skill diversity; (6) equitable pay/compensation at the industry level; (7) equality, social justice, and nondiscrimination policy statement; (8) pay structure transparency; (9) equitable pay/compensation at the company level; and (10) merit-based transparent recruitment and promotion. The present study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a means of assessing workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion in the construction industry. It is expected that utilizing the identified indicators would help managers and human resources specialists/professionals in construction perform a thorough assessment of the level of diversity, equity, and inclusiveness of the workforce within their organizations and identify opportunities for enhancing the workforce diversity, equity, and inclusiveness.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the influence of internalized weight stigma (IWS) on physical activity (PA) outcomes among women with body mass index (BMI) over 30 kg/m(2).
   Design and method: Data were drawn from an RCT that included 80 primarily inactive women (94% nonHispanic/Latina white; mean age = 39.6, SD = 4.1, range = 30.0 to 45.0; mean BMI = 38.0 kg/m(2), SD = 3.9, range = 30.2-44.8 kg/m(2). Participants completed a 6 month weight-neutral, health-at-every-size or weight-loss-focused group-based healthy living program. PA enjoyment and engagement in moderate-intensity PA (MI-PA) (at least 30 minutes most days of the week) were assessed at baseline and immediately post-intervention. We used intention-to-treat linear mixed-effects modeling to test IWS as a moderator of changes in MI-PA engagement. We also tested a model whereby the positive effects of participating in the program on engagement in MI-PA would be serially mediated by a reduction in IWS and a concomitant increase in MI-PA enjoyment.
   Results: The weight-neutral and weight-loss-focused data were combined for all analyses. The moderation hypothesis was supported with a significant interaction between IWS and time. Participants had significant gains overall in MI-PA engagement from baseline to post-intervention; however, those with high IWS had an attenuated response. The serial mediation model was also supported. The positive effect of the program on engagement in MI-PA occurred through decreased IWS and increased MI-PA enjoyment.
   Conclusions: Self-directed stigma and holding negative attitudes about one's weight interferes with positive changes in PA outcomes. Healthy living programs may be less effective for those most vulnerable unless we aim to reduce IWS. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Attitudes and empathy of farmers influence human-animal interaction, thereby affecting their behavior toward animals. The goal was to investigate how measures of attitude and empathy toward animals were associated with animal welfare indicators such as milk yield, mastitis incidence, fertility index, and the prevalence of skin lesions on cows. To assess empathy toward animals, a photo-based pain assessment instrument was developed depicting various conditions that could be associated with some degree of pain in cattle and included questions aimed at assessing attitudes toward animals. Photos of painful conditions are useful in eliciting measurable empathic responses to pain in humans. A total of 221 farmers were sampled via e-mail and 154 responses were obtained. In the first analysis, farmers were categorized into 2 groups according to their agreement or disagreement with the attitude statement "animals experience physical pain as humans do." In the second analysis, farmers were assigned a median pain assessment score obtained from their estimates on the visual analog scale of 21 conditions assumed painful for cattle. In the third analysis, farmers were clustered in 3 groups according to their visual analog scale responses. Three conditions were ranked as the most painful: fracture of tuber coxae, dystocia, and serious mastitis. Farmers with positive attitudes toward animals scored 2 points higher on their empathy score compared with farmers with negative attitudes. Personal experience with each additional condition resulted in a 0.09 higher score. Cluster analysis revealed 3 groups. Farmers in group 3 had the highest median pain assessment score (6.7 +/- 0.2), indicating a high level of empathy and a positive attitude toward animals. They had the lowest prevalence of skin lesions over the carpus (24 +/- 6%) and the lowest milk production (6,705 +/- 202 kg). The complex associations between indicators of empathy and attitudes with relevant welfare outcomes suggest that competence building to safeguard animal welfare could benefit from including both attitudes and empathy in human-animal interactions studies.

AB  - The rates of alcohol use and binge drinking are increasing among women. To examine factors that can differentiate women with low-risk alcohol use from those with high-risk alcohol use, the present study explored whether there would be distinct subgroups of mothers who differed in their attitudes and risk of alcohol use. A sample of 141 women aged between 18 and 50 years old who had given birth within 3 years was recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk. A hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted to categorize the mothers based on the similarities between their attitudes and risk of alcohol use, which resulted in the identification of the following distinct subgroups: (a) mothers with negative attitudes toward alcohol use and low risk for problematic alcohol use, (b) mothers with positive attitudes and low risk, and (c) mothers with positive attitudes and high risk. These subgroups of mothers were then compared on the extent to which they differed in trait impulsivity and impulsive decision-making toward instant gratification. The results showed that the subgroups significantly differed in trait impulsivity but not in impulsive decision-making toward instant gratification. The present study demonstrated the usefulness of cluster analysis for profiling distinct, practically meaningful subgroups of mothers of reproductive age based on their attitudes and risk of alcohol use, which has important implications for developing intervention strategies for problematic alcohol use in this population.
   Public Health Significance This study suggests that there are three distinct subgroups of mothers of reproductive age who differ in their attitudes and risk of alcohol use, and that trait impulsivity can differentiate mothers with positive attitudes toward alcohol use yet low risk for problematic alcohol use from those with positive attitudes and high risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward COVID-19 play an important role in controlling the outbreak. The present study aimed to investigate the KAP of a group of women toward COVID-19 during the second wave of the outbreak in Iran.
   METHOD AND MATERIAL: A cross-sectional survey of 2862 women was conducted in May and June 2020 in two centers of Persian birth cohort . The survey instrument was a self-reported questionnaire Multivariable linear regression analysis to identify factors associated with knowledge and practice. toward COVID-19 and multinomial logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with attitudes. Unstandardized regression coefficients (beta) and odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were used to quantify the associations between variables and KAP.
   RESULT: Good knowledge and optimistic attitudes toward the successful control of COVID-19 was seen among participants. Overall, about 57.3% (1640), 41.1% (1176), and 1.6% (46) of respondents were categorized as low (score <50%), moderate (score: 50%-80%), and high (score > 80%) proper practice, respectively. Eighty-five individuals with COVID-19 experience (3.0%) had lower knowledge score (79.91 +/- 17.93 vs. 83.81 +/- 13.88, P < 0.001) and lower proper practice score (40.22 +/- 16.57 vs. 47.96 +/- 16.15, respectively, P < 0.001) compared to those who were not infected. A higher level of knowledge was associated with appropriate practice in both groups of positive attitudes (chi(2) = 32.23, P < 0.001) and negative attitudes (chi(2) = 31.49, P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSION: This survey recorded good knowledge and relatively good attitudes among women. Special health policies plan should be taken for target populations among women during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of counter-stereotypes cognitive training on adolescents' aging stereotypes and to further investigate the best training method to intervene in aging stereotypes by comparing the effect of single and multiple intervention training methods on aging stereotypes and their retention effects. Three experiments examined the different intervention outcomes of different counter-stereotypes cognitive training on adolescent aging stereotypes. The study used a randomized block group experimental design and recruited a total of 183 middle school students for testing. Experiment 1 verified the effect of counter-stereotypes cognitive training by taking a single training task (evaluative conditioning technique), randomly assigning subjects to different conditions (training task or unrelated drawing task), and administering a follow-up test 24h after the posttest. Experiment 2a compared the effects of multiple versus single cognitive training, where we took multiple (adding the counter-stereotypes situational storytelling method) versus single training tasks and administered a follow-up test 72h after the posttest. Experiment 2b increased the number of training sessions based on Experiment 2a, with a second intervention training 72h after the end of the posttest and a follow-up test 72h after the second training. Experimental results suggest that evaluative conditioning techniques are effective in weakening subjects' aging stereotypes, but are less effective in maintaining them. Compared to a single training task, multi-tasking is more effective and the effects of the intervention are maintained for up to a week by increasing the number of training sessions.

AB  - The present study was designed to test whether imagined intergroup contact (Crisp & Turner, 2009) affects attributions of human emotions to outgroup members and positive behavioral intentions toward the outgroup via increased outgroup trust. Italian fourth-graders took part in a three-week intervention, where they were asked to imagine meeting an unknown immigrant child in various social settings. One week after the last session, they were administered the dependent measures. Results revealed an indirect effect of imagined contact on both behavioral intentions and attributions of uniquely human emotions to outgroup members via outgroup trust. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed, and an integration of the imagined contact and infrahumanization literature is suggested. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, registered hate crimes are on the rise in many Western societies. What explains temporal variation in the incidence of hate crimes? Combining insights from the grievance model and the opportunity model, we study the role of three types of contextual factors: security (terrorism), media (news about terrorism and immigration), and political factors (speech by anti-immigration actors, hate speech prosecution, and high-profile anti-immigration victories). We apply time-series analysis to our original dataset of registered hate crimes in the Netherlands, 2015-2017 (N = 7,219). Findings indicate that terrorist attacks, (both print and online) news on refugees, immigration, and terrorism boost nonviolent hate crime. Similarly, news of the hate speech prosecution of Freedom Party leader Geert Wilders increases nonviolent crime as well. Tentative evidence points to a contagion effect of speech by anti-immigration actors. With regard to violent hate crime, only terrorist attacks had an effect. This effect was modest and only found in one of our models. Hence, the grievance and the opportunities model each partially explain nonviolent hate crime, although the security and media context seem most influential. Our findings help to identify the contextual factors contributing to a climate for hate and suggest that perceived threats play a key role.

AB  - Purpose The recent mobilization of many Hong Kong youth to engage in what are regarded as radical political activities is not a new area of investigation. Much has been discussed about this growing political activism and localism often giving an impression that Hong Kong youth are radical and disengaged from China as a nation. Yet little is known about the possible antecedents of such disengagement. The purpose of this paper is to identify whether there is empirical evidence of growth or decline in civic trust and national attitudes amongst Hong Kong young adolescents over the ten-year period from 1999 to 2009.
   Design/methodology/approach In this study latent profile analyses were used to classify cohorts of Hong Kong secondary students according to the levels of their self-reported trust in civic institutions and attitudes toward the nation. The cohorts were separated by a ten-year gap. Comparisons were made across groups and across the ten-year time span, in order to trace changes in civic attitudes of young adolescents following the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997.
   Findings Three distinct groups were identified in both cohorts - Activists, who had negative attitudes to trust and toward the nation, Nationalists who had positive attitudes toward trust and the nation and Moderates who endorsed average responses to the, two variables. The gaps between the groups tended to be greater in the 2009 group compared to the 1999 groups suggesting greater polarization amongst adolescents on these measures.
   Originality/value Young adolescents cannot be assumed to be politically neutral or lacking social values. Citizenship education needs to take this into account so that values can be clarified and major issues can be discussed in a safe and supportive environment.

AB  - Background Smoking remains a leading public health challenge globally. As a psychosocial determinant of health, social capital can influence health attitudes and behaviors, and thus it may have the capacity to reduce smoking rates. The aim of this research was to examine the association between social capital and attitudes towards smoking among university students. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among 538 health and medical students, recruited using the proportionate sampling method. Participants' social capital and attitudes toward smoking were assessed using the social capital questionnaire (SCQ) and the scale of cigarette smoking attitude (CSA). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficient, and the multiple regression analysis. Results About one in four health and medical students reported smoking, either currently or in the past, and 30% had either positive or indifferent attitudes towards smoking. The mean scores of the SCQ and the CSA were 105.1 +/- 19.7 and 48.6 +/- 11.2, respectively. There was a statistically significant negative association between the SCQ and the CSA scores (r = - 0.24; p < 0.001). In the regression analysis, the SCQ scores were also negatively and statistically significantly associated with the CSA scores, after controlling potential confounders (B: -0.09; 95% CI: - 0.13 to - 0.004). Conclusions As future healthcare providers, who are expected to take the primary role in reducing smoking rates in the community, health and medical students should be supported to develop appropriate attitudes towards smoking. Promoting positive social capital among university students has the capacity to improve their attitudes towards smoking. Possessing negative attitudes towards smoking should hopefully reduce smoking behaviors among future health professionals and improve their participation in anti-smoking campaigns.

AB  - BackgroundFor at least the past two decades, medical educators have worked to improve patient communication and health care delivery to diverse patient populations; despite efforts, patients continue to report prejudice and bias during their clinical encounters. Targeted instruction in implicit bias recognition and management may promote the delivery of equitable care, but students at times resist this instruction. Little guidance exists to overcome this resistance and to engage students in implicit bias instruction; instruction over time could lead to eventual skill development that is necessary to mitigate the influence of implicit bias on clinical practice behaviors.ObjectiveTo explore student perceptions of challenges and opportunities when participating in implicit bias instruction.ApproachWe conducted a qualitative study that involved 11 focus groups with medical students across each of the four class years to explore their perceptions of challenges and opportunities related to participating in such instruction. We analyzed transcripts for themes.Key ResultsOur analysis suggests a range of attitudes toward implicit bias instruction and identifies contextual factors that may influence these attitudes. The themes were (1) resistance; (2) shame; (3) the negative role of the hidden curriculum; and (4) structural barriers to student engagement. Students expressed resistance to implicit bias instruction; some of these attitudes are fueled from concerns of anticipated shame within the learning environment. Participants also indicated that student engagement in implicit bias instruction was influenced by the hidden curriculum and structural barriers.ConclusionsThese insights can inform future curriculum development efforts. Considerations related to instructional design and programmatic decision-making are highlighted. These considerations for implicit bias instruction may provide useful frameworks for educators looking for opportunities to minimize student resistance and maximize engagement in multi-session instruction in implicit bias recognition and management.

AB  - Background Moving palliative care from a solely clinical focus to a more population based and community orientated approach is the hallmark of a much advocated public health approach to palliative care. Young adults are a vital cohort of the public, yet their understanding of palliative care has not been investigated. This study aimed to explore young adults' understanding of palliative care and identify factors that influence their engagement. Methods A purposive sample of young adults (n = 24) aged 18-29 years were recruited from one UK University. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken face to face or via telephone or Skype between November 2017 and February 2018. Thematic analysis using a framework approach and underpinned by a socioecological perspective was used to analyse the interviews. Results Three thematic categories were identified relating to intrapersonal and interpersonal influences, cultural and social influences and organisational and public policy influences. Palliative care was understood as supportive comfort care, delivered in the absence of cure, associated with the end of life and specifically focused on death and dying. Negative attitudes related to the context of care, which represented a static and hopeless situation. Whilst some reported positive attitudes, potential engagement was seen to be governed by a lack of knowledge and protective cultural norms. In terms of demonstrating readiness to engage with palliative care, participants requested clear information and suggested a normalising of palliative care through the education system. Conclusion Young adults in this study were ready to find out more about palliative care and identified social media as a platform upon which to engage this population. However, their perception of a society that views palliative care as a subject for those directly affected, creates a barrier to engagement. This study identified the ingredients of a public health message and mediums for disseminating the message. However, findings also suggest that a cultural shift is required to recognise the potential of engaging young adults in health issues that cross the life span, empowering them not only as individuals but as vital members of community and society.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to highlight the importance of organizational culture on the leader's style and the effect of the chosen leadership style on the team's performance. It surveys a strata of leaders from the Middle East in the current turbulent environment.
   Design/methodology/approach A research paper based on a quantitative data collection in the service sector from a large number of stratified sampled firms and respondents.
   Findings The cross-sectional data from 40 service companies reveal some interesting results highlighting the interrelationships between these three variables. The findings suggest that managers need to build on this concept finding in providing further training and development of employees' skills in addition to an organizational culture of acceptance, adaptation and diversity.
   Research limitations/implications Electing to use a specific set of criteria in sampling might have resulted in eliminating a meaningful different direction in the results. Moreover, the size of the survey tool limited the number of variables to test with the study.
   Practical implications A number of implications are worthy of mention. First, devising reward programmes that are fairly attractive to both genders independently of each other should be a managerial priority, along with the creation and development of strong organizational cultures.
   Social implications Finally, a coupled performance and organizational culture of efficiency at the workplace, if not paralleled with a proper leadership style that fosters positive results, will only result in partial improvements in the big organizational picture, resulting in the persistence of the old prejudice and discrimination along the gender and age lines.
   Originality/value The study examines a suggested model in a new environment that is known to be deeply rooted in old-fashioned paternalistic managerial behaviour, and where change, if occurring, is extremely slow to introduce.

AB  - Quantitative studies have found that suicide bereavement is associated with suicide attempt, and is perceived as the most stigmatising of sudden losses. Their findings also suggest that perceived stigma may explain the excess suicidality. There is a need to understand the nature of this stigma and address suicide risk in this group. We aimed to describe and compare the nature of the experiences of stigma reported by people bereaved by suicide, sudden unnatural death, and sudden natural death, and identify any commonalities and unique experiences. We conducted a population-based cross-sectional survey of 659,572 staff and students at 37 British higher educational institutions in 2010, inviting those aged 18-40 who had experienced sudden bereavement of a close contact since the age of 10 to take part in an on-line survey and to volunteer for an interview to discuss their experiences. We used maximum variation sampling from 1398 volunteer interviewees to capture a range of experiences, and conducted individual face-to-face semi-structured interviews to explore perceptions of stigma and support. We continued sampling until no new themes were forthcoming, reaching saturation at n = 27 interviews (11 participants bereaved by suicide). We employed thematic analysis to identify any distinct dimensions of reported stigma, and any commonalities across the three groups. We identified two key themes: specific negative attitudes of others, and social awkwardness. Both themes were common to interviewees bereaved by suicide, sudden unnatural death, and sudden natural death. All interviewees reported the experience of stigmatising social awkwardness, but this may have been experienced more acutely by those bereaved by suicide due to self-stigma. This study provides evidence of a persistent death taboo in relation to sudden deaths. There is potential for anti-stigma interventions to reduce the isolation and social awkwardness perceived by people bereaved suddenly, particularly after suicide loss.

AB  - The Northwestern University Law Review's 2017 Symposium asked whether McCleskey v. Kemp closed the door on social science's ability to meaningfully contribute to equal protection deliberations. This inquiry is understandable; McCleskey is widely understood to have rendered statistical racial disparities doctrinally irrelevant in the equal protection context. We suggest, however, that this account overstates McCleskey and its doctrinal impact. Roughly fifteen years after McCleskey, Chief Justice William Rehnquist-himself part of the McCleskey majority-invoked admissions data to support his conclusion that the University of Michigan Law School unconstitutionally discriminated against white applicants.
   Chief Justice Rehnquist's disparate treatment of statistical evidence in McCleskey and Grutter v. Bollinger reveals the doctrine's under-determinacy and invites a corresponding inquiry: why do Justices rely on social science in some cases, yet reject it in others? We propose that one answer lies at the intersections of Critical Race Theory (CRT) and empirical scholarship on motivated social cognition. This "eCRT" lens illuminates how ostensibly neutral biases and heuristics, when informed by socially salient racial stereotypes, will predictably and systematically lead judges to overvalue "evidence" that rationalizes existing racial disparities and, as a result, author legal opinions that re-instantiate and legitimize the status quo.

AB  - In July 2018, the UK's Intelligence & Security Committee issued a report into diversity and inclusion across the intelligence and security community. The picture the report painted was far from satisfactory; in short, Britain's intelligence agencies did not 'fully reflect the ethnic make-up of modern Britain'. The report argued that Britain's spy agencies - MI5, SIS (or MI6) and GCHQ - should improve black, Asian and ethnic minority recruitment, highlighting areas for improvement, especially around the vetting of recruits. This problem stems from the post-war Cold War 'security state' and the development of security-vetting programmes from the 1940s, aiming to protect Whitehall from Soviet spies and 'fellow travellers' to those with so-called 'character defects'- drink, drugs and homosexuality. But this 'security state' also saw the newly emerging multicultural Britain as a major threat. The so-called 'Windrush Generation' of migrants from the Caribbean, and migration from the Indian subcontinent and Africa, forever changed the social complexion of Britain, but posed significant questions for security officials. What was Britishness? With first or second generation migrants entering the civil service, who was a 'UK eye' and what access to secret information should they have? To what extent was discrimination justifiable to protect state secrets, and how should officials respond to new legislation such as the Race Discrimination Act? As this article shows, new entrants to the civil service faced deeply engrained prejudices, and questions over their loyalty to Britain. As late as the 1960s (and beyond), 'coloured' members of the civil service were rejected from secret posts across government, including the Ministry of Defence and intelligence and security services, especially MI5 and GCHQ, with discrimination on 'security' grounds justified by the landmark 1968 Race Relations Act, which barred race discrimination for housing and employment elsewhere.

AB  - Stigma associated with psychiatric disorders tends to be manifested as negative attitudes or behavior toward the mentally ill. It has negative influences, such as leading to difficulty in establishing trust-based relationships and interfering with medical treatment. In order to reduce such stigma, it is necessary to clarify its extent and characteristics in healthcare professionals. Considering this, an Internet-based questionnaire survey was conducted, involving doctors (n = 186), nurses (n = 161), and pharmacists (n = 192) in comparison with the general public (n = 331), and using the Whatley Social Distance Scale (WSDS) and Index of Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill (IATM) as stigma-related indices.
   Median total WSDS scores and interquartile range were as follows: doctors: 15.5(12.0-18.0), nurses: 14.0(12.0-16.5), pharmacists: 15.0(13.0-17.0), and the general public: 16.0(13.0-18.0). Similarly, median IATM scores were as follows: doctors: 39.0(36.0-42.0), nurses: 39.0(37.0-43.0), pharmacists: 40.0(36.0-42.0), and the general public: 37.0(33.0-41.0). IATM scores were significantly higher in the professional groups than the general public group. Both healthcare professionals and the general public with prior exposure to mental illness were more favorable attitudes toward the mentally ill. Especially among healthcare professionals, they working in psychiatric departments were more favorable attitudes.
   These results suggest that the stigma of healthcare professionals toward the mentally ill was shown to have a smaller and relatively favorable attitude than that of the general public. In order to correct the stigma it was suggested that a good contact experience with the patient such as work and training in psychiatry is effective.

AB  - This article constructs a brief history of how lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) issues have intersected with South African psychology at key sociopolitical moments, filling a gap in current histories. Organized psychology-a primary focus of this analysis-since its first formations in 1948, mostly colluded with apartheid governments by othering queerness as psychopathology or social deviance. The National Party, both homophobic and racist, ruled the country from 1948 until the first democratic elections in 1994. The acceleration of antiapartheid struggles in the 1980s saw progressive psychologists develop more critical forms of theory and practice. However, LGBTI+ issues remained overshadowed by the primary struggle for racial equality and democracy. Psychology's chameleon-like adaptation to evolving eras resulted in a unified organization when apartheid ended: the Psychological Society of South Africa (PsySSA). Democratic South Africa's Constitution took the bold step of protecting sexuality as a fundamental human right, galvanizing a fresh wave of LGBTI+ scholarship post-1994. However, LGBTI+ people still suffered prejudice, discrimination, and violence. Additionally, psychology training continued to ignore sexual orientation and gender-affirmative health care in curricula. PsySSA therefore joined the International Psychology Network for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Issues (IPsyNet) in 2007, catalyzing the PsySSA African LGBTI+ Human Rights Project in 2012 and two pioneering publications: a position statement on affirmative practice in 2013, and practice guidelines for psychology professionals working with sexually and gender-diverse people in 2017. This article traces a neglected history of South African psychology, examining the political, social, and institutional factors that eventually enabled the development of LGBTI+ affirmative psychologies.

AB  - Background: Early assessment and evidence-based management of depression can significantly improve recovery and enhance well-being. People with depression often present to general practice as their first contact with the health system. Although few general practice nurses have specialist mental health qualifications, to optimise outcomes they must be able to appropriately identify, triage and manage mental health issues such as depression.Aim: To explore the attitudes of general practice nurses about depression and investigate their current roles in mental health care. Design: A descriptive cross-sectional online survey.Methods: An online survey was delivered to nurses working in Australian general practice. An investigator developed survey collected data about participant demographics and their role in mental health within general practice. Attitudes to depression were measured using the Depression Attitudes Questionnaire.Findings: One hundred and four responses were included in the analysis. Findings indicate that participants felt that it was within their role to engage in activities related to mental health care. Participants also disagreed with negative attitudes to depression. Despite this, few participants were currently involved in assessing mental health or developing care plans for those living with mental illness. Few participants had undertaken professional development in mental health topics, although most identified that they felt additional learning would be beneficial.Conclusion: As the first point of contact with the health system, general practice plays an important role in the identification of mental health issues and determining the health services required. In an environment of increasing demand for mental health support, this role cannot be underestimated. With this in mind, the general practice nurse's role in mental health care can have a significant impact on the well-being of the community. Strategies that create opportunities for nurses' engagement in professional development and facilitate the assessment of people's mental health within usual care have the potential to improve the quality of care and health outcomes.(c) 2021 Australian College of Nursing Ltd.

AB  - Background: Much of the research on African-Americans' HPV vaccine acceptance has largely focused on racial/ethnic differences related to cognitive, socio-economical, and structural factors that contribute to differences in HPV vaccine acceptance and completion. A growing body of literature suggest that cultural factors, such as mistrust of healthcare providers (HCPs) and the healthcare system, religion, and social norms related to appropriate sexual behaviors, also plays a prominent role in their HPV vaccine acceptance. However, these studies were limited in their use of theoretical approaches necessary to conceptualize and operationalize culture. Objective: To explore the influence of culture on African-American mothers' and daughters' HPV vaccine acceptance using the PEN-3, a culturally-centered conceptual framework. Methods: Grounded theory techniques were used to explore cultural factors that influenced the acceptance of the HPV vaccine among African-American mothers (n = 28) and their daughters (n = 34). Results: Positive attitudes towards vaccination stemmed from beliefs that the HPV vaccine has cancer prevention benefits and that vaccinations in general protected against infectious diseases. Negative attitudes stemmed from beliefs that the HPV vaccine was too new, not effective, daughters were too young, and that vaccines were not a one-size-fits-all intervention. Majority of mothers and daughters indicated that their religious doctrine did not impede their HPV vaccination decisions. For a few mothers, religious beliefs could not be separated from their HPV vaccination decisions and ultimately deterred HPV vaccine acceptance. HCP recommendations were valued however mothers were often dissatisfied with the detail of information communicated. Support networks provided both positive and negative types of social support to mothers and daughters. The media highlighted the cancer prevention benefits of the HPV vaccine and unintentionally communicated negative information of the HPV vaccine, which deterred HPV vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: Study findings can inform the development of culturally appropriate interventions that advances the evidence on cervical cancer prevention.

AB  - Introduction: HIV prevalence among pregnant women in Kenya is high. Furthermore, there is a high risk of maternal mortality, as many women do not give birth with a skilled healthcare provider. Previous research suggests that fears of HIV testing and unwanted disclosure of HIV status may be important barriers to utilizing maternity services. We explored relationships between women's perceptions of HIV-related stigma and their attitudes and intentions regarding facility-based childbirth.
   Methods: 1,777 pregnant women were interviewed at their first antenatal care visit. We included socio-demographic characteristics, stigma scales, HIV knowledge measures, and an 11-item scale measuring health facility birth attitudes (HFBA). HFBA includes items on cost, transport, comfort, interpersonal relations, and services during delivery at a health facility versus at home. A higher mean HFBA score indicates a more positive attitude towards facility-based childbirth. The mean HFBA score was dichotomized at the median and analyses were conducted with this dichotomized HFBA score using mixed effects logit models.
   Results: Women who anticipated HIV-related stigma from their male partner had lower adjusted odds of having positive attitudes about giving birth at the health facility (adjusted OR = .63, 95% CI 0.50-0.78) and less positive attitudes about health facility birth were strongly related to women's intention to give birth outside a health facility (adjusted OR = 5.56, 95% CI 2.69-11.51).
   Conclusions: In this sample of pregnant women in rural Kenya, those who anticipated HIV-related stigma were less likely to have positive attitudes towards facility-based childbirth. Furthermore, negative attitudes about facility-based childbirth were associated with the intention to deliver outside a health facility. Thus, HIV-related stigma reduction efforts might result in more positive attitudes towards facility-based childbirth, and thereby lead to an increased level of skilled birth attendance, and reductions in maternal and infant mortality.

AB  - Background
   Unsafe abortion is still a leading cause of maternal death in most Sub-Saharan African countries. Post-abortion care (PAC) aims to minimize morbidity and mortality following unsafe abortion, addressing incomplete abortion by treating complications, and reducing possible future unwanted pregnancies by providing contraceptive advice. In this article, we draw on data from PAC service providers and patients in Kenya to illustrate how the quality of PAC in healthcare facilities is impacted by law and government policy.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional design was used for this study, with in-depth interviews conducted to collect qualitative data from PAC service providers and seekers in healthcare facilities. Data were analyzed both deductively and inductively, with diverse sub-themes related to specific components of PAC quality.
   Results
   The provision of quality PAC in healthcare facilities in Kenya is still low, with access hindered by restrictions on abortion. Negative attitudes towards abortion result in the continued undirected self-administration of abortifacients. Intermittent service interruptions through industrial strikes and inequitable access to care also drive unsafe terminations. Poor PAC service availability and lack of capacity to manage complications in primary care facilities result in multiple referrals and delays in care following abortion, leading to further complications. Inefficient infection control exposes patients and caregivers to unrelated infections within facilities, and the adequate provision of contraception is a continued challenge.
   Discussion
   Legal, policy and cultural restrictions to access PAC increase the level of complications. In Kenya, there is limited policy focus on PAC, especially at primary care level, and no guidelines for health providers to provide legal, safe abortion. Discrimination at the point of care discourages women from presenting for care, and discourages providers from freely offering post-abortion contraceptive guidance and services. Poor communication between facilities and communities continues to result in delayed care and access-related discrimination.
   Conclusion
   Greater emphasis should be placed on the prevention of unsafe abortion and improved access to post-abortion care services in healthcare facilities. There is a definite need for service guidelines for this to occur.

AB  - BackgroundIn remote rural Tanzania, the rate of linkage into HIV care was estimated at 28% in 2014. This study explored facilitators and barriers to linkage to HIV care at individual/patient, health care provider, health system, and contextual levels to inform eventual design of interventions to improve linkage to HIV care.MethodsWe conducted a descriptive qualitative study nested in a cohort study of 1012 newly diagnosed HIV-positive individuals in Mbeya region between August 2014 and July 2015. We conducted 8 focus group discussions and 10 in-depth interviews with recently diagnosed HIV-positive individuals and 20 individual interviews with healthcare providers. Transcripts were analyzed inductively using thematic content analysis. The emergent themes were then deductively fitted into the four level ecological model.ResultsWe identified multiple factors influencing linkage to care. HIV status disclosure, support from family/relatives and having symptoms of disease were reported to facilitate linkage at the individual level. Fear of stigma, lack of disclosure, denial and being asymptomatic, belief in witchcraft and spiritual beliefs were barriers identified at individual's level. At providers' level; support and good patient-staff relationship facilitated linkage, while negative attitudes and abusive language were reported barriers to successful linkage. Clear referral procedures and well-organized clinic procedures were system-level facilitators, whereas poorly organized clinic procedures and visit schedules, overcrowding, long waiting times and lack of resources were reported barriers. Distance and transport costs to HIV care centers were important contextual factors influencing linkage to care.ConclusionLinkage to HIV care is an important step towards proper management of HIV. We found that access and linkage to care are influenced positively and negatively at all levels, however, the individual-level and health system-level factors were most prominent in this setting. Interventions must address issues around stigma, denial and inadequate awareness of the value of early linkage to care, and improve the capacity of HIV treatment/care clinics to implement quality care, particularly in light of adopting the Test and Treat' model of HIV treatment and care recommended by the World Health Organization.

AB  - This study explored weight bias against women from different weight categories in relation to occupational decisions, child adoption, and helping behaviour, as well as individual difference correlates of weight bias. A total of 1024 participants were randomly assigned to one of five conditions in which they were asked to select the women they would most and least likely hire, promote, or terminate, select for parental adoption, or assist following a traffic accident. They also completed measures of anti-fat attitudes, fat phobia, and attitudes toward obese persons. Results showed bias against both emaciated and obese women across conditions, and suggested that bias was strongest in relation to hiring and weakest in relation to helping behaviour. Further results showed that only greater concern about becoming fat significantly predicted weight bias. These results suggest that weight bias may affect women at both ends of the weight continuum, which require measures to reduce discrimination. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: As yet, little is known about the effects of mental health stigma on sustainable employment. This is surprising, as mental health stigma is common, and because people with severe and common mental disorders are 7 and 3 times more likely to be unemployed, respectively, than people with no disorders. As the global lifetime prevalence of mental disorders is 29%, the high unemployment rates of people with these health problems constitute an important and urgent public health inequality problem that needs to be addressed.
   Main text: The aim of this position paper is to illustrate the assumption that stigma contributes to the unemployment of people with mental illness and mental health issues with evidence from recent scientific studies on four problem areas, and to provide directions for future research. These four problem areas indicate that: (1) employers and line managers hold negative attitudes towards people with mental illness or mental health issues, which decreases the chances of people with these health problems being hired or supported; (2) both the disclosure and non-disclosure of mental illness or mental health issues can lead to job loss; (3) anticipated discrimination, self-stigma and the 'Why Try' effect can lead to insufficient motivation and effort to keep or find employment and can result in unemployment; and (4) stigma is a barrier to seeking healthcare, which can lead to untreated and worsened health conditions and subsequently to adverse occupational outcomes (e.g. sick leave, job loss).
   Conclusions: The paper concludes that stigma in the work context is a considerable and complex problem, and that there is an important knowledge gap especially regarding the long-term effects of stigma on unemployment. To prevent and decrease adverse occupational outcomes in people with mental illness or mental health issues there is an urgent need for high quality and longitudinal research on stigma related consequences for employment. In addition, more validated measures specifically for the employment setting, as well as destigmatizing intervention studies are needed.

AB  - Background: Volunteers have been a valuable resource in supporting people with dementia and their caregivers in the community. However, factors such as misconceptions, negative attitudes towards dementia, and a lack of motivation might impact the quality of volunteer care. The present paper aims to examine the effect of training and service provision on the knowledge and attitudes of volunteers towards dementia and the association between knowledge and attitudes with the levels of motivation to volunteer.
   Methods: The present study is part of an effectiveness-implementation cluster randomized clinical hybrid trial using a music-with-movement intervention to promote the well-being of people with dementia and their informal caregivers. Volunteers were recruited to receive training to support the delivery of the intervention. Training and enrichment workshops were offered to volunteers during the one-year project. Before and after their training and service, the recruited volunteers were asked to complete the following assessments: Dementia Attitudes Scale, and the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale. The levels of motivation to volunteer was measured with Volunteer Functions Inventory at baseline. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and multiple regression test were applied for statistical analyses.
   Results: A total of 107 volunteers were recruited, and 81 of them completed a mean period of 47.32 weeks of training and service. Significant improvements in their total score on the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (p=.009) and Dementia Attitudes Scale (p < .001) were found. Dementia attitude (beta =.57, p <.001) and knowledge (beta =-.18, p = .038) were found to have the most significant association with the levels of motivation to be a volunteer at baseline.
   Conclusions: The present study illustrated the importance of quality volunteer training and voluntary service in improving the dementia knowledge and attitudes of volunteers. It also shed light on the association between knowledge and attitudes with the levels of motivation to volunteer. Accordingly, future research and public health policymakers should address more efforts to amplify the advantage of volunteers as a vital asset in dementia care.

AB  - Framed by role congruity and ambivalent sexism, the current study is designed to investigate perceptions of male and female nurses. Specifically, 167 Canadian undergraduates from Southern Ontario viewed a potential nursing recruitment advertisement (female nurse, male nurse, or masculinity emphasized male nurse), reported their perceptions of the nurse in the advertisement, and rated the appropriateness of nursing as a career for men and women. MANOVAs revealed that participants viewed the male nurses more negatively (less competent and more deviant) in the masculinity emphasized condition than the male nurse condition, which is consistent with role congruity theory. Correlations further revealed that men in the male nurse condition and women in the masculinity emphasized condition who were higher in hostile sexism were more likely to rate the depicted male nurse as deviant than their lower scoring peers. Female participants rated nursing as a more appropriate career for men than did male participants, suggesting that resistance toward male nurses may stem primarily from other men. The ambivalent sexism scores of men and women related differently in each condition to ratings of the appropriateness of nursing as a career for men and women, suggesting a complex relationship between sexism and acceptance of male nurses. The findings imply that attempts to challenge current stereotypes by emphasizing the masculinity of men in female dominated careers may instead lead to perceptions of greater role incongruity-and more negative perceptions of men in these careers. Moreover, ambivalent sexism may be contributing to resistances toward men in nursing.

AB  - This paper explores how working on a faculty-led research project influenced the views of Master of Social Work students concerning unauthorized immigrants. Five graduate assistants worked for one year with two faculty members and one doctoral student to code data from interviews with social workers at immigrant-serving organizations in South Carolina. The master's students then reflected on what they learned from participating in data analysis tasks, indicating that the experience had further sensitized them to the social justice concerns confronting unauthorized immigrants. Drawing on social contact theory, we argue that student participation in faculty-led research can provide a form of indirect social exposure to other groups, which reduce bias, and suggest that such experiences be included in how educators conceptualize the implicit curriculum in schools of social work.

AB  - Introduction
   European societies are rapidly becoming multicultural. Cultural diversity presents new challenges and opportunities to communities that receive immigrants and migrants, and highlights the need for culturally safe healthcare. Universities share a responsibility to build a fair and equitable society by integrating cultural content in the nursing curricula. This paper aims to analyze European student nurses experience of learning cultural competence and of working with patients from diverse cultural backgrounds.
   Materials and methods
   A phenomenological approach was selected through a qualitative research method. 7 semi-structured focus groups with 5-7 students took place at the participants' respective universities in Spain, Belgium, Turkey and Portugal.
   Results
   5 themes and 16 subthemes emerged from thematic analysis. Theme 1, concept of culture/cultural diversity, describes the participants' concept of culture; ethnocentricity emerged as a frequent element in the students' discourse. Theme 2, personal awareness, integrates the students' self-perception of cultural competence and their learning needs. Theme 3, impact of culture, delves on the participants' perceived impact of cultural on both nursing care and patient outcomes. Theme 4, learning cultural competence, integrates the participants' learning experiences as part of their nursing curricula, as part of other academic learning opportunities and as part of extra-academic activities. Theme 5, learning cultural competence during practice placements, addresses some important issues including witnessing unequal care, racism, prejudice and conflict, communication and language barriers, tools and resources and positive attitudes and behaviors witnesses or displayed during clinical practice.
   Conclusion
   The participants' perceived level of cultural competence was variable. All the participants agreed that transcultural nursing content should be integrated in the nursing curricula, and suggested different strategies to improve their knowledge, skills and attitudes. It is important to listen to the students and take their opinion into account when designing cultural teaching and learning activities.

AB  - During the early 1920s, an average of 25,000 colonial soldiers from North Africa, Senegal and Madagascar formed part of the French army of occupation in the Rhineland. The campaign against these troops, which used the racist epithet 'black horror on the Rhine' (schwarze Schmach am Rhein), was one of the most important propaganda efforts of the Weimar period. In black horror propaganda, images of alleged sexual violence against Rhenish women and children by African French soldiers served as metaphors for Germany's 'victimization' through the Versailles Treaty. Because the campaign initially gained broad popular and official support, historians have tended to consider the black horror a successful nationalist movement bridging political divides and strengthening the German nation state. In contrast, this essay points to some of the contradictions within the campaign, which often crystallized around conflicts over the nature of effective propaganda. Extreme racist claims about the Rhineland's alleged 'mulattoization' (Mulattisierung) increasingly alienated Rhinelanders and threatened to exacerbate traditional tensions between the predominantly Catholic Rhineland and the central state at a time when Germany's western borders seemed rather precarious in the light of recent territorial losses and separatist agitation. There was a growing concern that radical strands within the black horror movement were detrimental to the cohesion of the German nation state and to Germany's positive image abroad, and this was a major reason behind the campaign's decline after 1921/22. The conflicts within the campaign also point to some hitherto neglected affinities between the black horror and subsequent Nazi propaganda.

AB  - Background: Negative attitude and discriminatory behavior of health professionals constitute a major obstacle in psychiatric care and have been pointed out as a key issue in working with mental illness. Understanding about the attitude of nurses is crucial for quality and holistic care of psychiatric services and essential for the successful integration of mental health into primary health care. However, there is a paucity of study to examine the attitude of primary health care nurses towards severe mental disorder in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the attitude of primary health care nurses and its associated factors towards people with severe mental illness in Addis Ababa.
   Methods: Institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted among nurses working at primary health care in Addis Ababa from May to June, 2018. Multistage sampling technique was used to select 634 participants. A structured self-administered questionnaire was used. Data were coded and entered into EPIDATA 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with attitudes of nurses in primary health care. The level of significance was declared at P-value < 0.05 with 95% confidence interval.
   Results: A total of 610 respondents were included in the study with a response rate of 96.2%. The mean age of participants was 28.6 +/- 5.9 (SD) years and the prevalence of negative attitude was 48.2%. Multiple logistic regression models revealed that respondents who have diploma [AOR = 3.09, CI (1.20-7.95)], work experience of < 5 years [AOR = 4.49, CI (2.37-8.49)], respondents who didn't took mh-Gap training [AOR = 4.92, CI (3.05-7.95)] and poor knowledge about mental illness [AOR = 2.84, CI (1.82-4.44) were associated with negative attitude towards people with severe mental illness.
   Conclusion: Nearly half of the participants have negative attitude towards people with severe mental disorders. Therefore, evidence based and contextualized models are warranted to mitigate negative attitudes of primary health care nurses.

TI  - Challenges Women with Disability Face in Accessing and Using Maternal Healthcare Services in Ghana: A Qualitative Study
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - USER-FEE EXEMPTION
KW  - ACCESSIBILITY
KW  - BARRIERS
AB  - Background
   While a number of studies have examined the factors affecting accessibility to and utilisation of healthcare services by persons with disability in general, there is little evidence about disabled women's access to maternal health services in low-income countries and few studies consult disabled women themselves to understand their experience of care and the challenges they face in accessing skilled maternal health services. The objective of this paper is to explore the challenges women with disabilities encounter in accessing and using institutional maternal healthcare services in Ghana.
   Methods and Findings
   A qualitative study was conducted in 27 rural and urban communities in the Bosomtwe and Central Gonja districts of Ghana with a total of 72 purposively sampled women with different physical, visual, and hearing impairments who were either lactating or pregnant at the time of this research. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were used to gather data. Attride-Stirling's thematic network framework was used to analyse the data. Findings suggest that although women with disability do want to receive institutional maternal healthcare, their disability often made it difficult for such women to travel to access skilled care, as well as gain access to unfriendly physical health infrastructure. Other related access challenges include: healthcare providers' insensitivity and lack of knowledge about the maternity care needs of women with disability, negative attitudes of service providers, the perception from able-bodied persons that women with disability should be asexual, and health information that lacks specificity in terms of addressing the special maternity care needs of women with disability.
   Conclusions
   Maternal healthcare services that are designed to address the needs of able-bodied women might lack the flexibility and responsiveness to meet the special maternity care needs of women with disability. More disability-related cultural competence and patient-centred training for healthcare providers as well as the provision of disability-friendly transport and healthcare facilities and services are needed.

Although operators of CMOs comprising pharmacists and over-the-counter (OTC) medicine sellers largely support the public-private mix strategy which seeks to engage pharmacies in tuberculosis (TB) case detection, a significant proportion is not involved in TB referral services. The study explores the barriers to and motivation for presumptive TB case referral among CMO operators. Methods We used open- and close-ended questions nested in a telephone survey which assessed factors associated with presumptive TB case referral among CMO operators (n = 465). We interviewed participants using computer assisted telephone interviews and analysed the qualitative data using adjusted Mayring's structured qualitative content analysis. Results Based on participants' own experiences, non-referral was attributed to negative attitudes of presumed cases (48.2%) and inability to meet the financial demands of referred presumed cases (26.3%). Regarding their perception of barriers to TB referral for their professional colleagues, an assumed lack of TB training (44.5%) and an assumed negative attitude of operators (43.6%) were mentioned. From close-ended questions, most chosen barriers to referral were: the assumption of not having seen a presumptive TB case yet (31.8%), lack of TB training (22.2%) and no monetary motivation for operators (10.5%). Most operators (81.6%) view TB referral services as their social responsibility and feel self-motivated to refer cases in order to control the spread of TB in their communities. Of 152 further comments extracted as recommendations to improve referral, 101 (66.4%) of respondents would only refer with the availability of support systems in the form of TB training and making TB diagnostic testing more accessible. Conclusion Operators of CMOs are predominantly self-motivated to refer presumptive TB cases. Barriers to referral might be mitigated by providing more training to operators and specific financial support such as reimbursement of travel costs to presumptive cases.

AB  - Background: In psoriatic arthritis (PsA) almost all qualitative studies have been performed in European populations. This work aimed to evaluate the impact of PsA in Brazilian and French subjects, as well as to explore cultural differences in the experience of disease and to recognize domains important for patients living with PsA outside Europe.
   Methods: A qualitative study was conducted in two university hospitals in Brazil and France; outpatients fulfilling Classification Criteria for PsA participated in individual interviews regarding the impact of PsA; interviews were conducted in the local language. The sample size was defined by saturation; interviews were recorded and transcribed and content analysis was performed.
   Results: Fifteen patients were interviewed in Brazil and 13 in France. Mean disease duration was 16.5 +/- 12.5 years (range: 8 months to 47 years) and 14.4 +/- 8.4 years (range 12 months to 29 years) for Brazilian and French subjects, respectively. A broad impact was perceived: 67 codes emerged from the interviews and were grouped in 41 categories. Although 2/3 of categories were common to both nationalities, some important health domains from the perspective of PsA patients from a non-European background were brought to light including sexual dysfunction, emotional impact of psoriasis and impact of prejudice on social and professional life.
   Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of assessing the impact of PsA on a national level, emphasizing the common cross-cultural aspects but also revealing domains of interest for patients with PsA living outside Europe which merit further study.

AB  - Background Vaccination against COVID-19 has been available in Germany since December 2020. However, about 30% of the population report not wanting to be vaccinated. In order to increase the willingness of the population to get vaccinated, data on the acceptance of vaccination and its influencing factors are necessary. Little is known about why individuals refuse the COVID-19 vaccination. The aim of this study was to investigate the reasons leading to rejecting vaccination, based on posts from three social media sites. Methods The German-language versions of Instagram, Twitter and YouTube were searched regarding negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Data was extracted until a saturation effect could be observed. The data included posts created from January 20, 2020 to May 2, 2021. This time frame roughly covers the period from the first reports of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 up to the general availability of vaccines against COVID-19 in Germany. We used an interpretive thematic approach to analyze the data and to inductively generate codes, subcategories and categories. Results Based on 333 posts written by 323 contributing users, we identified six main categories of reasons for refusing a COVID-19 vaccination: Low perceived benefit of vaccination, low perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, health concerns, lack of information, systemic mistrust and spiritual or religious reasons. The analysis reveals a lack of information among users and the spread of misinformation with regard to COVID-19 and vaccination. Users feel inadequately informed about vaccination or do not understand the information available. These information gaps may be related to information not being sufficiently sensitive to the needs of the target group. In addition to limited information for the general population, misinformation on the internet can also be an important reason for refusing vaccination. Conclusions The study emphasizes the relevance of providing trustworthy and quality-assured information on COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination to all population groups. In addition, vaccinations should be easily accessible in order to promote the population's willingness to be vaccinated.

AB  - This article aims to improve our understanding about why and how individuals' signals of cognitive and noncognitive skills influence labour market outcomes. We study how employers use skills signals when hiring labour market entrants. These demand-side microprocesses are investigated at the apprenticeship market in Germany, which functions as the main entry labour market below tertiary-level education. Qualitative studies and personnel psychology research suggest multistage hiring processes. We concentrate on the first stage at which employers narrow the applicant pools based on written application documents. Their information is limited to applicants' school reports-including their grades (as signals of cognitive skills) and teachers' evaluations of their behaviours (as signals of noncognitive skills). We conducted two linked field experiments, applying the correspondence test method. Analysing the unbiased employers' responses to randomly varied fictitious applicant profiles enables us to discover whether, and if so how, applicants' skills signals are used as 'screens' at the first selection stage. The experiments reveal that both skills signals are important selection criteria, but employers prefer noncognitive skills signals. Moreover, the findings confirm that firms use thresholds (cut-off values) for selection criteria instead of linear rankings.

AB  - Purpose Personality disorder is reported to elicit strong emotional responses and negative attitudes in mental health staff (Bodner et al., 2015). The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the design and development of a co-produced e-learning training package for personality disorder awareness and an evaluation of its effectiveness. This study was carried out to explore if e-learning is an effective mode of training delivery for raising personality disorder awareness.
   Design/methodology/approach The e-learning was uniquely developed by subject matter experts working in co-production with people with lived experience. Self-reported measures were completed at three separate intervals to evaluate the effectiveness of the training: at pre-, post- and three-month follow up. Quantitative data were collected via these questionnaires.
   Findings The results from this evaluation show that e-learning is an effective mode of delivery for raising the awareness of personality disorder among mental health professionals, achieving similar outcomes to those reported following face-to-ace training.
   Research limitations/implications Attrition at follow-up phase was high which was consistent with other similar studies. The evaluation was led by the lead contributors and in the geographical area of its development. The study was relatively small and the participants were self-selected, therefore findings should be treated with caution.
   Practical implications E-learning can provide flexible training to compliment and act as an alternative to face-to-face personality disorder training. E-learning may provide an alternative refresher course to knowledge and understanding framework or other face-to-face methods. Co-produced training can be mirrored within an e-learning programme, careful planning to ensure the service user voice is heard and that their lived experience is embraced is required.
   Originality/value This is the first evaluation of a co-produced e-learning only personality disorder awareness training. It is also the first paper to carry out a review of the published evaluations of personality awareness training in the UK with comparisons explored across the studies.

AB  - Introduction: Exercise is recommended for patients undergoing hemodialysis to decrease morbidity and mortality. However, their exercise level is lower than healthy people. Understanding reasons behind their sedentary lifestyle is required. Traditional Chinese culture may have a profound impact on patients' perceptions of exercise, particularly with regard to the relationship of overwork and kidney function and family members' attitudes toward patients' participation in exercise. Therefore, we sought to explore the facilitators and barriers to exercise influenced by traditional Chinese culture. Methods: We conducted semistructured interviews with 44 Chinese patients residing in Nantong of Jiangsu Province undergoing hemodialysis, aged 25 to 77 years. Interview questions focused on their perceptions of, attitudes to, and experiences with exercise. Each interview was digitally recorded and lasted from 40 to 60 minutes. Conventional content analysis was used to understand facilitators and barriers to exercise within their experience and perceptions. Findings: We found that specific Chinese cultural health beliefs informed by traditional Chinese medicine strongly affected patients' attitudes and behaviors toward exercise. Participants in this study tended to believe that overwork impairs kidney functions and viewed strenuous exercise as overwork. Although participants admitted the benefits of exercise, they rejected strenuous exercise and regarded nearly all modalities of exercise with or without facilities (except walking) as strenuous exercise. The most common barriers to exercise were lack of motivation, bad weather, negative attitudes of family members toward patients' doing exercise, and insufficient exercise information resources. The most common facilitators found in this study were their increased physical well-being and confidence from exercise. Group exercise supported by family members and positive attitudes toward obtaining exercise information were also motivators. Discussion: Chinese patients undergoing hemodialysis reported more barriers than facilitators to exercise. Perceptions and attitudes toward exercise informed by traditional Chinese culture may be hidden barriers to exercising. Our findings indicated that culturally sensitive and patient-centered exercise interventions for Chinese patients are urgently needed.

TI  - Success Rates for Notification of Enrollment in Exception From Informed Consent Clinical Trials
T2  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
LA  - English
KW  - FAMILY
AB  - Objectives: Exception from informed consent (EFIC) for research in emergency settings requires investigators to notify enrolled subjects, family members, or legally authorized representatives about inclusion in the study. We examined the success rate of a notification strategy including mail services for subjects enrolled in EFIC trials.
   Methods: We describe notification attempts for subjects in three out-of-hospital cardiac arrest clinical trials in both urban and rural areas around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, between the years 2000 and 2014. We examined the time required to notify subjects and the success of contacting subjects or their representatives when notified in person (if alive), by mail (if alive and unable to reach in person), or by mail (if the subject was deceased). We characterized comments received from subjects or their representatives as positive, neutral, or negative.
   Results: We attempted notification on a total of 1,912 subjects, 1,762 by mail, and 163 in person. Of these, 1,767 (92%) notification forms were successfully delivered, and 431 (24%) were signed and returned. Only 16 subjects or representatives (0.91%) requested to withdraw from the study. In-person notifications were more likely to be signed than mailed notifications (69% vs. 20%; p < 0.001). A total of 3.2% of recipients contacted investigators by phone or letter in response to notifications, but only five recipients expressed negative attitudes toward the trial. Ninety percent of subjects were notified within 35 days of the incident. Time to notification was shorter for in person (median = 5 days, interquartile range [IQR] = 2 to 10 days) than for deceased and mailed (11 days, IQR = 8 to 14 days) or alive and mailed (20 days, IQR = 14 to 29 days).
   Conclusions: It is possible to successfully notify recipients of enrollment in a study using EFIC over 90% of the time within 35 days, although only 24% of recipients will sign and return a form. Fewer than 1% of subjects withdraw from the study, and fewer than 5% contact investigators, usually for neutral reasons. (C) 2016 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine

AB  - Aim The aim of this study was to explore and describe the factors that contribute to burnout among nurses. Background Burnout remains one of the major occupational health problems, posing risks to human health globally. In Namibia, there has been growing public criticism of nurses, stating that they are rude or act in a manner that does not show professionalism towards their clients. Reasons for such unprofessional behaviour could be linked to negative attitudes on the part of nurses towards their clients, resulting from burnout syndrome. Method A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual research design was followed as the basis for conducting the study. Using a purposive sampling technique, a sample of 20 nurses was selected from a population of 69 nurses employed in this setting. This sample size was determined by the saturation of data as reflected in repeating themes. Data were collected using individual semi-structured interviews and were analysed using qualitative thematic analysis. Results The following three themes emerged: understanding the concept of burnout, factors leading to burnout and creating a conducive environment as a corrective measure to address burnout and to advance nurses. Conclusions Burnout is indeed real and affects nurses' performance negatively. Burnout has a negative impact on the well-being of nurses both physically and emotionally, which has the potential to compromise staff performance, productivity and the quality of patient care. Burnout among nurses is linked to many stressors such as poor staff management, inadequate resources, lack of support and lack of wellness programmes in the workplace. Implications for Nursing Management Strengthening communication between frontline health workers and management by engaging and involving them more in decision making in matters that concern them is anticipated to address poor staff management, enhance staff performance and improve the quality of patient care. Staff wellness programmes in the workplace are believed to be a good coping mechanism to address work-related pressure and tensions, and they are believed to resolve some work-related stress that may result in increased staff productivity.

AB  - Objectives
   The Code of Ethics of pharmacy practitioners in Australia recognises the obligation to provide care to patients in a culturally safe and responsive manner. The aim of this exploratory study was to examine how Australian community pharmacists understand and experience the concept of 'culture' in their everyday practice environment.
   Methods
   Voluntary, semi-structured interviews were conducted at community pharmacy placement sites in South-East Queensland, Australia. Pharmacists were asked to recall an incident that evoked their cultural awareness during the course of their practice. The question stated, verbatim: "We are preparing our students to be pharmacists in a highly multicultural community. Can you think of an incident where you learnt something about another person's culture or it made you more aware of your own culture? Please briefly describe the incident." Reportable responses were collected from 59 of the 92 visited pharmacists. These responses were audio-recorded and transcribed. The data were collated and analysed through iterative, reflexive, thematic analysis using constant comparison.
   Results and significance
   The responses provided a rich selection of lived experiences within Australian multicultural pharmacy practice, describing professional dilemmas, fears and the strategies employed to overcome practice challenges. Six main response categories were identified: (i) Language/communication challenges, (ii) Cultural attitudes and behaviours, (iii) Exposure to culture due to pharmacy location, (iv) Religion, gender, and age, (v) Prejudiced/ perceived racist attitudes and discrimination towards 'other' cultures, (vi) Perceived 'sameness' of different cultures. The study has provided valuable insights into community pharmacists' experiences of culture in their day-to-day professional practice, also highlighting the associated strategies used to maintain a high standard of practice. There is merit in ensuring that the pharmacy curriculum and professional development programs are designed to respond to the ethical obligation of pharmacists to practise in a culturally safe, responsive manner that acknowledges and incorporates the importance of culture, cultural differences and intercultural relations, while addressing culturally unique needs in a skilled and professional manner.

TI  - Intellectual interchanges in the history of the massive online open-editing encyclopedia, Wikipedia

KW  - DYNAMICS
AB  - Wikipedia is a free Internet encyclopedia with an enormous amount of content. This encyclopedia is written by volunteers with various backgrounds in a collective fashion; anyone can access and edit most of the articles. This open-editing nature may give us prejudice that Wikipedia is an unstable and unreliable source; yet many studies suggest that Wikipedia is even more accurate and self-consistent than traditional encyclopedias. Scholars have attempted to understand such extraordinary credibility, but usually used the number of edits as the unit of time, without consideration of real time. In this work, we probe the formation of such collective intelligence through a systematic analysis using the entire history of 34 534 110 English Wikipedia articles, between 2001 and 2014. From this massive data set, we observe the universality of both timewise and lengthwise editing scales, which suggests that it is essential to consider the real-time dynamics. By considering real time, we find the existence of distinct growth patterns that are unobserved by utilizing the number of edits as the unit of time. To account for these results, we present a mechanistic model that adopts the article editing dynamics based on both editor-editor and editor-article interactions. The model successfully generates the key properties of real Wikipedia articles such as distinct types of articles for the editing patterns characterized by the interrelationship between the numbers of edits and editors, and the article size. In addition, the model indicates that infrequently referred articles tend to grow faster than frequently referred ones, and articles attracting a high motivation to edit counterintuitively reduce the number of participants. We suggest that this decay of participants eventually brings inequality among the editors, which will become more severe with time.

AB  - Objectives
   This study was to investigate the prevalence of actual uptake of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), willingness to use daily oral PrEP under two cost scenarios, and potential issues related to PrEP use among men who have sex with men (MSM) with HIV negative/unknown sero-status in Hong Kong, China. Factors associated with the two measures of willingness were also investigated.
   Methods
   403 eligible MSM completed the anonymous venue-based face-to-face interview/telephone interview.
   Results
   Only 1% had ever used PrEP. After being briefed about some facts of PrEP, the prevalence of willingness to use daily oral PrEP was 7.7% if they could purchase PrEP at private hospitals/clinics at HK$8,000 (US$1,032)/month (market rate) and 45.2% if free PrEP was provided by public hospitals/clinics in Hong Kong (free PrEP). After adjusted for significant background variables, significant factors of these two measures of willingness included: (1) number of correct responses to knowledge on PrEP, (2) perceived risk of HIV infection in the next six months, and (3) constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior: positive and negative attitudes toward PrEP, perceived their significant others would support them take PrEP (perceived subjective norm), perceived number of local MSM who were willing to take PrEP (perceived descriptive norm), and confidence in using PrEP under the two scenarios (perceived behavioral control). Among all participants, 9.7% and 25.1% would start and discontinue using PrEP without consulting doctors; 26.0% would not take PrEP daily if it was provided for free, and 42.4% would not take up HIV testing every 3 months after using PrEP.
   Conclusion
   Different strategies should be considered for promoting PrEP at market rate and if free PrEP is made available. Future promotion should increase their knowledge about PrEP, modify their perceptions related to HIV and PrEP, and address some potential issues related to PrEP use.

AB  - African Americans are overrepresented among heterosexual cases of HIV/AIDS in the USA. Inconsistent condom use and concurrent partnering are two sexual behaviors driving the heterosexual HIV epidemic in the African American community. To inform the development of an HIV prevention behavioral intervention to decrease concurrent partnering and increase condom use among African American heterosexual men, we conducted formative research, including 61 structured interviews, 5 focus groups with 25 men, and 30 in-depth qualitative interviews between July and December 2009. We used a grounded theoretical approach and categorizing strategies to code and analyze the qualitative data. Results around condom use confirmed earlier findings among heterosexual men in general: condoms diminish pleasure, interfere with erection, and symbolize infidelity. Although valued by some as a form of disease prevention and pregnancy prevention, condoms are often used only with specific types of female partners, such as new or casual partners, or due to visual risk assessment. Sex partner concurrency was described as normative and ascribed to men's "natural" desire to engage in a variety of sexual activities or their high sex drive, with little recognition of the role it plays in the heterosexual HIV epidemic. Fatherhood emerged among many men as a crucial life event and compelling motivation for reducing sexual risk behavior. Based on these results, we conclude that existing HIV prevention efforts to improve attitudes towards and motivate use of condoms either have not reached or have not been successful with African American heterosexual men. In designing behavioral interventions to decrease concurrent partnering and increase condom use, addressing negative attitudes towards condoms and partner risk assessment is critical, as is integrating novel motivational approaches related to identity as fathers and men in the African American community.

AB  - Background: Health professionals need interpersonal communication competence (ICC) in their work with patients and other professionals. Interprofessional simulation provides health care students with an opportunity to practice communication skills in a safe and authentic environment.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe the perceptions of health care students of interprofessional simulations in acquiring affective interpersonal communication competence (AICC).
   Design: This study was conducted using the quantitative descriptive research method.
   Settings: The data were collected from health care students participating in interprofessional simulations at a university of applied sciences in Finland using a questionnaire titled Student questionnaire on a multiprofessional simulation exercise. The health care students included nursing, physical therapy and practical nursing students.
   Participants: This study was participated by 149 health care students with a response rate of 41.2%.
   Methods: The quantitative data were analysed using the SPSS 24.0 for Windows statistical software. Frequencies, percentages, averages, and standard deviation were used to describe the data. Two mean sum variables were formed using factor analysis from the variables describing AICC.
   Results: The students' perceptions of learning AICC (attitude, motivation, emotions) in interprofessional simulations were largely positive; for example, the simulations reduced prejudice against, and increased appreciation of, other occupational groups. Even though the interprofessional simulations were sometimes perceived as stressful, stress could also be a positive source of learning and effectively fostered personal understanding of others in a team.
   Conclusion: Interprofessional simulations increased knowledge of the activities of other professional groups for students in different fields of education. This encourages them to work together after completing their education and entering the workforce. Knowledge of the simulation process and the creating a safe learning environment also promoted students' AICC.

AB  - The study focused on the relations between Italian nationals' personal values and their expectations towards the way ethnic minorities should acculturate. The main aim was to understand whether nationals' personal values predict their acculturation preferences towards immigrants, both directly and through national identity. Four hundred and forty-six Italian high school students (M-age = 19.1; SD = 0.57; females = 54.4%) completed a self-administered questionnaire assessing personal values, nationalism, patriotism, acculturation preferences and demographics. An SEM model with bootstrapping estimations was tested. As expected, the results highlighted that personal values predict acculturation preferences towards immigrants in two ways - directly and also through an indirect effect on nationalism - supporting the claim that ingroup and outgroup definitions are closely intertwined. The results also highlighted the need to differentiate between nationalism and patriotism, with the latter having no influence on Italian nationals' readiness to accept immigrants. Overall, the research demonstrates the relevance of personal values in studying intergroup relations and draws attention to the potential value of communication policies centred on self-transcendence values to improve interethnic relations.

AB  - A large number of educational systems face the challenges of dealing with students from different ethnic minorities and providing equal opportunities for them. In Germany, Turkish students belong to the largest ethnic minority group and display the lowest levels of academic achievement in comparison with most other ethnic minority or German students. Teachers' attitudes toward Turkish students might contribute to the disadvantages of this social group. The aim of this study was to assess preservice teachers' implicit and explicit attitudes toward Turkish students. Previous research has focused primarily on the attitudes of ethnic majority teachers. Drawing on potential benefits of a cultural match between teachers and students, we considered ethnic majority preservice teachers, preservice teachers with a Turkish background, and those with other ethnic minority backgrounds. Results showed no differences in explicit attitudes but significant differences in implicit attitudes depending on teachers' ethnic background. Preservice teachers with Turkish backgrounds showed positive implicit attitudes toward Turkish students, preservice teachers from other ethnic minority backgrounds had more neutral attitudes, whereas German preservice teachers had negative implicit attitudes toward Turkish students. Findings are discussed in terms of the cultural match between students and teachers and the benefits of a culturally diverse teaching workforce.

AB  - Objectives Disaster medicine research generally lacks control groups. This study aims to describe categories of diagnoses encountered by the Belgian First Aid and Support Team after the 2010 Haiti earthquake and extract earthquake-related changes from comparison with comparable baseline data. The hypothesis is that besides earthquake-related trauma, medical problems emerge soon, questioning an appropriate composition of Foreign Medical Teams and Interagency Emergency Health Kits.
   Methods Using a descriptive cohort study design, diagnoses of patients presenting to the Belgian field hospital were prospectively registered during 4 weeks after the earthquake and compared with those recorded similarly by Medecins Sans Frontieres in the same area and time span in previous and later years.
   Results Of 7000 triaged postearthquake patients, 3500 were admitted, of whom 2795 were included and analysed. In the fortnight after the earthquake, 90% suffered from injury. In the following fortnight, medical diseases emerged, particularly respiratory (23%) and digestive (14%). More than 53% developed infections within 3 weeks after the event. Medecins Sans Frontieres registered 6407 patients in 2009; 6033 in 2011; and 7300 in 2012. A comparison indicates that postearthquake patients suffered significantly less from violence, but more from wounds, respiratory, digestive and ophthalmological diseases.
   Conclusion This is the first comparison of postearthquake diagnoses with baseline data. Within 2 weeks after the acute phase of an earthquake, respiratory, digestive and ophthalmological problems will emerge to the prejudice of trauma. This fact should be anticipated when composing Foreign Medical Teams and Interagency Emergency Health Kits to be sent to the disaster site. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Front line providers of care are frequently lacking in knowledge on and sensitivity to social and structural determinants of underprivileged patients' health. Developing and evaluating approaches to raising health professional awareness and capacity to respond to social determinants is a crucial step in addressing this issue. McGill University, in partnership with Universite de Montreal, Quebec dental regulatory authorities, and the Quebec anti-poverty coalition, co-developed a continuing education (CE) intervention that aims to transfer knowledge and improve the practices of oral health professionals with people living on welfare. Through the use of original educational tools integrating patient narratives and a short film, the onsite course aims to elicit affective learning and critical reflection on practices, as well as provide staff coaching.
   Methods: A qualitative case study was conducted, in Montreal Canada, among members of a dental team who participated in this innovative CE course over a period of four months. Data collection consisted in a series of semi-structured individual interviews conducted with 15 members of the dental team throughout the training, digitally recorded group discussions linked to the CE activities, clinic administrative documents and researcher-trainer field notes and journal. In line with adult transformative learning theory, interpretive analysis aimed to reveal learning processes, perceived outcomes and collective perspectives that constrain individual and organizational change.
   Results: The findings presented in this article consist in four interactive themes, reflective of clinic culture and context, that act as barriers to humanizing patient care: 1) belief in the "ineluctable" commoditization of dentistry; 2) "equal treatment", a belief constraining concern for equity and the recognition of discriminatory practices; 3) a predominantly biomedical orientation to care; and 4) stereotypical categorization of publically insured patients into "deserving" vs. "non-deserving" poor. We discuss implications for oral health policy, orientations for dental education, as well as the role dental regulatory authorities should play in addressing discrimination and prejudice.
   Conclusion: Humanizing care and developing oral health practitioners' capacity to respond to social determinants of health, are challenged by significant ideological roadblocks. These require multi-level and multi-sectorial action if gains in social equity in oral health are to be made.

TI  - DENYING DEFENDANTS THE BENEFIT OF A REASONABLE DOUBT: FEDERAL RULE OF EVIDENCE 609 AND PAST SEX CRIME CONVICTIONS
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL LAW & CRIMINOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The vast majority of jurisdictions in the United States allow the credibility of testifying defendants to be impeached with evidence of prior felony convictions. This past crime evidence is admitted solely to show that the defendant may lack credibility. It is not admitted to show that the defendant has a tendency to commit crimes in general or that he or she is a bad, dangerous person. Juries are given a limiting instruction that is supposed to prevent improper use of the evidence, but courts and legislatures acknowledge that despite limiting instructions, past crime evidence can illegitimately prejudice a jury against a defendant. For this reason, judges are required to compare the prejudicial effect of past crimes evidence to its probative value before it is admitted. If the evidence is even slightly more prejudicial than probative of credibility, it is to be excluded.
   Sex offense convictions are extraordinarily prejudicial overwhelming evidence shows that sex offenders are the most feared and despised group in this country and these convictions are not particularly probative of credibility. Yet judges rarely acknowledge this when comparing the probative value of past sex crime convictions to their prejudicial effect on jurors. This failure undermines evidentiary principles that are fundamental to our system of criminal justice. A defendant who previously was convicted of a sex offense is left with three bad choices: he or she can accept a plea bargain regardless of actual guilt; go to trial but decline to testify or testify but lose the jury's goodwill when the sex crime conviction is presented. An acquittal based on valid reasonable doubt becomes much less likely.
   For jurors in a criminal trial to fulfill their duty of determining whether a person is guilty of a particular act beyond a reasonable doubt, they must not be diverted from that task by intense dislike for a defendant who has previously been convicted of a sex crime. Legislatures and courts should adopt a rule that prior sex crime convictions are presumptively inadmissible to impeach credibility.

AB  - Aim: To determine the relationship between the food groups consumed by students and the dietary habits and life satisfaction. Methods: The cross-sectional study was carried out with 811 students studying in Balikesir University, Faculty of Health Sciences in January 2018 in Turkey. In this study, Personal Information Form, Survey of Eating Habits and Satisfaction with lifeScale that included the socio-demographic characteristics and the frequency of food consumption of the students were used. Kolmogorov Simirnov test, mean, standard deviation, number, percentage, Mann Whitney U test, Kruskal Wallis test, Spearman correlation and multiple linear regression analysis were used in the evaluation of the data. Results: Satisfaction with lifescores of students who often consume grains, fruits, meat and its derivatives were found to be high. It was determined that as self-perception against being overweight and eating habits scores increase, lifesatisfaction decreases in students. Prejudice score against being overweight was found to be high in students studying nursing care, whose BMI is normal and who rarely consume vegetable. The positive and negative thought scores caused by being overweight were found to be high in overweight/obese students who often consume dairy product and legume. The self-perception score against being overweight was found to be high in students who are obese and often consume dairy products. Eating habits score was found to be high in weak students who rarely consume dairy products and fruit (P<0.05). Conclusions: It was found that while the consumption of foods with high quality and high calorie value by students increases satisfaction with life, perceiving himself/herself to be overweight reduces satisfaction with life. It was found that BMI affects thoughts on being overweight. It was determined that the students who receive dietary education, who perceive themselves to be overweight and who have excessive positive-negative thoughts about being overweight have high awareness of being overweight and prefer healthy diet practices. Based on these results, an increase in satisfaction with life can be achieved by providing proper dietary habits and receiving dietary education.

AB  - Objective: Menopausal experience and symptom reporting of the women was reported to be affected by their attitudes to menopause which in turn is influenced by a range of variables. In this study, we primarily tried to investigate the attitudes of women and their spouses towards menopause. The other aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between menopausal attitudes and menopausal symptom experience, depression and anxiety scores of the participants. Method: The sample included 60 physiological menopausal women and their spouses. Socio-demographic data were obtained with a questionnaire. The menopausal symptoms were measured through the Menopausal Rating Scale (MRS). The women and their spouses were administered the Attitudes Towards Menopause Scale (ATMS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Results: Both the menopausal women and their spouses had a positive attitude towards menopause. The women had a mean total score of 16.36 +/- 7.62 on MRS (moderate). The mean somatic, psychological and urogenital sub-scores of MRS were 6.43 +/- 3.23 (moderate), 5.97 +/- 3.33 (moderate), and 3.93 +/- 2.77 (moderate), respectively. There were no significant differences in Bat scores between the women and their spouses. However, the scores of BAI were more likely to be higher in women than their spouses (p < 0.0001). The current study revealed a significant positive correlation between MRS scores and BAI and BDI scores of the women. A significant negative correlation was found with the scores of ATMS, and scores of MRS in women. The scores of ATMS in men were significantly and negatively correlated with the total, somatic, and urogenital subscale scores of MRS in women. Conclusion: The main finding of this study was that both the menopausal women and their spouses had a positive attitude towards menopause. We also found that, the women who had more negative attitudes towards menopause reported more severe menopausal symptoms. Our results also demonstrated that the severity of menopausal complaints might be related to the attitudes of the husbands towards menopause.

TI  - The Complexities and Nuances of Analyzing the Genome of Drosophila ananassae and Its Wolbachia Endosymbiont
T2  - G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS
LA  - English
AB  - In "Retrotransposons Are the Major Contributors to the Expansion of the Drosophila ananassae Muller F Element," Leung et al. (2017) improved contigs attributed to the Muller F element from the original CAF1 assembly, and used them to conclude that most of the sequence expansion of the fourth chromosome of D. ananassae is due to a higher transposon load than previously thought, but is not due to Wolbachia DNA integrations. While we do not disagree with the first conclusion, the authors base their second conclusion on the lack of homology detected between their improved CAF1 genome assembly attributed to D. ananassae and reference Wolbachia genomes. While the consensus CAF1 genome assembly lacks any sequence similarity to the reference genome of the Wolbachia endosymbiont of Drosophila melanogaster (wMel), numerous studies from multiple laboratories provide experimental support for a large lateral/horizontal gene transfer (LGT) of a Wolbachia genome into this D. ananassae line. As such, we strongly suspect that the original whole genome assembly was either constructed after the removal of all Wolbachia reads, or that Wolbachia sequences were directly removed from the contigs in the CAF1 assembly. Hence, Leung et al. (2017) could not have identified the Wolbachia LGT using the CAF1 assembly. This manuscript by Leung et al. (2017) highlights that an assembly of the Wolbachia sequence reads and their mate pairs was erroneously attributed solely to the Wolbachia endosymbiont, albeit before we understood the extent of LGT in D. ananassae. As such, we recommend that the sequences deposited at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under PRJNA13365 should not be attributed to Wolbachia endosymbiont of D. ananassae, but should have their taxonomy reclassified by NCBI as "Unclassified sequences." As our knowledge about genome biology improves, we need to reconsider and reanalyze earlier genomes removing the prejudice introduced from now defunct paradigms.

TI  - Are maternal healthcare services accessible to vulnerable group? A study among women with disabilities in rural Nepal
T2  - PLOS ONE

KW  - EXPERIENCES
AB  - Background
   Studies report that vulnerable groups like people with disabilities have less access to healthcare. This study compares health service access between women with and without disabilities in general and explores the challenges encountered by women with disabilities in accessing maternal healthcare services during pregnancy.
   Methods
   A mixed method study was conducted in Rupandehi district of Nepal implementing a cross-sectional survey among 354 women including 79 women with disabilities, supplemented by 43 in-depth interviews. Descriptive and bivariate statistical analysis of quantitative data using Pearson's Chi-square test for association was carried out, while qualitative data were analysed following the theme content analysis using a framework approach.
   Results
   The vast majority of women from both groups, women with and without disabilities (71% vs 74%) reported that the nearest health facility from their location was more than 30 minutes walking distance (P>0.05). Half of the women with disabilities walked to health facilities for ANC check-ups. Over one-third of women without disabilities and a slightly lesser proportion of women with disabilities (29%) used a low-cost means of transport (rikshaw, bi/tri-cycles) (P>0.05). Distribution of health facilities found uneven and poorly linked with road transport facilities. None of the health facilities accommodated the needs of women with disabilities with accessible buildings and convenient opening time. The travel cost and the extra cost of services, staff shortage, often delayed and inadequate drug supplies were common problems for both women with and without disabilities. Unavailability of beds during delivery, insensitive providers with negative attitudes and abusive behaviour, inadequate knowledge and in providing services to the people with disabilities as well as unwelcoming health facility environment made services particularly inaccessible to women with disabilities.
   Conclusion
   Maternal healthcare services are not easily and equitably accessible to women with disabilities. To increase access to healthcare for this vulnerable group, improvements are needed in distribution and management of resources from transportation through service delivery, as well as improved provider knowledge and awareness of a human rights approach to disability and health.

TI  - Protection of shareholders class rights in company law
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND MANAGEMENT
LA  - English
KW  - Company law
KW  - Shareholder rights
KW  - Companies act
AB  - Purpose
   A company that is registered with share capital may issue different classes of shares and may confer rights on members, which place them in different classes in the company's organisational structure. This paper is concerned with the propensity for encroachment on such vested class rights as companies strive to wriggle out of business challenges spawn by the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study is to ascertain the extent of protection that the law accords to the different classes of shareholders and members in a company especially when the company seeks to vary the vested class rights.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A doctrinal methodology, which relies on existing literature, case law and statutory instruments, is adopted to explore the nature of class rights and the adequacies of the remedial measures availed by statute to the aggrieved bearers of class rights in the context of the South African Companies Act 71 of 2008 with inferences drawn from the UK companies statute and case law.
   Findings
   The findings indicate that accessing the remedies available to aggrieved shareholders under the relevant statutory provisions are fraught with conditionality, which could make them elusive to those who may seek to rely on such provisions to vindicate any encroachment on their class rights.
   Practical implications
   The paper embodies cogent information on the interpretation and application of the relevant statutory provisions geared at the protection of shareholders class rights, which should serve as guides to companies and the courts in dealing with matters that affect the vested class rights of shareholders and members of a company.
   Originality/value
   The paper shows that protections offered to classes of shareholders under the law can also be extended to classes of members who are not necessarily shareholders, and that shareholders who seek to vindicate their class rights may conveniently rely on Section 163 that provides for unfair prejudice remedy to avoid the onerous conditions under Section 164 of the South African Companies Act 71 of 2008, which directly deals with class rights.

TI  - Diversity Jurisdiction and Juridical Persons: Determining the Citizenship of Foreign-Country Business Entities
T2  - TEXAS LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - Protecting foreign-country litigants from prejudice in state courts provided an original impetus for the creation of diversity jurisdiction. However, the protections of alienage jurisdiction are in peril with respect to large foreign companies. Under current law, it is not clear how to determine the citizenship of a foreign-country business entity. For large companies with thousands of members or shareholders from all over the world, this lack of clarity is particularly concerning because being forced to allege the citizenship of every member is not only extremely burdensome, if not impossible, but also severely restricts large foreign companies' access to federal court. The question ultimately turns on how to classify the foreign-country business entity. Under American law, a corporation has its own citizenship, and unincorporated associations have the citizenship of all of their members. But in the case of a foreign-country business entity, it is not always clear whether the entity should be classified as a corporation or an unincorporated association. The circuit courts are divided on how to address this issue. The Fifth and Ninth Circuits have resolved the issue by developing what I refer to as the "juridical person approach." Under this framework, a court will treat an entity like a corporation for citizenship purposes if it determines that the country of the entity's formation views the entity as a juridical person. By contrast, the Seventh Circuit has adopted what I refer to as the "comparison approach" to determine the citizenship of foreign-country business entities. This involves looking to the attributes of a foreign-country business entity and comparing it to American business entities, according the foreign-country entity the same citizenship that its American analogue would have. This Note analyzes these two approaches in terms of their adherence to Supreme Court precedent and their practical application. It recommends that courts uniformly apply a modified version of the juridical person approach to determine the citizenship of foreign-country business entities.

AB  - Purpose: Stigma and discrimination against transgender people can lead to their segregation. Fighting stigma and discrimination is a crucial strategy to expand access to health services. The goals of the present study were to develop and validate a transgender health care humanization scale (THcH scale) to evaluate the perception of humanization in health care for transgender individuals.Methods: This cross-sectional study included 340 health care providers aged >= 18 years. Participants answered a structured questionnaire when attending HIV/AIDS scientific meetings or at their place of work. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted, using a polychoric matrix and robust diagonally weighted least squares extraction method. The number of retained factors was defined through the parallel analysis technique, with random permutation of the observed data and the use of Robust Promin rotation.Results: The interpretability of correlation matrix items was suggested by the Bartlett's sphericity tests (1633.7, df=91; p<0.001) and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Test (0.875). The factor structure showed adequate adjustment indices (chi(2)=44,200, df=52; root mean square error of approximation p<0.05; comparative fit index=0.968; Tucker-Lewis index=0.945; goodness-of-fit index = 0.995). Only one factor was retained by parallel analysis, explained by 54.17% of the variance of the construct and confirmed by the following indices: unidimensional congruence=0.902, explained common variance=0.828, and mean of item residual absolute loadings=0.279. Good reliability was confirmed by Cronbach's alpha test (0.899).Conclusion: The THcH scale showed good psychometric properties. This self-report questionnaire, which can be completed in 5 min, may be useful in scientific research and could guide health care providers in expansion of a Health Humanization Policy and in deconstructing prejudice against transgender people in health care settings.

AB  - Background: Stigma towards people with mental health problems (PMHP) is known to have substantial negative impacts on their lives. More in-depth exploration of the stigma and discrimination experienced by PMHP in low-and middle-income countries is needed. Previous research suggests that negative attitudes towards PMHP are widespread among the Filipino general public. However, no study has investigated PMHP's own experiences of being stigmatised in the Philippines.
   Methods: A qualitative study was conducted on the stigma experienced by PMHP (including people with epilepsy) and its related factors in the Philippines, employing the constructivist grounded theory approach. We analysed data on 39 PMHP collected through interviews with PMHP, their carers, and community health volunteers who know them well.
   Results: The findings highlight the culturally and socio-economically specific contexts, consequences, and impact modifiers of experiences of stigma. Participants emphasised that PMHP face stigma because of the cultural traits such as the perception of mental health problem as a disease of the family and the tendency to be overly optimistic about the severity of the mental health problem and its impact on their life. Further, stigma was experienced under conditions where mental health care was not readily available and people in the local community could not resolve the PMHP's mental health crisis. Stigma experiences reduced social networks and opportunities for PMHP, threatened the economic survival of their entire family, and exacerbated their mental health problems. An individual's reaction to negative experiences can be fatalistic in nature (e.g. believing in it is God's will). This fatalism can help PMHP to remain hopeful. In addition, traditional communal unity alleviated some of the social exclusion associated with stigma.
   Conclusions: The study indicates that existing stigma-reduction strategies might have limitations in their effectiveness across cultural settings. Therefore, we propose context-specific practical implications (e.g. emphasis on environmental factors as a cause of mental health problems, messages to increase understanding not only of the possibility of recovery but also of challenges PMHP face) for the Philippines.

AB  - There are two axioms that have shaped the degrowth discussion, namely one on the reduction of production and consumption and one on the necessity of value and attitude change in society to respect environmental limits. Surprisingly little research has focused on the role of technology in connection to value change, consumption behavior and degrowth. This gap is linked to a widely held assumption of technological innovation acting contrary to degrowth.
   In contrast, this paper suggests that technological innovation needs to be connected to degrowth. In particular, the fast evolution of information and communication technologies in recent years points to their importance for the global civil society. Given the scope of sustainability challenges connected to these technologies and smartphones in particular, this paper argues that a degrowth movement going hand in hand with technological development is only made possible, if sustainable alternatives for highly demanded products are offered.
   Specifically, this study draws on lifestyle movements as the nexus between consumption, degrowth and technology. Three core concepts are found to influence the attendance to degrowth-related consumer movements: a sustainable lifestyle, alternative forms of consumption and social commitment, all of which are assumed to have a positive effect. Empirically this paper draws on the case of the Fairphone, a company that applies sustainable characteristics to a smartphone. Data collected in a survey via online fora of the Fairphone from November 4-29, 2015 are analyzed using a structural equation modeling with partial least squares. Results indicate that a sustainable lifestyle represents the dominant factor explaining the involvement with the Fairphone. Surprisingly, the findings show that alternative consumption seems to negatively influence the involvement with the Fairphone and social commitment seems to play a minor role in the model. These aspects point to the Fairphone as a technical artifact, centered on a choice for a sustainable lifestyle. Future research needs to reach clarification on the relationship of alternative consumption and degrowth related movements and whether the negative effect is case specific or beyond. Furthermore, future studies need to delve deeper into lifestyle decisions as a leverage point towards degrowth, especially on lifestyles understood as a from of activism to change contemporary society.

AB  - The majority of dairy calves around the world are dehorned with methods that cause them pain and distress. In some dairy production systems, extensionists may influence dehorning practices used on farm through their advisory and knowledge-transfer role. The aims of this study were to investigate Brazilian extensionists' knowledge, beliefs, and behavior regarding dehorning dairy calves. As little research has addressed this question, a qualitative, theory-building approach was used and the theory of planned behavior was used as a conceptual framework to guide data collection and analysis. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 15 extensionists working in Santa Catarina, Brazil, to examine their role in the adoption and rejection of pain-mitigation strategies at dehorning. The interview transcripts were free coded, identifying 9 major themes within and across interviews. Transcribed interview responses were then coded to constructs in the theory of planned behavior. The themes and constructs that emerged through analysis of the interview responses were combined to develop a conceptual model of extensionists' beliefs, attitudes, and behavior toward recommending protocols for dehorning aimed at minimizing pain. The extensionists interviewed believed that it was necessary to dehorn all dairy replacement heifers. Despite being aware of methods to minimize pain during and after dehorning, all of the interviewees recommended or used the hot cautery method, with no pain control. This method was described as the most effective, cheapest, safest, and fastest method of dehorning The majority (12) of interviewees rejected the caustic paste method, citing negative past experiences or unfamiliarity with the method and the belief that the method is less practical and riskier for farmers. More than half of the interviewees did not recognize dehorning as painful or expressed the belief that the pain associated with the procedure did not justify the use of pain control. Although a small number of extensionists (4) recognized potential sources of social pressure to change, including the rejection of pain-inflicting practices by some farmers, the Brazilian general public, and animal-protection societies, they did not identify these factors as a reason to change their existing practices. Interviewees expressed the belief that the adoption of practices to minimize pain and stress, such as dehorning very young calves, using caustic paste and pain control, would increase labor and costs associated with dehorning. Extensionists' negative attitudes toward recommending practices that minimize pain during and after dehorning appear to be embedded in the production-focused political and economic agriculture environment and a lack of education, research, and legislation regarding farm animal welfare.

AB  - This article examines the development of international migration in the context of broader changes in global economic and political formations since the late 1940s. It also reflects on changing official policies and public attitudes to migration, as well as on the emergence of migration studies as a special interdisciplinary area of the social sciences. Four phases are discussed: 1. The period of concentration of investment in the old industrial areas of Western Europe up to the mid- 1960s , which led to attraction of mainly lower-skilled labour as guestworkers' or post-colonial migrants. Prejudice against newcomers was interpreted mainly in social-psychological terms as a natural reaction' against newcomers. 2. The beginnings of a new wave of globalisation in the 1970s and 1980s. Manufacturing employment in old core industrial areas fell, while new industrial economies (based largely on low pay and anti-union policies) burgeoned. Western European governments tried to send home the guestworkers'. The failure of such policies led to the emergence of multicultural societies. At the same time, the growing economies of the Gulf oil states and some Asian tigers' pulled in millions of workers, bound by very strict and often discriminatory contracts. 3. From the late 1980s to the recession of 2008 the globalisation of investment and production reached new heights. Cheaper transport and the growth of new media supported the growth of international migration at all skill levels. Developed countries cut back on education costs by importing human capital from countries like India and China, while denying the need for low-skilled workers. Yet the lack of nationals willing to take such jobs fuels the growth of temporary contract migration and irregular movement. Increasingly, migrants have come to be seen as a threat to jobs for low-skilled nationals and as a danger to national security. 4. The article argues that a new phase in global change is emerging following the 2008 crisis, and examines possible trends and their meaning for human mobility in the 21st century.

AB  - Introduction: In 2012, the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) reaffirmed that domestic violence is a serious public health hazard that emergency medical services (EMS) personnel will encounter. Many victims of domestic violence may refuse transport to the hospital, making EMS pre-hospital field personnel -EMTs and paramedics- their only contact with healthcare providers. Despite these facts, the interaction of field EMS personnel and victims of domestic violence remains largely unexamined.
   Objectives: Given the importance of the interaction of field EMS personnel have with victims of domestic violence, the goal of this study is to explore attitudes about and experiences of EMS personnel on the issue of domestic violence after completing a training on domestic violence.
   Methods: Participants were recruited by researchers contacting multiple EMS agencies. Data were gathered using a survey attached to an online domestic violence training for field EMS personnel (EMTs and paramedics) circulated in a large southern state. Participants were able to obtain continuing education credits for completing the online modules.
   Results: A total of 403 respondents completed the survey. 71% of respondents indicated that they frequently encounter patients who disclose domestic violence; 45% believe that if a victim does not disclose abuse, there is little they can do to help; and from 32% to 43% reported assumptions and attitudes that indicate beliefs that victims are responsible for the abuse.
   Conclusions: Implications of the data are discussed suggesting that EMS providers are aware that they frequently assist victims of domestic violence, yet many continue to endorse common myths and negative attitudes about victims. Core components of training that can educate EMS personnel about the dynamics of domestic violence are described, and a new free online training for medical professionals on domestic violence is offered for use as part of ongoing education to enhance the EMS response to victims.

AB  - Context Clinicians often have negative attitudes toward obesity and express dissatisfaction in caring for obese patients. Moreover, obese patients often feel that clinicians are biased or disrespectful because of their weight. These observations raise the concern that obese patients may receive lower quality of care.
   Objective To determine whether performance on common outpatient quality measures differs by patient weight status.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Eight different performance measures were examined in 2 national-level patient populations: (1) Medicare beneficiaries (n=36 122) using data from the Medicare Beneficiary Survey (1994-2006); and (2) recipients of care from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) (n=33 550) using data from an ongoing performance-evaluation program (2003-2004).
   Main Outcome Measures Performance measures among eligible patients for diabetes care (eye examination, glycated hemoglobin [HbA(1c)] testing, and lipid screening), pneumococcal vaccination, influenza vaccination, screening mammography, colorectal cancer screening, and cervical cancer screening. Measures were based on a combination of administrative claims, survey, and chart review data.
   Results We found no evidence that obese or overweight patients were less likely to receive recommended care relative to normal-weight patients. Moreover, success rates were marginally higher for obese and/or overweight patients on several measures. The most notable differentials were observed for recommended diabetes care among Medicare beneficiaries: comparing obese vs normal-weight patients with diabetes, obese patients were more likely to receive recommended care on lipid screening (72% vs 65%; odds ratio, 1.37 [95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.73]) and HbA(1c) testing (74% vs 62%; odds ratio, 1.73 [95% confidence interval, 1.41-2.11]). All analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic factors, health status, clinical complexity, and visit frequency.
   Conclusions Among samples of patients from the Medicare and VHA populations, there was no evidence across 8 performance measures that obese or overweight patients received inferior care when compared with normal-weight patients. Being obese or overweight was associated with a marginally higher rate of recommended care on several measures. JAMA. 2010;303(13):1274-1281

AB  - To compare long-term and short-term outcomes in patients <70 years old with those >= 70 years old, who underwent transthoracic esophagectomy for carcinoma. With an ageing population more patients, with increasing co-morbidities are being diagnosed with potentially curable esophageal cancer. Concerns exist regarding offering older patients esophagectomy, conversely undue prejudice may exists that may prevent surgery being offered. Consecutive patients from a single unit between January 2000 and July 2016 that underwent trans-thoracic esophagectomy with or without neoadjuvant treatment for carcinoma were included. Short-term outcomes including morbidity, mortality, length of stay and long-term survival were compared between those <70 and those >= 70. This study identified 992 patients who underwent esophagectomy during the study period, of which 302 (30%) >= 70 years old. Greater proportion >= 70 years old had SCC (squamous cell carcinoma) (23%) than <70 (18%) (p = 0.07). Patients >= 70 years old were noted to have higher ASA Grade 3 (34% vs 25%, p = 0.004) and were less likely to receive neoadjuvant treatment (64% vs 45%p<0.001). Length of stay was longer in >= 70 (14 vs 17 days p<0.001), and there were more complications (63% vs 75% p < 0.001). In hospital mortality was higher in >= 70 (2% vs 5% p = 0.026). Overall survival was 50 months in <70 vs 36 months in >= 70 (p = <0.001). In <70s with adenocarcinoma, overall survival was 52 months vs 35 months in the >= 70 (p < 0.001). No significant difference in survival in patients with SCC, 49 months in <70 vs 54 months in >= 70 (p = 0.711). Increased peri-operative morbidity and mortality combined with the reduction in the long term survival in the over 70s cohort should be addressed when counselling patients undergoing curative resection for oesophageal cancer.

AB  - Background: General practitioners (GPs) play a key role in the care of somatic and psychiatric problems in people diagnosed with schizophrenia (PWS). It is probable that, like other health professionals, GPs are not all free of prejudices toward PWS. In clinical practice, GPs sometimes interact with clients diagnosed with schizophrenia by specialists, passively accepting this diagnosis. Other times, GPs interact with clients having symptoms of schizophrenia but who have not been diagnosed. In this case, GPs are expected to actively make a diagnosis. Giving the key role of GPs in the process of care, it is worthwhile examining whether passive acceptance and active usage of the diagnosis schizophrenia have differential effects on GPs' attitudes toward people with this disorder.
   Aims: To investigate GPs' views of schizophrenia and whether they were influenced by a schizophrenia' label, passively accepted or actively used.
   Methods: A total of 430 randomly selected GPs were invited to complete a questionnaire about their views of schizophrenia, either after reading a description of this disorder and making a diagnosis, or without being provided with a description but passively accepting the label schizophrenia' given in the questionnaire.
   Results: The GPs who passively accepted the label schizophrenia (n=195) and those who actively identified schizophrenia from the description (n=127) had similar views. Compared to the GPs who did not identify schizophrenia in the description (n=65), those who used the diagnosis, actively or passively: more frequently reported heredity and less frequently psychosocial factors as causes of the disorder; were more skeptical about recovery; were more convinced of the need for long-term pharmacotherapies; believed more strongly that PWS should be discriminated against when in medical hospital; and perceived PWS as more dangerous and as kept at greater social distance.
   Conclusion: The diagnosis schizophrenia', however used, is associated with pessimistic views. Stigma education should be provided to GPs.

AB  - The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes and prevention practices (KAP) among the garment factory worker population in Bangladesh regarding a historical dengue outbreak in 2019. A total of 400 participants were selected by simple random sampling, and questionnaire-based interviews were conducted. The average score of knowledge, attitude and prevention practice was 8.33 +/- 2.35, 6.32 +/- 1.20 and 6.31 +/- 1.50, respectively. Only 76 out of 400 participants (19%) scored above 10 (all university-educated). Participant workers reported both negative and positive attitudes regarding dengue fever (DF). Negative attitudes included an expectation of increased mortality and strained family finances from DF attacks. A significantly high number of participants (92%) believed that death from DF was inevitable. Positive attitudes included optimism about DF eradication potentials and eagerness to help and donate blood to sick relatives. Participants primarily learned about the DF prevention from mass media (244/400; 61.0%) and social media (97/400; 24.25%). The most popular prevention measures adopted were mosquito repellent incense (344/400; 86.0%) and mosquito nets (389/400; 97.25%). While most participants (358/400; 89.5%) cleaned areas where mosquitos lay eggs, only 169 out of 400 (42.25%) regularly treated with chemical sprays. Only 182 out of 400 (45.5%) reported receiving DF prevention training in the factory. Correlation between DF knowledge and education was statistically significant (r = .38, p < .01, n = 398). Correlation between DF knowledge and work experience was insignificant (r = .01, p > .01, n = 398). Age and DF knowledge were not correlated (r = 0.07, p > .01, n = 398). In conclusion, gaps in KAP for dengue could be addressed by government-sponsored educational programmes that utilize the power of mass/social media for dengue prevention and control. More KAP surveillance studies are needed for other sectors of the society.

AB  - Background: The HIV epidemic in Russia is concentrated among injection drug users (IDUs). This is especially true for St. Petersburg where high HIV incidence persists among the city's estimated 80,000 IDUs. Although sterile syringes are legally available, access for IDUs may be hampered. To explore the feasibility of using pharmacies to expand syringe access and provide other prevention services to IDUs, we investigated the current access to sterile syringes at the pharmacies and the correlation between pharmacy density and HIV prevalence in St. Petersburg.
   Methods: 965 pharmacies citywide were mapped, classified by ownership type, and the association between pharmacy density and HIV prevalence at the district level was tested. We selected two districts among the 18 districts - one central and one peripheral - that represented two major types of city districts and contacted all operating pharmacies by phone to inquire if they stocked syringes and obtained details about their stock. Qualitative interviews with 26 IDUs provided data regarding syringe access in pharmacies and were used to formulate hypotheses for the pharmacy syringe purchase test wherein research staff attempted to purchase syringes in all pharmacies in the two districts.
   Results: No correlation was found between the density of pharmacies and HIV prevalence at the district level. Of 108 operating pharmacies, 38 (35%) did not sell syringes of the types used by IDUs; of these, half stocked but refused to sell syringes to research staff, and the other half did not stock syringes at all. Overall 70 (65%) of the pharmacies did sell syringes; of these, 49 pharmacies sold single syringes without any restrictions and 21 offered packages of ten.
   Conclusions: Trainings for pharmacists need to be conducted to reduce negative attitudes towards IDUs and increase pharmacists' willingness to sell syringes. At a structural level, access to safe injection supplies for IDUs could be increased by including syringes in the federal list of mandatory medical products sold by pharmacies.

AB  - Sexual minorities in the United States are at elevated risk of prejudice, discrimination, and violence victimization due to stigma associated with their sexual orientation. These stressors may contribute to physiological stress responses and changes in the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). To date, no studies have examined the associations among minority sexual orientation, recent stressful events, and diurnal salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) patterns. The present study included 1663 young adults ages 18-32 years (31% men, 69% women) from the Growing Up Today Study, a prospective cohort of U.S. youth. Participants provided five saliva samples over the course of one day to estimate diurnal sAA patterns. Sexual orientation groups included completely heterosexual with no same-sex partners (CH; referent), mostly heterosexual/completely heterosexual with same-sex partners, and gay/lesbian/bisexual (LB or GB). Sex-stratified multilevel models were fit to evaluate the association of sexual orientation with diurnal patterns of log sAA. The association of recent stressful events was also evaluated. Among women, sexual minorities scored significantly higher than CH on perceived stress and number of stressful events in the past month (p < 0.05). Among men, sexual minorities scored higher than CH on perceived stress but not recent stressful events. In multivariable models, recent stressful events were not associated with sAA patterns, but significant sexual orientation group differences in sAA diurnal rhythm were observed among women though not among men. Compared to CH women, LB showed a blunted awakening response and elevated sAA levels across the day, both indicators consistent with SNS dysregulation. Findings suggest dysregulation of stress physiology in LB women, but not other sexual minority women or men, relative to same-sex heterosexuals. Observed dysregulation may relate to exposure among LB women to chronic stressors associated with sexual orientation stigma, although these relations and differences by sex warrant further study.

AB  - The value information leads to effective utilisation of services. The study identifies the gap in information about maternal health services and their utilisation. The information which has led to utilisation of services can be assiduously labelled as value information or value awareness. The relationship has been explored between awareness about maternal health services and service utilisation among fanani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) beneficiaries in Punjab, a high-performing state in India as per NRHM. Further, an assessment of impact of demographics on beneficiaries with information and those who utilised the services has been explored. Information received and utilisation of ante-natal checkups (ANC), delivery care and post-natal checkups (PNC) services have been studied for two districts in the state of Punjab, India. Chi-square test has been applied to know the association between the maternal health services and the select districts with respect to information and services utilised. Impact of demographic variables such as age, education, income and caste have been evaluated for information and utilisation of maternal health services. The dispersed information that has not triggered in utilisation of services by JSY beneficiaries have been used as an ingredient to explore and understand the deterring factors in non-utilisation of maternal care services in the rural areas of developing country like India. Results highlight that a significant association exists between the utilisation of maternal health services among the select districts in the state of Punjab (x(2) = 8.73, p-value = 0.0127); however, there is no association between the informed beneficiaries and the districts for the maternal health services. No impact of demographic variables has been found on the beneficiaries with information about maternal health services and those who utilised the services. The gap in awareness and utilisation of services throws light on the lurking concerns of unrecognised benefits, uncaring attitude towards health, prejudices about institutional delivery and PNC being considered an unimportant service among the beneficiaries.

AB  - BackgroundPopulation movements have been increasing over the past years in Europe due to socioeconomic factors, global turbulence and conflicts, especially in the area of Middle East. The presence of migrant populations in Europe challenges health systems due to increased requirements for health care provision. However, to date there is limited published data on the burden of disease among this population (in Greece and elsewhere). Our objective was to record burden of disease of undocumented migrants hosted in a Detention Center and therefore generate data for migrant and public health planning.MethodsEpidemiological data have been collected for 4756 male migrants hosted in a Detention Center from mid 2013 to mid 2015. Of them, 1427 have used health services in the Center, which maintained a detailed record of their medical history and tests.ResultsThe majority of the study population was aged between 18 and 40years old. Among those who used health services, most suffered from respiratory (45.6%) and digestive (30.1%) diseases. Injury, poisoning and other external causes accounted for 19.6% of service use, diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue for 18.7%, and factors affecting health status and contact with health services for 16.7%. Prevalence of communicable diseases was 15.9% amongst migrants randomly tested.ConclusionSystematic screening and monitoring of diseases and use of health services by migrants in detention centers allows for an evidence based understanding of the burden of disease related to these populations and the investment required to effectively manage it, thus providing critical input to appropriate health planning. Surveillance for communicable diseases amongst migrants in detention centers would also allow for a true picture of the impact of their presence on public health indicators and help address related prejudices and stigma.

AB  - Objective: Clinicians, advocates, and policy makers have presented mental illnesses as medical diseases in efforts to overcome low service use, poor adherence rates, and stigma. The authors examined the impact of this approach with a 10-year comparison of public endorsement of treatment and prejudice.
   Method: The authors analyzed responses to vignettes in the mental health modules of the 1996 and 2006 General Social Survey describing individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, major depression, and alcohol dependence to explore whether more of the public 1) embraces neurobiological understandings of mental illness; 2) endorses treatment from providers, including psychiatrists; and 3) reports community acceptance or rejection of people with these disorders. Multivariate analyses examined whether acceptance of neurobiological causes increased treatment support and lessened stigma.
   Results: In 2006, 67% of the public attributed major depression to neurobiological causes, compared with 54% in 1996. High proportions of respondents endorsed treatment, with general increases in the proportion endorsing treatment from doctors and specific increases in the proportions endorsing psychiatrists for treatment of alcohol dependence (from 61% in 1996 to 79% in 2006) and major depression (from 75% in 1996 to 85% in 2006). Social distance and perceived danger associated with people with these disorders did not decrease significantly. Holding a neurobiological conception of these disorders increased the likelihood of support for treatment but was generally unrelated to stigma. Where associated, the effect was to increase, not decrease, community rejection.
   Conclusions: More of the public embraces a neurobiological understanding of mental illness. This view translates into support for services but not into a decrease in stigma. Reconfiguring stigma reduction strategies may require providers and advocates to shift to an emphasis on competence and inclusion. (Am J Psychiatry 2010; 167:1321-1330)

AB  - Introduction: People with epilepsy are socially discriminated against on the grounds of widespread negative public attitudes, misunderstandings and defensive behaviour. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the public understanding of and attitudes toward epilepsy among the Chinese population in Malaysia.
   Methods: A validated, self-administered questionnaire comprising 23 questions was utilised to evaluate the understanding of and attitudes toward epilepsy among randomly approached respondents from the Chinese population living in the urban areas of Penang, Klang Valley, Kuala Lumpur and Sibu in Malaysia.
   Results: Out of 1,000 people approached, 697 (69.7 percent) respondents agreed to participate in the study. When asked whether people with epilepsy are slow learners and have intellectual functioning below normal, 448 (64.3 percent) respondents answered 'no'. This positive answer was mainly provided by female (35.6 percent) as compared to male (28.6 percent) respondents. Moreover, more than half responded positively to the following statements: people with epilepsy should not be isolated from the normal population; epileptics can perform daily activities; epileptics can receive academic education; and epileptics can become useful members of society. In addition, significant associations were discovered between the education level of the respondents and several statements, including whether epileptics are as intelligent as everyone else (p-value is 0.009), whether epilepsy can be treated with drugs (p-value is 0.037) and whether epileptics can be as successful as other people in their chosen career (p-value is 0.009). Positive responses were mainly acquired from those with secondary education and above. A large number of the respondents felt that people with epilepsy should not be employed as lorry drivers, firefighters, doctors and army personnel.
   Conclusion: The general Chinese population in the urban areas of Malaysia had, at the time of the investigation, a relatively high level of understanding and positive attitudes toward certain aspects of epilepsy, although a minority of the study population demonstrated prejudice and discriminatory behaviours toward people with epilepsy.

TI  - EVOLVING EQUALITY: THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE BAR
T2  - STANFORD JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
LA  - English
AB  - Defense counsel in international criminal proceedings face difficult challenges that are intrinsic to the modern system of internationalized accountability,- yet their professionalism and performance represent perhaps the most determinative dimension for evaluating the overall fairness of what the world terms "justice for grievous atrocities. Defense teams labor against the tides of public opinion and the deeply felt pain of the victims of mass atrocities. Abandonment of appropriate defense efforts, whether the result of professional fecklessness or personal pressures, would transform international criminal law into an organized sham aimed at achieving a shadow of justice while undermining the rights of the individuals unlucky enough to face charges against the combined weight of political and judicial will. Since its genesis in the wake of World War II, the growth of a modern field termed international criminal law is necessarily paralleled by the development of a mature defense role that helps ensure that every defendant's culpability or innocence is grounded in the soil of individual responsibility rather than irrational prejudice or irresponsible collective guilt. The developmental arc of the international defense bar in its organizational and systematic context has, however, been surprisingly underexplored.
   This article discusses the jurisprudence associated with the precept of equality of arms between the prosecution and defense. Highlighting the key challenges encountered by the defense that impair perfect equality of arms, this article will describe the organizational responses in modern practice. This article documents the empirical indicators supporting the assertion that defendants receive assistance from an organized and mature defense bar, despite its imperfections and occasional inadequacies. The holistic system of international criminal justice provides rough procedural parity to the defense, despite the recurring ethical dilemmas highlighted herein. This article concludes, perhaps controversially, that while a perfect equality of arms is a structural impossibility in the modern system of international justice, the modern defense bar has evolved to provide its functional equivalent.

AB  - EN 14103:2003 and EN 14103:2011 were developed in order to determine fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) content of biodiesel. The internal standards (IS) of biodiesel include methyl heptadecanoate (MHD) and methyl nonadecanoate (MND), respectively. However, since these ISs are also present in bovine tallow methyl esters (BTME) or overlapping peaks, they have not been efficient. This work proposes an improved BTME determination method by using hexadecyl propanoate (HDP) as an IS. For this purpose, an analytical methodology by Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) was developed and validated, where HDP demonstrated selectivity in retention time between peaks C16:1 and C18:0 for coconut and soybeans methyl esters and BTME, as well as resolution > 1.5 for the BTME in split mode 30:1. Trueness in the determination of BTME content using the HDP as an IS was statistically equivalent to confidence interval of 95% for the null hypothesis statistic test, even when only 20% of the HDP was utilized in comparison with the IS concentrations defined by EN 14103:2003 and EN 14103:2011. This allowed the biodiesel analysis to be performed five times more with 1 g of HDP. Furthermore, the method developed enabled us to reduce the analysis time by 21.6%, without prejudice to the integration of peaks (C6:0 to C24:1). Regarding the repeatability and intermediate precision tests, results of RSD (%) <= 2% were reached. Additionally, the method developed has proved to be robust.

AB  - The global reach of mass media leaves few unexposed to Western ideals and ideas, which privilege White and Eurocentric images. Through a combination of visual and narrative stereotypes, ads, movies, print media and television distribute implicit messages about how humans should be viewed, categorized and commented on based on their perceived social identity. This juggernaut of disproportional representation ensures that people exposed to implicit messages will unconsciously absorb and accept them. Drawing on the engaged scholarship of the first author and interviews with strangers, this manuscript explores the ways in which an intentional and inclusive combining of the same elements of visuals and narratives can be utilized to problematize one-dimensional stereotypes, create space for unlearning biased social messages, and provide an alternative method of seeing others and ourselves. This work demonstrates how Author 1 promoted her anti-racist White identity development while simultaneously supplanting stereotypical images of individuals with diverse lived experiences with complex, person-centered oral histories and portraits that serve as compelling counter-narratives.

AB  - We describe the planning, processing, and uncertainty analysis for a marine CSEM survey of the Scarborough gas field off the northwest coast of Australia, consisting of 20 transmitter tow lines and 144 deployments positioned along a dense 2D profile and a complex 3D grid. The purpose of this survey was to collect a high-quality data set over a known hydrocarbon prospect and use it to further the development of CSEM as a hydrocarbon mapping tool. Recent improvements in navigation and processing techniques yielded high-quality frequency domain data. Data pseudosections exhibit a significant anomaly that is laterally confined within the known reservoir location. Perturbation analysis of the uncertainties in the transmitter parameters yielded predicted uncertainties in amplitude and phase of just a few percent at close ranges. These uncertainties may, however, be underestimated. We introduce a method for more accurately deriving uncertainties using a line of receivers towed twice in opposite directions. Comparing the residuals for each line yields a Gaussian distribution directly related to the aggregate uncertainty of the transmitter parameters. Constraints on systematic error in the transmitter antenna dip and inline range can be calculated by perturbation analysis. Uncertainties are not equal in amplitude and phase, suggesting that inversion of these data would be better suited in these components rather than in real and imaginary components. One-dimensional inversion showed that the reservoir and a confounding resistive layer above it cannot be separately resolved even when the roughness constraint is modified to allow for jumps in resistivity and prejudices are provided, indicating that this level of detail is beyond the single-site CSEM data. Further, when range-dependent error bars are used, the resolution decreases at a shallower depth than when a fixed-error level is used.

AB  - Expectations of chastity have been placed upon Indian women for centuries. This article seeks to analyse why such prejudice continues to persist in Indian society, both in India and across Indian communities globally, namely South Africa. An answer to this question can be found in theRamayana. This epic Sanskrit text is the reason Hindus across the world celebrate Diwali, lighting lamps to guide Rama and Sita home after years in exile. As a Hindu, I grew up believing that Rama and Sita were the ideal man and woman, the ideal husband and wife. I was never aware of one controversial part of theRamayana, known in the text as theagni parikshaor fire ordeal, in which Sita after being rescued from King Ravana by her husband, must prove her sexual purity by walking through a blazing fire (Hess,1999). This test of chastity has been defended, criticised and even deliberately ignored in various analyses and reinterpretations of theRamayana. One example is the work of Yael Farber, a South African woman theatre practitioner. TitledRam - The Abduction of Sita into Darkness(2011), Farber makes Sita the focal point of her play and challenges patriarchal expectations. This article investigates, through Farber's play, the reasons and complexities behind why the Indian female body and chastity is deemed imperative to the preservation of Indian society. Many South African Indians see India as their 'motherland'. Through family and Indian communities in South Africa, notions of Indian identity in India pervade our society at home. Fatima Meer explains that, "Indian societies in South Africa have not abandoned 'the Sita myth'" (1972: 37). This article is thus an investigation and challenge of the patriarchy that has always troubled me about my religion and culture as a South African Indian Hindu woman.

AB  - Background Telehealth and online health information provide patients with increased access to healthcare services and health information in chronic disease management of older patients with chronic diseases, addressing the challenge of inadequate health resources and promoting active and informed participation of older patients in chronic disease management. There are few qualitative studies on the application of telehealth and online health information to chronic disease management in older patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is one of the most common chronic diseases in older adults. Telehealth is widely used in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of older patients and healthcare providers in the application of telehealth and online health information to chronic disease management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Methods A qualitative descriptive study with data generated from 52 individual semi-structured interviews with 29 patients [Law of the People's Republic of China on the protection of the rights and interests of older people (2018 Revised Version) = >60 years old] with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 23 healthcare providers. The inductive thematic analysis method was used for data analysis. Results Four themes and 16 sub-themes were identified in this study. Four themes included: faced with a vast amount of online health information, essential competencies and personality traits ensuring older patients' participation and sustained use, user experience with the use of technology, being in a complex social context. Conclusion The ability of patients to understand health information should be fully considered while facilitating access to online health information for older patients. The role of health responsibility and user experience in older patients' participation and sustained use of telehealth and online health information needs to be emphasised. In addition, the complex social context is a determining factor to be considered, particularly the complex impact of a reliance on offspring and social prejudice on the behaviour of older adults using telehealth and online health information.

TI  - Safeguarding British Identity or Betraying It? The Role of British 'Tradition' in the Parliamentary Great Debate on EC Membership, October 1971
T2  - JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - This article will revisit the parliamentary debate in October 1971 which took Britain into the European Economic Community (EEC). It will show that both sides involved viewed the vote as a great matter of principle and invoked a number of British traditions in order to justify their stance. Opponents of entry sought to portray EEC membership as endangering three great traditions: Cobdenite liberalism, British internationalism and the UK's ability to govern itself. Those on the other side of the argument rejected all three of these claims, viewing the choice for Europe as opting for an exciting future rather than clinging unrealistically to former glories, and claimed that they were acting in line with another central British tradition - that of being a country that mattered and had a say when crucial economic and political decisions were being made.

AB  - Learning about the abandonment of moral principles of healthcare professionals and scientists, their societies and academic institutions, to a murderous ideology yields fundamental concerns and global implications for present and future healthcare professionals' education and practice. Medicine's worst-case scenario raises deeply disturbing yet essential questions in the here and now: Could the Holocaust, one of the greatest evils ever perpetrated on humankind, have occurred without the complicity of physicians, their societies, and the scientific profession community? How did healers become killers? Can it happen again?We reflect here on those queries through the lens of the Second International Scholars Workshop on Medicine during the Holocaust and Beyond held in the Galilee, Israel on May 7-11, 2017 and derive contemporary global lessons for the healthcare professions. Following a brief historical background, implications of the history of medicine in the Holocaust are drawn including 1) awareness that the combination of hierarchy, obedience, and power constitutes a risk factor for abuse of power in medicine and 2) learning and teaching about medicine in the Holocaust and beyond is a powerful platform for supporting professional identity formation. As such, this history ideally can help equip learners with a moral compass for navigating the future of medical practice and inherent ethical challenges such as prejudice, assisted reproduction, resource allocation, obtaining valid informed consent, end of life care, and challenges of genomics and technology expansion. Curriculum modules are available and studies on impact on students' attitudes and behavior are emerging.The conference culminated with the launch of the Galilee Declaration, composed and signed by an international, inter-professional community of historians, healthcare professions educators, and ethicists. The Declaration included herein (http://english.wgalil.ac.il/category/Declaration) calls for curricula on history of healthcare professions in the Holocaust and its implications to be included in all healthcare professions education.

AB  - Purpose
   Extant sales management literature shows that holding negative headquarters stereotypes (NHS) by salespeople is harmful to their sales performance. However, there is a lack of research on how managers can leverage organizational structures to minimize NHS in sales forces. This study aims to know how social network patterns influence the flow of NHS among salespeople and sales managers in a large B2B sales organization.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The authors hypothesize and test whether patterns of social networks among salespeople and sales managers determine the stereotypical attitudes of salespeople toward corporate directors and, eventually, impact their sales performance. The authors analyzed a multi-level data set from the B2B sales forces of a large US-based media company.
   Findings
   The authors found that organizational social network properties including the sales manager's team centrality, sales team's network density and sales team's external connectivity moderate the flow of NHS from sales managers and peer salespeople to a focal salesperson.
   Research limitations/implications
   First, the data was cross-sectional and did not allow the authors to examine the dynamics of social network patterns and their impact on NHS. Second, The authors only focused on advice-seeking social networks and did not examine other types of social networks such as friendship and trust networks. Third, the context was limited to one company in the media industry.
   Practical implications
   The authors provide recommendations to sales managers on how to leverage and influence social networks to minimize the development and flow of NHS in sales forces.
   Originality/value
   The findings advance existing knowledge on how NHS gets shared and transferred in sales organizations. Moreover, this study provides crucial managerial insights with regard to controlling and managing NHS in sales forces.

TI  - Tripping the Light Fantastic: A Comparative Analysis of the European Commission's Proposals for New and Interim Financing of Insolvent Businesses
T2  - INTERNATIONAL INSOLVENCY REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - The European Commission published a Draft Directive in November 2016, with the aim of ensuring that all Member States have in place an effective mechanism for dealing with viable, but financially distressed, businesses. The Draft Directive includes provisions designed to encourage financing for the debtor company, both interim financing to keep the lights on' for a brief period while the debtor negotiates with its creditors for a resolution to its financial distress, and, where possible, to finance implementation of a restructuring plan, called new financing' in the Draft Directive. Creating such a financing regime is a complex and difficult issue, as the law's intervention in this area often involves constraints on the rights of existing creditors, requiring that a careful balance is maintained between existing creditors' rights and the rights of the interim financier. This article examines the underlying policy rationale and benefits of having new and interim financing available to financially distressed debtor companies and discusses the risks involved. It examines the EU Commission's proposals in light of the experience of jurisdictions that have already tackled these issues, notably the USA and Canada, or have developed a market-based solution to this problem, such as the UK. While the European Commission's wish to include such measures in its restructuring proposals is laudable, the measures as drafted raise concerns, particularly regarding risks associated with priority for the grantors of such finance. The authors suggest that there are four fundamental aspects of such financing on which the Directive could give guidance to Member States, namely, effective notice to pre-filing creditors, thresholds for the debtor to qualify, a menu of relevant criteria to balance benefit and prejudice, and a role for the court in resolving disputes, ensuring fairness to stakeholders, and serving as an accountability check on interim financing arrangements, all aimed at maintaining the integrity of the insolvency process.

AB  - Background: The nonlinear nature of contagious diseases and the potential for exponential growth can be difficult to grasp for the general public. This has strong implications for public health communication, which needs to be both easily accessible and efficient. A pandemic is an extreme situation, and the accompanying strict societal measures are generally easier to accept if one understands the underlying reasoning behind them. Bringing about informed attitude change and achieving compliance to strict restrictions requires explanations of scientific concepts and terminologies that laypersons can understand.
   Objective: The aim of the project is to develop effective, evidence-based modes of video communication for translating complex, but important, health messages about pandemics to both the general population and decision makers. The study uses COVID-19 as a case to learn and prepare society for handling the ongoing and future pandemics, as well as to provide evidence-based tools for the science communication toolbox.
   Methods: The project applies a mixed methods design, combining qualitative methods (eg, interviews, observational studies, literature reviews) and quantitative methods (eg, randomized controlled trials [RCTs]). The project brings together researchers from a wide range of academic fields, as well as communication industry professionals.
   Results: This study has received funding from the Trond Mohn Foundation through the Research Council of Norway's "COVID-19 Emergency Call for Proposals" March 2020. Recruitment and data collection for the exploratory first phase of the project ran from February 2021 to March 2021. Creative communication work started in May 2021, and the production of videos for use in the RCTs in the final phase of the project started in September 2021.
   Conclusions: The COVCOM project will take on several grand challenges within the field of communicating science and provide evidence-based tools to the science communication toolbox. A long-term goal of the project is to contribute to the creation of a more resilient health care system by developing communication responses tailormade for different audiences, preparing society for any future pandemic.

AB  - The single factor fallacy occurs when social scientists model their applied work largely around a single factor. The problem generally arises when either a highly relevant theory is ignored or when missing key variables distort the results. Examples of this fallacy are drawn from the expanding research literature on intergroup contact, where we discuss the implications of missing critical variables from the analysis (including segregation, effects of negative as well as positive contact, extended contact, and contact when the outgroup is in the majority). The policy issues involved include racially desegregated schools, minority protest, the impact of neighborhood diversity, and anti-immigration voting. Three suggestions for avoiding the fallacy are emphasizedthe use of mediation-moderation analysis, longitudinal research, and multilevel analysis. We end by outlining five simple principles, based on our own experience in the United States and the United Kingdom, that may increase the impact of social scientists' research on public policy.

AB  - Theories of risk aversion, epistemic defense, and ingroup enhancement converge in predicting greater impact of negative (vs. positive) experiences with outgroup members on generalized evaluations of stigmatized outgroups. However, they diverge in predictions for admired outgroups. Past tests have focused on negative outgroups using correlational designs without a control group. Consequently, they have not distinguished between alternative explanations or ascertained the direction of causality/generalization, and they have suffered from self-selection biases. These limitations were redressed by a meta-analysis of experimental research on individual-to-group generalization with positive and negative outgroups (59 tests; 3,012 participants). Controlling for modest confounds, the meta-analysis found a generalization advantage of negative experiences for stigmatized outgroups and a generalization advantage of positive experiences for admired outgroups. These results highlight the centrality of valenced expectations about outgroups, consistent with epistemic defense and ingroup enhancement and inconsistent with risk aversion. Implications for positive changes in intergroup dynamics are discussed.

AB  - Background: Information and communication technologies are promising tools to increase the quality of life of people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment and that of their caregivers. However, there are barriers to their use associated with sociodemographic factors and negative attitudes, as well as inadequate knowledge about technologies.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze technophilia (attitudes toward new technologies) and the use of smartphones and tablets along with associated factors in people with dementia/mild cognitive impairment and their caregivers.
   Methods: Data from the first visit of the Support Monitoring and Reminder for Mild Dementia (SMART4MD) randomized multicenter clinical trial were used for this analysis. Data were obtained from two European countries, Spain and Sweden, and from three centers: Consorci Sanitari de Terrassa (Catalonia, Spain), Servicio Andaluz de Salud (Andalusia, Spain), and the Blekinge Institute of Technology (Sweden). Participants with a score between 20 and 28 in the Mini Mental State Examination, with memory problems (for more than 6 months), and who were over the age of 55 years were included in the study, along with their caregivers. The bivariate Chi square and Mann-Whitney tests, and multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used for statistical analysis.
   Results: A total of 1086 dyads were included (N=2172). Overall, 299 (27.53%) of people with dementia/mild cognitive impairment had a diagnosis of dementia. In addition, 588 (54.14%) of people with dementia/mild cognitive impairment reported using a smartphone almost every day, and 106 (9.76%) used specific apps or software to support their memory. Among the caregivers, 839 (77.26%) used smartphones and tablets almost every day, and 181 (16.67%) used specific apps or software to support their memory. The people with dementia/mild cognitive impairment showed a lower level of technophilia in comparison to that of their caregivers after adjusting for confounders (B=0.074, P=.02) with differences in technology enthusiasm (B=0.360, P<.001), but not in technology anxiety (B=-0.042, P=.37). Technophilia was associated with lower age (B=-0.009, P=.004), male gender (B=-0.160, P<.001), higher education level (P=.01), living arrangement (living with children vs single; B=-2.538, P=.01), country of residence (Sweden vs Spain; B=0.256, P<.001), lower depression (B=-0.046, P<.001), and better health status (B=0.004, P<.001) in people with dementia/mild cognitive impairment. Among caregivers, technophilia was associated with comparable sociodemographic factors (except for living arrangement), along with a lower caregiver burden (B=-0.005, P=.04) and better quality of life (B=0.348, P<.001).
   Conclusions: Technophilia was associated with a better quality of life and sociodemographic variables in people with dementia/mild cognitive impairment and caregivers, suggesting potential barriers for technological interventions. People with dementia/mild cognitive impairment frequently use smartphones and tablets, but the use of specific apps or software to support memory is limited. Interventions using these technologies are needed to overcome barriers in this population related to sociodemographic characteristics and the lack of enthusiasm for new technologies.

AB  - Objectives Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) individuals are often subjected to negative attitudes in the workplace, which may lead to non-disclosure of their sexual orientation and/or gender identities. We aimed to determine the prevalence of workplace disclosure of sexual or gender identity (ie, 'outness'; being 'out') and to examine its associations with workplace characteristics in LGBTI workers in Austria. Methods This cross-sectional study analysed sociodemographic, work-related and well-being-related data from self-identifying gender and/or sexual minority participants elicited by an online questionnaire between February and June 2017. From the initial 1268 respondents, 1177 (93%) provided complete data and were included in the subsequent analyses. Results The largest proportion of the sample were 26-35 years old (39.1%), cisgender gay men (40.0%) in full-time employment (63.9%). Overall, 51.7% of the sample were 'out' at the workplace. Being bisexual (OR=0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.81), the provision of antidiscrimination guidelines in the workplace (OR=0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.90), living alone (OR=0.50, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.79) and in shared households (OR=0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.96) were associated with a decreased likelihood of being 'out' at work. Factors associated with being 'out' at work were being middle aged (36-45 years old; OR=1.74, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.85), having been in employment for >10 years (OR=2.03, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.81), an LGBTI-friendly work environment (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.91), labour-management antidiscrimination contract (OR=2.02, 95% CI 1.23 to 3.32) and work council protections (OR=1.56, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.36). Conclusions Instating antidiscrimination protections might facilitate 'outness' of LGBTI workers and lead to a better promotion of diversity in the workplace.

AB  - Italy is increasingly becoming a culturally complex society. This poses numerous challenges for developmental and educational psychology, mainly in terms of how to encourage adequate levels of social harmony by promoting positive development of both immigrant and autochthonous youth. Within this perspective, the current paper presents the Italian findings of the Mutual Intercultural Relations in Plural Societies (MIRIPS) international project, postulating the centrality of three core hypotheses: integration, multiculturalism, and contact. Two studies were performed to investigate these hypotheses. Study 1 comprised 188 Tunisian adolescents aged 13-18 (51% F; M-age=15.94), while Study 2 included 282 Italian adolescents aged 13-18 ( 58% F; M-age=16.34). Data collection involved completion of the Italian version of the MIRIPS questionnaires, including security, contact, attitudes, acculturation, and well-being measures. In both studies, hypotheses were simultaneously tested by a SEM approach. The tested theoretical models fit the data well. For Tunisian adolescents, establishing contacts with Italian peers was associated with acculturation outcomes of integration (contact hypothesis), that, in turn, were related to higher well-being (integration hypothesis). Also, higher levels of perceived discrimination were related to acculturation outcomes of separation (multiculturalism hypothesis). For Italian adolescents, feelings of security were linked to higher multicultural ideology and tolerance ( multiculturalism hypothesis) as well as to higher contact with immigrants, that, in turn, were connected to lower segregationist attitudes (contact hypothesis). Moreover, higher levels of acculturation expectation of multiculturalism (the idea that non-dominant/immigrant groups should be integrated by both maintaining the original culture and adopting the dominant/hosting culture) were linked to higher self-esteem (integration hypothesis). The findings substantially supported the three core hypotheses and provided insights for decision-makers and practitioners to design effective social policies and educational programs to enhance the quality of intercultural relations among youth in Italy.

AB  - Aims This study examined the predictors of student nurses' intention to vaccinate against COVID-19. We measured the nursing students' risk perceptions, anxiety, fears and beliefs on COVID-19 vaccine; attitudes towards it and vaccine literacy (VL). Design This study is a multi-university study utilizing the quantitative, cross-sectional and predictive approach. Methods Using convenience sampling (n = 1170), we surveyed 10 Saudi universities from November 26, 2020, to December 31, 2020. Forward stepwise multinomial logistic regression was performed in identifying the factors predicting student nurses' intention to vaccinate against COVID-19. Results The overall mean in the risk perception, anxiety and fear was 9.59 (SD = 2.82, possible range = 1-15), 3.95 (SD = 4.77, possible range = 0-20) and 18.17 (SD = 6.65, possible range = 7-35) respectively. They also reported a mean of 29.90 (SD = 6.56, possible range = 8-40) on COVID-19 belief. COVID-19 positive and negative attitudes mean score was 3.64 (SD = 0.92) and 2.72 (SD = 0.90) in a 1-4 range of scores respectively. The functional and interactive-critical COVID-19 VL of the students were at moderate levels. More than half of the respondents (55.9%) intended to be vaccinated against COVID-19, 17.6% did not intend to do so and 26.5% were unsure. High-risk perceptions, low levels of COVID-19 anxiety, positive beliefs and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine, and high levels of interactive-critical COVID-19 VL were significant predictors of student nurses' intentions to vaccinate against COVID-19. Conclusion Policymakers could consider the factors identified in this study and why the students did not intend to receive the vaccine in planning a nationwide vaccination program. The colleges of nursing could also utilize the findings in developing educational programs that aim to improve VL and beliefs and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine.

AB  - Scholars have long explored the colorblind and multicultural ideological approaches to improving intergroup attitudes and relations. Polyculturalism, a newly studied ideological approach, focuses on the past and current interactions and connections among different racial and ethnic groups. Drawing on cross-disciplinary work, we critically examine the various forms that each of these ideological approaches has taken across studies, and their implications for intergroup attitudes and relations among racially and ethnically diverse children, adolescents, and adults. Although each ideological approach has been examined in several ways ( often combining different forms of each approach), there is sufficient comparative work to draw some conclusions. We propose that a combined ideological approach be implemented in educational settings that maximizes the strengths and positive intergroup consequences of colorblindness, multiculturalism, and polyculturalism, while minimizes the weaknesses and negative intergroup consequences of each approach.

AB  - Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between personality traits and attitudes toward learning communication skills in undergraduate medical students. The relation between students' attitudes and personality trait could help us identify those who those who will need more support to develop communication skills, based on their personality traits.
   Methods: The data was collected data from an intentional and cross-sectional sample composed of 204 students from three Brazilian universities. The students answered questionnaires containing the Communication Skills Attitude Scale (CSAS-BR) and the Big Five Mini-Markers (BFMM) for personality. Data were analyzed using frequency calculations, principal components analysis, and the multiple linear regression model.
   Results: Seven among 26 items of the original Communication Skills Attitude Scale (CSAS) presented factor loads lower than vertical bar 0.30 vertical bar and must be excluded in the CSAS -BR that showed one domain including positive and negative attitudes. The value of Cronbach's alpha of the 19-item scale was 0.894. The BFMM showed similar dimensional results with five domains with Cronbach's alpha values of 0.804 for Extroversion, 0.753 for agreeableness, 0.755 for conscientiousness, 0.780 for neuroticism and 0.668 for openness. There were positive and statically significant linear associations with the CSAS- BR and agreeableness (beta: 0.230, p<0.001), extraversion (beta: 0.150, p=0.030), and openness to experience (beta: 0.190, p= 0.010). These personality factors drive social interactions and interpersonal relations, which involve the tendency to be friendly, flexible, and cooperative; to show a willing disposition; and the ability to actively engage with others.
   Conclusions: Based on the methods applied in this study, the results demonstrated a relation between agreeableness, extraversion and openness to experience with attitudes on communication skills in students from three Brazilian universities. Our results suggest that the evaluation of personality traits can contribute to the recognition of students for whom the establishment of special teaching strategies can improve communication skills.

AB  - Lay understandings reflect the lived experience of racism, and our knowledge of these considerations assist with enhancing an appreciation of intergroup relations. Drawing on data from semi-structured interviews and focus groups with 30 school attendees from diverse backgrounds aged 14-22 years, conducted from December 2011 to January 2012 in Victoria, Australia, we critically examined their understandings of and experiences with racism. Data demonstrate the ambiguity of racism, while confirming that Australian youth from various racial, ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds consistently conceptualise, explain, and classify racism, whilst minimising some forms of racism, including racist humour. Participants described racism through three primary domains: (a) Group versus Individual: racism stems from perceived differences, with individuals stereotyped as belonging to larger groups; (b) Actions versus Beliefs: individuals are classified as racist or non-racist according to their actions and beliefs; and (c) Exceptions, Exclusions and Minimisation: racism is frequently excused and minimised. The present research highlights the need for additional exploration of the nuances of racism in Australia from lay perspectives and provides clear evidence of the need to address racism in Australian society. Further developing the evidence base to understand the lived experience of racism in Australia could inform and support the design and evaluation of anti-racism and pro-diversity initiatives. Moreover, we hope that the present data can be drawn upon to enlighten the development of instruments to more accurately measure racist attitudes in Australian youth. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The current research answers the question how Twitter users express their evaluation of topical social problems (explicitly or implicitly) and what linguistic means they use, being restricted by the allowed length of the message. The article explores how Twitter users communicate with each other and exchange ideas on social issues of great importance, express their feelings using a number of linguistic means, while being limited by a fixed number of characters, and form solidarity, being geographically distant from each other. The research is focused on the linguistic tools employed by Twitter users in order to express their personal attitude. The subject chosen for study was the migration processes in Europe and the USA. The aim of the current investigation is to determine the correlation between the attitudes of English-speaking users towards migration and the way they are expressed implicitly or explicitly. The authors make an attempt to define which tools contribute to the implicit or explicit nature of the utterances. The material includes 100 tweets of English-speaking users collected from February 1 to July 31, 2017. The choice of the time period is defined by significant events in Trump's migration policy and their consequences. The research is based on the content analysis of the material carried out by means of the Atlas.ti program. The software performs the coding of textual units, counts the frequency of codes and their correlation. The results of the research show that Twitter users tend to express their critical attitudes towards migration, rather than approve of it or sympathise with migrants. Criticism is more often expressed implicitly rather than explicitly. In order to disguise the attitude and feelings, the English-speaking users of Twitter employed irony, questions and quotations, while the explicit expression of attitudes was done by means of imperative structures. It is also worth mentioning that ellipses, contractions and abbreviations were used quite frequently due to the word limit of tweets. At the same time, the lack of knowledge about extralinguistic factors and personal characteristics of users makes the process of interpretation of tweets rather challenging. The findings of the current research suggest the necessity to take into account implicit negative attitudes while carrying out the analysis of public opinion on Twitter.

AB  - Purpose: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning (LGBQ) youth exhibit significantly higher rates of mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and nonsuicidal self-injury than their heterosexual peers. Past studies tend to group LGBQ youth together; however, more recent studies suggest subtle differences in risk between sexual minority groups. This study examined differences in mental health symptoms across male and female youth who are attracted to the same sex (gay and lesbian), opposite sex (heterosexual), both sexes (bisexual), or are unsure of whom they were attracted to (questioning) in a sample of 2,513 youth (ages 14-24 years).
   Methods: Data were collected using the Behavioral Health Screenda Web-based screening tool that assesses psychiatric symptoms and risk behaviors-during routine well visits.
   Results: Bisexual and questioning females endorsed significantly higher scores on the depression, anxiety, and traumatic distress subscales than did heterosexual females. Lesbians, bisexual females, and questioning females all exhibited significantly higher lifetime suicide scores than heterosexual females. Interestingly, bisexual females exhibited the highest current suicide scores. Gay and bisexual males endorsed significantly higher scores on the depression and traumatic distress subscales than did heterosexual males. Gay males also exhibited higher scores on the anxiety subscale than heterosexual males, with bisexual males exhibiting a nonsignificant trend toward higher scores as well.
   Conclusions: Findings highlight varying level of risk across subgroups of LGBQ youth and suggest the importance of considering LGBQ groups separately in the context of a behavioral health assessment, especially for females.

AB  - Whereas an individual differences perspective recently pointed to the importance of a relative extrinsic to intrinsic value orientation in the prediction of outgroup attitudes, the intergroup relations perspective stresses the importance of threat. This study investigates the interplay of both perspectives. A scenario study among high-school students showed that only people who attach greater relative importance to extrinsic values react with a negative attitude towards an outgroup that is portrayed as threatening. A longitudinal study among university students then showed that people with a relatively greater extrinsic value orientation are not only more likely to react to threat but also to perceive threat. Specifically, cross-lagged analyses showed that a relatively greater extrinsic value orientation predicted over-time increases in threat perceptions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Art in general perception is something that transcends our notion of reality. In view of the earliest findings in Paleolithic sites, their abstract appearance and sometimes ceremonial context increased their status of a secret language. Even the first figurative cave paintings remained in a context of an encoded semantic whole. The highly symbolic value of art seemed invulnerable. It was just the claim for "mimesis" in Greek antiquity (Plato) that urged artists to "realistically" depict what can be seen-as to stay in track of eternal messages behind. This devaluated the artistic oeuvre to a purely imitating craft and had to overcome at once several inherent obstacles. First, that reality (the phenomenal world) is in general only a pale reflection of what lays behind (Platonic ideas) and second, that the human eye, unlike the human mind, cannot penetrate to more than ephemeral impressions. Moreover, it mixed up reality with what we are able to see (i.e. visual perception), thus supposing a pinpoint representation of the world by our senses. Aristotle was the first to qualify art as picturing more than we usually are meant to see, filling the gap between the sensual and the spiritual world. Aristotelian aesthetics includes concepts of reduction and selection of composition and emotion, thus a summarized view within any performance of poetics or painting. And it took centuries to close the gap between natural and aesthetic perception or art. Life sciences in the 20th century discovered the evolutionary basis of sensory perception as being highly biased and organized, concept as emotion-driven and thus, mentally equipped as well. This sets a new approach in our understanding of perception, art, and aesthetics as an ongoing communication in process on common bases. Art may cooperate or disagree, but never can cut the nexus with its perceptual prejudices and substrate.

AB  - Background. Health workers' awareness and knowledge of transplantation medicine can improve people's sensitivity and reduce their degree of opposition to donations. The medical literature contains numerous examples of attitudes toward organ transplantation and donation aimed at university students or medical staff members, but rarely for transplantation nurses.
   Objective. The purposes of the study were to investigate the attitudes toward organ transplantation and donation among transplantation nurses and to explore the impact factors.
   Methods. The study was conducted in 37 transplantation surgery wards in 22 hospitals using cross-sectional approach. SPSS (International Business Machines Corporation, Armonk, New York, USA) 7.0 software was used to analysis descriptive and inferential statistics for data.
   Results. Five hundred thirty-six effective questionnaires were received and the effective rate was 89.33%. Nurses' mean age was 28.40 years with a mean service length of 6.54 years. Among these nurses, 66.6% and 78.0% were willing to accept organ transplantation surgery for themselves and their relatives, respectively. Of these nurses, 33.4% would donate their organs after death; whereas 39.9% were uncertain. Only 38.2% were willing to register in the national organ donation system. Of these nurses, 28.2% were willing to sign the organ donation consent forms when their relatives became potential organ donors, and 45.7% were uncertain. Eight independent variables that affected nurses' attitudes toward donating their organs from most to least significant were: ratio of nurse to bed, title, employment form, age, length of service, position, monthly income, and the highest educational degree earned. Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant correlation among nurses' attitudes toward organ transplantation, organ donation, and online registration.
   Conclusion. The attitude toward donation and transplantation in the hospitals was not too optimistic, and an improvement in the training regarding transplantation and donation among nurses in China is necessary. Nurses are an important group who generate opinion in the patient population, and their negative attitudes can have a significant negative impact on society's attitudes toward organ donation.

AB  - Understanding individual resilience helps to improve employment opportunities of people with epilepsy. This is significant because, in Zimbabwe, as in many other countries in the Global South, people with epilepsy encounter several barriers in a context of less-than-ideal public services. Despite this disadvantage, some people with epilepsy have better employment outcomes for reasons including level of seizure control, social background, employment support services, and individual resilience. This article reports on data from participants (n = 8), who were part of a larger study (n = 30) on employment experiences of people with epilepsy in Harare. The study used in-depth interviews with the participants, who were all service users and members of the Epilepsy Support Foundation (ESF) in Harare. The eight resilient participants comprised four males and four females aged between 26-48 years, who were selected because, unlike the remaining 22 participants, they had overcome chronic unemployment. Seven of the eight participants were employed, while one had recently become unemployed. Views of service providers (n = 7) were sought on the experiences of people with epilepsy through a focus group discussion. The service providers included two health workers, three social service workers, and two disability advocacy workers. Data were analysed using NVivo, a computer-assisted qualitative data analysis package. The study found that participants experienced barriers, such as a lack of medical treatment, yet this was important for education and training, lack of finances for training, and negative attitudes at workplaces. Despite these barriers, participants had overcome chronic unemployment due to their individual resilience characterised by: (i) a 'fighting spirit', (ii) being their own advocates, and (iii) having a mastery over, and acceptance of, their epilepsy. The research concluded that, where people with epilepsy faced barriers, as in Zimbabwe, individual resilience acted as a strong coping mechanism that resulted in better employment outcomes. This suggested service providers should strengthen resilience-building initiatives and make them more accessible to people with epilepsy. However, this is only a coping mechanism that should not stop service providers and service users from advocating for government-provided employment services. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Individuals who qualify equally for membership in two racial groups provide a rare window into social categorization and perception. In 5 experiments, we tested the extent to which a rule of hypodescent, whereby biracial individuals are assigned the status of their socially subordinate parent group, would govern perceptions of Asian White and Black White targets. In Experiment 1, in spite of posing explicit questions concerning Asian White and Black White targets, hypodescent was observed in both cases and more strongly in Black White social categorization. Experiments 2A and 2B used a speeded response task and again revealed evidence of hypodescent in both cases, as well as a stronger effect in the Black White target condition. In Experiments 3A and 3B. social perception was studied with a face-morphing task. Participants required a face to be lower in proportion minority to be perceived as minority than in proportion White to be perceived as White. Again, the threshold for being perceived as White was higher for Black White than for Asian White targets. An independent categorization task in Experiment 3B further confirmed the rule of hypodescent and variation in it that reflected the current racial hierarchy in the United States. These results documenting biases in the social categorization and perception of biracials have implications for resistance to change in the American racial hierarchy.

Microbial fuel cells (MFC) emerge as an ecofriendly technology able to harvest energy and remove pollutants at the same time, however high internal resistance is a key problem limiting their operating performance and practical application. In this work, a novel continuous up-flow MFC was designed and fed solely using PW under different flowrates. Effects of the different flowrates (0 mL/s, 0.2 mL/s, 0.4 mL/s, and 0.6 mL/s) in power production performance and pollutants removal were analyzed. Our results demonstrated the removal efficiency of all the pollutants improved when flowrate incremented from 0 to 0.4 mL/s (COD: 96%, TDS: 22%, sulfates: 64%, TPH: 89%), but decreased when 0.6 mL/s was applied. The best power density of 227 mW/m(2) was achieved in a flowrate of 0.4 mL/s. Similar to the pollutant's removal, the power density increased together with the increment of flowrate and decreased when 0.6 mL/s was used. The reason for the performance fluctuation was the decrement of internal resistance from 80 Omega (batch mode) to 20 Omega (0.4 mL/s), and then the sudden increment to 90 Omega for 0.6 mL/s. A flow simulation revealed that until 0.4 mL/s the flow was organized and helped protons to arrive in the membrane faster, but flowrate of 0.6 mL/s created turbulence which prejudiced the transportation of protons incrementing the internal resistance. Microbial community analysis of the biofilm found that Desulfuromonas, Desulfovibrio and Geoalkalibacter were dominant bacteria in charge of pollutant removal and electricity production. This study can be helpful in guiding the use of continuous-flow MFC for PW treatment, and to accelerate the practical application of MFC technology in oil industry.

AB  - The objectives of the study were to explore the prevalence and effects of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) among ischemic stroke patients and to provide a basis for prevention and treatment strategies. A stratified cluster random sampling method was performed, and 689 ischemic stroke patients (over 40 years of age) were enrolled. All of the patients had received a neuropsychological assessment battery to assess cognitive function and self-designed questionnaires to collect relevant information. According to the cognitive status, the patients were divided into two groups, a case group and a control group. The caregivers of the patients were given a questionnaire concerning the awareness of and attitudes toward VCI. In this study, we determined that the prevalence of VCI was 41.8%. Aging, paraventricular white matter lesion (WML), macroangiopathy, high levels of alcohol, a lack of hobbies, and excessive sleep were risk factors for vascular cognitive impairment no dementia (VCIND). A high level of education, manual-work, low level of alcohol use, regular health checks, a vegetable-based diet, and more fruit and milk were protective factors for VCIND. Living alone, hyperlipidemia, transient ischemic attack, a family history of stroke, and brain atrophy were risk factors of vascular dementia (VD). A high educational level, a vegetable-based diet, and tea were protective factors for VD. The general public awareness of VCI was found to be insufficient, and there was a prejudice toward and lack of funding for the care of VCI patients. The prevalence of VCI is high in ischemic stroke patients, and there are different impact factors at different stages. Despite the high prevalence of VCI, the general public awareness is limited. Appropriate prevention measures should be developed to reduce the prevalence of VCI. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: People with schizophrenia face prejudice and discrimination from a number of sources including professionals and families. The degree of stigma perceived and experienced varies across cultures and communities. We aimed to develop a cross-cultural measure of the stigma perceived by people with schizophrenia.
   Method: Items for the scale were developed from qualitative group interviews with people with schizophrenia in six countries. The scale was then applied in face-to-face interviews with 164 participants, 103 of which were repeated after 30 days. Principal Axis Factoring and Promax rotation evaluated the structure of the scale; Horn's parallel combined with bootstrapping determined the number of factors; and intra-class correlation assessed test-retest reliability.
   Results: The final scale has 31 items and four factors: informal social networks, socio-institutional, health professionals and self-stigma. Cronbach's alpha was 0.84 for the Factor 1; 0.81 for Factor 2; 0.74 for Factor 3, and 0.75 for Factor 4. Correlation matrix among factors revealed that most were in the moderate range [0.31-0.49], with the strongest occurring between perception of stigma in the informal network and self-stigma and there was also a weaker correlation between stigma from health professionals and self-stigma. Test-retest reliability was highest for informal networks [ICC 0.76 [0.67 -0.83]] and self-stigma [ICC 0.74 [0.64-0.81]]. There were no significant differences in the scoring due to sex or age. Service users in Argentina had the highest scores in almost all dimensions.
   Conclusions: The MARISTAN stigma scale is a reliable measure of the stigma of schizophrenia and related psychoses across several cultures. A confirmatory factor analysis is needed to assess the stability of its factor structure.

AB  - Introduction: Although men who have sex with men (MSM) in sub-Saharan Africa are at high risk for HIV acquisition, access to and quality of health and HIV services within this population are negatively affected by stigma and capacity within the health sector. A recently developed online MSM training programme (www.marps-africa.org) was shown to contribute to reductions in MSM prejudice among healthcare providers (HCPs) in coastal Kenya. In this study, we used qualitative methods to explore the provision of MSM healthcare services two years post-training in coastal Kenya.
   Methods: From February to July 2014, we held 10 focus group discussions (FGD) with 63 participants, including HCP from 25 facilities, county AIDS coordinators and MSM from local support groups. Participants discussed availability, acceptability and accessibility of HIV healthcare for MSM. HCP also discussed changes in their health service practices after completing the training. FGD were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using Ritchie and Spencer's "framework approach" for qualitative data.
   Results: HCPs described continued improvements in their ability to provide service in a non-stigmatizing way to MSM patients since completing the training programme and expressed comfort engaging MSM patients in care. Four additional recommendations for improving MSMhealthcare services were identified: 1) expanding the reach of MSMsensitivity training across the medical education continuum; 2) establishing guidelines to manage sexually transmitted anal infections; 3) promoting legal and policy reforms to support integration of MSM-appropriate services into healthcare; and 4) including MSM information in national reporting tools for HIV services.
   Conclusions: Positive impacts of this sensitivity and skills training programme were reflected in HCP attitudes two years postintervention. Scaling-up of efforts will rely on continued policies to include MSM in healthcare programmes to reduce stigma in health settings and guidelines for MSM STI service delivery.

AB  - Melanoma skin cancer is one of the most common diseases in the world. It is essential to diagnose melanoma at an early stage. Visual inspection during the medical examination of skin lesions is not a simple task, as there is a similarity between lesions. Also, medical experience and disposition can result in inaccurate diagnoses. Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) have helped to create effective health systems. Doctors can use them anywhere, with the guarantee that more people can be diagnosed without prejudice to subjective factors. Transfer Learning and Deep Learning are increasingly significant in the clinical diagnosis of different diseases. This work proposes the use of Transfer Learning and Deep Learning in an IoT system to assist doctors in the diagnosis of common skin lesions, typical nevi, and melanoma. This work uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as resource extractors. The CNN models used were: Visual Geometry Group (VGG), Inception, Residual Networks (ResNet), Inception-ResNet, Extreme Inception (Xception), MobileNet, Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), and Neural Architecture Search Network (NASNet). For the classification of injuries, the Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Perceptron Multilayer (MLP), and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers are used. This study used two datasets: the first provided by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) at the International Biomedical Imaging Symposium (ISBI); the second is PH2. For ISBI-ISIC, this study examined lesions between nevi and melanomas. In PH2, this work analyzed the diagnosis based on lesions of common nevus, atypical nevi, and melanomas. The DenseNet201 extraction model, combined with the KNN classifier achieved an accuracy of 96.805% for the ISBI-ISIC dataset and 93.167% for the PH2. Thus, an approach focused on the IoT system is reliable and efficient for doctors who assist in the diagnosis of skin lesions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Almost six decades of research have consistently demonstrated that intergroup contact is one of the most powerful ways of improving intergroup attitudes. At least two important limitations, however, still compel researchers to continue work in this area: the issue of long-term effects of contact, and the processes underlying such effects. This report makes a theoretical and empirical contribution with regard to these two aspects introducing a new mediator of the effects of contact: verification of qualities of typical ingroup members that may or may not characterize individual group members (e. g. verification of ingroup identities). One hundred and forty-two high school students participated in a two-wave longitudinal study with 12 weeks' lag in Spain. Cross-sectional and longitudinal mediational analyses using multiple imputation data showed that intergroup contact improves general outgroup evaluation through increasing verification of ingroup identities. This research demonstrates the relevance of considering verification of ingroup identity as a mediator for the positive effects of intergroup contact.

AB  - Background Effective screening can prevent cervical cancer, but many women choose not to attend their screening tests. Objective This study aimed to investigate behavioural influences on cervical screening participation using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and COM-B models of behaviour change. Design A qualitative study and semistructured phone interviews were conducted with women invited for routine screening tests within the national cervical screening programme in Ireland. Setting and Participants Forty-eight women aged 25-65 years were recruited from the national screening register. Results Seven core themes were identified that mapped to three COM-B components and 11 TDF domains: (1) knowledge of cervical cancer and screening, (2) coping with smear tests, (3) competing motivational processes-automatic and reflective, (4) cognitive resources, (5) role of social support, (6) environmental influences and (7) perceputal and practical influences. A range of knowledge about screening, perceived risk of cervical cancer and human papillomavirus infection was evident. Factors that influenced screening behaviours may be hierarchical-some were assigned greater importance than others. Positive screening behaviours were linked to autonomous motivation. Deficits in physical and psychological capability (inadequate coping skills) were barriers to screening, while physical and social opportunity (e.g. healthcare professional 'champions') could facilitate participation. Older women raised age-related issues (e.g. screening no longer necessary) and had more negative attitudes to screening, while younger women identified practical barriers. Conclusions This study provides insight into screening participation and will aid development of theoretically informed interventions to increase uptake. Patient or Public Contribution Women invited for screening tests through the national screening programme were interviewed. A Public & Patient Involvement (PPI) Panel, established to provide input into all CERVIVA research projects, advised the research team on recruitment materials and were given the opportunity to review and comment on the interview topic guide. This panel is made up of six women with various cervical screening histories and experiences.

AB  - Background
   Fibromyalgia (FM) is defined as a widely distributed pain. While many rheumatologists and pain physicians have considered it to be a pain disorder, psychiatry, psychology, and general medicine have deemed it to be a syndrome (FMS) or psychosomatic disorder. The lack of concrete structural and/or pathological evidence has made patients suffer prejudice that FMS is a medically unexplained symptom, implying inauthenticity. Furthermore, FMS often exhibits comorbidity with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or spondyloarthritis (SpA), both of which show similar indications. In this study, disease specific biomarkers were sought in blood samples from patients to facilitate objective diagnoses of FMS, and distinguish it from RA and SpA.
   Methods
   Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients and healthy donors (HD) were subjected to multicolor flow cytometric analysis. The percentage of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in PBMCs and the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of cell surface antigen expression in MAIT cells were analyzed.
   Results
   There was a decrease in the MAIT cell population in FMS, RA, and SpA compared with HD. Among the cell surface antigens in MAIT cells, three chemokine receptors, CCR4, CCR7, and CXCR1, a natural killer (NK) receptor, NKp80, a signaling lymphocyte associated molecule (SLAM) family, CD150, a degrunulation marker, CD107a, and a coreceptor, CD8 beta emerged as potential biomarkers for FMS to distinguish from HD. Additionally, a memory marker, CD44 and an inflammatory chemokine receptor, CXCR1 appeared possible markers for RA, while a homeostatic chemokine receptor, CXCR4 deserved for SpA to differentiate from FMS. Furthermore, the drug treatment interruption resulted in alternation of the expression of CCR4, CCR5, CXCR4, CD27, CD28, inducible costimulatory molecule (ICOS), CD127 (IL-7 receptor alpha), CD94, NKp80, an activation marker, CD69, an integrin family member, CD49d, and a dipeptidase, CD26, in FMS.
   Conclusions
   Combined with the currently available diagnostic procedures and criteria, analysis of MAIT cells offers a more objective standard for the diagnosis of FMS, RA, and SpA, which exhibit multifaceted and confusingly similar clinical manifestations.

AB  - The minority stress model posits that stigmatized identities expose sexual minority individuals to chronic stressors that contribute to health disparities, but that individual-level resources may mitigate psychological distress. Sexual minority adolescents experience one such stressor, bullying victimization, at higher rates than heterosexual peers. Whereas negative consequences of sexual identity-based bullying are well documented, potential positive outcomes are not well understood. The present work examined hypothesized pathways to posttraumatic growth (PTG)-positive psychological changes stemming from trauma-in sexual minority adults following adolescent bullying experiences. We predicted that attributing bullying to one's sexual identity, as opposed to other factors (e.g., weight/appearance, personality), would exacerbate perceived bullying severity but, in turn, enhance PTG. We also predicted that outness about sexual identity would enhance social support and, in turn, facilitate PTG. The hypothesized conceptual model was tested in two samples of sexual minority adults who had experienced bullying during adolescence (Sample 1: Community Sample [N= 139]; Sample 2: National Online Sample [N= 298]), using structural equation modeling with Bayesian estimation. Mediation hypotheses were tested using the PROCESS v3.4 macro. Participants reported their adolescent experiences with bullying, attributions for bullying, outness, social support, and PTG as a result of adolescent bullying experiences, in addition to demographics. Supporting the hypothesized model, in both samples, attributions to sexual identity-based bullying directly and indirectly (via bullying severity) predicted greater PTG, and outness predicted greater PTG through proximal impact on social support. This research underscores the importance of supportive responses to individuals who disclose sexual minority identities and of (re)framing attributions about bullying to facilitate growth.

AB  - BackgroundHIV/AIDS has emerged as a serious public health issue across the globe, and particularly in developing countries. Comprehensive knowledge and positive attitudes are cornerstones for the prevention, control and treatment of HIV/AIDS. However, there are various misconceptions associated with HIV/AIDS transmission, which lead to negative attitudes towards people living with AIDS. The present study aims to explore the effects of these determinants, related to socio-demographic characteristics and autonomy, on women's overall knowledge and attitudes regarding HIV/AIDS in Pakistan.MethodsSecondary data analysis was carried out using the national representative dataset of the 2012-13 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey. A series of questions related to HIV/AIDS was asked of 13,558 ever-married women aged 15-49years to assess respondents' knowledge regarding modes of HIV/AIDS transmission and preventative measures, as well as their attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were used to identify associations with socio-demographic and autonomy-related variables. Furthermore, bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between multiple factors and overall HIV/AIDS knowledge as well as attitudes towards people living with AIDS.ResultsThe results show that only 42% of Pakistani women have heard about HIV/AIDS. Amongst these women, the majority (68%) have good overall knowledge of HIV/AIDS and more than 55% have positive attitudes towards people living with AIDS. Furthermore, women residing in urban areas, having at least secondary-level education, with high autonomy, belonging to the richest wealth quintile and having exposure to mass media had high overall knowledge and positive attitudes towards people living with AIDS.ConclusionThe findings of this research support the relevance of women's autonomy, education and exposure to mass media, particularly in rural areas of Pakistan, to address the lack of knowledge and eliminate various myths and stigmatisation of people living with HIV/AIDS. Furthermore, it reveals a need to increase focused and targeted interventions to enhance women's knowledge and positive attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS. In this regard, the media can play a proactive role to gauge wider audience in creating awareness and eradicating the myths and misconceptions regarding HIV/AIDS.

AB  - BackgroundWhile trust in physicians has been rigorously investigated regarding its concept, measurement, and factors, the studies have mainly focused on the attributes of the physicians. This approach can lead to a limited understanding of trust in physicians as trust is based on the relationship, an interaction of both parties: patients and physicians. This study aimed to investigate the factors for trust in physicians among the Koreans by focusing on patients' traits which are related to their subjective perceptions.MethodsA web-based survey was conducted between August and September 2016 among 1000 Korean adults aged 18 to 59years. Survey participants were selected by a proportionate quota sampling based on age, sex and place of residence. The t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to examine the difference in trust in physicians among the different groups in each variable of patient characteristics. An ordinal logistic regression model was employed to examine the association between trust in physicians and patient attributes.ResultsNegative health-related traits, such as stress and low self-rated health, were likely to lower trust in physicians, and women were less likely to trust physicians. The negative attitudes toward the current health care system were strongly associated with low trust in physicians. Meanwhile, recent experience of hospitalization or outpatient visit was positively associated with trust in physicians, and experience of not being able to use health facilities showed no significant association. These results suggest that trust in physicians is more likely to be lowered by negative perception than by the objective conditions or experience.ConclusionIn investigating the factors for trust in physicians, the patients' predispositions, which make them less likely to trust physicians, should be considered. The attributes of the patients in Korea, which could negatively affect trust in physicians, need to be investigated in consideration of the recent changes in patient-physician relationships and the medical environment in Korea.

AB  - Background: In recent years, there has been increased recognition of the need to integrate mental health services into routine tuberculosis (TB) care. For successful integration, policymakers need to first understand the practices of TB health workers in the management of mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, and psychological distress, and use this to decide how best mental health services could be delivered in tandem with TB services. In this qualitative study we aimed to understand how TB health workers and other stakeholders viewed mental health conditions linked to TB and how they screened and treated these in their patients.
   Methods: The study draws on qualitative data collected in 2018 as part of the Tuberculosis Reduction through Expanded Antiretroviral Treatment and Screening for active TB trial (TREATS), conducted in eight urban communities in Zambia. Data were collected through 17 focus group discussions with local health committee members (n = 96) and TB stakeholders (n =57) present in the communities. Further in-depth interviews were held with key TB health workers (n = 9). Thematic analysis was conducted.
   Results: TB stakeholders and health workers had an inadequate understanding of mental health and commonly described mental health conditions among TB patients by using stigmatizing terminology and overtones, for example "madness; which often implied a characterological flaw rather an actual illness. Psychological distress was also described as"overthinking' which participants attributed to psychosocial stressors, and was not perceived as a condition that would benefit from mental health intervention. There were no standard screening and treatment options for mental health conditions in TB patients and most TB health workers had no mental health training. TB Stakeholders and health workers understood the negative implications of mental health conditions on TB treatment adherence and overall wellbeing for TB patients.
   Conclusions: TB stakeholders and health workers in Zambia have a complex conceptualisation of mental health and illness, that does not support the mental health needs ofTB patients. The integration of mental health training in TB services could be beneficial and shift negative attitudes about mental health. Further,TB patients should be screened for mental health conditions and offered treatment.

AB  - The age-friendly regeneration of urban settlements has been promoted in China to meet older people's demand for "aging in place". However, there are some contradictions among stakeholders in the decision making, hindering the regeneration process. Therefore, after identifying the stakeholders and their contradictions and clarifying their benefits and strategies, this paper established an evolutionary game model of the local government, investors and residents and then explored the stable strategy set of the evolutionary game of stakeholders. A case simulation method was used to test the theoretical results. This paper found the incentive measures that improve the efficiency of the decision making regarding the age-friendly regeneration of urban settlements. This paper also found that under limited conditions, the only stable strategy set of the stakeholder game was the local government, investors and residents implementing active intervention, coordinating opinions and agreeing on benefits strategies, respectively. The evolutionary sequence of the stable strategy set is "local government -> investors -> residents", which was very important to the application of incentive measures and the proposal of policy implications and suggestions. The effective incentive measures to improve the age-friendly regeneration decision-making efficiency included the following: direct subsidies, indirect subsidies and direct punishment for investors and passive compensation and sharing coefficient optimization for residents. Some policy implications and suggestions for improving decision-making efficiency and promoting the age-friendly regeneration of urban settlements in China are proposed in this paper. The local government can appropriately increase direct and indirect incentives and apply moderate punishment. It is very important that the local government pays attention to the design and operating principles of incentive measures. Otherwise, the wrong design and operation might lead to the failure of incentive measures. The higher-level government should supervise the local government carefully and propose relevant policies and regulations to clearly punish the negative attitudes of the local government. Investors can share more incremental income with residents to promote the development of corporations and the recognition of the local government and residents. Residents should make a good balance of advantages and disadvantages in the decision-making of age-friendly regeneration.

AB  - Purpose The attitudes of healthcare workers toward COVID-19 vaccines ensure that health services are able to run without interruption and potentially have a role in the messaging about vaccination that they convey to the public. Hence, healthcare workers' attitudes ultimately have a significant role in controlling the pandemic. This study aimed to qualitatively investigate the attitudes of healthcare workers in Turkey in relation to COVID-19 vaccines. Methods The study used the phenomenological approach. The sample consisted of 36 healthcare workers who were employed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected online using focus group interviews. A total of four focus group interviews were conducted. Findings Following analysis of the data, the attitudes of healthcare workers in Turkey toward the COVID-19 vaccine were divided into three themes: "influencing factors," "priority group" and "trust." Conclusions Vaccination was found to create negative emotions among some of the healthcare workers. Their opinions about the COVID-19 vaccines were affected by the negative emotions and burnout they experienced during the pandemic. In addition, they saw the vaccination process as impacted by contraindications and uncertainty about the duration of the protection, the balance of the benefits and harm of the vaccines, and by vaccine myths and prejudices about the country where the vaccine was developed. Healthcare professionals expressed the need for trust to be established in the whole vaccination process. They suggested that different vaccine options should be offered, that the appointment and process notification system for vaccination should be improved, that evidence-based information about vaccines should be provided and that a safe environment should be created. Practice Implications Vaccine hesitancy can be addressed by careful attention to the application of vaccination programs, correct and effective use of social media, transparent, and precise management of political processes, and the provision of evidence-based information about the vaccines.

AB  - Background: HIV prevention is needed among people who use drugs (PWUD) due to mixing sex and drugs, selling/trading sex, and/or injecting drugs. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an extremely effective biomedical HIV prevention strategy, but uptake remains low among communities most in need of HIV prevention, including PWUD. Previous studies have found that providers are less willing to prescribe PrEP to PWUD, yet PWUD express high levels of PrEP acceptance. More research is needed to understand how people who provide substance use treatment services think about PrEP to maximize this biomedical prevention strategy. Methods: The study conducted semistructured interviews with 29 staff members in two methadone clinic settings in urban northern New Jersey. Staff members included medical providers, methadone counselors, intake coordinators, front desk staff, lab technicians, security guards, and administrative/leadership personnel. Results: All staff recognized the need for HIV prevention among their patient populations, but most were either unaware of PrEP or unfamiliar with its purpose and how it works. Medical providers were more likely to have some PrEP knowledge in comparison to counselors and other staff, but the former largely did not have in-depth knowledge. Among those familiar with PrEP, many confused PrEP with HIV medication, as Truvada was the only FDA-approved PrEP at the time of the study. About half of participants expressed clear support for PrEP, while the other half expressed mixed or negative attitudes related to HIV, sexual behavior, and mistrust of the medication. Both the positive and negative perceptions entailed stigmatizing elements. Recommendations: Due to patients' frequent interactions with non-medical staff (e.g., front desk staff, lab technicians, etc.), all staff, not only medical personnel, should be aware of PrEP and comfortable discussing it to foster well-informed, nonjudgmental conversations about HIV prevention with patients. PrEP education should specifically address HIV and sexual-related stigma, as even positive perceptions of PrEP may entail stigmatizing elements.

AB  - BackgroundAgeism is a global challenge, which leads to a range of adverse outcomes for elderly people worldwide, which maybe more severe among urban older adults in a competitive society. However, how self-perceived ageism influences the quality of life in a sample of urban older adults remains inconclusive. ObjectivesThe current study aims to assess the status of self-perceived stigma among urban Chinese older adults, identify its relationship with quality of life, and further explore whether both attitude toward own aging and traditionality moderate this relationship. Materials and MethodsPrimary data were collected through cross-sectional surveys among urban older adults in three provinces of China from October 2019 to December 2020. A total of 764 urban older adults were valid participants (effective response rate = 81.28%) and completed questionnaires via anonymous face-to-face interviews. Socio-demographic factors, self-perceived stigma, attitude toward own aging, traditionality, and quality of life were assessed using questionnaires that included the Self-perceived Stigma, Attitude Toward Own Aging, Traditionality, and SF-8 Scales. ResultsFor urban Chinese older adults, the average score of self-perceived stigma was 2.041 +/- 0.726. Self-perceived stigma (beta = -0.391, p < 0.05) and attitude toward own aging (beta = -0.211, p < 0.05) both influenced quality of life. Additionally, attitude toward own aging (beta = -0.530, p < 0.05) and traditionality (beta = -0.525, p < 0.05) moderated the association between self-perceived stigma and quality of life. Simple slope analysis revealed that when the level of negative attitude toward own aging and traditionality was higher, the strength of the influence of self-perceived stigma on quality of life was stronger. ConclusionUrban Chinese older adults were aware of the self-perceived stigma, which contributes to decreased quality of life. Attitude toward own aging and traditionality could moderate the association between self-perceived stigma and quality of life. When negative attitudes toward own aging and traditionality are higher, self-perceived stigma has a greater effect on the quality of life. More interventions related to relieving self-perceived stigma, traditionality, and negative attitude toward own aging should be considered to build a new modern society that emphasizes health, friendliness, well-being, and dignity for all ages.

AB  - Background: Epidemiological studies show disparities in the provision of physical health-care for people with severe mental illness. This observation includes countries with universal health insurance. However, there is limited in-depth data regarding the barriers preventing equality of physical health-care provision for this population. This study applied the capabilities approach to examine the interface between general practitioners and patients with severe mental illness. The capabilities approach provides a framework for health status which conceptualizes the internal and external factors relating to the available options (capabilities) and subsequent health outcomes (functioning).
   Methods: Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 10 general practitioners and 15 patients with severe mental illness, and then thematically analyzed.
   Results: We identified factors manifesting across three levels: personal, relational-societal, and organizational. At the personal level, the utilization of physical health services was impaired by the exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms. At the relational level, both patients and physicians described the importance of a long-term and trusting relationship, and provided examples demonstrating the implications of relational ruptures. Finally, two structural-level impediments were described by the physicians: the absence of continuous monitoring of patients with severe mental illness, and the shortfall in psychosocial interventions.
   Conclusion: The capability approach facilitated the identification of barriers preventing equitable health-care provision for patients with severe mental illness. Based on our findings, we propose a number of practical suggestions to improve physical health-care for this population: 1. A proactive approach in monitoring patients' health status and utilization of services. 2. Acknowledgment of people with severe mental illness as a vulnerable population at risk, that need increased time for physician-patient consultations. 3. Training and support for general practitioners. 4. Increase collaboration between general practitioners and mental-health professionals. 5. Educational programs for health professionals to reduce prejudice against people with severe mental illness.

AB  - Background:
   Women seldom reach the highest leadership positions in academic plastic surgery. Contributing factors include lack of female role models/mentors and lack of gender diversity. Studies show that female role models and mentors are critical for recruiting and retaining female surgeons and that gender diversity within organizations more strongly influences women's career choices. The authors therefore sought to determine the current gender diversity of academic plastic surgery programs and investigate influences of gender and leadership on program gender composition.
   Methods:
   A cross-sectional study of U.S. plastic surgery residency programs was performed in December of 2018. Genders of the leadership were collected, including medical school dean, department of surgery chair, department/division of plastic surgery chair/chief, plastic surgery program director, plastic surgery faculty, and plastic surgery residents. Gender relationships among these groups were analyzed.
   Results:
   Ninety-nine residency programs were identified (79 integrated with or without independent and 20 independent). Women represented a smaller proportion of academic plastic surgeons in more senior positions (38 percent residents, 20 percent faculty, 13 percent program directors, and 8 percent chairs). Plastic surgery chair gender was significantly correlated with program director gender, and plastic surgery faculty gender was significantly associated with plastic surgery resident gender. Although not statistically significant, female plastic surgery chair gender was associated with a 45 percent relative increase in female plastic surgery residents.
   Conclusions:
   Women in leadership and gender diversity influence the composition of academic plastic surgery programs. Gender disparity exists at all levels, worsening up the academic ladder. Recruitment, retention, and promotion of women is critical, as such diversity is required for continued progress in innovation and problem-solving within plastic surgery.

AB  - Transgender (trans) women are at higher risk of sexual violence than cisgender women, with trans women of color reported to be at highest risk. This study examined subjective experiences of sexual violence for 31 trans women of color living in Australia, average age 29 (range 18-54), through in-depth interviews. An additional photovoice activity and follow-up interviews were completed by 19 women. Data were analyzed through thematic analysis and feminist intersectionality theory, identifying the following themes. The first theme, "'A sexually tinged violation of boundaries': Defining sexual violence," examined women's definition of sexual violence, including staring and verbal abuse, nonconsensual touching and sexual assault, in both public and private contexts. The second theme, "'Crossing people's boundaries': Sexual harassment in the public domain," examined the frequent sexual harassment women experienced in their daily lives. This included the subtheme, "A hostile gaze: Public staring and 'weird looks'" and "Mockery and transphobic abuse: Verbal abuse is sexual violence." The third theme, "'Crossing bodily boundaries': Experiences of sexual assault," included the subthemes "'Unwanted sexual touch': Groping and forced sex by strangers," "Danger in relationships: Sexual assault and manipulation," "Sexual violence in the context of sex work," and "'We're turned into something we're not': Fetishization and the sexual other." The poor health outcomes experienced by many trans women are closely associated with their exposure to sexual violence and the social inequities and transphobia to which they are subjected. Trans women of color may experience additional prejudice and discrimination due to the intersection of gender, sexuality, race, and social class. Our research suggests that understanding these intersectionalities is integral in understanding the sexual violence experiences of trans women of color.

AB  - Background: As in many fragile and post-conflict countries, South Africa's social contract has formally changed from authoritarianism to democracy, yet access to services, including health care, remains inequitable and contested. We examine access barriers to quality health services and draw on social contract theory to explore ways in which a post-apartheid health care contract is narrated, practiced and negotiated by patients and providers. We consider implications for conceptualizing and promoting more inclusive, equitable health services in a post-conflict setting.
   Methods: Using in-depth interviews with 45 patients and 67 providers, and field observations from twelve health facilities in one rural and two urban sub-districts, we explore access narratives of those seeking and delivering - negotiating - maternal health, tuberculosis and antiretroviral services in South Africa.
   Results: Although South Africa's right to access to health care is constitutionally guaranteed, in practice, a post-apartheid health care contract is not automatically or unconditionally inclusive. Access barriers, including poverty, an under-resourced, hierarchical health system, the nature of illness and treatment, and negative attitudes and actions, create conditions for insecure or adverse incorporation into this contract, or even exclusion (sometimes temporary) from health care services. Such barriers are exacerbated by differences in the expectations that patients and providers have of each other and the contract, leading to differing, potentially conflicting, identities of inclusion and exclusion: defaulting versus suffering patients, uncaring versus overstretched providers. Conversely, caring, respectful communication, individual acts of kindness, and institutional flexibility and leadership may mitigate key access barriers and limit threats to the contract, fostering more positive forms of inclusion and facilitating easier access to health care.
   Conclusions: Building health in fragile and post-conflict societies requires the negotiation of a new social contract. Surfacing and engaging with differences in patient and provider expectations of this contract may contribute to more acceptable, accessible health care services. Additionally, the health system is well positioned to highlight and connect the political economy, institutions and social relationships that create and sustain identities of exclusion and inclusion - (re)politicise suffering - and co-ordinate and lead intersectoral action for overcoming affordability and availability barriers to inclusive and equitable health care services.

AB  - Introduction: Limited evidence suggests that transgender individuals smoke at significantly higher rates than the general population. We aimed to determine whether structural or everyday discrimination experiences predict smoking behavior among transgender individuals when sociodemographic, health, and gender-specific factors were controlled.
   Methods: Data from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (N = 4781), a cross-sectional online and paper survey distributed to organizations serving the transgender community, were analyzed in order to determine the association between current smoking and discrimination experiences and other potential predictors. Logistic regression models were used to establish factors that predict smoking.
   Results: Participants reported experiencing both structural (80.4%) and everyday (65.9%) discrimination. Multivariate analyses showed that participants who reported attending some college, graduating college, or having a graduate degree were less likely to smoke compared to those with a high school degree or less. Uninsured participants were more likely to report smoking compared to those with private insurance. Those who used alcohol or drugs for coping were also more likely to smoke. Participants whose IDs and records listed their preferred gender were less likely to smoke (OR = 0.84); those who had experienced structural discrimination were more like to report smoking (OR = 1.65).
   Conclusions: Further research is needed in order to explore the relationship between smoking and legal transition among transgender individuals. Strategies to prevent smoking and encourage cessation among this vulnerable population are also needed. In addition, comprehensive collection of gender identity data in the context of national surveys, tobacco-related research, and clinical settings is sorely needed.
   Implications: This study establishes a link between experiences of structural discrimination among transgender individuals and smoking status.

AB  - Private well users are responsible for managing and maintaining the quality of their drinking water source. Previous studies in Canada have reported low testing rates among well users, a cornerstone of well stewardship behaviours that can prevent the consumption of contaminated groundwater. To improve well stewardship, it is important to understand the interactions between, and the impacts of, various factors that may influence behaviours. Accordingly, the objective of the current study was to investigate the impact of socio-demographics, property characteristics, and experiences with well construction and acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) (i.e., previous experiences) on levels of awareness, attitudes, risk perceptions, and beliefs (i.e., risk domains) among private well users in Ontario. A link to a province-wide online survey was circulated between May and August 2018 and novel "risk domain" scoring protocols were developed to classify and summarize response data. The survey was undertaken by 1228 respondents, of which 1030 completed the survey in full Results indicate a low level of waterborne pathogen awareness, with 50.8% of respondents unaware of any groundwater associated pathogens. Respondents' geographic location, gender, and well type were significantly associated with well users' attitudes and perceptions of risk regarding their personal well water supply and the quality and quantity of local groundwater sources. Higher levels of awareness and lower risk perception scores (i.e., lower perceptions of risk) were associated with residential presence during well construction (p < 0.001 and p = 0.017, respectively). Previous case(s) of AGI within the respondent's household were significantly associated with negative attitudes towards their well water (p < 0.001) and higher risk perception scores (p = 0.025) with respect to the quantity of local groundwater sources. Results may be used to identify critical experiential control points (e.g., during well construction or after a physician confirmed AGI diagnosis) and develop improved risk management and communication strategies aimed at private well users.

AB  - Prejudices against palliative care are a potential barrier to quality end-of-life care. There have been few large-scale community-wide interventions to distribute appropriate information about palliative care, and no studies have investigated their impact on cancer patients, their families, and the general public. Thus, we conducted a 3-year community intervention and evaluated the effects of distributing such information at the community level, and explored associations among levels of exposure, perceptions, knowledge, and the sense of security achieved.
   Over a period of 3 years, we provided flyers, booklets, posters, and public lectures about palliative care in four regions of Japan, and carried out pre- and post-intervention surveys with repeated cross-sectional samplings of cancer patients (pre 859, post 857), bereaved family members (1110, 1137), and the general public (3984, 1435). The levels of exposure to the provided information were measured by a multiple-choice questionnaire after intervention. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to estimate multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for perceptions of palliative care, knowledge about opioids, and sense of security among the exposure groups.
   Overall perceptions of palliative care, opioids, and receiving care at home improved significantly among the general public and families, but not among the patients at the community level. However, multiple regression revealed that patients of extensive exposure category had significantly more positive perceptions of palliative care to those of non-exposure category (p = 0.02). The sense of security regarding cancer care of all patients, family members, and the general public improved. Among others, the respondents who reported extensive exposure in the general public and family members scored significantly higher sense of security.
   Our findings indicate that providing palliative care information via small media and lectures in the community is effective in improving perceptions of palliative care and knowledge about opioids among the community dwellers, especially for caregivers of the patients. The acquisition of adequate knowledge about palliative care from various information sources may improve people's sense of security regarding cancer.

AB  - Growth of Internet gambling has fuelled concerns about its contribution to gambling problems. However, most online gamblers also gamble on land-based forms, which may be the source of problems for some. Studies therefore need to identify the problematic mode of gambling (online or offline) to identify those with an online gambling problem. Identifying most problematic form of online gambling (e.g., EGMs, race betting, sports betting) would also enable a more accurate examination of gambling problems attributable to a specific online gambling form. This study pursued this approach, aiming to: (1) determine demographic, behavioral and psychological risk factors for gambling problems on online EGMs, online sports betting and online race betting; (2) compare the characteristics of problematic online gamblers on each of these online forms. An online survey of 4,594 Australian gamblers measured gambling behavior, most problematic mode and form of gambling, gambling attitudes, psychological distress, substance use, help-seeking, demographics and problem gambling status. Problem/moderate risk gamblers nominating an online mode of gambling as their most problematic, and identifying EGMs (n = 98), race betting (n = 291) or sports betting (n = 181) as their most problematic gambling form, were compared to non-problem/low risk gamblers who had gambled online on these forms in the previous 12 months (n = 64, 1145 and 1213 respectively), using bivariate analyses and then logistic regressions. Problem/moderate risk gamblers on each of these online forms were then compared. Risk factors for online EGM gambling were: more frequent play on online EGMs, substance use when gambling, and higher psychological distress. Risk factors for online sports betting were being male, younger, lower income, born outside of Australia, speaking a language other than English, more frequent sports betting, higher psychological distress, and more negative attitudes toward gambling. Risk factors for online race betting comprised being male, younger, speaking a language other than English, more frequent race betting, engaging in more gambling forms, self-reporting as semi-professional/professional gambler, illicit drug use whilst gambling, and more negative attitude toward gambling. These findings can inform improved interventions tailored to the specific characteristics of high risk gamblers on each of these online activities.

AB  - Aim To identify healthcare professionals' attitudes toward the coronavirus vaccine. Background Controlling the coronavirus pandemic depends on achieving a high level of herd immunity. Accordingly, it is very important that healthcare professionals become role models by displaying positive attitudes toward vaccination. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted between March and April 2021 with a total of 309 healthcare professionals. Data were collected via an online surveys using an "Introductory Information Form" and "Attitudes Towards the COVID-19 Vaccine Scale." One-way variance analysis and Bonferroni correction were used for the comparison of nonnormally distributed quantitative variables between more than two groups. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn-Bonferroni test were used to compare non-normally distributed quantitative variables between more than two groups. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between the quantitative variables. Results Regarding the healthcare professionals' attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine, the average score of positive attitudes was 3.52 +/- 0.87, and the average score of negative attitudes was 3.39 +/- 0.68. A statistically significant weak relationship was found between the ages of the participants and the average score of their positive attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine. The negative attitude score of the individuals who wanted to get the coronavirus vaccine was significantly higher than those who were undecided or did not want to get the vaccine. Conclusions Healthcare professionals completely agreed with the opinion "I would persuade everyone around me to get the coronavirus vaccine," and completely disagreed with the opinion "I believe that they will inject microchips to people with the coronavirus vaccine." Healthcare professionals have positive attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19-vaccinated participants' positive and negative attitude scores were found higher than those who were not vaccinated. Implications for nursing and health policy Supportive social activities should be organized in the public sense so that healthcare professionals act as a role model by displaying positive attitudes toward vaccination.

AB  - Background: Cervical cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among women in Uganda, often due to late disease diagnosis. Early screening for the cancer has been shown to be the most effective measure against the disease. Studies conducted elsewhere have reported the lack of awareness and negative attitudes towards cervical cancer as barriers to early screening. This study assessed the knowledge and attitudes of Ugandan women about cervical cancer prevention with the aim of informing prevention and control interventions.
   Methods: This study was conducted in Bugiri and Mayuge districts in eastern Uganda. It was a cross-sectional community based survey and collected data by means of a questionnaire. A total of 900 women aged 25-49 years participated in the study. Women's knowledge and attitudes towards cervical cancer prevention were assessed and scored. Data were analysed using STATA 12.0 software. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to establish the relationship between knowledge levels and demographic characteristics.
   Results: Most (794; 88.2%) of the respondents had heard about cervical cancer, the majority (557; 70.2%) having received information from radio and 120 (15.1%) from health facilities. Most women (562; 62.4%) knew at least one preventive measure and (743; 82.6%) at least one symptom or sign of the disease. The majority (684; 76.0%) of respondents perceived themselves to be at risk of cervical cancer, a disease most (852; 94.6%) thought to be very severe. Living in peri-urban areas (AOR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.15 - 2.28), urban areas (AOR = 3.64, 95% CI: 2.14 - 6.19), having a higher monthly income (AOR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.37 - 0.68) and having had an HIV test (AOR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.34-2.96) were associated with level of knowledge about cervical cancer prevention.
   Conclusion: Although general knowledge about cervical cancer prevention was relatively high among women, and attitudes mostly encouraging, specific knowledge about screening was low. There were also undesirable perceptions and beliefs regarding cervical cancer among respondents. There is therefore need for more education campaigns to bridge identified knowledge gaps, and scale up of cervical cancer screening services to all women to increase service uptake.

AB  - The present study examined how majority perceptions of intergroup relations afford different contact experiences with immigrant minorities. Majority students attending culturally diverse high schools first completed a survey that measured the extent to which they perceived immigrant minorities as either threatening to the majority or discriminated by the majority. Two weeks later, the same majority students kept a 1-week diary of their contacts with immigrant minorities. As expected, perceived threat at premeasurement was positively associated with situated threat-related appraisals and emotions (e.g., fear) during everyday contacts with immigrant minorities 2-3 weeks later. In contrast, acknowledgment of discrimination at premeasurement was positively associated with perspective taking and enrichment-related appraisals and emotions (e.g., admiration). These findings suggest that generalized threat perceptions can become self-enforcing through repeated threatening contact experiences; but also that an alternative perception of minorities as disrespected by the majority may underlie more positive contact experiences.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the attitudes of undergraduate pharmacy students towards patient safety in six developing countries. Design A cross-sectional study. Setting Participants were enrolled from the participating universities in six countries. Participants Undergraduate pharmacy students from the participating universities in six developing countries (Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, India and Indonesia) were invited to participate in the study between October 2018 and September 2019. Primary outcome Attitudes towards patient safety was measured using 14-item questionnaire that contained five subscales: being quality-improvement focused, internalising errors regardless of harm, value of contextual learning, acceptability of questioning more senior healthcare professionals' behaviour and attitude towards open disclosure. Multiple-linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of positive attitudes towards patient safety. Results A total of 2595 students participated in this study (1044 from Jordan, 514 from Saudi Arabia, 134 from Kuwait, 61 from Qatar, 416 from India and 429 from Indonesia). Overall, the pharmacy students reported a positive attitude towards patient safety with a mean score of 37.4 (SD=7.0) out of 56 (66.8%). The 'being quality-improvement focused' subscale had the highest score, 75.6%. The subscale with the lowest score was 'internalising errors regardless of harm', 49.2%. Female students had significantly better attitudes towards patient safety scores compared with male students (p=0.001). Being at a higher level of study and involvement in or witnessing harm to patients while practising were important predictors of negative attitudes towards patient safety (p<0.001). Conclusion Patient safety content should be covered comprehensively in pharmacy curricula and reinforced in each year of study. This should be more focused on students in their final year of study and who have started their training. This will ensure that the next generation of pharmacists are equipped with the requisite knowledge, core competencies and attitudes to ensure optimal patient safety when they practice.

AB  - Of an estimated 6.8 million households in the United States headed by young adults, aged 19-25, 5 percent receive housing assistance that is funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This research looks for evidence in the 2011 American Housing Survey that the stigma associated with residence in HUD-assisted housing has translated into low self-efficacy and the why try response to becoming economically self-sufficient. In 2011, a majority of these young householders, 58 percent, participated in the labor force, with household median incomes at 96 percent of the poverty line. Forty percent of householders with less than good health or disability participated in the labor force. The vast majority was also parenting. Small families were the norm. An estimated 526,000 children under age 18 lived in assisted housing headed by these young millennials. Of these, 158,000 children were under age 5 and living in households headed by a single adult who was not a labor force participant. Logistic regression was used to find whether there were any statistically significant predictors of labor force participation at the 0.10 level. Good health and no disability of the respondent (OR=3.3, CI=1.5-7.4) and educational attainment of some college (OR=3.2, CI=1.0-10.2) were statistically significant for the entire sample. Each additional adult in the household also increased (OR=1.9) the odds of labor force participation by the household head (CI=.9-3.7). For households headed by a single adult, residence in the Midwest Census Region depressed labor force participation (OR=.32, CI=.10-1.00). We conclude that the discovery of these statistically significant predictors suggests that the stigma of living in assisted housing does not create such low self-efficacy that labor force participation is avoided. Assisted housing reduces the burden on shelters and foster care systems as well as provides a significant safety net for workers who are unable to earn a living wage.

AB  - Evidence remains fundamentally unchanged over the last 30 years that nurses are not sufficiently prepared during their undergraduate education to work with alcohol and other drug (AOD) use. Employing a mixed-methods longitudinal panel design, our study objectives were to (a) explore perceptions among entry level nursing students regarding AOD work and (b) explore whether current alcohol and drug education efforts impact on the perception of AOD by nursing students over time. Two hundred forty-two students were recruited (94% response rate). Most (86%) of the study participants identified AOD training as relevant/extremely relevant to their future practice. After exposure to AOD sessions in the nursing curriculum, there was no significant change to participants' score on either alcohol or drug role security between T1 and T2/T3. However, there was a statistically significant improvement in alcohol therapeutic commitment between T1 and T2/T3 (F(2, 136) = 5.87, p < .01), but not between T2 and T3; conversely, drug therapeutic commitment was significantly higher at T2 but signficantly lower at T3 (F(2, 149) = 254.19, p < .0001). There was no significant difference in alcohol or drug role security between the three nurse training pathways. However, alcohol and drug therapeutic commitment scores at T1 were significantly higher in students taking the mental health field/track (F(2, 160) = 9.45, p < .001, and F(2, 236) = 15.23, p < .0001). Although the positive message is that students recognize the importance of the topic to their future practice, concerns remain regarding the impact and efforts of readiness for practice. Over a 3-year training period, no significant gains were made in increasing students' knowledge and skills, and their training experiences in clinical practice appear to have a negative effect on "therapeutic commitment" influenced by exposure/contact to patients with drug use disorders specifically and less than positive mentoring experiences with qualified nursing staff. How to address these issues is explored including the need to perhaps shift the focus of attention from "negative attitudes" held by students to exploring the barriers and obstacles in upskilling nursing faculty and clinical mentors so that they feel able and willing to teach and be a role model of good practice in this area.

AB  - Background: Facing rising inequities and poorer accessibility of physicians in rural areas, new healthcare delivery structures are being considered to support local healthcare in German communities. To better understand perspectives on and attitudes towards different supplementary models, we examined attitudes among local politicians in the German federal state of Lower Saxony towards the suitability of supplementary care models.
   Methods: As part of a cross-sectional study, we surveyed local politicians in Lower Saxony at the local authority and district levels (n = 449) by mail questionnaire. We asked for an assessment of four potential supplementary healthcare models at the local level: the use of trained medical assistants, patients' buses, mobile physicians' offices, and telemedicine.
   Results: The response rate was 71.0% for mayors (n = 292) and 81.6% (n = 31) for county administrators. In summary, 72.4% of respondents supported the use of trained medical assistants, 48.9% voted for patients' buses, 22.0% for mobile physicians' offices, and 13.9% for telemedicine. Except for telemedicine, the politicians' approval of the supplementary models in rural areas was higher than in urban areas. The assessment regarding the suitability of each model was not significantly connected with indicators of a positively or negatively assessed local healthcare situation. The analyses showed that the use of trained medical assistants was associated with the positive effects of division of labor and potential to relieve physicians. In contrast, there was skepticism about technical support via telemedicine, mostly due to concerns about its unsuitability for elderly people and the potential lower quality of healthcare delivery.
   Conclusion: Local politicians widely accept the use of trained medical assistants, whereas the applicability of technical solutions such as telemedicine is perceived with skepticism. Therefore, the knowledge gap between evidence for and prejudices against telemedicine needs to be addressed more effectively. Reasons for the assessments of the presented models are more likely traceable to personal views than to assessments of the actual estimated local primary care situation.

AB  - Background People who inject drugs (PWID) are a medically and socially vulnerable population with a high incidence of overdose, mental illness, and infections like HIV and hepatitis C. Existing literature describes social and economic correlations to increased health risk, including stigma. Injection drug use stigma has been identified as a major contributor to healthcare disparities for PWID. However, data on this topic, particularly in terms of the interface between enacted, anticipated, and internalized stigma, is still limited. To fill this gap, we examined perspectives from PWID whose stigmatizing experiences impacted their views of the healthcare system and syringe service programs (SSPs) and influenced their decisions regarding future medical care. Methods Semi-structured interviews conducted with 32 self-identified PWID in New York City. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Interview transcripts were coded using a grounded theory approach by three trained coders and key themes were identified as they emerged. Results A total of 25 participants (78.1%) reported at least one instance of stigma related to healthcare system engagement. Twenty-three participants (71.9%) reported some form of enacted stigma with healthcare, 19 participants (59.4%) described anticipated stigma with healthcare, and 20 participants (62.5%) reported positive experiences at SSPs. Participants attributed healthcare stigma to their drug injection use status and overwhelmingly felt distrustful of, and frustrated with, medical providers and other healthcare staff at hospitals and local clinics. PWID did not report internalized stigma, in part due to the availability of non-stigmatizing medical care at SSPs. Conclusions Stigmatizing experiences of PWID in formal healthcare settings contributed to negative attitudes toward seeking healthcare in the future. Many participants describe SSPs as accessible sites to receive high-quality medical care, which may curb the manifestation of internalized stigma derived from negative experiences in the broader healthcare system. Our findings align with those reported in the literature and reveal the potentially important role of SSPs. With the goal of limiting stigmatizing interactions and their consequences on PWID health, we recommend that future research include explorations of mechanisms by which PWID make decisions in stigmatizing healthcare settings, as well as improving medical care availability at SSPs.

AB  - Conflicts between the objectives of agricultural production and conservation are becoming increasingly complex. Of vital importance to the success of conflict interventions is a detailed understanding of how stakeholders react to management interventions as well as the influence of interacting social and political factors.
   Across Europe, goose populations have increased considerably, leading to widespread impacts on agriculture and significant conflicts between different stakeholder groups. We used a novel experimental game to understand farmer preferences regarding the design of goose conflict interventions in Scotland. We specifically examined how three alternative interventions (government financial support for scaring activities, subsidies and agglomeration payments that include bonus payments for adoption by neighbouring farms) affect farmer propensity to support goose conservation interests through reduced shooting and the provision of sacrificial crops. We also examined the links between within-game behaviour and real-life attributes and attitudes of farmers.
   We found that all three interventions were conducive to pro-conservation behaviour in the games. The effects of all three interventions were stronger among farmers who had higher trust towards other community members. Agglomeration payments led to increased provision of sacrificial crops among farmers with negative attitudes towards the current allocation of goose finances in Scotland. Farmers with more positive attitudes towards wildlife tourism were more likely to provide more sacrificial crops, and less likely to shoot in the games.
   Farmers' real-life traits had a statistically significant but marginal impact on the effectiveness of financial payments, such as the number of geese being shot on their own lands, remoteness and crop damage by geese.
   These game results provide evidence for the potential of innovative financial instruments in conflict management and their interactions with social factors such as community trust, equity attitude and real-life shooting levels. Our study highlights the importance of socio-political elements in fostering mutually beneficial outcomes in conservation conflicts in addition to addressing material losses to wildlife. We also show how games can help in addressing conservation conflicts in a wide range of settings.

AB  - Background: Negative attitudes towards insulin are commonly reported by people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and can act as a barrier to timely insulin initiation. The Insulin Treatment Appraisal Scale (ITAS) is a widely used 20-item measure of attitudes towards insulin. While designed for completion by both insulin using and non-insulin using adults with T2DM, its psychometric properties have not been investigated separately for these groups. Furthermore, the total score is routinely reported in preference to the published two-factor structure (negative/positive appraisals). Further psychometric validation of the ITAS is required to examine its properties.
   Methods: The ITAS was completed by a subgroup of 748 Diabetes MILES - Australia study participants with T2DM, who were either insulin using (n = 249; 45% women; mean age = 58 +/- 9 years; mean diabetes duration = 13, SD = 8 years) or non-insulin using (n = 499; 47% women; mean age 57 +/- 9 years; mean diabetes duration 7 +/- 6 years). We replicated the psychometric analyses reported in the ITAS development paper. In addition, we explored factor structure and investigated internal consistency separately for the insulin using and non-insulin using samples.
   Results: Factor analyses supported a two-factor structure with good internal consistency (negative subscale alpha =.90; positive subscale alpha =.69). Scale performance differed slightly in the insulin using and non-insulin using samples, with some items loading inconsistently between groups. A one-factor solution was not supported in either sample, with the positive items and some negative items failing to load adequately. Consistent with prior research, negative appraisals were significantly more common among non-insulin using participants compared to those using insulin (d = 1.04), while the positive subscale score did not discriminate between groups.
   Conclusions: The data supported a two factor structure and the positive subscale did not discriminate between insulin using and non-insulin using participants. As such, we recommend use of the negative subscale score in preference to the ITAS total score, and suggest close attention is paid to the relevance of the positive items in the given population.

AB  - This article analyzes the relationship between the relative position of an ethnic group, as measured by its majority/minority status at a subnational level, and attitudes of its members toward immigrants of different origins. Based on the Russian case, it addresses the question whether the effects of in-group majority status within a region on attitudes toward the general category of immigrants hold regardless of out-group origin and, if not, what may drive this variation. Using data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey of the Higher School of Economics and Bayesian hierarchical structural equation modeling, the study demonstrates that the relative position of an ethnic in-group is of varying importance as a predictor of attitudes toward migrant groups of European versus non-European origin in Russia. A group's majority status within a region proved to play a role in predicting attitudes toward migrants originating from the "south" (encompassing North and South Caucasus; Central Asia; and China, Vietnam, and Korea) but not toward migrants coming from the "west" (Ukraine and Moldova). We draw on arguments related to the source and the level of threat induced by the out-groups, ethnic hierarchies, and group cues to explain this pattern of results.

AB  - Australian health and aged care reforms mandate a wellness and reablement (W&R) approach with services and the workforce needing to adjust their way of working with older people, to actively promote independence and participation in life's activities. Studies exploring the older person's perspective are sparse. This study aims to understand the older person's experience of a W&R approach, supplemented with experiences of staff trained in the approach. The study evaluates a W&R approach implemented across three community-based sites of a large Australian aged care provider. Staff from participating sites underwent training and were asked to use a W&R approach with at least one older person. Eighteen older people aged 65+ were engaged in the 4-month programme. Semi-structured interviews with older people and staff were conducted on completion of the programme. The W&R approach showed variable benefits and experiences of older people related to goal setting and outcomes. Overall, older people were unfamiliar with goal setting or displayed negative attitudes. Negative emotional responses to health decline and ageing, such as apathy, frustration, embarrassment and sense of helplessness, were identified as barriers to goal pursual. In contrast, enabling factors, such as assistive equipment, staff and social connection, triggered positive emotional responses, which acted as protective factors and enhanced goal pursual. Staff knowledge and understanding of the W&R approach also influenced older people's experience and outcomes. These findings recommend a stronger focus on the social and emotional aspects of W&R and co-developing goals in line with the older person's sense of wellbeing. This approach supports the multiple dimensions of W&R and aligns with principles of positive and healthy ageing. Additional training for staff should be provided, with ongoing mentoring and support from W&R champions. Ensuring that goals are meaningful and valuable to individual older people will enhance successful goal pursual and improve outcomes.

AB  - We investigated intercultural competence among immigrant and non-immigrant background adolescents in multiethnic schools in relation to intercultural contact, age, and ethnic identity exploration. The sample included 631 adolescents in Germany (49.4% of immigrant background, 48.2% female), aged 11 to 18 years (M-age = 13.69 years, SDage = 1.83). Intercultural competence was measured using a self-report questionnaire and situational judgment tests capturing the adolescents' interpretation of and reaction to intercultural conflicts. Intercultural contacts and ethnic identity exploration were measured using self-report questionnaires. Results showed that among immigrant and non-immigrant background adolescents, intercultural contact and ethnic identity exploration were positively related to different aspects of intercultural competence. As predicted, self-reported intercultural competence was unrelated to age in both groups, whereas this competence, as measured by the situational judgment tests, increased with age. Thus, learning about others (e.g., by engaging in intercultural contact) and learning about yourself (e.g., by exploring your own ethnic background) are both important for developing pivotal intercultural skills.

AB  - This paper explores the dynamics of change in meaning-making about female genital cutting among migrants from Somalia and Sudan residing in Norway. In both countries, female genital cutting is almost universal, and most women are subjected to the most extensive form - infibulation - which entails the physical closure of the vulva. This closure must later be re-opened, or defibulated, to enable sexual intercourse and childbirth. Defibulation can also ease other negative health consequences of the practice. In Norway, surgical defibulation is provided on demand by the public health services, also beyond the traditional contexts of marriage and childbirth. This study explores experiences and perceptions of premarital defibulation. It explores whether Somali and Sudanese men and women understand defibulation as a purely medical issue or whether their use of the services is also affected by the cultural meaning of infibulation. This study analyses data from in-depth interviews with 36 women and men of Somali and Sudanese origin as well as participant observation conducted in various settings during 2014-2015. It reports that although all of the informants displayed negative attitudes towards infibulation, cultural meanings associated with virginity and virtue constitute a significant barrier to the uptake of premarital defibulation. ResumeCet article examine la dynamique du changement dans la recherche de la signification de la mutilation genitale des femmes (MGF) chez les migrants originaires de la Somalie et du Soudan residant en Norvege. Dans ces deux pays d'origine, la MGF est quasiment universelle et la plupart des femmes sont soumises a sa forme la plus extreme - l'infibulation - qui implique la fermeture de la vulve. Plus tard, la vulve doit etre rouverte, ou defibulee, pour permettre les rapports sexuels et l'accouchement. La defibulation peut egalement avoir d'autres consequences negatives sur la sante. En Norvege, la defibulation chirurgicale est fournie sur demande par les services de sante publique, y compris au-dela des contextes traditionnels du mariage et de l'accouchement. Cette etude explore les experiences et les perceptions de la defibulation pre-maritale. Elle cherche a verifier si les hommes et les femmes originaires de la Somalie et du Soudan percoivent la defibulation comme une notion purement medicale, ou si leur recours aux services est egalement influence par la signification culturelle de l'infibulation. L'etude analyse les donnees provenant d'entretiens en profondeur conduits avec 36 femmes et hommes d'origine somalienne et soudanaise, ainsi que d'une observation participative conduite dans divers environnements entre 2014 et 2015. Elle rapporte que bien que tous les participants aient manifeste des attitudes negatives vis-a-vis de l'infibulation, la signification culturelle de cette pratique associee a la virginite et a la vertu constitue un obstacle important au recours a la defibulation pre-maritale. ResumenEl presente articulo examina las dinamicas de cambio relacionadas con la construccion de significados que provoca la mutilacion genital femenina entre las y los migrantes de Somalia y Sudan residentes en Noruega. En ambos paises africanos, dicha mutilacion es llevada a cabo de manera casi universal; a la mayoria de las mujeres se les practica la modalidad mas radical la infibulacion que implica el cierre fisico de la vulva. Mas adelante, el cierre debe ser reabierto la defibulacion para permitir el acto sexual o el parto.
   Ademas, la defibulacion puede aliviar ciertas consecuencias negativas que esta practica produce en la salud. En Noruega, los servicios de salud publicos realizan la defibulacion quirurgica segun la demanda, incluso en casos no relacionados con el matrimonio o el parto. Este estudio analiza las vivencias y las percepciones que tienen lugar cuando se lleva a cabo la defibulacion premarital. Al respecto, indaga si los hombres y las mujeres somalies y sudaneses perciben la defibulacion como una cuestion exclusivamente medica o si el significado cultural de la infibulacion tambien incide en el uso de los servicios de salud. La presente investigacion analiza la informacion aportada por entrevistas a profundidad realizadas a 36 mujeres y hombres de origen somali y sudanes, asi como por observaciones participativas efectuadas en varios contextos durante 2014 y 2015. Dicha informacion da cuenta de que, aunque todos los informantes expresaron opiniones negativas sobre la infibulacion, su significado cultural asociado a la virginidad y a la virtud constituye una barrera significativa para el uso de la defibulacion premarital.

AB  - Background Clinical pathways (CPs) are intended to standardise and improve care but do not always produce positive outcomes, possibly because they were not adapted to suit the specific context in which they were enacted. This qualitative study aimed to explore staff perspectives of implementation of a CP for routine screening, assessment, referral and management of anxiety and depression (the ADAPT CP) for patients with cancer, focussing on perceived feasibility of the CP and negotiated adaptations made during the implementation phase. Methods The ADAPT CP was implemented in 12 urban and regional oncology services in Australia. Services were randomised to receive core versus enhanced implementation strategies. Core sites received support until implementation commencement and could access progress reports. Enhanced sites received proactive, ongoing support during the 12-month implementation. Purposively selected staff were interviewed prior to implementation (n = 88) and 6 months later, half-way through the implementation period (n = 89). Monthly meetings with lead multi-disciplinary teams at the eight enhanced sites were recorded. Data were thematically analysed. Results Six overarching themes were identified: ADAPT is of high value; timing for introducing the CP and screening is difficult; online screening is challenging; a burden too much; no-one to refer patients to; and micro-logistics are key. While early screening was deemed desirable, diverse barriers meant this was complex, with adaptations made to time and screening location. Online screening prompted by email, seen as time-saving and efficient, also proved unsuccessful in some services, with adaptations made to in-clinic or phone screening, or repeated email reminders. Staff negative attitudes to ADAPT, time constraints, and perceived poor fit of ADAPT to work roles and flows, all impacted implementation, with key tasks often devolving to a few key individuals. Nevertheless, services remained committed to the ADAPT CP, and worked hard to create, review and adapt strategies to address challenges to optimise success. Conclusions This study demonstrates the interactive nature of health service change, with staff actively engaging with, forming views on, and problem-solving adaptations of the ADAPT CP to overcome barriers. Obtaining staff feedback is critical to ensure health service change is sustainable, meaningful and achieves its promise of improving patient outcomes.

AB  - Public Significance Statement This study advances our understanding of sexual minority women subgroups for whom the link between sexism and mental and behavioral health might be more pronounced, such as those who identify as gender minorities or are masculine-presenting. These findings underscore the importance of considering whether sexism (e.g., experiences of traditional gender role stereotyping and prejudice, and unwanted sexually objectifying comments and behavior) may be experienced as incongruent or dysphoric for gender minority or masculine-presenting SMW.
   Gender-based stressors (e.g., sexism) are rooted in hegemonic masculinity, a cultural practice that subordinates women and stems from patriarchal social structures and institutions. Sexism has been increasingly documented as a key driver of mental and behavioral health issues among women, yet prior research has largely focused on heterosexual women. The current study examined associations between sexism and mental health (i.e., psychological distress) and behavioral health (i.e., alcohol- and drug-related consequences) among sexual minority women (SMW). We also examined whether these associations might be more pronounced among SMW who identify as gender minorities (e.g., gender nonbinary, genderqueer) or are masculine-presenting compared to those who identify as cisgender women or are feminine-presenting. Participants included 60 SMW (ages 19-32; 55.0% queer, 43.3% gender minority, 41.7% racial and ethnic minority) who completed self-report measures of sexism, psychological distress, and alcohol- and drug-related consequences. Results indicated that sexism was positively associated with psychological distress, alcohol-related consequences, and drug-related consequences, respectively. In addition, sexism was associated with worse mental and behavioral health outcomes among SMW who identify as gender minorities or are masculine-presenting compared to SMW who identify as cisgender or are feminine-presenting. Findings provide evidence that the health impact of gender-based stressors among SMW may differ based on whether SMW identify as gender minorities and based on the extent to which SMW violate traditional gender norms.

AB  - Public Significance Statement Men who need psychological services for a specific problem are less likely to seek them to the extent that they adhere to traditional masculine norms, hold negative attitudes about seeking psychological help, and experience self-stigma regarding their need for such services. However, if depressed they are more likely to overcome these effects and express intentions to seek counseling. These relationships held for both dominant and minoritized groups of men, based on race, ethnicity, and sexual partner preferences.
   The present study used data from 1,602 men collected online to assess the relationship between men's endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology (TMI) and their intentions to seek psychotherapy, as mediated by attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help and self-stigma of seeking help and moderated by the men's levels of depression and precontemplation. Also assessed was whether the model was conditional on race and ethnicity (comparing White men to men of color) and sexual partner preferences (comparing men who always partnered with women to those who did not). The relationship between TMI and help-seeking intentions was fully mediated through help-seeking attitudes and partially mediated through self-stigma and was moderated by depression. At higher levels of depression, a given level of endorsement of TMI was associated with more favorable attitudes toward seeking help than they were at lower levels of depression. Furthermore, the negative relationship between TMI and help-seeking intentions seen at lower levels of depression (where increases in TMI were associated with reductions in intentions) changed to a positive relationship at higher levels of depression (where increases in TMI were associated with increases in intentions). The mediation moderation model was not conditional on race and ethnicity or sexual partner preferences. An implication for practice is that depression appears to play a key role in limiting or even reversing the negative relationships between TMI and intentions to seek therapy, and that this role applies broadly across the male population, irrespective of race, ethnicity, and sexual partner preferences.

AB  - In 2002, voters in Massachusetts and Colorado faced identical ballot initiatives to remove bilingual education programs from the public schools. The measure passed in Massachusetts and failed in Colorado. This paper investigates the debates over the issue in these two states. It provides insight into how people reason with respect to minority politics. It also helps to make sense of the states' divergent outcomes. Content analysis of letters-to-the-editor reveals that voters are motivated by ethnic competition and fiscal concerns, as existing theories would predict. Additionally, citizens debate which kinds of programs work best for English learners and take stands on how these youngsters can be successful in life. The inter-state comparison reveals that a major factor distinguishing the two statewide debates was ethnic paternalism, a logic often used by members of ethnic majorities to justify restrictive policy decisions on the basis of what they think is best for the affected population. The analysis shows that themes related to doing what is best for English learners were significantly more salient in Massachusetts than Colorado. This finding implies that where public debate over this issue is framed in terms of helping minority youth, the fate of bilingual education is not secure.

AB  - This article approaches the interpretation of elite and popular attitudes towards the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union through analysis of some of the rival perspectives on the national identity of the English that have become increasingly salient during the last two decades. It highlights their role as sources of some of the most influential ideas about nationhood, governance and state now shaping public discourse on the UK's membership of the EU. These include radical-democratic, restorationist and Anglo-British forms of patriotic discourse, which have prompted and responded to the growing prevalence of England as an imagined community' - a trend which has rendered other circles of attachment to the UK and Europe more tenuous and distant. A central conclusion of the article is that these emerging perspectives have spawned webs of belief that connect new and old ideas of nationhood to the political judgements that different actors are making about the EU.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   The choice of anaesthesia for caesarean section depends on many factors including the indication for the caesarean section, whether the procedure is emergency or elective, NBM status of the patient, preoperative condition of the patient, any preoperative disease and the condition of the foetus. Even though as anaesthetists, we would prefer spinal anaesthesia as the anaesthesia of choice for caesarean section, we wanted to know the perception of women who have undergone spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section about the overall experience of the same.
   Aim- To determine the overall experience of women undergoing regional anaesthesia for caesarean section.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   We conducted a cross-sectional study via a questionnaire on an online social media platform in a group, which consisted exclusively of mothers in the city of Mumbai. The questionnaire included basic questions about demographics of patients, any preexisting medical conditions complicating the pregnancy, the total number of children, number of caesarean surgeries they underwent, the type of anaesthesia received, the position and comfort during spinal anaesthesia, any apprehension felt during or after anaesthesia, awareness about surroundings, the pain relief post-surgery, any headache or backache after surgery, the overall experience of anaesthesia and the likelihood of them opting for spinal anaesthesia if need arises in future. The answers were computed by statistical analysis and the results were analysed.
   RESULTS
   In our study, 52% did not feel apprehensive during induction of anaesthesia suggesting almost equal number of patients felt apprehensive during the same. The sitting position for spinal anaesthesia was found to be significantly comfortable. This result was surprising, because in lateral general position is perceived to be more comfortable than the sitting position while receiving spinal anaesthesia. In our study, 238 i.e. 72% patients were pain free immediately after surgery. In our study, 32.92% females had headache postoperatively. 180 out of 327, i.e. almost 55% patients had experienced backache after the surgery. The same number of patients, 180 i.e. 55% have persistent backache even years after the surgery. When we compared incidence of backache in patients receiving different types of anaesthesia, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of backache in those receiving spinal, general or epidural anaesthesia. Of the 327 patients in our study, almost 60% patients felt they would opt for spinal anaesthesia if required in future. In spite of all the apprehensions and prejudices, in our study 84.09% women found the overall experience of anaesthesia for caesarean surgery to be satisfactory.
   CONCLUSION
   In conclusion, this study shows that in spite of the advantages of neuraxial blockade for caesarean surgery a number of factors can decide the comfort of patient during the surgery including whether anaesthetist spoke to the patient prior to surgery, the apprehension felt while receiving anaesthesia, the position given or whether baby was shown immediately after birth. Backache is very common in these patients, but most of the times it becomes persistent due to factors like physiological changes of pregnancy and postpartum period. Irrespective of its aetiology and pathogenesis, the postpartum backache is attributed to spinal anaesthesia or epidural anaesthesia received during caesarean surgery.

KW  - Pregnancy
KW  - TRANSMISSION
AB  - Background: Antenatal care (ANC) provides healthcare services to pregnant women in an attempt to ensure, the best possible pregnancy outcome for women and their babies. Healthcare providers' understanding of their patient's behaviour and reasons for engagement in care and their response to this insight can influence patient-provider interactions and patient demand for ANC early in pregnancy. We examined the insight of healthcare providers into women's reasons for starting ANC later than the South African National Department of Health's recommended 20 weeks gestation. We also looked at the impact of late ANC presentation on overall healthcare providers' work experiences and their response in their interactions with patients.
   Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 healthcare providers at Maternal Obstetrics Units (MOU) and Primary Healthcare Centres (PHC) in Gauteng, South Africa. Healthcare providers were selected with the assistance of the facility managers. Data analysis was conducted using the qualitative analysis software NVivo 11, using a thematic approach of pinpointing, examining, and recording patterns within the data.
   Results: Healthcare providers were aware of patients need for secrecy in the early stages of pregnancy because of fears of miscarriage and women's preference for traditional care. Women with prior pregnancies presumed to know about stages of pregnancy and neglected to initiate ANC early. Barriers to early ANC initiation also include, women's need to balance income generating activities; travel cost to the clinic and refusal of care for coming after the daily patient limit has been reached. Healthcare providers encounter negative attitudes from un-booked patients. This has a reciprocal effect whereby this experience impacts on whether healthcare providers will react with empathy or frustration.
   Conclusions: Timing of ANC is influenced by the complex decisions women make during pregnancy, starting from accepting the pregnancy itself to acknowledging the need for ANC. To positively influence this decision making for the benefit of early ANC, barriers such as lack of knowledge should be addressed prior to pregnancy through awareness programmes. The relationship between healthcare providers and women should be emphasized when training healthcare providers and considered as an important factor that can affect the timing of ANC.

AB  - Background: Perinatal mental illness is a common and important public health problem, especially in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study aims to explore the barriers and facilitators, as well as perceptions about the feasibility and acceptability of plans to deliver perinatal mental health care in primary care settings in a low income, rural district in Uganda.
   Methods: Six focus group discussions comprising separate groups of pregnant and postpartum women and village health teams as well as eight key informant interviews were conducted in the local language using a topic guide. Transcribed data were translated into English, analyzed, and coded. Key themes were identified using a thematic analysis approach.
   Results: Participants perceived that there was an important unmet need for perinatal mental health care in the district. There was evidence of significant gaps in knowledge about mental health problems as well as negative attitudes amongst mothers and health care providers towards sufferers. Poverty and inability to afford transport to services, poor partner support and stigma were thought to add to the difficulties of perinatal women accessing care. There was an awareness of the need for interventions to respond to this neglected public health problem and a willingness of both community-and facility-based health care providers to provide care for mothers with mental health problems if equipped to do so by adequate training.
   Conclusion: This study highlights the acceptability and relevance of perinatal mental health care in a rural, low income country community. It also underscores some of the key barriers and potential facilitators to delivery of such care in primary care settings. The results of this study have implications for mental health service planning and development for perinatal populations in Uganda and will be useful in informing the development of integrated maternal mental health care in this rural district and in similar settings in other low and middle income countries.

Theory is often neglected as a tool for providing evidence to inform better practice; in this study we investigated the reasons for poor implementation of the policy in Ghana using Lipsky's theory of street-level bureaucracy to better understand how providers shape and implement policy and how provider-level barriers might be overcome.
   Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 43 health professionals of different levels (managers, obstetricians, midwives) at three hospitals in Accra, as well as staff from smaller and private sector facilities. Relevant policy and related documents were also analysed.
   Results: Findings confirm that health providers' views shape provision of safe-abortion services. Most prominently, providers experience conflicts between their religious and moral beliefs about the sanctity of (foetal) life and their duty to provide safe-abortion care. Obstetricians were more exposed to international debates, treaties, and safe-abortion practices and had better awareness of national research on the public health implications of unsafe abortions; these factors tempered their religious views. Midwives were more driven by fundamental religious values condemning abortion as sinful. In addition to personal views and dilemmas, 'social pressures' (perceived views of others concerning abortion) and the actions of facility managers affected providers' decision to (openly) provide abortion services.
   In order to achieve a workable balance between these pressures and duties, providers use their 'discretion' in deciding if and when to provide abortion services, and develop 'coping mechanisms' which impede implementation of abortion policy.
   Conclusions: The application of theory confirmed its utility in a lower-middle income setting and expanded its scope by showing that provider values and attitudes (not just resource constraints) modify providers' implementation of policy; moreover their power of modification is constrained by organisational hierarchies and mid-level managers. We also revealed differing responses of 'front line workers' regarding the pressures they face; whilst midwives are seen globally as providers of safe-abortion services, in Ghana the midwife cadre displays more negative attitudes towards them than doctors. These findings allow the identification of recommendations for evidence-based practice.

AB  - Background: Although high educational attainment is linked to better health and lower health risk behaviors, this effect may be systemically smaller for racial and ethnic minority groups compared to Whites. However, it is still unknown whether these diminished returns also apply to marginalization based on sexual orientation. Aims: In a national sample of adults which was composed of people of color, we compared straight and homosexual people for the association between education attainment and obesity. Methods: The Social Justice Sexuality Project (SJS-2010) is a cross-sectional national survey of health and wellbeing of predominantly people of color who identify as homosexual. The current analysis included 2884 adults (age 24 or more) who were either heterosexual (n = 260) or homosexual (n = 2624). The predictor variable was education attainment, and the outcome variable was obesity status (body mass index larger than 30 kg/m(2) [kilograms per meter squared]). Demographic factors (age and gender), household income, nativity (US born vs. immigrant), and health (self-rated health and current smoking) were the covariates. Sexual orientation was the moderator. Results: In the pooled sample, high education attainment was protective against obesity status. Sexual orientation interacted with education attainment on odds of obesity, which was suggestive of stronger protective effects of high education attainment against obesity for heterosexual than homosexual individuals. Conclusion: High education attainment better protects heterosexual than homosexual people against obesity, a pattern similar to what has been observed for comparison of Whites and non-Whites. Smaller protective effects of education attainment on health behaviors of marginalized people are possibly, due to prejudice and discrimination that they experience. Discrimination may minimize stigmatized individuals' abilities to mobilize their economic and human resources and translate them to tangible outcomes. This finding extends the Minorities' Diminished Returns theory, suggesting that it is not just race/ethnicity but possibly any marginalizing and stigmatizing social identity that results in diminished returns of socioeconomic status resources.

AB  - Objectives: Disparities in diagnosis and treatment of racial minorities exist in the emergency department (ED). A better understanding of how physician implicit (unconscious) bias contributes to these disparities may help identify ways to eliminate such racial disparities. The objective of this systematic review was to examine and summarize the evidence on the association between physician implicit racial bias and clinical decision making.
   Methods: Based on PRISMA guidelines, a structured electronic literature search of PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and PsycINFO databases was conducted. Eligible studies were those that: 1) included physicians, 2) included the Implicit Association Test as a measure of implicit bias, 3) included an assessment of physician clinical decision making, and 4) were published in peer-reviewed journals between 1998 and 2016. Articles were reviewed for inclusion by two independent investigators. Data extraction was performed by one investigator and checked for accuracy by a second investigator. Two investigators independently scored the quality of articles using a modified version of the Downs and Black checklist.
   Results: Of the 1,154 unique articles identified in the initial search, nine studies (n = 1,910) met inclusion criteria. Three of the nine studies involved emergency providers including residents, attending physicians, and advanced practice providers. The majority of studies used clinical vignettes to examine clinical decision making. Studies that included emergency medicine (EM) providers had vignettes relating to treatment of acute myocardial infarction, pain, and pediatric asthma. An implicit preference favoring white people was common across providers, regardless of specialty. Two of the nine studies found evidence of a relationship between implicit bias and clinical decision making; one of these studies included EM providers. This one study found that EM and internal medicine residents who demonstrated an implicit preference for white individuals were more likely to treat white patients and not black patients with thrombolysis for myocardial infarction. Evidence from the two studies reporting a relationship between physician implicit racial bias and decision making was low in quality.
   Conclusions: The current literature indicates that although many physicians, regardless of specialty, demonstrate an implicit preference for white people, this bias does not appear to impact their clinical decision making. Further studies on the impact of implicit racial bias on racial disparities in ED treatment are needed.

AB  - Influenza vaccines represent a major tool to contain the clinical and epidemiological burden generated by influenza. However, in spite of their effectiveness, vaccines are victims of prejudices and false myths, which contribute to the increasing phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy and loss of confidence. Media and, mainly, new media, and information and communication technologies play a major role in disseminating health-related information. While, on the one hand, they can be extremely promising in promoting disease prevention, on the other hand, they can also have a negative impact on population's health attitudes and behaviors when delivering information not based on scientific evidences. The Fluad-case is an excellent example of the crucial role of an adequate information campaign. Following the cluster of deaths allegedly related to the administration of the adjuvanted influenza vaccine Fluad during the 2014-2015 influenza campaign, the Italian health authorities and regulatory bodies decided the withdrawal of two potentially contaminated Fluad batches. This fostered a huge media coverage, with resulted in negatively impacting on influenza vaccination coverage. Monitoring and tracking the Fluad-related web searches, we showed that Liguria resulted the Italian region with the highest number of Fluad-related website searches and that, interestingly, Fluad was searched also in Regions in which this vaccine was not distributed. A positive moderate correlation between accessing Fluad-related websites and overall influenza vaccination coverage was found (r = 0.66 ([95%CI 0.29-0.86], p = 0.0026). Considering subjects 65years, who are the subjects for which the Fluad vaccination is recommended, the correlation resulted r = 0.49 ([95%CI 0.03-0.78], p = 0.0397). As such, health authorities and decision-makers should promote high-quality communication campaigns in order to raise awareness of vaccination practices.

AB  - Objective: The open expression of hatred, hostility, and violence against minorities has become a common online phenomenon. Adolescents are at particular risk of being involved in different hate speech roles (e.g., witness, perpetrator). However, the correlates of their involvement as perpetrators and the mechanisms that might explain their involvement in hate speech across different roles have not yet been thoroughly investigated. To this end, this study investigates moral disengagement and empathy as correlates of online hate speech perpetration and the moderation effects of empathy and moral disengagement in the relationship between witnessing and perpetrating online hate speech. Method: The sample consists of 3,560 7th to 9th graders from 40 schools in Germany and Switzerland. Self-report questionnaires were utilized to assess online hate speech involvement, moral disengagement, and empathy. Results: Multilevel regression analyses revealed that moral disengagement and witnessing online hate speech were positively associated with online hate speech perpetration, while empathy was negatively associated with it. The findings also showed that the positive relationship between witnessing and perpetrating online hate speech was stronger at higher levels of moral disengagement and weaker when moral disengagement was low. The association between witnessing and perpetrating online hate speech was weaker when adolescents had higher rather than lower levels of empathy. Conclusions: The findings underscore the need for prevention efforts to accelerate moral engagement and empathy as critical future directions in hate speech prevention. This study also contributes to our understanding of underlying mechanisms that explain adolescents' involvement across different roles in hate speech.

AB  - The authors' purpose is to investigate the relationship between religiosity, authoritarianism, and moral authority by considering religiosity as a multidimensional construct and morality from its sources of influence. Religiosity, authoritarianism, and moral authority scales were applied to a sample of 109 students from one high school and one university college in Semirom city in the province of Isfahan, Iran. Results showed that religious beliefs, feelings and consequences are related to external sources but only religious beliefs and feelings correlate with the principal source of moral authority. Findings also demonstrated a significant relationship between religious consequences and authoritarianism, and that their combination significantly predicts the external source of moral authority. Findings are discussed in relation to previous studies and we argue that previous conclusions about the authoritarian tendency of religious people and their reliance on external sources of moral reasoning are mostly about the religious consequences dimension.
   Resume L'objectif des auteurs est d'etudier la relation entre la religion, l'autoritarisme et l'autorite morale, en considerant la religion comme un concept multidimensionnel et en etudiant l'impact de la morale sur l'homme. Pour connaitre leurs rapports a la religion et ses principes moraux, 109 etudiants d'un lycee et d'un college de Semirom, dans la province d'Ispahan en Iran, ont ete sondes. Les resultats ont montre que les croyances religieuses, les sentiments et leurs consequences sont lies a une source externe. Mais l'autorite morale a une veritable influence sur les croyances et les sentiments religieux. Les resultats ont egalement demontre une correlation totale entre consequences religieuses et autoritarisme. Leur combinaison laisse a penser que l'autorite morale joue un role determinant dans le quotidien des personnes sondees. Avec les resultats obtenus precedemment, nous en avons conclu que les personnes religieuses qui aient une tendance autoritaire et s'appuyent surtout sur une moralite externe sont pour la plupart influencees par la dimension religieuse.

TI  - Service provision and barriers to care for homeless people with mental health problems across 14 European capital cities
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH

KW  - ASSERTIVE COMMUNITY TREATMENT
KW  - ILLNESS
AB  - Background: Mental health problems are disproportionately higher amongst homeless people. Many barriers exist for homeless people with mental health problems in accessing treatment yet little research has been done on service provision and quality of care for this group. The aim of this paper is to assess current service provision and identify barriers to care for homeless people with mental health problems in 14 European capital cities.
   Method: Two methods of data collection were employed; (i) In two highly deprived areas in each of the 14 European capital cities, homeless-specific services providing mental health, social care or general health services were assessed. Data were obtained on service characteristics, staff and programmes provided. (ii) Semi-structured interviews were conducted in each area with experts in mental health care provision for homeless people in order to determine the barriers to care and ways to overcome them.
   Results: Across the 14 capital cities, 111 homeless-specific services were assessed. Input from professionally qualified mental health staff was reported as low, as were levels of active outreach and case finding. Out-of-hours service provision appears inadequate and high levels of service exclusion criteria were evident. Prejudice in the services towards homeless people, a lack of co-ordination amongst services, and the difficulties homeless people face in obtaining health insurance were identified as major barriers to service provision.
   Conclusions: While there is variability in service provision across European capital cities, the reported barriers to service accessibility are common. Homeless-specific services are more responsive to the initial needs of homeless people with mental health problems, while generic services tend to be more conducive to long term care. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of different service delivery models, including the most effective coordination of homeless specific and generic services.

AB  - This paper asks what are the potential responsibilities to respect, protect, and fulfill international human rights law (IHRL) of a particular class of non-State actors: non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The paper focuses on those NGOs pursuing development in a post-genocide/post-mass-atrocity transitional justice context acting simultaneously in partnership with State governments, as proxies, and providing essential public goods as part of their development remit. It uses post-genocide Rwanda as an example to illustrate how respect and fulfillment of the IHRL pertaining to reparative justice are hindered by failing to hold NGOs responsible for IHRL. This paper defines reparative justice in accordance with the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of IHRL and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law. These are centered upon five principles: restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction, and guarantees of non-repetition. I argue that many development NGOs in Rwanda, by not adequately incorporating reparative justice into their development and transitional justice remit and not acknowledging and responding to the distinctive rights and vulnerabilities of genocide survivors, are neglecting IHRL on the right to reparative justice. They have the capacity to prioritize reparative justice in their programming for genocide survivors and in their negotiations with the Rwandan government of how development aid will be disbursed in Rwanda, who will be its recipients, and the prioritization of those facing disadvantage so as not to further marginalize them. I argue, furthermore, that current soft law demands that NGOs should never enter into a contract for provision of development aid with a sovereign that knowingly entails - whether by commission or omission - a violation of IHRL. Though States are ultimately held legally responsible for the acts of NGOs this should not prejudice NGOs being held socially and morally responsible in some capacity and some degree, simultaneously. There is potential for new soft-law moral and social standards regulating NGO behavior to become legal obligations, if they eventually achieve widespread status and practice as customary international law.

AB  - Background
   Addressing Citizen's perspectives on homelessness is crucial for the design of effective and durable policy responses, and available research in Europe is not yet substantive. We aim to explore citizens' opinions about homelessness and to explain the differences in attitudes within the general population of eight European countries: France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden.
   Methods
   A nationally representative telephone survey of European citizens was conducted in 2017. Three domains were investigated: Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices about homelessness. Based on a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), a generalized linear model for clustered and weighted samples was used to probe the associations between groups with opposing attitudes.
   Results
   Response rates ranged from 30.4% to 33.5% (N = 5,295). Most respondents (57%) had poor knowledge about homelessness. Respondents who thought the government spent too much on homelessness, people who are homeless should be responsible for housing, people remain homeless by choice, or homelessness keeps capabilities/empowerment intact (regarding meals, family contact, and access to work) clustered together (negative attitudes, 30%). Respondents who were willing to pay taxes, welcomed a shelter, or acknowledged people who are homeless may lack some capabilities (i.e. agreed on discrimination in hiring) made another cluster (positive attitudes, 58%). Respondents living in semi-urban or urban areas (ORs 1.33 and 1.34) and those engaged in practices to support people who are homeless (ORs > 1.4; p<0.005) were more likely to report positive attitudes, whereas those from France and Poland (p<0.001) were less likely to report positive attitudes.
   Conclusion
   The majority of European citizens hold positive attitudes towards people who are homeless, however there remain significant differences between and within countries. Although it is clear that there is strong support for increased government action and more effective solutions for Europe's growing homelessness crisis, there also remain public opinion barriers rooted in enduring negative perceptions.

AB  - This paper reports on three studies examining people's belief about race as biological. Study 1 (N = 155) found that the relationship between early exposure to diversity as a child and belief in race as biological was moderated by socioeconomic status. Study 2 (N = 210) found that belief in race as biological was related to greater social distance toward out-group members, and this relationship was mediated by out-group discomfort. Study 3 found that participants (N = 31) had significant decreases in belief in race as biological immediately following a daylong race relations workshop and in a 6-week follow-up, and this "unlearning" trajectory was particularly prominent among students who experienced greater social distance from out-groups. Results are interpreted and discussed in relation to reconceptualizing beliefs about race as rationalizing rather than proactive ideologies and for promoting positive race relations through education aimed at deessentializing race.

AB  - This study investigated the relationship between self-reported discrimination and ethnic identity among 61 Arab American adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18years. Participants completed the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM) to obtain an assessment of their ethnic identities. Additionally, the lead author developed a questionnaire asking participants to self-report if either they or another Arab student they knew had been treated badly or differently because of their ethnicity'. Consistent with the rejection-identification model, respondents who had reported experiencing discrimination, knowing of others who had experienced discrimination, or both had higher ethnic identity scores than those who had not, although the only significant difference was found between the group that experienced both types of discrimination and the non-discrimination group. Implications of these results are discussed as well as directions for future research.

AB  - Pursuing economic, environmental and social sustainability requires networks endowed with persistent relationships between stakeholders. Networks serve as the vehicle to coordinate diverse policy goals among stakeholders. Within the networks, stakeholders inevitably experience some level of distrust due to the complexity and uncertainty of the unstructured problems on the sustainability. However, little is known about why stakeholders often distrust with one another in the networks. By analysing a local fracking policy network in NYS, we suggest that distrust is influenced by incongruent ecological worldviews, policy goals incongruence in the triple bottom line of sustainability, characterization framing, policy communications and knowledge exchange.

AB  - Objectives
   This study examines whether belief in the food addiction construct is associated with support for obesity-related policies (e. g., restrictions on foods served in schools and workplace cafeterias, subsidies on fruits and vegetables), while simultaneously examining other factors associated with policy support (e. g., political party affiliation).
   Design
   Cross-sectional.
   Setting
   Online Community.
   Participants
   200 individuals were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk.
   Measurements
   Participants (n = 193) responded to three questions about belief in food addiction and a measure evaluating support for 13 obesity-related policy initiatives. Individuals also completed the modified Yale Food Addiction Scale (mYFAS), self-reported height and weight, and provided demographic information (age, gender, race, political party affiliation).
   Results
   Belief in food addiction was significantly associated with greater support for obesity-related initiatives, even when accounting for the significant associations of age, gender, and political party. Belief in food addiction and political party both had moderate effect sizes for predicting support for obesity-related policy. There was an interaction between age and belief in food addiction, with significant associations with policy support for both younger and older individuals, though the effect was larger for younger participants.
   Conclusion
   The current study provides evidence that belief in food addiction is associated with increased obesity-related policy support, comparable to the influence of one's political party. Growing evidence for the role of an addictive process in obesity may have important implications for public support of obesity-related policy initiatives.

AB  - Background: At the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), held in Cairo, the global community agreed to the goal of achieving universal access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and rights by 2015. This research explores the accelerators and decelerators of achieving universal access to the sexual and reproductive health targets and accordingly makes some suggestions.
   Method: We have critically reviewed the latest national reports and extracted the background data on each SRH indicator. The key stakeholders, both national and international, were visited and interviewed at two sites. A total of 55 in-depth interviews were conducted with religious leaders, policy-makers, senior managers, senior academics, and health care managers. Six focus-group discussions were also held among health care providers. The study was qualitative in nature.
   Results: Obstacles on the road to achieving universal access to SRH can be viewed from two perspectives. One gap exists between current achievements and the targets. The other gap arises due to age, marital status, and residency status. The most recently observed trends in the indicators of the universal access to SRH shows that the achievements in the "unmet need for family planning" have been poor. Unmet need for family planning could directly be translated to unwanted pregnancies and unwanted childbirths; the former calls for sexual education to underserved people, including adolescents; and the latter calls for access to safe abortion. Local religious leaders have not actively attended international goal-setting programs. Therefore, they usually do not presume a positive attitude towards these goals. Such negative attitudes seem to be the most important factors hindering the progress towards universal access to SRH. Lack of international donors to fund for SRH programs is also another barrier. In national levels both state and the society are interactively playing their roles. We have used a cascade model for presenting the barriers at the state levels from the strategic planning to implementation. Social factors are to be considered as a background for other factors at all stages.
   Conclusion: Accelerating universal access to SRH requires adequate funding, firm political commitment, creative programming, and the involvement of diverse actors, including faith-based, civil society, and private sector partners.

AB  - Rationale: HIV-related stigma profoundly affects the physical and social wellbeing of people living with HIV, as well as the community's engagement with testing, treatment, and prevention. Based on theories of stigma elaborating how it arises from the relationships between the stigmatized and the stigmatizer as well as within the general community, we hypothesized that social networks can shape HIV-related stigma.
   Objective: To estimate social network correlates of HIV-related stigma.
   Methods: During 2011-2012, we collected complete social network data from a community of 1669 adults ("egos") in Mbarara, Uganda using six culturally-adapted name generators to elicit different types of social ties ("alters"). We measured HIV-related stigma using the 9-item AIDS-Related Stigma Scale. HIV serostatus was based on self-report. We fitted linear regression models that account for network autocorrelation to estimate the association between egos' HIV-related stigma, alters' HIV-related stigma and alters' self-reported HIV serostatus, while adjusting for egos' HIV serostatus, network centrality, village size, perceived HIV prevalence, and sociodemographic characteristics.
   Results: The average AIDS-Related Stigma Score was 0.79 (Standard Deviation = 0.50). In the population 116 (7%) egos reported being HIV-positive, and 757 (46%) reported an HIV-positive alter. In the multivariable model, we found that egos' own HW-related stigma was positively correlated with their alters' average stigma score (b =0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-0.63) and negatively correlated with having one or more HIV-positive alters (b= -0.05; 95% CI -0.10 to -0.003).
   Conclusion: Stigma-reduction interventions should be targeted not only at the level of the individual but also at the level of the network. Directed and meaningful contact with people living with HIV may also reduce HIV-related stigma.

AB  - Background: An innovative patient-centred interprofessional communication concept with advanced lung cancer patients (Heidelberg Milestone Communication Approach, MCA) has been developed and implemented. Role changes and interprofessional communication are challenging in a busy outpatient oncology service. The aim of the study was to present attitudes to interprofessional collaboration of professions in thoracic oncology during the implementation of MCA and to explore factors and experiences healthcare team members associate with its implementation.
   Methods: In a longitudinal study, 3 of the 4 subscales of the validated German translation of the University of the West of England Interprofessional Questionnaire (UWE-IP-D) were collected prior to implementation of MCA (t0) with follow-up data collections at 4 months (t1), 10 months (t2) and 17 months (t3). Descriptive analysis included calculating subscale sum scores and categorizing each subscale into positive, neutral and negative attitudes. Interviews and focus groups on implementation and interprofessional collaboration in the context of MCA were conducted with healthcare staff. The topics were analysed deductively, guided by the Professional Interactions factor of the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases (TICD) framework.
   Results: The survey with 87 staff (44 nurses, 13 physicians, 12 psycho-social staff, 7 therapists, and 11 others) participating at least once found heterogeneous attitudes. 'Communication and Teamwork' and 'Interprofessional Relationships' were characterized by primarily positive attitudes. Neutral attitudes to 'Interprofessional Interaction' were indicated by the majority of respondents. There were no differences between collection times. Fifteen staff members participated in the interviews and focus groups. The main interprofessional interaction factors associated with implementation concerned the knowledge of the MCA and the impact of the intervention on team roles, on information sharing and on transfer processes between wards. Adaptive processes led to a shift in the perception of responsibilities and interprofessional collaboration.
   Conclusions; Positive experiences and potential shortfalls in the implementation were observed. Future introductions of interprofessional communication concepts require further activities which should address the attitudes of healthcare professionals towards interprofessional care.

AB  - BackgroundVaccine hesitancy is responsible for low vaccine coverage and increased risk of epidemics. The purpose of this study was to assess whether public knowledge, attitudes, practices, and willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 have changed over time and at different stages of vaccination. MethodsTwo consecutive surveys were conducted among residents of the Leshan Community in Jinan from May to June, 2021 (n = 423) (basic dose vaccination phase) and from December, 2021 to January, 2022 (n = 470) (booster vaccination phase). Randomly sampling was used in residents to complete an anonymous questionnaire. Chi-square test was used to compare the changes in knowledge, attitudes and practices of the subjects in different survey stages. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to explore factors related to vaccination hesitancy. ResultsIn the booster vaccination phase, protective behaviors (89.9%) of residents increased significantly compared with the basic vaccination phase (74.5%). Residents were more hesitant to receive booster doses than basal doses of COVID-19 vaccine (OR: 18.334, 95% CI: 9.021-37.262). Residents with other marital statuses (OR: 2.719, 95% CI: 1.632-4.528), negative attitudes toward government measures were more hesitant to get vaccinated (OR: 2.576, 95% CI: 1.612-4.118). People who thought their physical condition was very good or good were more likely to be vaccinated than those who thought they were in fair or poor health (OR: 0.516, 95% CI: 0.288-0.925; OR: 0.513, 95% CI: 0.295-0.893). Young people inclined to use new media (such as WeChat and microblog) to obtain information, while the elderly inclined to use traditional methods (such as television). Government propaganda, residents' perception of the importance of vaccines and the risk of disease were the main reasons for accelerating residents to vaccinate. The main reasons affecting residents' lack of vaccination were contraindications to the vaccine or inconvenient time for vaccination. ConclusionsVaccine hesitancy increased significantly with change in vaccination stage. Strategies should be adopted to increase vaccination coverage such as improving the convenience of vaccination, promoting through multiple channels.

TI  - Euroscepticism and the Anglosphere: Traditions and Dilemmas in Contemporary English Nationalism
T2  - JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - British participation in the historical process of European integration has been persistently framed as a policy dilemma of the highest order. This dilemma was itself coloured by the existence of policy traditions that oriented Britain away from Europe and towards political communities tied to a historical interpretation of British nationality. Euroscepticism is symptomatic of these traditions and dilemmas while at the same time sustaining them. But Eurosceptics face a dilemma of their own. What serious alternative do they propose? The notion of the Anglosphere' was adopted on the Eurosceptic right of British politics as an alternative to European integration. As a politics of disengagement by the Cameron government played out in Europe, a policy of re-engagement began with Britain's former Dominions. Here was a response to a political dilemma that not only used historical consciousness and political tradition as its point of departure, but as its place of destination too.

AB  - Background: Devising a program to increase physical activity (PA)/exercise behavior in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can meet with limited effectiveness in real-world settings because of the variety of barriers to PA/exercise that individuals need to overcome. An alternative approach is to explore whether targeting motivation as a facilitator may be effective to increase PA/exercise. This study aimed to understand attitudes toward perceived barriers to PA/exercise by examining individual levels of motivation, grounded on self-determination theory, in patients with T2DM. Methods: This study used an integrated approach combining qualitative and quantitative analysis. Sixteen patients with T2DM were grouped (n = 8 for each group) into either a higher self-motivation (HSM) or lower self-motivation (LSM) group via the Relative Autonomy Index. Thematic and deductive analysis were used to identify attitudes based on ten preconceived barrier themes: apathy, dislike, no priority, lack of support, health problems, lack of knowledge, unfavorable environment, tiredness, lack of time, and financial constraints. Quantitative analysis was to assess statistical differences in the volume of PA/exercise across the two groups, and a mixed-methods analysis was employed to highlight unique cases. Results: Patients in the HSM group expressed positive attitudes toward barriers to PA/exercise, while patients in the LSM group expressed a greater degree of hindrance. Although regular PA/exercise is necessary for T2DM management, patients with LSM considered PA/exercise a lesser priority displaying negative attitudes such as apathy and dislike. Conversely, patients with HSM placed greater emphasis on the benefits of PA/exercise regardless of apathy and dislike. Lack of time and health problems were commonly reported in both groups. The volume of PA/exercise corresponded to motivation levels, but there were some unique cases which arose from active commuting habits and severe health problems. Conclusion: These findings provide insights on how attitudes to perceived barriers to PA/exercise differ by levels of motivation. One insight was that examining motivation should be an essential consideration when designing practical strategies to overcome PA/exercise barriers in patients with T2DM. Lack of time and health problems exist regardless of motivation levels. Future research requires a tailored approach to managing barriers to PA/exercise in patients with T2DM.

AB  - Introduction: Ukraine's volatile HIV epidemic, one of the largest in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, remains concentrated in people who inject drugs (PWID). HIV prevalence is high (21.3% to 41.8%) among the estimated 310,000 PWID. Opioid agonist therapy (OAT) is the most cost-effective HIV prevention strategy there, yet OAT services are hampered by negative attitudes and frequent harassment of OAT clients and site personnel by law enforcement. This paper examines the various types of police violence that Ukrainian PWID experience and factors associated with the different types of violence, as well as the possible implications of police harassment on OAT retention.
   Methods: In 2014 to 2015, we conducted a cross-sectional survey in five Ukrainian cities with 1613 PWID currently, previously and never on OAT, using a combination of respondent-driven sampling, as well as random sampling. We analysed correlates of police violence by multiple factors, including by gender, and their effects on duration of OAT retention. Self-reported physical and sexual violence by police were the two primary outcomes, while retention on OAT was used as a secondary outcome.
   Results: Overall, 1033 (64.0%) PWID reported being physically assaulted by police, which was positively correlated with currently or previously being on OAT (69.1% vs. 60.2%; p<0.01). HIV prevalence rates were higher in those receiving OAT than those not on OAT (47.6% vs. 36.1%; p<0.01). Police violence experiences differed by sex, with men experiencing significantly more physical violence, while women experienced more sexual violence (65.9% vs. 42.6%; p<0.01). For PWID who had successfully accessed OAT, longer OAT retention was significantly correlated both with sexual assault by police and fewer non-fatal overdoses.
   Conclusions: Police violence is a frequent experience among PWID in Ukraine, particularly for those accessing OAT, an evidence-based primary and secondary HIV prevention strategy. Police violence experiences, however, were different for men and women, and interventions with police that address these sexual differences and focus on non-violent interactions with PWID to improve access and retention on OAT are crucial for improving HIV prevention and treatment goals for Ukraine.

AB  - To understand the mechanisms behind social inequality, this address argues that we need to more thoroughly incorporate the effects of status-inequality based on differences in esteem and respect-alongside those based on resources and power. As a micro motive for behavior, status is as significant as money and power. At a macro level, status stabilizes resource and power inequality by transforming it into cultural status beliefs about group differences regarding who is "better" (esteemed and competent). But cultural status beliefs about which groups are "better" constitute group differences as independent dimensions of inequality that generate material advantages due to group membership itself. Acting through micro-level social relations in workplaces, schools, and elsewhere, status beliefs bias evaluations of competence and suitability for authority, bias associational preferences, and evoke resistance to status challenges from low-status group members. These effects accumulate to direct members of higher status groups toward positions of resources and power while holding back lower status group members. Through these processes, status writes group differences such as gender, race, and class-based life style into organizational structures of resources and power, creating durable inequality. Status is thus a central mechanism behind durable patterns of inequality based on social differences.

AB  - Objective: To examine the magnitude of explicit and implicit weight biases compared to biases against other groups; and identify student factors predicting bias in a large national sample of medical students.
   Methods: A web-based survey was completed by 4,732 1st year medical students from 49 medical schools as part of a longitudinal study of medical education. The survey included a validated measure of implicit weight bias, the implicit association test, and 2 measures of explicit bias: a feeling thermometer and the anti-fat attitudes test.
   Results: A majority of students exhibited implicit (74%) and explicit (67%) weight bias. Implicit weight bias scores were comparable to reported bias against racial minorities. Explicit attitudes were more negative toward obese people than toward racial minorities, gays, lesbians, and poor people. In multivariate regression models, implicit and explicit weight bias was predicted by lower BMI, male sex, and non-Black race. Either implicit or explicit bias was also predicted by age, SES, country of birth, and specialty choice.
   Conclusions: Implicit and explicit weight bias is common among 1st year medical students, and varies across student factors. Future research should assess implications of biases and test interventions to reduce their impact.

AB  - Background Tackling challenges related to health, environmental sustainability and equity requires many sectors to work together. This "intersectoral co-operation" can pose a challenge on its own. Research commonly focuses on one field or is conducted within one region or country. The aim of this study was to investigate facilitators and barriers regarding intersectoral co-operative behaviour as experienced in twelve distinct case studies in ten European countries. The COM-B behavioural system was applied to investigate which capabilities, opportunities and motivational elements appear necessary for co-operative behaviour. Method Twelve focus groups were conducted between October 2018 and March 2019, with a total of 76 participants (policymakers, case study coordinators, governmental institutes and/or non-governmental organisations representing citizens or citizens). Focus groups were organised locally and held in the native language using a common protocol and handbook. One central organisation coordinated the focus groups and analysed the results. Translated data were analysed using deductive thematic analysis, applying previous intersectoral co-operation frameworks and the COM-B behavioural system. Results Amongst the main facilitators experienced were having highly motivated partners who find common goals and see mutual benefits, with good personal relationships and trust (Motivation). In addition, having supportive environments that provide opportunities to co-operate in terms of support and resources facilitated co-operation (Opportunity), along with motivated co-operation partners who have long-term visions, create good external visibility and who have clear agreements and clarity on roles from early on (Capability). Barriers included not having necessary and/or structural resources or enough time, and negative attitudes from specific stakeholders. Conclusions This study on facilitators and barriers to intersectoral co-operation in ten European countries confirms findings of earlier studies. This study also demonstrates that the COM-B model can serve as a relatively simple tool to understand co-operative behaviour in terms of the capability, opportunity and motivation required amongst co-operation partners from different sectors. Results can support co-operators' and policymakers' understanding of necessary elements of intersectoral co-operation. It can help them in developing more successful intersectoral co-operation when dealing with challenges of health, environmental sustainability and equity.

AB  - How do individuals' personal experiences with various aspects of political violence affect their attitudes toward hosting conflict refugees? More specifically, how do their personal exposure to violence, their own personal experience of being displaced, and their recent contact with refugees influence these attitudes? To explore answers to these questions, we draw upon a recent survey of 2,400 Lebanese residents where we identify individuals who experienced violence during the Lebanese civil war (1975-90), those forced to flee their homes during that conflict, and those who enjoy recent contact with Syrian immigrant and/or displaced populations. We examine whether these distinct experiences affect respondents' regard for members of the Syrian refugee population. Results demonstrate that historical exposure to violence and experience of displacement have no discernible impact on individual attitudes toward hosting refugees. We find much stronger evidence that attitudes are associated with whether individual respondents have had contact with Syrians in Lebanon; those with such interactions are significantly more likely to support hosting refugees, to consider hiring a refugee, or to allow one of their children to marry a refugee. Our findings suggest exposure to violence by itself does not correlate to positive sentiments toward refugees, especially over time. Further, finding ways to create positive contact between refugees and native populations may be associated with improving attitudes and relations between the two populations.

AB  - Recently, with the Medicare bundled payments initiative for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), there has been a move by many institutions to further streamline costs associated with the entire operative and perioperative process. One of these cost-saving strategies has been to favor discharging patients to home with outpatient services as opposed to discharging to the relatively more expensive rehabilitation facilities. Our aim was to determine the success of a teaching institute's initiative in discharging patients to home instead of a rehabilitation facility. Specifically, we evaluated if there were differences in discharge disposition based off of (1) surgeon/patient preference, (2) length of stay, (3) demographics, and (4) postoperative complications. A retrospective review of all patients who had a TKA from 2015 to 2017 at a single teaching institution was performed and assessed discharge to home or to a rehabilitation facility. If they were not discharged to home, we evaluated why that did not happen, stratified the reason they were discharged to a rehabilitation facility into four groups based on (1) physician and occupational health team assessment, (2) patient preference, (3) physician preference, and (4) family or caretaker preference. A total of 229 patients were enrolled in this initiative, with 107 patients (47%) discharged to home with outpatient physical therapy services and 122 (53%) discharged to a rehabilitation facility. Of these, 35 patients (29%) went to these facilities because of physician and occupational health team assessment. However, 31 (25%) patients were due to patient preference, 32 (26%) were because of surgeon's preference, and 24 (20%) were not discharged to home because of family or caretaker preference. There were no differences in length of stay, gender, or complication rates between cohorts. Many patients can be safely discharged to home following TKA at a community teaching institution; however, there continues to be a strong prejudice by patients, physicians, and caretakers to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility despite the home discharge initiative.

AB  - Background: Chronic pain has emerged as a disease in itself, affecting a growing number of people. Effective patient-provider communication is central to good pain management because pain can only be understood from the patient's perspective. We aimed to develop a user-centered tool to improve patient-provider communication about chronic pain and assess its feasibility in real-world settings in preparation for further evaluation and distribution.
   Methods: To identify and prioritize patient treatment goals for chronic pain, strategies to improve patient-provider communication about chronic pain, and facilitate implementation of the tool, we conducted nominal group technique meetings and card sorting with patients with chronic pain and experienced providers (n = 12). These findings informed the design of the PainAPP tool. Usability and beta-testing with patients (n = 38) and their providers refined the tool and assessed its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact.
   Results: Formative work revealed that patients felt neither respected nor trusted by their providers and focused on transforming providers' negative attitudes towards them, whereas providers focused on gathering patient information. PainAPP incorporated areas prioritized by patients and providers: assessing patient treatment goals and preferences, functional abilities and pain, and providing patients tailored education and an overall summary that patients can share with providers.
   Beta-testing involved 38 patients and their providers. Half of PainAPP users shared their summaries with their providers. Patients rated PainAPP highly in all areas. All users would recommend it to others with chronic pain; nearly alltrusted the informationand said it helped themthink about my treatment goals(94%),understand my chronic pain(82%),make the most of my next doctor's visit(82%), andnot want to use opioids(73%).Beta-testing revealed challenges delivering the tool and summary report to patients and providers in a timely manner and obtaining provider feedback.
   Conclusions PainAPP appears feasible for use, but further adaptation and testing is needed to assess its impact on patients and providers.

AB  - BackgroundCross-cultural educational initiatives for professionals are now commonplace across a variety of sectors including health care. A growing number of studies have attempted to explore the utility of such initiatives on workplace behaviors and client outcomes. Yet few studies have explored how professionals perceive cross-cultural educational models (e.g., cultural awareness, cultural competence) and the extent to which they (and their organizations) execute the principles in practice. In response, this study aimed to explore the general perspectives of health care professionals on culturally competent care, their experiences working with multi-cultural patients, their own levels of cultural competence and the extent to which they believe their workplaces address cross-cultural challenges.MethodsThe perspectives and experiences of a sample of 56 health care professionals across several health care systems from a Mid-Western state in the United States were sourced via a 19-item questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised both open-ended questions and multiple choice items. Percentages across participant responses were calculated for multiple choice items. A thematic analysis of open-ended responses was undertaken to identify dominant themes.ResultsParticipants largely expressed confidence in their ability to meet the needs of multi-cultural clientele despite almost half the sample not having undergone formal cross-cultural training. The majority of the sample appeared to view cross-cultural education from a cultural awareness' perspective - effective cross-cultural care was often defined in terms of possessing useful cultural knowledge (e.g., norms and customs) and facilitating communication (the use of interpreters); in other words, from an immediate practical standpoint. The principles of systemic cross-cultural approaches (e.g., cultural competence, cultural safety) such as a recognition of racism, power imbalances, entrenched majority culture biases and the need for self-reflexivity (awareness of one's own prejudices) were scarcely acknowledged by study participants.ConclusionsFindings indicate a need for interventions that acknowledge the value of cultural awareness-based approaches, while also exploring the utility of more comprehensive cultural competence and safety approaches.

AB  - Aims and objectives. To examine nursing home managers' knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and current practice regarding advance care planning for people with dementia in long-term care settings informed by the theory of planned behaviour.
   Background. Internationally, advance care planning is advocated for people with dementia. However, evidence suggests that discussions with people with dementia are rare, particularly in long-term care settings. Whilst nursing home managers can be considered central to implementation in this setting, there is a dearth of research that has examined their perspective. This study reports on their role with regard to advance care planning and the perceived factors which influence this.
   Design. A cross-sectional postal survey was carried out as part of a larger scale sequential explanatory mixed-methods study between January-March 2015.
   Setting and participants. Nursing home managers in a region in the UK (n = 178).
   Results. A response rate of 66% (n = 116) was achieved. Nursing home managers demonstrated a lack of knowledge of advance care planning, with negative attitudes underpinned by concerns regarding the capacity and lack of perceived benefits to the person with dementia. Currently, they do not view advance care planning as part of their role, with lack of ownership impacting upon current practice behaviours. Conclusions. Whilst nursing home managers recognise the potential benefits of advance care planning, barriers and challenges create a reluctance to facilitate. Targeted training to address the knowledge deficit is required, with the wider components of advance care planning promoted. There is a need for greater role clarification to ensure nurses in long-term care settings identify with the process in the future. A gap between rhetoric and reality of implementation is evident; therefore, long-term care settings must critically examine system, organisational and individual factors for failure to implement advance care planning for people with dementia.
   Relevance to Clinical Practice. Increased cognisance of the context in which advance care planning takes place is vital for improved implementation in this context. In addition strong nursing leadership is imperative to facilitate initiation, engagement and re-evaluation of the process of advance care planning.

AB  - Brucellosis is a highly contagious zoonosis affecting humans and a wide range of domesticated and wild animal species. An important element for effective disease containment is to improve knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of afflicted communities. This study aimed to assess the KAP related to brucellosis at the human-animal interface in an endemic area of Egypt and to identify the risk factors for human infection. A matched case-control study was conducted at the central fever hospitals located in six governorates in northern Egypt. Face-to-face interviews with cases and controls were conducted using a structured questionnaire. In total, 40.7% of the participants owned farm animals in their households. The overall mean practice score regarding animal husbandry, processing and consumption of milk and dairy products were significantly lower among cases compared with controls (-12.7 +/- 18.1 vs. 0.68 +/- 14.2, respectively; p < .001). Perceived barriers for notification of animal infection/abortion were predominate among cases and positively correlated with participants' education. The predictors of having brucellosis infection were consumption of unpasteurized milk or raw dairy products and practicing animal husbandry. Applying protective measures against infection significantly reduced its risk. A model predicting risk factors for brucellosis among those who own animal showed that frequent abortions per animal increased the chance for brucellosis infection among human cases by 50-fold (95% CI: 8.8-276.9), whereas the use of protective measures in animal care reduced the odds (OR = 0.11 [95% CI: 0.03-0.45]). In conclusion, consumption of unprocessed dairy products was equally important as contact with infected/aborted animals as major risk factors for Brucella spp. infection among humans in Egypt. There is poor knowledge, negative attitudes and risky behaviours among villagers which can perpetuate the risk of brucellosis transmission at the human-animal interface. This supports the need for integrating health education into the national brucellosis control programme.

AB  - Simple Summary Animal welfare is affected by how people think we should treat animals, and what people think is important affects the way they treat animals. The way people think about their animals is affected by how cute they perceive them to be. Animal welfare affects quality of life, which is about how sentient animals experience their lives, and understanding this requires animal welfare science. Ethics weighs that scientific knowledge with human desires (e.g., to earn a living by farming, to keep an animal as a companion, to clear land and build houses), so we decide how we should treat animals. The decisions that society has reached using science and ethical reasoning about how we ought to treat animals are reflected in animal welfare law. However, animal welfare law may often set a low standard of care, as there is little public money to enforce higher standards or the public is not aware of the welfare problems. The first step in ensuring a good quality of life is to measure welfare and then take action to improve it. The recognition of animal suffering is influenced by cultural and societal prejudices and the cuteness of an animal leads to bias in the way it is treated. It is important to consider the animal's behaviour and its environment-not just its physical condition-when assessing its quality of life. The Animal Welfare Assessment Grid (AWAG) is a useful tool for this purpose. The AWAG offers an evidence-based tool for continual welfare assessment, using technology where appropriate, such as digital activity recording, to facilitate decision-making and lead to improvements in the animals' quality of life. It is highly adaptable to any species by assessing the four parameters of physical health, psychological wellbeing, environmental quality, and clinical and management procedural events. The outcome of assessing welfare should be action to improve it. Societal ethics and policy-making lead to legislation balancing the values we hold for different species. Influencing policy development in such matters as animal welfare, ecological conservation, and risks to humans requires a focus on public attitudes to, and understanding of, science, as well as consideration of potential unforeseen consequences of the social/environmental/economic impacts of policies.

AB  - The outcome of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election was a big surprise to many, as the majority of polls had predicted the opposite outcome. In this two-stage cross-sectional study, we focus on how Democrats and Republicans reacted to this electoral surprise and how these reactions might have influenced the way they allocated resources to each other in small groups. We find that, before the election, Republicans showed greater in-group favoritism than Democrats, who treated others equally, regardless of their political affiliation. We then show that Democrats experienced the election outcome as an ego shock and, in the week following the election, reported significantly higher levels of negative emotions and lower levels of self-esteem than Republicans. These reactions then predicted how individuals' decided to allocate resources to others: after the election, Republicans no longer showed in-group favoritism, while Democrats showed out-group derogation. We find these decisions when the tables were turned can be partially explained by differences in participants' state self-esteem.

AB  - Objective
   Pervasive weight stigma and discrimination have led to ongoing calls for efforts to reduce this bias. Despite increasing research on stigma-reduction strategies, perspectives of individuals who have experienced weight stigma have rarely been included to inform this research. The present study conducted a systematic examination of women with high body weight to assess their perspectives about a broad range of strategies to reduce weight-based stigma.
   Methods
   Women with overweight or obesity (N = 461) completed an online survey in which they evaluated the importance, feasibility and potential impact of 35 stigma-reduction strategies in diverse settings. Participants (91.5% who reported experiencing weight stigma) also completed self-report measures assessing experienced and internalized weight stigma.
   Results
   Most participants assigned high importance to all stigma-reduction strategies, with school-based and healthcare approaches accruing the highest ratings. Adding weight stigma to existing anti-harassment workplace training was rated as the most impactful and feasible strategy. The family environment was viewed as an important intervention target, regardless of participants' experienced or internalized stigma.
   Conclusion
   These findings underscore the importance of including people with stigmatized identities in stigma-reduction research; their insights provide a necessary and valuable contribution that can inform ways to reduce weight-based inequities and prioritize such efforts.

AB  - The aims of the current paper were (a) to investigate preservice teachers' own ethnic background as a factor that affects attitudes and (b) to investigate the influence of an activation of teacher efficacy on attitudes toward students from ethnic minority groups. In a quasi-experimental design, implicit and explicit attitudes were assessed before the preservice teachers filled out a teacher efficacy questionnaire and in another group, attitudes were assessed after the questionnaire. Results showed that, in comparison with preservice teachers from the ethnic majority, the preservice teachers from ethnic minority groups had more favorable implicit and explicit attitudes toward students from ethnic minority groups. Activating participants' teacher efficacy did not affect attitudes of the preservice teachers from the ethnic majority, but it lowered positive implicit attitudes of preservice teachers from ethnic minority groups. The results highlight the need to explore factors that are able to change attitudes in either direction.

TI  - Negotiating absence: Bernard Tschumi's new Acropolis Museum in Athens
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURE
LA  - English
AB  - The ambition to inaugurate the new Acropolis Museum illuminated by the Olympic flame of 2004 and broadcast worldwide was not fulfilled. Difficulties and delays of practical, economic and archaeological nature were in the end less daunting than the political, legal and ideological obstacles to the aspiration of crowning the new museum with the Elgin Marbles, which were moved to London about two hundred years ago. The expatriation of the Parthenon fragments and the repeated requests for repatriation, both brought to play in Bernard Tschumi's highly persuasive structure, define a striking prism through which to look at some of the urgent and conflicting issues haunting the museum institution today (Fig. 1).
   Driven by the ideals of enlightenment, the idea of the public, universal museum, perfect and complete, proliferated at the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1796, only three years after the foundation of the Museum Francais (the later Musee du Louvre), Antoine Chrysostome Quatremere de Quincy advised passionately against the relocation of antique monuments to European capitals in his 'Lettres au general Miranda sur le prejudice qu'occasionnens aux arts et a la science le deplacement des monumens de l'art de l'Italie, Le demembrement de ses ecoles, et la spoliation de ses collections, galeries, musees, etc.'(1) In hindsight, however, the physical removal of ancient art and architecture marks not only the decontextualisation of these objects, but also their re-location from one discourse to another. Once relocated to the museum, architectural elements are invested with new functions and historical and aesthetic values that radically alter their significance.
   Thus, as Greece today reclaims the Elgin Marbles by means of a compelling architectural rhetoric, the discourse on decontextualisation gets a new twist, now including the possible re-contextualisation of a fragment whose original context has changed beyond recognition. In fact, Quatremere himself anticipated this delicious paradox in his Canova-correspondence of 1818 on the Parthenon Collection in London. Here, Quatremere addressed with surprising precision a fundamental museo-theoretical problem regarding decontextualisation as well as re-contextualisation; a problem to which Tschumi's design for the new Acropolis Museum gives such an eloquent architectural manifestation.

AB  - BackgroundSexual violence against women is a major public health issue and a breach of human rights. Although various consequences of sexual violence on health have been described in a large number of scientific publications, very little is known about this topic in Estonia. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of sexual violence and associations between exposure to sexual violence and risky health and sexual behaviours among women in Estonia.MethodsA population-based cross-sectional study was carried out in Estonia in 2014. Self-reported data regarding selected indicators of risky health and sexual behaviours were collected from 1670 women, aged 18-44years, via a self-administered questionnaire. To measure the prevalence of sexual violence, questions from the NorVold Abuse Questionnaire were included. Chi-square and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyse the data.ResultsOf the respondents, 22.7% (n =379) reported being exposed to sexual violence during their lifetime, and over half of these women had had these experiences before the age of 18. Statistically significant associations were found between sexual violence and smoking (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.32, 95% CI 1.03-1.70), alcohol consumption (AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.18-1.95), illicit drug use (AOR 2.21, 95% CI 1.70-2.89), sexual intercourse for money or other material reward (AOR 3.51, 95% CI 1.62-7.61), concurrent sexual relationships (AOR 2.64; 95% CI 1.80-3.86), and being diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections (AOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.09-2.01).ConclusionsIn Estonia, sexual violence against women is widespread and is associated with several risky health and sexual behaviours. Efforts should be made, both among the general public and professionals, to raise awareness regarding the prevalence and negative impact of sexual violence. Women who have been exposed to sexual violence are in need of professional medical, legal and psychological help free from prejudice to help them recover from such traumatic events.

AB  - Background: There is an urgent need to increase population levels of physical activity, particularly amongst those who are socio-economically disadvantaged. Multiple factors influence physical activity behaviour but the generalisability of current evidence to such 'hard-to-reach' population subgroups is limited by difficulties in recruiting them into studies. Also, rigorous qualitative studies of lay perceptions and perceptions of community leaders about public health efforts to increase physical activity are sparse. We sought to explore, within a socio-economically disadvantaged community, residents' and community leaders' perceptions of physical activity (PA) interventions and issues regarding their implementation, in order to improve understanding of needs, expectations, and social/environmental factors relevant to future interventions.
   Methods: Within an ongoing regeneration project (Connswater Community Greenway), in a socio-economically disadvantaged community in Belfast, we collaborated with a Community Development Agency to purposively sample leaders from public- and voluntary-sector community groups and residents. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 leaders. Residents (n = 113), of both genders and a range of ages (14 to 86 years) participated in focus groups (n = 14) in local facilities. Interviews and focus groups were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using a thematic framework.
   Results: Three main themes were identified: awareness of PA interventions; factors contributing to intervention effectiveness; and barriers to participation in PA interventions. Participants reported awareness only of interventions in which they were involved directly, highlighting a need for better communications, both inter-and intra-sectoral, and with residents. Meaningful engagement of residents in planning/organisation, tailoring to local context, supporting volunteers, providing relevant resources and an 'exit strategy' were perceived as important factors related to intervention effectiveness. Negative attitudes such as apathy, disappointing experiences, information with no perceived personal relevance and limited access to facilities were barriers to people participating in interventions.
   Conclusions: These findings illustrate the complexity of influences on a community's participation in PA interventions and support a social-ecological approach to promoting PA. They highlight the need for cross-sector working, effective information exchange, involving residents in bottom-up planning and providing adequate financial and social support. An in-depth understanding of a target population's perspectives is of key importance in translating PA behaviour change theories into practice.

AB  - Background: With the spread of COVID-19 around the world, herd immunity through vaccination became a key measure to control the pandemic, but high uptake of vaccine is not guaranteed. Moreover, the actual acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination and associated factors remain uncertain among health care students in Northwest China.Methods: A cross-sectional survey of a sample of 631 health care students was performed using a questionnaire developed through Wen Juan Xing survey platform to collect information regarding their attitudes, beliefs, and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the association between vaccination willingness and demographics, attitudes, and beliefs to determine the factors that actually effect acceptance and hesitancy of COVID-19 vaccine among health care students.Results: Overall, 491 (77.81%) students actually received the COVID-19 vaccine, and of the 140 unvaccinated, 69 were hesitant and 71 rejected. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the actually vaccinated individuals were those who mostly believed in the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine (OR = 2.94, 95%CI: 1.37, 6.29), those who mostly felt it is their responsibility to receive the vaccine to protect others from infection (OR = 2.75, 95%CI: 1.45, 5.23), with less previous experience about other vaccines (OR = 1.70, 95%CI: 1.06, 2.72), students who mostly thought COVID-19 to be very severe (OR = 1.77, 95%CI: 1.07, 2.93), and students who mostly thought the COVID-19 vaccine was one of the best protection measures (OR = 1.68, 95%CI: 1.03, 2.76). Concerns about side effects of vaccines (OR = 0.30, 95%CI: 0.18, 0.51) and the use of personal protective behavior as an alternative to the COVID-19 vaccination (OR = 0.16, 95%CI: 0.06, 0.39) hindered the vaccine acceptance.Conclusions: Our study showed higher COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among healthcare students. However, the individuals with vaccine hesitancy and rejection were still worrying. Vaccine safety and effectiveness issues continue to be a major factor affecting students' acceptance. To expand vaccine coverage in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, appropriate vaccination strategies and immunization programs are essential, especially for those with negative attitudes and beliefs.

AB  - Vitamin D deficiency is widespread in Saudi Arabia. The aim of this study was to explore participants' knowledge about vitamin D and attitudes toward sun exposure. The study also aimed to explore the social and cultural factors that might potentially contribute to vitamin D deficiency in Saudi Arabia. Face-to-face interviews were carried out in the cities of Jeddah and Makkah between May and October 2015. The interview questions were semi-structured, and the data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Study participants showed a reasonable level of knowledge in different areas about vitamin D, including the effect of vitamin D deficiency on bone health and exposure to sunlight as the main source of vitamin D. Participants were also knowledgeable about vitamin D supplements as another source of this vitamin. Nevertheless, there was a shortage of knowledge in relation to dietary sources of vitamin D. In respect to attitudes toward sun exposure, some participants had positive attitudes toward sunlight and were willing to expose themselves to sunlight, but it was restricted to the early morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat. These participants who liked exposure to sunlight were largely exposing only their faces and hands to sunlight. Other participants had negative attitudes toward sun exposure and were avoiding sunlight. Moreover, the study participants identified several barriers to sun exposure, including hot climate, living in high-rise buildings, limited public areas allowing outdoor activities, lifestyle issues such as physical inactivity, and some religious concerns such as wearing the hijab. The study results also demonstrate that females were more enthusiastic about taking actions to improve their vitamin D status in comparison with males. Recommendations for health education interventions that increase awareness about vitamin D sources, especially food sources, are made. Also, educational interventions should focus on increasing awareness about the sufficient time of the day and duration for sun exposure to improve vitamin D status and the importance of the intake of vitamin D supplements as an affordable source to improve vitamin D status. Increasing males' awareness of the benefits of vitamin D is important to encourage them to adopt behaviors to improve vitamin D.

AB  - Behavioral immune system (BIS) describes psychological mechanisms that detect cues to infectious pathogens in the immediate environment, trigger disease-relevant responses and facilitate behavioral avoidance/escape. BIS activation elicits a perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD) which can result in conformity with social norms. However, a response to superficial cues can result in aversive responses to people that pose no actual threat, leading to an aversion to unfamiliar others, and likelihood of prejudice. Pathogen-neutralizing behaviors, therefore, have implications for social interaction as well as illness behaviors and responses to health communications. In this study, we investigate how PVD influences conformity, attitudes to other people and to lockdown regulations through the lens of the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST). RST describes personality in terms of biologically-driven approach and avoidance motivations which support personal goals. Participants from the United Kingdom public (N = 605) completed an RST personality questionnaire and then read either (a) coronavirus morbidity-mortality statistics and current United Kingdom government lifestyle regulations, (b) just the regulations (as presented in most government publicity materials), or (c) no information at all. They all completed the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease scale to assess BIS-relevant Germ Aversion and Perceived Infectability, followed by questions measuring social conformity, warmth toward others and attitudes toward lockdown measures. Significantly lower PVD scores were observed in the no-information condition, with the other conditions showing no difference. In terms of RST, approach behaviors related to goal-drive persistence work alongside fear in explaining conformity to social norms. Reward related approach behaviors partially explained warmth toward others, indicating that social rewards gained through interaction continue to be strong drivers of behavior. We found no role for RST traits in attitudes toward lockdown. Overall, coronavirus-related behavior is not driven purely by fear, but also by social and/or protection goals regulated by approach motivation. This study presents new insights into public perceptions of coronavirus and government regulated lifestyle restrictions, helping to explain social behaviors in terms of biologically driven mechanisms. Such understanding is vital if we are to successfully motivate public behavior to constrain spread of the virus.

AB  - Some aspects of our attitudes are composed of things outside of our consciousness. However, traditional survey research does not use measurements that are able to tap into these aspects of public opinion. We describe, recommend, and demonstrate a procedure by which non-self-reported responses can be measured in order to test whether these responses have independent effects on individuals' preferences. We use one of the better-known physiological measures-electrodermal activity or skin conductance-and illustrate its potential by reporting our own study of attitudes toward President Barack Obama. We find that both self-reported emotional responses and physiological responses to Obama's image independently correlate with variation in the intensity of attitudes regarding his job approval and his central policy proposal: health-care reform.

AB  - Purpose With the emergence of zoonoses such as Ebola, many medical educators, have recommended the need for providing Interprofessional Education (IPE) as a pedagogical tool for familiarizing medical (MD) students with the framework of One Health (OH). This is important as students need to understand, the wider impacts of animal and environmental health factors on human health. IPE initiatives which typically incorporate the principles of OH, can provide MD and veterinary (DVM) students with a greater awareness of the role that animal diseases and climate change have on global health. However, negative attitudes to IPE have been reported as a key limitation to IPE implementation. The purpose of this paper is to examine the differences in readiness for interprofessional learning of medical and other allied human health professional students, including veterinarians and students undertaking dual degrees in combination with a Master of Public Health (MPH). Reflecting on Role Theory (RT) and Social Identity Theory (SIT), the paper aims to contribute to the understanding of differences in perceptions that exist between different types of health professionals. Methods Students at a medical University enrolled in MD, DVM, DVM MPH and MD MPH programs, were invited to complete the standardized Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS), which consists of 19 Likert scale items measuring concepts relating to teamwork, professional identity and roles and responsibilities. A total of 364 students across the four programs took part. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed to assess differences between the programmes. Results Results indicate that MD students score lower on the different RIPLS items compared to DVM, MD MPH and DVM MPH students. DVM and DVM MPH students are generally more positive about the need for teamwork, while MD MPH and DVM MPH students have a stronger positive identity about the need for IPE. Conclusions The findings drawn from this study suggests that the MD students keep on seeing themselves as a separate group of health professionals in their own right. In order to guarantee an increased level of understanding on issues relating to the human-animal-environmental spectrum, medical curricula might benefit from the incorporation of shared learning and teamwork, as occurs within the MPH, enabling students to appreciate the value of interprofessional collaboration to their future practice. This is especially important during a time at which human-animal-environmental issues are affecting social and economic life worldwide.

AB  - Background Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a serious phenomenon on a global scale that can worsen with the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aimed to understand the perceptions of health professionals about MDR-TB, their strategies to ensure adherence to treatment and their challenges in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in a priority municipality for disease control. Methods We conducted a qualitative study and recruited 14 health providers (four doctors, three nurses, three nursing technicians, three nursing assistants and a social worker) working in a city in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Remote semi-structured interviews were conducted with the participants. For data analysis, the thematic content analysis technique was applied according to the study's theoretical framework. Results The study revealed the causes of MDR-TB are associated with poverty, vulnerability, and social risk. A pre-judgement from the providers was observed, namely, all patients do not adhere due their resistance and association with drug abuse or alcoholism. The study also observed difficulty among health providers in helping patients reconstruct and reframe their life projects under a care perspective, which would strengthen adherence. Other issues that weakened adherence were the cuts in social protection and the benefits really necessary to the patients and a challenge for the providers manage that. The participants revealed that their actions were impacted by the pandemic and insecurity and fear manifested by patients after acquiring COVID-19. For alleviating this, medical appointments by telephone, delivery of medicine in the homes of patients and visits by health professionals once per week were provided. Conclusion The study advances knowledge by highlighting the challenges faced by the health system with the adherence of patients with MDR-TB in a context aggravated by the pandemic. An improvement in DOT is really necessary to help the patients reframe their lives without prejudices, face their fears and insecurity, recover their self-esteem and motivate in concluding their treatment.

AB  - Background HIV stigma undermines a person's wellbeing and quality of life and hinders HIV control efforts. This study examined the extent and drivers of HIV stigma in the teaching hospitals in Sana'a City, Yemen. The country has low HIV prevalence (4000 (2000-11,000) per 100,000) and limited HIV control funds, worsened by a long conflict and an economic crisis. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of 320 Yemeni health professionals in all the four teaching hospitals in Sana'a City. Data were collected anonymously, using an adapted self-completed Arabic version of the Health Policy Project HIV Stigma tool. The questionnaire covered the respondents' background, the stigmatising practices, and potential personal and professional drivers of stigma. Results The majority of the participants were: females (68%), 20-39 years old (85%), nurses (84%), and holding a nursing diploma (69%) or a bachelor's degree (27%). None of the hospitals had institutional policies against HIV stigma, and 93% of the participants believed the current infection control measures were inadequate. Less than half of the participants provided care for people living with HIV (PLHIV) (45%), had received HIV training (33%), and were confident that their HIV knowledge was adequate (23%). The majority indicated a preference to test patients for HIV prior to surgical procedures (77%) and disclose positive HIV results to others (99%) without prior knowledge or consent. All the participants had exhibited a form of HIV-related stigmatization, such as avoiding physical contact with PLHIV (87%) or wearing gloves throughout the consultation (96.5%). These practices were significantly correlated with the fear of infection, high perceived risk of infection, and poor work environment (p < 0.05). Conclusion PLHIV face widespread stigmatizing behaviour in the teaching hospitals in Sana'a City, consistent with the higher level of stigma in low HIV prevalence countries and its links to the fear of infection, poor HIV knowledge, and limited funding for HIV control. Stigma reduction interventions are required at institutional and individual levels. In addition, anti-discrimination policies and structural adjustments are needed, in combination with training on HIV and universal precautions, and action to tackle negative attitudes towards PLHIV and key populations.

AB  - The present paper explores Flemish majority members' expectations concerning the acculturation of Turkish minorities. We studied two kinds of antecedents: majority members' perceptions of Turkish minorities' acculturation behavior and their experiences of intergroup contact. The possible mediating role of outgroup affect was also investigated. 247 Flemish high school students completed a survey. Data were analyzed using path analyses. Results show that positive contact experiences and perceiving that Turkish immigrants make efforts to engage in contact with the host group and/or to adopt the host culture are associated with less negative affective reactions towards Turkish migrants. Perceiving that Turkish immigrants maintain their heritage culture is associated with more negative affective reactions. Our results further revealed that increased negative affective reactions are associated with less support for culture maintenance and for contact with the host group but with a higher demand for host culture adoption. The present results also show that expectations of contact engagement and expectations of host culture adoption cannot be considered as equivalent. This implies that results from studies using Berry's conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Berry, 2001) and results from studies using Bourhis' conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Bourhis, Moise, Perreault, & Senecal, 1997) are not directly comparable. Our data also clearly disconfirm the orthogonal structure of the fourfold acculturation model for majority members' acculturation expectations, suggesting that relying on the specific dimensions defining acculturation expectations may constitute a more valid approach to understand ongoing acculturation processes.

AB  - Abundant HCI research exists on the many assistive technologies that provide help with everyday physical and cognitive tasks. However, while a purely assistive approach often casts aging people in passive roles, recent studies suggest that adults may be 'flourishing' way into advanced age, even though implicit ageist prejudices are difficult to eradicate. Negative age-related stereotypes are the hidden and yet urgent issue we address in this study. There is a clear opportunity for an anti-ageist perspective in HCI, an approach that we propose as complementary to assistive technologies: in addition to providing solutions for the aging population, we urgently call for designs about aging, to spark a conversation on age, raise awareness and ultimately contrast ageist stereotypes. We point at empathy as a key element to reconceptualize, at least in part, HCI's contribution to research on aging. We present a design critique of two interactive pieces that, although not without flaws, suggest how future empathy-raising artifacts might be. Our analysis combines pragmatist aesthetics, interaction criticism and ludology, and yields four design tactics (recurring configurations of significant elements) that are generative in bringing about broader design implications towards a different, empathy-based concept of aging in HCI.
   RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS
   We situate our work in the general agenda of designing for 'aging well.'
   Empathy is already a familiar notion in HCI research, and we point at it to reconceptualize - at least in part - how HCI relates to aging adults.
   We select two artifacts, The Graveyard and Alz, as 'objects to think with,' and we produce a design critique leveraging pragmatist aesthetics and interaction criticism.
   In the artifacts, we tease out four configurations of significant elements that reveal a different conceptualization of age and aging.
   Our design critique exemplifies how age-related HCI may move beyond purely assistive approaches, and present aging adults not only as people to assist but also to empathize with.
   More generally, it also suggests a broader reconceptualization of HCI research for/about/with aging people, expanding its scope to include also empathy-raising designs.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the level of knowledge regarding epilepsy and attitudes prevalent toward people with epilepsy (PWE) among Libyan university students in comparison with international data.
   Methods: A self-administrated questionnaire on awareness regarding epilepsy and behaviors toward PWE was distributed among undergraduate students enrolled in the University of Benghazi. The collected data were analyzed against responses from an Italian survey that utilized a similar questionnaire to explore epilepsy-related knowledge and attitudes among Italian university students in Rome (Mecarelli et al., 2007).
   Results: Out of the 500 interviewed students, 96% successfully completed the survey. Further, 96.6% asserted that they possessed some knowledge regarding epilepsy, gained mainly from their families (76.6%). A total of 57.5% considered epilepsy to be a psychiatric disorder while 11.6% recommended psychological tests for the diagnosis of epilepsy. Moreover, 37.5% believed in ancient superstitions, such as possession by evil forces, as the underlying cause of the condition, and 31.8% recommended traditional remedies to cure it. Further, 66.6% deemed epilepsy as a barrier for career prospects, 41% indicated that it presents an impediment in participation in sports, and 35% considered it as an obstacle in marriage. Additionally, epilepsy was perceived as a severe illness by 53.3% of the respondents and considered to be a moderately severe condition by 43.7%. The responses were found to be statistically significant (P < 0.05) against the responses from the Italian study.
   Conclusion: There is a reasonable level of awareness regarding epilepsy among Libyan students, though a lack of accuracy in the acquired knowledge exists. The ancient misconceptions regarding the nature of epilepsy and negative attitudes toward PWE appear to be rather common among the Libyan students. Consequently, the discrepancies in the views between the two surveys concerning the ways in which epilepsy is perceived and PWE are treated were extremely evident, thus reflecting the already established view that epilepsy faces greater stigma as a health condition in developing countries in comparison with Western nations.

AB  - The response to the pandemic requires access to accurate information and public understanding and adherence to preventive measures. This online cross-sectional study of adult Poles (n = 1337) assessed the frequency of COVID-19 preventive behaviors, fears related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and beliefs in COVID-19-related conspiracy theories during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic when the nationwide lockdown was imposed (April 2020). As shown, 22% of surveyed admitted not to wash their hands frequently, while 12% did not use disinfectants. These two behaviors were also less frequent in individuals with medical education. The highest levels of pandemic-related fears were associated with health loss in relatives, pandemic-induced economic crisis, and government using a pandemic to control citizens by the state. A significant share of surveyed individuals believed that the pandemic was intentional action to weaken non-Chinese economies (32%) or was deliberately induced for profits from selling vaccines (27%). Men, individuals with no children, and subjects with lower education were significantly less likely to adhere to sanitary measures (handwashing, disinfection, avoiding face touching, changes in greeting etiquette, face-covering when coughing or sneezing), and were less concerned over self and relatives' health. At the same time, men were less prone than women to the conspiracy theories related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate that adherence to sanitary measures during the pandemic can be a challenge also in developed countries, while misinformation campaigns (also concerning vaccines) have already affected the general public during the early phase of the epidemiological outbreak. The study provides observations that may be useful in the management of the public response to future epidemics.

AB  - The scale-up of effective treatment has partially reduced the stigma attached to HIV, but HIV still remains highly stigmatized throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Most studies of anti-HIV stigma interventions have employed psycho-educational strategies such as information provision, counseling, and testimonials, but these have had varying degrees of success. Theory suggests that livelihood interventions could potentially reduce stigma by weakening the instrumental and symbolic associations between HIV and premature morbidity, economic incapacity, and death, but this hypothesis has not been directly examined. We conducted a longitudinal qualitative study among 54 persons with HIV participating in a 12-month randomized controlled trial of a livelihood intervention in rural Kenya. Our study design permitted assessment of changes over time in the perspectives of treatment-arm participants (N = 45), as well as an understanding of the experiences of control arm participants (N = 9, interviewed only at follow-up). Initially, participants felt ashamed of their seropositivity and were socially isolated (internalized stigma). They also described how others in the community discriminated against them, labeled them as being "already dead," and deemed them useless and unworthy of social investment (perceived and enacted stigma). At follow-up, participants in the treatment arm described less stigma and voiced positive changes in confidence and self-esteem. Concurrently, they observed that other community members perceived them as active, economically productive, and contributing citizens. None of these changes were noted by participants in the control arm, who described ongoing and continued stigma. In summary, our findings suggest a theory of stigma reduction: livelihood interventions may reduce internalized stigma among persons with HIV and also, by targeting core drivers of negative attitudes toward persons with HIV, positively change attitudes toward persons with HIV held by others. Further research is needed to formally test these hypotheses, assess the extent to which these changes endure over the long term, and determine whether this class of interventions can be implemented at scale.

AB  - Objective: Epilepsy has long been considered by the society as a dangerous and frightening spiritual possession or even a contagious disease. This results in an unavoidable embarrassment for both the patient and the family leading to social isolation, seclusion, and secretiveness about the diagnosis. The aim of this study was to determine the stigmatizing level of the general Turkish population and to compare these results with the stigmatizing level of the patients' relatives group (PRG).
   Methods: This is a substudy of our main study which aimed to develop two scales for the quantification of the stigma level in patients with epilepsy (PWE) and their relatives (Stigma Scale for Epilepsy (SSE) -Self Report (SR) and -Informant Report (IR)]. First-degree relatives of the patients had been included in the main study. For the present study, 202 healthy people who were caregivers and relatives of neurologic patients other than epilepsy were recruited for the control group (CG). A sociodemographic and clinical data form and SSE-IR scale were administered to the CG as well. The relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and SSE-IR scores was evaluated, and a regression analysis was performed in order to analyze sociodemographic factors contributing to SSE-IR scores. Stigmatizing levels were compared between PRG and CG. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 22.0 software.
   Results: Comparison of stigma scores among different sociodemographic strata of the CG showed that there was a statistically significant difference in terms of educational status and occupation (p < 0.01). Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that education accounted for 10.8% and 8.9% of the variance in the SSE-IR scale respectively in the PRG and the CG. Prejudgment scores and total scores of the PRG were significantly higher than those of the CG. There was no statistically significant difference between two groups in terms of discrimination and false beliefs subscales scores. The proportion of highly stigmatizor participants in the PRG was statistically significantly higher than that of the CG.
   Discussion/Conclusions: This study showed us that the stigmatization levels in a group of subjects drawn from general population without acquaintance of epilepsy were lower than the relatives of the patients. This result may be partially explained by the ambivalent attitudes of the relatives, as those high scores may stem from not only enacted but also the felt stigma that they were experiencing themselves. It must be a warning sign for both of all the clinicians treating epilepsy and national association against epilepsy, as well as public health officials to increase efforts for awareness raising.

AB  - The question of whether high immigration produces anti-immigration hostility has vexed researchers across multiple disciplines for decades. And yet, understanding this relationship is crucial for countries dependant on immigrant labour but concerned about its impact on social cohesion. Absent from most of this research are theories about the impact of early-years socialisation conditions on contemporary attitudes. Using the British sample of the European Social Survey (2002-2017) and two innovative approaches to modelling generational differences - generalised additive models and hierarchical age-period-cohort models - this paper shows that rather than producing hostility to immigration, being socialised in a context of high immigrant-origin diversity is likely to result in more positive attitudes to immigration later in life. This implies that through generational replacement, countries like the UK are likely to become increasingly tolerant of immigration over time. Importantly, however, a context of high-income inequality may diminish this effect.

AB  - RESUME Les associations entre les variables psychosociaux et les comportements de conduite ont ete examines seulement en coupe transversale a ce jour. Dans cette etude, nous avons utilise trois vagues de donnees recueillies chaque annee de 928 conducteurs ages (age moyen = 76.21 ans; 62% d'hommes) s'inscrits pour la cohorte Candrive II, afin de determiner si des changements dans les attitudes et les perceptions a l'egard de conduire (l'equilibre decisionnel et le confort a la conduite de jour comme de nuit) ont ete associes a des limitations a la conduite rapportees chez les aines et de leurs capacites percues a conduire. Des modeles a plusieurs niveaux ont revele que plus de personnes agees qui ont montre une augmentation des attitudes negatives a l'egard de conduite etaient plus susceptibles de declarer la pratique de plus en plus restreinte (on evite souvent des situations difficiles de conduite) et des baisses percues dans la capacite de conduire, par rapport aux individus dont les attitudes envers la conduite restaient stable au cours de deux annees. Ce travail confirme les resultats precedents et offre une nouvelle comprehension de la facon dont les attitudes ont trait aux perceptions de conduite (c'est-a-dire, le confort), et l'auto-regulation chez les personnes agees au fil du temps.
   ABSTRACT To date, associations between psychosocial driving variables and behaviour have been examined only cross-sectionally. Using three waves of data collected annually from 928 older drivers (mean age = 76.21 years; 62% male) enrolled in the Candrive II cohort, we examined in this study whether changes in attitudes and perceptions towards driving (decisional balance and day and night driving comfort) were associated with changes in older adults' reported restrictions in driving practices and perceived driving abilities. Multi-level models revealed that older adults who showed an increase in negative attitudes towards driving over time were more likely to report more-restricted practices (greater avoidance of challenging driving situations) and perceived declines in driving abilities compared to individuals whose attitudes towards driving remained stable across two years. This work supports previous findings and offers a new understanding of how attitudes relate to driving perceptions (e.g., comfort) and self-regulation in older adults over time.

TI  - The Accuracy of Dermatology Network Physician Directories Posted by Medicare Advantage Health Plans in an Era of Narrow Networks
T2  - JAMA DERMATOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - IMPORTANCE Insurers are increasingly deploying "narrow networks" with fewer contracted physicians both in health plans offered in new state exchanges under the Affordable Care Act and in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, which are commercial alternatives offered to Medicare beneficiaries. Patients choosing health plans rely on the accuracy of network directories posted by insurers. The MA plans must meet network adequacy requirements, and inaccurate directories of participating physicians might prejudice those determinations.
   OBJECTIVE To determine the accuracy of MA plan directories of participating dermatologists, and the appointment availability of listed physicians.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Scripted telephone calls were placed to every dermatologist listed in directories for the largest MA plans in 12 US metropolitan areas. The caller sought an appointment on behalf of his fictitious father who had severe itch for several months, asked whether the dermatologist accepted the relevant plan, and asked for the next available appointment date.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Appointment availability and wait time.
   RESULTS Among 4754 total physician listings, 45.5% represented duplicates in the same plan directory. Among the remaining unique listings, 48.9% of physicians were reachable, accepted the listed plan, and offered an appointment for our fictitious patient. Many of the dermatologists listed had incorrect contact information, were deceased, retired, or had moved, were not accepting new patients, did not accept the insurance plan, or were subspecialized. The mean (range) wait time for appointments among the remaining listings was 45.5 (1-414) days. Both the accuracy of network directories and the appointment wait times varied substantially by health plan and metropolitan area. For 1 plan, our caller was unable to obtain an appointment with any listed dermatologist.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Medicare Advantage physician directories for dermatology in many areas substantially overestimate the number of in-network physicians available to treat patients with medical skin conditions. These inaccuracies occurred in areas with long appointment wait times and where plans are terminating selected physician contracts. This suggests a lack of capacity that would be exacerbated by further network narrowing. Accurate physician directories are essential for proper oversight of network adequacy, and for patients who rely on these listings to evaluate health plan options during open enrollment.

AB  - Background: Untold numbers of women worldwide are survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) with a substantial number of these experiencing co-occurring mental health and substance use problems. Despite the complex interconnections among these problems, funding mechanisms and organizational structures and mandates have been designed to address just a single, focal problem. One of the challenges for frontline providers is the lack of effective, evidence-informed inter-professional education or training to help them identify and appropriately respond to co-occurring problems. We developed an evidence-informed, competency-based curriculum to address this gap. In this paper we report on its effectiveness in increasing knowledge, changing beliefs and enhancing skills of frontline workers from all three sectors.
   Methods: The curriculum consists of multiple elements: a text manual; an interactive, online series of modules; and, an in-person workshop. Frontline workers (n = 1111) in the violence against women (VAW) (n = 499), mental health (n = 229), addiction treatment (n = 167), and associated sectors (n = 149) were recruited to attend the workshop and instructed to read the manual or complete the online modules before attending. Some failed to respond (n = 67). Online pre-and post-tests were used to assess changes in knowledge, beliefs and skills; evaluations of the workshop were also collected.
   Results: Matched pre- and post-tests were available for over half of the participants (n = 624). Results show statistically significant improvements across all six competency domains from pre to post-test (p < 0.0001). Significant changes in participants' knowledge and stigmatizing beliefs were achieved. There was no correlation among differences in sector, age, size of organization, years of experience or prior training. Participant feedback made evident prior misconceptions about women experiencing co-occurring problems, improved understanding about the need to bridge silos, as well as the need for enhanced self-care.
   Conclusions: An educational intervention designed to sensitize frontline workers to the realities of women's experiences of co-occurring problems, educate about the challenges of accessing help when there are co-occurring problems, and bridge discipline and practice-based silos, can effectively challenge and alter providers' negative attitudes and stigmatizing beliefs.

AB  - Objective To investigate the COVID-19 vaccination coverage rate and differences among various COVID-19 prevention primary healthcare (PHC) facilities in China and understand their attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine. These findings are helpful to provide important suggestions to further improve national COVID-19 vaccination rate. Design A nationwide cross-sectional online survey was designed and conducted among COVID-19 prevention and control management teams at PHC facilities in mainland China. In the self-designed questionnaires, each subject was asked to evaluate on a 1-10 scale (10=extremely important/acceptable/influential) the COVID-19 vaccination importance, acceptance and factors related to vaccine hesitancy. Setting Subjects from 31 provinces and autonomous regions including minorities across mainland China were invited to complete the questionnaire between 22 February 2021 and 2 March 2021. Participants Were selected by multistage stratified sampling, 998 valid questionnaires (valid rate 99.11%) were collected. The respondents were divided into group A (<= 5 respondents within each PHC facility, n(1)=718) and group B (>5 respondents within each PHC facility, n(2)=280). Outcome measures Survey on vaccination rate and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine included the following: (1) if the subjects think the vaccination is important in containment of COVID-19 pandemic (1-10 scale, 10=extremely important), (2) if they would accept COVID-19 vaccine (1-10 scale, 10=extremely acceptable) and (3) their opinions on 7 factors possibly related to vaccine hesitancy (1-10 scale, 10=extremely influential). All the items were designed based on the previous expert interviews. Results Our results showed vaccination rate was greater in group A (85.93%) than in group B (66.43%) (p<0.001). Detailed analyses revealed that in group A, male members were twice as likely to get vaccinated as compared with female members (adjusted OR (aOR): 2.07; 95% CI: 1.26 to 3.43, p=0.004). In group B, those who were at or under the median age had twice the odds of vaccination coverage compared with those who were over the median age (aOR: 2.29; 95% CI: 1.22 to 4.33, p=0.010). In addition, those who were specialised in traditional Chinese medicine were less likely to get vaccinated against COVID-19 compared with those who were specialised in general medicine, with the aOR: 0.10 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.83, p=0.033). By analysing the factors that influenced the vaccination attitudes among the 998 respondents, we found no significant difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. However, further detailed analyses found that team members with undergraduate college education were less likely to score higher in COVID-19 vaccination importance than those with technical secondary school education (aOR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.93, p=0.035); Furthermore, those with non-medical job titles had nearly twice the odds of giving a higher score for the uncertainty of vaccine efficacy compared with those with junior medical titles (aOR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.85, p=0.016). Team members with a non-medical title were more likely to give a higher score for advice on social sources compared with those with a junior medical title (aOR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.85, p=0.042). Conclusion In PHC facilities, although there was a higher COVID-19 vaccination rate among COVID-19 prevention and control teams, some subgroups with different descriptive characters showed negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination.
   Because primary care workers in China are highly expected to receive the vaccination, and support and educate the public for COVID-19 vaccination. Thus, it is important and necessary to continue to educate them about their vaccination concerns and change their attitudes towards vaccination. Our findings are highly beneficial for designing public vaccination education strategies.

AB  - Background Medical regulators worldwide have implemented programmes of maintenance of professional competence (MPC) to ensure that doctors, throughout their careers, are up to date and fit to practice. The introduction of MPC required doctors to adopt a range of new behaviours. Despite high enrolment rates on these programmes, it remains uncertain whether doctors engage in the process because they perceive benefits like improvements in their practice and professional development or if they solely meet the requirements to retain medical registration. In this study, we aimed to explore the relationship between doctors' beliefs, intention and behaviour regarding MPC through the lens of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to make explicit the factors that drive meaningful engagement with the process. Methods We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. From a pool of 1258 potential participants, we purposively selected doctors from multiple specialities, age groups, and locations across Ireland. We used thematic analysis, and the TPB informed the analytic coding process. Results Forty-one doctors participated in the study. The data analysis revealed doctors' intention and behaviour and the factors that shape their engagement with MPC. We found that attitudes and beliefs about the benefits and impact of MPC mediated the nature of doctors' engagement with the process. Some participants perceived positive changes in practice and other gains from participating in MPC, which facilitated committed engagement with the process. Others believed MPC was unfair, unnecessary, and lacking any benefit, which negatively influenced their intention and behaviour, and that was demonstrated by formalistic engagement with the process. Although participants with positive and negative attitudes shared perceptions about barriers to participation, such perceptions did not over-ride strongly positive beliefs about the benefits of MPC. While the requirements of the regulator strongly motivated doctors to participate in MPC, beliefs about patient expectations appear to have had less impact on intention and behaviour. Conclusions The findings of this study broaden our understanding of the determinants of doctors' intention and behaviour regarding MPC, which offers a basis for designing targeted interventions. While the barriers to engagement with MPC resonate with previous research findings, our findings challenge critical assumptions about enhancing doctors' engagement with the process. Overall, our results suggest that focused policy initiatives aimed at strengthening the factors that underpin the intention and behaviour related to committed engagement with MPC are warranted.

AB  - Objective Transdiagnostic cognitive behaviour therapy (TCBT) is an efficacious treatment for anxiety and depression, but its mechanisms of change remain poorly understood. The current study used thematic framework analysis to analyse how patients, recruited in a recent trial on transdiagnostic group CBT (TGCBT), understood the treatment and its mechanisms.
   Design Cross-sectional thematic framework analysis.
   Method The sample included 24 participants suffering from anxiety and/or depression, divided into two groups by treatment efficacy (i.e., group doing well and group doing not so well) in order to evaluate whether different understandings of the treatment affected its efficacy. The participants were interviewed and completed self-report measures. They were encouraged to discuss what they believed to be helpful and unhelpful in the TGCBT and what they believed to be the mechanisms of change in the treatment. Each interview was recorded, transcribed verbatim and themes were identified.
   Results The analysis revealed four overarching themes and 18 subthemes. The overarching themes were as follows: Cognitive and behavioural flexibility, Awareness/understanding of symptoms and triggers, Therapeutic alliance and engagement, and finally Attitudes towards treatment. Four of the 18 subthemes corresponded to a differentiation between the groups: Cognitive flexibility and Comparison with others in the group on the one hand and Cognitive inflexibility and Negative attitudes towards treatment on the other.
   Conclusion The most important difference between the groups appeared to be CBT-specific, that is, cognitive flexibility that characterized the group doing well where thematic analysis did not indicate that other themes were important.
   Practitioner points
   Findings
   The analysis revealed four overarching themes and 18 subthemes, four of which corresponded to the difference between the two groups of participants based on treatment efficacy.
   The four differentiating subthemes were cognitive flexibility and comparison with others, which characterized the group doing well, and cognitive inflexibility and negative attitude towards treatment, which characterized the group doing less well.
   The theme evaluated as the most important for the efficacy of the transdiagnostic cognitive behaviour therapy and patients' understanding of the treatment was cognitive flexibility, which characterized the group doing well.
   Limitations
   Use of qualitative methodology restricts the generalizability of our results.
   Data are built on answers from only 24 participants.

But does this potential necessarily exhibit itself in an intergroup contact setting where all groups are present? We study Palestinian Citizens of Israel (PCI) at Seeds of Peace, a three-week program with PCI, Jewish Israeli, and Palestinian teens. By analyzing which camp participants the PCI list as close and which participants list PCI as close, we find that PCI associate with Palestinians at an especially high rate. Importantly, PCI are even more popular among Palestinians and less popular among Jewish Israelis than are Palestinians. We explain these results with an identity assertion hypothesis in which the PCI assert their Palestinian identity through their relationships.

AB  - Conditions under which implicit and explicit impressions of an individual may change in response to new information were investigated in two experiments. Participants formed an impression of a target person based on his membership in a social group and, in some conditions, detailed behavioral evidence. Later, half of the participants were given reason to believe that the initial information they had been given was wrong, and that the target actually belonged to a different social group. Implicit and explicit measures of participants' impressions of the target were then collected. Results indicated that, while explicit impressions were effectively corrected in light of new information, implicit impressions continued to reflect initial beliefs (Experiments 1 and 2). However, when given the opportunity to re-examine the original behavioral information, implicit measures also reflected a change in participants' impressions (Experiment 2). The role of elaboration in determining implicit and explicit impression change is discussed.

AB  - Background: Despite global efforts, HIV-related stigma continues to negatively impact the health and well-being of people living with HIV/AIDS. Even in healthcare settings, people with HIV/AIDS experience discrimination. Anecdotal evidence suggests that healthcare professionals in the Lao People's Democratic Republic, a lower-middle income country situated in Southeast Asia, stigmatize HIV/AID patients. The purpose of this study was to assess HIV stigmatizing attitudes within Laotian healthcare service providers and examine some of the factors associated with HIV/AIDS-related stigma among doctors and nurses.
   Methods: A structured questionnaire, which included a HIV-related stigma scale consisting of 17 items, was self-completed by 558 healthcare workers from 12 of the 17 hospitals in Vientiane. Five hospitals were excluded because they had less than 10 staff and these staff were not always present. The questionnaire was pre-tested with 40 healthcare workers. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed and comparisons between groups undertaken using chi-square test and t-test. Bivariate and multiple linear regression analyses were carried out to examine the associations between stigmatizing attitudes and independent variables.
   Results: Out of the 558 participating healthcare workers, 277 (49.7%) were doctors and 281 (50.3%) were nurses. Nearly 50% of doctors and nurses included in the study had high levels of stigmatizing attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS. Across the different health professionals included in this study, lower levels of HIV/AIDS knowledge were associated with higher levels of stigmatizing attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS. Stigmatizing attitudes, including discrimination at work, fear of AIDS, and prejudice, were lower in healthcare workers with more experience in treating HIV/AIDS patients.
   Conclusions: This study is the first to report on HIV/AIDS-related stigmatization among healthcare workers in Lao PDR. Stigmatizing attitudes contribute to missed opportunities for prevention, education and treatment, undermining efforts to manage and prevent HIV. Reversing stigmatizing attitudes and practices requires interventions that address affective, cognitive and behavioral aspects of stigma. Alongside this, health professionals need to be enabled to enact universal precautions and prevent occupational transmission of HIV.

AB  - This article provides experimental empirical evidence on the penalization of a father of high professional status who decides to use a family friendly measure (FFM) offered by his company. A cross-cultural sample of university students (in the field of Business Administration and Economics) from Ghana and Spain was used to evaluate a hypothetical male employee who after the birth of their child either used a reduction of the working day or worked traditional hours. We compared the results with those obtained for an identical female employee. We considered several variables that mediated the effect of using the FFM on the behavior proxy items. We also considered the participants' (explicit and implicit) attitudes towards fathers caring for their babies. We obtained strong empirical evidence on the penalization of a father who uses a reduction of the working day. However, and contrary to expectations, in Spain this penalty experienced by the father was similar to that experienced by the mother, while in Ghana it was greater.

AB  - Background: Despite the high prevalence of alcohol use disorders (AUDs), in 2016, only 7.8% of individuals meeting diagnostic criteria received any type of AUD treatment. Developing options for treatment within primary care settings is imperative to increase treatment access. As part of a trial to implement AUD pharmacotherapy in primary care settings, this qualitative study analyzed pre-implementation provider interviews using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to identify implementation barriers.
   Methods: Three large Veterans Health Administration facilities participated in the implementation intervention. Local providers were trained to serve as implementation/clinical champions and received external facilitation from the project team. Primary care providers received a dashboard of patients with AUD for case identification, educational materials, and access to consultation from clinical champions. Veterans with AUD diagnoses received educational information in the mail. Prior to the start of implementation activities, 24 primary care providers (5-10 per site) participated in semi-structured interviews. Transcripts were analyzed using common coding techniques for qualitative data using the CFIR codebook Innovation/Intervention Characteristics, Outer Setting, Inner Setting, and Characteristics of Individuals domains. Number and type of barriers identified were compared to quantitative changes in AUD pharmacotherapy prescribing rates.
   Results: Four major barriers emerged across all three sites: complexity of providing AUD pharmacotherapy in primary care, the limited compatibility of AUD treatment with existing primary care processes, providers' limited knowledge and negative beliefs about AUD pharmacotherapy and providers' negative attitudes toward patients with AUD. Site specific barriers included lack of relative advantage of providing AUD pharmacotherapy in primary care over current practice, complaints about the design quality and packaging of implementation intervention materials, limited priority of addressing AUD in primary care and limited available resources to implement AUD pharmacotherapy in primary care.
   Conclusions: CFIR constructs were useful for identifying pre-implementation barriers that informed refinements to the implementation intervention.The number and type of pre-implementation barriers identified did not demonstrate a clear relationship to the degree to which sites were able to improve AUD pharmacotherapy prescribing rate. Site-level implementation process factors such as leadership support and provider turn-over likely also interacted with pre-implementation barriers to drive implementation outcomes.

AB  - People endorse colorblind and genderblind ideologies to appear unbiased toward race or gender, but although they have similar meanings these two ideologies have not been compared across public and private contexts. Given that laws make both gender and race discrimination illegal in public settings, such as schools and workplaces, people may hold similar ideologies in public, professional settings. However, differences in how gender and race are viewed in private contexts, such as friendships or families, could contribute to differential endorsement and use of the ideologies. The current research measured the self-reported endorsement of genderblind or colorblind ideologies in different contexts (Studies 2 and 3) and a behavioral manifestation of blindness within a decision-making paradigm (Studies 1, 2, and 3). In this paradigm, participants imagined themselves in an academic and/or social situation and chose which of two targets of different genders or races should join them in a group. Being blind to race or gender involved opting out of this choice. Participants also rated the appropriateness of using gender and race to make these decisions (Study 3). As predicted, in private, social situations participants (a) endorsed colorblindness more than genderblindness, (b) were more likely to show blind decision-making in cross-race than cross-gender choices, and (c) perceived race-based decisions as more inappropriate than gender-based decisions. In public (academic and work) situations, colorblind and genderblind measures were equivalent. Thus, people's beliefs about the value of being blind to gender and race differ in social situations and this difference has implications for equality.

AB  - In three studies (N = 340), we tested whether vocal cues to a person's sexual orientation prompted sexual orientation discrimination in heterosexual individuals when hiring leaders. Our results inform how gender and sexual orientation intersect to produce discriminatory effects in the hiring context. Heterosexual participants listened to short clips of voices that sounded like job candidate was a lesbian or heterosexual woman, or a gay or heterosexual man, and rated all for job suitability and employability. Candidates applied for jobs as leaders (Study 1), as leaders or assistants (Study 2), and for leadership roles that varied in both gender role and status (Study 3). Sexual orientation discrimination occurred in all three studies and was greater among women job candidates. Refuting role congruity theory, several findings disconfirmed the prediction that lesbian-sounding women would be advantaged when stereotyped as masculine and when applying for leadership roles. Rather, in line with status-beliefs theory, lesbian-sounding women and gay-sounding men were rated and ranked poorly to the extent that they were perceived as less competent than heterosexual candidates. Findings suggest that hiring discrimination occurs in subtle ways, such as when individuals sound gay/lesbian. This has implications for recruitment as well as sexual-orientation discrimination court cases.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the idea of inclusion in women's bottom-up peacebuilding in Ghana. Inspired by the growing importance of "inclusion" and "local empowerment" in the discourse and practice of local ownership in peacebuilding, this paper seeks to investigate the scope and degree of inclusion of key actors such as women and youth, and how that affects peacebuilding and sustainable peace in some conflict-affected zones. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts a cross-sectional case study design and qualitative strategy. It is based on semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions conducted with actors who have been engaged in grassroots peacebuilding in Ghana and West Africa. The analysis was largely inductive, identifying emerging themes and patterns in the research data. Findings The findings indicate that young women are usually absent or not engaged meaningfully in the mobilization of women and youth in the "inclusive" grassroots peacebuilding in Ghana. This is due to the prevalence of deep-seated cultural and political prejudices or stereotypes about women in the areas studied. As these local constructs and thus practices are difficult to change or challenge, peacebuilding non-governmental organizations (NGOs) usually deploy innovative ways by mobilizing socially constructed women's positionalities - as "whistleblowers," "cross-ethnic/cross-cultural actors" and "socially networked actors" - in ways that promote women in contemporary peacebuilding discourses and practices. Through mobilizing these stereotypes (to forestall possible provocation, especially from dominant actors or gatekeepers), peacebuilding NGOs have subtly positioned women centrally within a vibrant peace infrastructure in Ghana. Yet, due to the dominance of some patriarchal sociopolitical structures, only older women and young men occupy the spaces for women and youth's peacebuilding. Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge, this is one of the first research papers to question not only the scope but also the degree of inclusion and participation of women in peacebuilding in sub-Sahara Africa. This has nuanced scholarly debates on the subject and encouraged the development of innovative programmes targeted at a more comprehensive gendered and youth-ed inclusion to address the inequality gap in peacebuilding discourses and practices.

AB  - In secularized modern Western societies, moral opposition to the liberalization of abortion, gay adoption, euthanasia, and suicide often relies on justifications based on other-oriented motives (mainly, protection of the weak, e.g., children). Moreover, some argue that the truly open-minded people may be those who, against the stream, oppose the established dominant liberal values in modern societies. We investigated whether moral and religious opposition to, vs. the acceptance of, the above four issues, as well as the endorsement of respective con vs. pro arguments reflect (a) "compassionate openness" (prosocial, interpersonal, dispositions and existential flexibility), (b) "compassionate conservatism" (prosocial dispositions and collectivistic moral concerns), or (c) "self-centered moral rigorism" (collectivistic moral concerns, low existential quest, and low humility instead of prosocial dispositions). The results, to some extent, confirmed the third pattern. Thus, compassionate openness does not seem to underline modern moral opposition, possibly in contrast to some rhetoric of the latter.

AB  - Aim: To investigate nursing students' perceptions of spirituality and spiritual care.
   Background: Spirituality is an essential part of holistic care but often neglected in practice. Barriers to spiritual care include limited educational preparation, negative attitudes towards spirituality, confusion about nurses' role, perceptions of incompetence and avoidance of spiritual matters. There is limited knowledge about students' perspectives of spirituality and spiritual care. Previous studies have predominantly focused on educational approaches to enhance spirituality. The next generation of clinicians may have different world-views, cultural beliefs and values about spirituality and spiritual care from current nurses. There is a need to understand students' views and how their spiritual development is shaped in order to inform pre-registration education.
   Method: A cross-sectional survey of final-year students from three educational institutions in Singapore was conducted from April to August 2010. Data included demographic details and responses on a new composite tool, the Spiritual Care Giving Scale (SCGS).
   Results: A response rate of 61.9% (n=745 out of 1204) was achieved. The lowest mean score was item 9, "Without spirituality, a person is not considered whole". Highest mean was item 2, "Spirituality is an important aspect of human being". Factor 5 (Spiritual Care Values) had the lowest mean with Factor 2 (Sprituality Perspectives) the highest. Participants considered spirituality as essential to being human; developmental in nature; and vital for individuals' state of well-being. Attributes important for spiritual care were identified. Multivariate analyses showed positive association between participants' scores and institution but not with other variables.
   Conclusion: Participating student nurses reported a high level of spiritual awareness that was not constrained by age. Students affirmed the importance of spiritual awareness in order to address the spiritual needs of patients. There was some congruence between the perceptions of students in this ethno-culturally diverse Asian sample and responses by students in the UK and North America on the personal attributes needed to provide spiritual care. Comparative studies using the SCGS could inform our understanding of spirituality and best pedagogical approaches to develop spiritual awareness across the curricula and in clinical practice.

AB  - Background: For many autistic individuals approaching adulthood, interventions to promote skills toward independence are lacking. Driving is an important ability to cultivate as it may be a critical step to attaining independence, securing and maintaining work, and fostering relationships. Only about one third of able autistic individuals drive independently, and fear to drive is a common reason for not driving.
   Methods: This initial pilot study was a 3-month open trial to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and initial estimates of outcomes for the newly developed Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Driving (CBID) intervention, a manualized curriculum to enhance executive functioning (EF) and emotional regulation (ER) skill development for driving, combined with individualized commentary-based driving simulator practice, in autistic teens and adults within a community research environment. Nineteen participants received the CBID intervention in 1.5-hour group sessions for 10 weeks, across two cohorts, with approximately five individualized driving simulator sessions. Data were collected on anxiety symptoms, driving cognitions, driving attitudes, and simulated driving performance at pre- and post-intervention assessments.
   Results: Program completion rate was 81%. Participants and parents rated both the intervention and simulator practice sessions with high satisfaction. All the participants (100%) reported both a positive attitude change (interest toward driving) and a desire to drive in the future at the post-intervention assessment. Significant changes occurred for driving cognitions, attitudes, and behaviors, and 47% of participants obtained a driver's permit or license by 2 months post-intervention.
   Conclusions: For autistic individuals, the CBID intervention appeared to directly impact the pursuit toward driving goals by both increasing driving attitudes and behaviors and reducing anxiety/apprehension. This highlights the need for driving intervention programs designed specific to autistic teens/adults that focus on EF and ER skills coupled with individualized simulator practice. CBID could be provided in community services to increase the number of autistic individuals driving.
   Lay summary
   Why was this study done?
   Driving contributes greatly to independence in many teens and adults. Anxiety can act as a barrier to that independence by affecting driving attitudes, ability and performance. Autistic individuals are often affected by anxiety, executive functioning, and emotion regulation challenges. Previous studies show that virtual reality training and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), separately, can reduce driving anxiety in autistic individuals and support driving skills. However, to date, no studies have developed and tested a manualized intervention specific to driving that combines such methods.
   What was the purpose of this study?
   The goal of this study was to develop and test a group intervention, called Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Driving (CBID), combined with individualized, coached driving simulator practice to help reduce fears and increase cognitions, attitudes and performance towards driving.
   The study examined the following questions: 1) Do autistic individuals actively participate in CBID? 2) Do autistic participants like CBID? and 3) Are autistic participants more prepared to drive after taking part in CBID than they were before they participated in the program?
   What did the researchers do?
   After developing the CBID intervention with community member involvement, the researchers ran 2 intervention groups and individualized driving simulator sessions to a total of 19 enrolled participants. The group intervention focused on strengthening executive functioning and emotion regulation skills in 1.5 hour sessions over 10 weeks and 5, 1 hour driving simulator sessions. Researchers compared data on participant anxiety levels, driving cognitions, attitudes, and performance before and after the intervention.
   What were the results of the study?
   Most of the participants completed the program (81%) and all (100%) rated satisfaction with the group and simulator practice. All (100%) of the participants changed attitudes towards driving. Participants had higher levels of positive thoughts about driving, better attitudes towards wanting to drive and less driving errors (like speeding, collisions, crossing lanes) on the driving simulator after completing CBID. Almost half (47%) of participants obtained a driver's permit or license by 2 months after the intervention.
   What do these findings add to what was already known?
   This study adds a new option of an integrated approach, CBID, for addressing driving anxiety or apprehension. It provides initial findings of the value of incorporating executive functioning skills with traditional cognitive behavior therapy for enhancing driving readiness.
   What are the potential weaknesses in the study?
   This study contained a small sample size that was mostly white male participants. This limits generalizing the results to a representative diverse population. It also did not have a control group or use randomization which means that results can't be interpreted as causal at this time. There was no information about participants obtaining permit/licensure later than 2 months after CBID so it is unclear if some participants require more time to pursue a license. There was no follow up to understand if participants continued to feel comfortable driving overtime.
   How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future?
   This study showed that it's possible to combine virtual reality training and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy into one driving readiness program. The new CBID program may help autistic adults by addressing multiple aspects of what they need to be ready to drive. Since the study used previously tested strategies, enrolled a community sample, manualized the program, and used a services approach, it was designed for broad distribution to other community settings.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 vaccine is considered to be the most promising approach to alleviate the pandemic. However, in recent surveys, acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine has been low. To design more effective outreach interventions, there is an urgent need to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines.
   Objective: Our objective was to analyze the potential of leveraging transfer learning to detect tweets containing opinions, attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward COVID-19 vaccines, and to explore temporal trends as well as automatically extract topics across a large number of tweets.
   Methods: We developed machine learning and transfer learning models to classify tweets, followed by temporal analysis and topic modeling on a dataset of COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets posted from November 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. We used the F1 values as the primary outcome to compare the performance of machine learning and transfer learning models. The statistical values and P values from the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test were used to assess whether users' perceptions changed over time. The main topics in tweets were extracted by latent Dirichlet allocation analysis.
   Results: We collected 2,678,372 tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines from 841,978 unique users and annotated 5000 tweets. The F1 values of transfer learning models were 0.792 (95% CI 0.789-0.795), 0.578 (95% CI 0.572-0.584), and 0.614 (95% CI 0.606-0.622) for these three tasks, which significantly outperformed the machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine). The prevalence of tweets containing attitudes and behavioral intentions varied significantly over time. Specifically, tweets containing positive behavioral intentions increased significantly in December 2020. In addition, we selected tweets in the following categories: positive attitudes, negative attitudes, positive behavioral intentions, and negative behavioral intentions. We then identified 10 main topics and relevant terms for each category.
   Conclusions: Overall, we provided a method to automatically analyze the public understanding of COVID-19 vaccines from real-time data in social media, which can be used to tailor educational programs and other interventions to effectively promote the public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.

AB  - Background: Although policy discourses frame integrated Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as essential for contemporary healthcare systems, increased information sharing often raises concerns among patients and the public. This paper examines patient and public views about the security and privacy of EHRs used for health provision, research and policy in the UK.
   Methods: Sequential mixed methods study with a cross-sectional survey (in 2011) followed by focus group discussions (in 2012-2013). Survey participants (N = 5331) were recruited from primary and secondary care settings in West London (UK). Complete data for 2761 (51.8 %) participants were included in the final analysis for this paper. The survey results were discussed in 13 focus groups with people living with a range of different health conditions, and in 4 mixed focus groups with patients, health professionals and researchers (total N = 120). Qualitative data were analysed thematically.
   Results: In the survey, 79 % of participants reported that they would worry about the security of their record if this was part of a national EHR system and 71 % thought the National Health Service (NHS) was unable to guarantee EHR safety at the time this work was carried out. Almost half (47 %) responded that EHRs would be less secure compared with the way their health record was held at the time of the survey. Of those who reported being worried about EHR security, many would nevertheless support their development (55 %), while 12 % would not support national EHRs and a sizeable proportion (33 %) were undecided. There were also variations by age, ethnicity and education. In focus group discussions participants weighed up perceived benefits against potential security and privacy threats from wider sharing of information, as well as discussing other perceived risks: commercial exploitation, lack of accountability, data inaccuracies, prejudice and inequalities in health provision.
   Conclusions: Patient and public worries about the security risks associated with integrated EHRs highlight the need for intensive public awareness and engagement initiatives, together with the establishment of trustworthy security and privacy mechanisms for health information sharing.

AB  - Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) are among the most effective treatments in psychiatry, yet they remain underutilized in clinical practice. Although LAIs are typically used to maintain treatment adherence in patients with chronic schizophrenia, recent research has suggested that they may also provide an effective treatment strategy for patients with early-phase or first-episode disease. In October 2015, a group of 8 experts on the management of schizophrenia and LAIs met to evaluate the evidence surrounding the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of LAIs and to develop practical recommendations regarding the clinical use, education, and unmet needs related to LAIs. Participants were also asked to rate the importance of several patient characteristics when choosing an LAI versus an oral antipsychotic, from the perspectives of 4 different stakeholder groups: patients, health care professionals, families, and payers. The evidence review demonstrated that LAIs are superior to placebo for acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia and, in general, appear to be similar to one another in terms of schizophrenia relapse prevention. Study design impacts the demonstrated efficacy of LAIs versus oral antipsychotics, but recent database and randomized controlled studies favor the use of LAIs in early-phase schizophrenia patients. LAIs vary considerably in their propensity to cause certain adverse effects, including weight gain, metabolic effects, extrapyramidal symptoms, and prolactin elevation, and these differences can be used to help guide LAI selection. Some studies, but not all, have demonstrated significant reductions in health care utilization or overall costs with LAIs. The expert panel identified several barriers to LAI use in current practice, including clinician lack of knowledge, negative attitudes about LAIs, and resource and cost issues. The participants also identified a number of additional factors that should be considered when weighing the use of LAI therapy, including medication adherence, relapse risk and severity, cognitive impairment, ease of use, substance misuse, access and cost, stigma, social support, patient autonomy, control over medication dosing, fear of needles, and the potential for patient harm due to relapses and associated loss of functioning. This evidence review, discussion, and summary recommendations may help clinicians, patients, families, payers, and other stakeholders to better characterize the role of LAIs in the treatment of schizophrenia.

AB  - Background: With increasing acceptance of premarital sex among young Chinese women, the rates of unintended pregnancies and induced abortions are becoming alarmingly high, suggesting the needs of educating women with adequate contraceptive knowledge and providing them with accessible contraceptive services. Previous studies have shown that knowledge and attitudes towards contraception could be modified through intervention strategies. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of two community intervention models on modifying contraceptive attitudes and behaviors among nulliparous women.
   Methods: In this clustered randomized controlled trial, nulliparous women aged 18-40 years from 18 communities were enrolled and randomized to either the traditional community intervention model (TC model) or the more comprehensive new community-based intervention model (NC model) with a ratio of 1: 2. Contraceptive attitudes and behaviors were assessed before and after the interventions.
   Results: A total of 901 nulliparous women were followed. The most common contraceptive method in both groups was condom (approximately 80%) before or after interventions. The rates of using effective contraceptive methods were very low (< 5%) even after the intervention. Comparing the NC with TC group, the adjusted ORs and 95% CIs regarding natural family planning, emergency contraceptive usage and short-acting OCPs were1.53 (95% CI: 1.11-2.13), 2.87 (95% CI: 2.05-4.02), and 2.71 (95% CI: 1.65-4.47), respectively; while the ORs and 95% CIs of gynecological examination and contraceptive use were 2.31 (95% CI: 1.63-3.27) and 2.89 (95% CI: 1.98-4.23), respectively. No statistical significant difference was found for the use of effective contraceptive methods at post-intervention among the two models.
   Conclusions: High proportions of nulliparous women held negative attitudes and behaviors towards effective contraceptive methods. The NC model, integrating existing health resources, had more positive influence than the TC model on the favorable contraceptive attitudes and behaviors towards the use of any contraceptive methods, but had limited impact on the use of effective contraceptive methods. Our study suggested the feasibility of applying the NC model in Shanghai. Interventions on contraceptive attitudes and behaviors should base on the existing health service system, synthesize resources and selectively apply to populations with distinct characteristics.

AB  - Most theories addressing the topic have proposed that threat and fear underlie right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), and many empirical findings have been consistent with this proposition. Important questions, however, remain unanswered, such as whether RWA is associated with fear and threat in general or only specific kinds of fear and threat. Theories of RWA generate markedly different predictions on this issue, particularly with respect to social or personal fears, and whether the association would also hold for the closely related construct of social dominance orientation (SDO). We investigated the issue by asking 463 undergraduate students to rate their feelings of fear, concern, and anxiety to a comprehensive 93-item list of potential fears and threats, which were formulated as either personal or social. Exploratory factors analysis identified five distinct fearthreat factors: Harm to Self, Child, or Country; Personal and Relationship Failures; Environmental and Economic Fears; Political and Personal Uncertainties; and Threats to Ingroup. All the fearthreat factors were correlated with RWA, with the strongest correlations being for Threats to Ingroup, and with stronger effects for social than for personal fears. None of the fear factors correlated with SDO. These relationships were not affected by controlling for Social Desirability or Emotional Stability (EMS). When the intercorrelations between fear factors and EMS were controlled using ridge regression, only Threats to Ingroup predicted RWA. Structural equation modeling indicated good fit for a model in which low levels of EMS had a significant path to Threats to Ingroup, which in turn had a significant path to RWA, and EMS having a significant though weak indirect (fully mediated) inverse effect on RWA. Implications of these findings for theories of authoritarianism and future research are discussed.

AB  - The attitudes of medical students toward transgender people have important implications for the future quality of healthcare for Caribbean transgender patients. This paper examined the attitudes and beliefs of Caribbean medical students toward transgender people, provides psychometric evaluation of a promising instrument, and considers implications for the development of transgender curricula in Caribbean medical education. Medical students (N = 205; 155 women, 43 men, 7 unstated) enrolled at a publicly supported Caribbean university completed the Transgender Attitudes and Beliefs Scale (TABS; Kanamori et al., 2017). Internal consistency was strong for the total TABS (alpha = .93) and more variable for the three subscales: interpersonal comfort (IC: alpha = .91), sex/gender beliefs (SGB: alpha = .89), and human value (HV: alpha = .74). Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated acceptable overall fit for the three-factor model. There were no significant gender differences in overall attitudes toward transgender people as measured by the total TABS score; women reported higher IC scores. Scores were not correlated with age or with year in medical school. Students reported significantly more tolerant attitudes on the HV scale than on IC or SGB scales. Psychometric findings establish measurement invariance and provide support for further use of the TABS in the Caribbean. We discuss implications for medical curriculum development, including use of the TABS as a tool for medical students to reflect on their individual attitudes and beliefs regarding transgender people.

AB  - While considering the role of group-level factors as predictors of collective action, research has overlooked the role of group prototypes in determining willingness to engage in collective action. To begin to investigate this area, we conducted two correlational studies (Ns = 141 and 98) in high schools examining the association between prototypical ingroup members' desire to engage in collective action and participants' collective action on behalf of a disadvantaged group (immigrants). Results showed a positive association between these two variables. We also investigated boundaries of this effect, finding that the association emerged when participants lacked personal experiences with the disadvantaged group (cross-group friendships; Study 1) or identified more with their ingroup, an effect also found when including a behavioral measure of collective action (Study 2). Intentions to follow the prototypical ingroup member emerged as the mediator (Study 2). It is worth noting that our methodology allowed us to assess prototypicality in a naturalistic context by calculating a metacontrast ratio for each group member, in line with self-categorization theory's conceptualization of prototypicality. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications, with reference to the role of prototypicality as a means of social influence and to developing social norms in the context of collective action.

AB  - According to social identity theory, low self-esteem motivates group members to derogate out-groups, thus achieving positive in-group distinctiveness and boosting self-esteem. According to the Frankfurt School and status politics theorists, low self-esteem motivates collective narcissism (i.e.. resentment for insufficient external recognition of the in-group's importance), which predicts out-group derogation. Empirical support for these propositions has been weak. We revisit them addressing whether (a) low self-esteem predicts out-group derogation via collective narcissism and (b) this indirect relationship is only observed after partialing out the positive overlap between collective narcissism and in-group satisfaction (i.e., belief that the in-group is of high value and a reason to be proud). Results based on cross-sectional (Study 1, N = 427) and longitudinal (Study 2, N = 853) designs indicated that self-esteem is uniquely, negatively linked to collective narcissism and uniquely, positively linked to in-group satisfaction. Results based on cross-sectional (Study 3, N = 506; Study 4. N = 1,059; Study 5. N = 471), longitudinal (Study 6, N = 410), and experimental (Study 7, N = 253) designs corroborated these inferences. Further, they revealed that the positive overlap between collective narcissism and in-group satisfaction obscures the link between self-esteem and out-group derogation.

AB  - Background: Health services across Europe provide health care for migrant patients every day. However, little systematic research has explored the views and experiences of health care professionals in different European countries. The aim of this study was to assess the difficulties professionals experience in their service when providing such care and what they consider constitutes good practice to overcome these problems or limit their negative impact on the quality of care.
   Methods: Structures interviews with open questions and case vignettes were conducted with health care professional working in areas with high proportion of migrant population in 16 countries. In each country, professionals in nine primary care practices, three accident and emergency hospital departments, and three community mental health services (total sample = 240) were interviewed about their views and experiences in providing care for migrant patients. i.e. from first generation immigrant populations. Answers were analysed using thematic content analysis.
   Results: Eight types of problems and seven components of good practice were identified representing all statements in the interviews. The eight problems were: language barriers, difficulties in arranging care for migrants without health care coverage, social deprivation and traumatic experiences, lack of familiarity with the health care system, cultural differences, different understandings of illness and treatment, negative attitudes among staff and patients, and lack of access to medical history. The components of good practice to overcome these problems or limit their impact were: organisational flexibility with sufficient time and resources, good interpreting services, working with families and social services, cultural awareness of staff, educational programmes and information material for migrant positive and stable relationships with staff, and clear guidelines on the care entitlements of different migrant groups. Problems and good care components were similar across the three types of services.
   Conclusion: Health care professionals in different services experience similar difficulties when providing care to migrants. They also have relatively consistent views on what constitutes good practice. The degree to which these components already are part of routine practice varies. Implementing good practice requires sufficient resources and organisational flexibility, positive attitudes, training for staff and the provision of information.

AB  - Background: Online social networking and personally controlled health management systems (PCHMS) offer a new opportunity for developing innovative interventions to prevent diseases of public health concern (e. g., influenza) but there are few comparative studies about patterns of use and impact of these systems.
   Methods/Design: A 2010 CONSORT-compliant randomised controlled trial with a two-group parallel design will assess the efficacy of a web-based PCHMS called Healthy. me in facilitating the uptake of influenza vaccine amongst university students and staff. Eligible participants are randomised either to obtain access to Healthy. me or a 6-month waitlist. Participants complete pre-study, post-study and monthly surveys about their health and utilisation of health services. A post-study clinical audit will be conducted to validate self-reports about influenza vaccination and visits to the university health service due to influenza-like illness (ILI) amongst a subset of participants. 600 participants older than 18 years with monthly access to the Internet and email will be recruited. Participants who (i) discontinue the online registration process; (ii) report obtaining an influenza vaccination in 2010 before the commencement of the study; or (iii) report being influenced by other participants to undertake influenza vaccination will be excluded from analysis. The primary outcome measure is the number of participants obtaining influenza vaccination during the study. Secondary outcome measures include: number of participants (i) experiencing ILI symptoms, (ii) absent from or experiencing impairment in work or study due to ILI symptoms, (iii) using health services or medications due to ILI symptoms; (iv) expressing positive or negative attitudes or experiences towards influenza vaccination, via their reasons of receiving (or not receiving) influenza vaccine; and (v) their patterns of usage of Healthy. me (e.g., frequency and timing of hits, duration of access, uptake of specific functions).
   Discussion: This study will provide new insights about the utility of online social networking and PCHMS for public health and health promotion. It will help to assess whether a web-based PCHMS, with connectivity to a health service provider, containing information and self-management tools, can improve the uptake of preventive health services amongst university students and staff.

AB  - The outcomes of out-group members working together can be mixed. Many researchers have taken a pessimistic view, describing conflict and social categorization among age-diverse workforces. Alternately, we consider an optimistic view, framing contact theory within the input-process-output model to depict the potential of multigenerational workplaces and their impact on team outcomes. Integrating these two theories lends insight to management strategies to promote positive outcomes in the increasingly common multigenerational workplace context. We offer propositions for researchers and human resource management professionals to understand and enhance input, processes, and output of age-diverse teams.

AB  - In the Canadian context, stunt driving refers to street racing and associated risky driving activities. Although no national official statistics are available, other data have found that stunt driving is a common activity among young males. Research from Australia, New Zealand and other jurisdictions has shown that those engaged in stunt driving are at higher crash and violation risk. The purpose of this study was to examine the correlates of self-reported stunt driving and the effects of thrill seeking, competitive driving and attitudes towards risky driving on self-reported stunt driving among a sample of car and racing enthusiasts through a web-based survey of car and racing clubs. The Internet questionnaire included: (1) personality variables (Driver Thrilling Seeking Scale, Competitive Attitude Toward Driving Scale); (2) beliefs about seriousness and perceived crash likelihood of various drivers and driving behaviours; (3) attitudes regarding Ontario, Canada's new stunt driving legislation and street racing/stunt driving; (4) risky driving behaviours, as measured by the Manchester Driver Behaviour Questionnaire subscale, Self-Report Driver Aggression Questionnaire, Risk-Taking Driving Scale, collisions in past five years, traffic offences in last year and stunt driving, as defined by Ontario's Street Racers, Stunt and Aggressive Drivers Legislation. A minority of car and racing enthusiasts reported stunt driving. Clear differences emerged between the self-reported stunt drivers and non-stunt drivers. Stunt drivers were more likely to be young, less concerned about excessive speeding and street racing, to hold more negative attitudes towards Ontario's stunt driving legislation and more positive attitudes towards street racing and stunt driving, to score higher on the driver thrill seeking, competitive attitude toward driving and risky driving scales and more likely to report traffic offences in the past year. The sequential logistic regression showed that personality characteristics and attitudes provided unique contributions to the model in predicting stunt driving. Thus, although a minority of the sampled car and racing enthusiasts engage in stunt driving, further interventions need to be considered to reduce their risky driving beliefs, attitudes and behaviours.

AB  - Purpose - The aim of this paper is to enhance the understanding of the consumer attitudes and behaviour towards a new currency, euro, before the process of the changeover. The approach of the current study differs from most past research on the same topic as consumer attitudes are surveyed before the currency changeover, not retrospectively based on consumer recall. The research attempts to achieve the following set of objectives: to identify the general consumer attitudes towards euro and pinpoint sources of tension, resistance and uncertainty before the currency changeover process; to identify the pre-adoption assessment of euro value scales and inflation expectations; and to identify various emotional factors related to the national and European identity in the euro adoption process.
   Design/methodology/approach - The data analysis of the current research adopts a qualitative methodology. To gather a full insight into the pre-changeover attitudes, opinions, fears and hopes, a total of 29 qualitative interviews were conducted.
   Findings - The results suggest that consumer attitudes and opinions towards the changeover process are multifaceted and concerns and uncertainties rise from various sources - from rational economic aspects to emotional aspects related to national identity. This research points also to the underestimated role of national pride in the process of transfer from the national currency to euro.
   Research limitations/implications - The study is one of the first attempts to research consumers before a forthcoming changeover; thus it is exploratory in its nature and has the traditional limitations of an exploratory research. Based on the initial findings, it would be possible to design a quantitative research for the subsequent countries adopting euro.
   Practical implications - The research identifies the attitudes of consumers before the changeover, outlining their doubts, fears and prejudices. The results can be used by subsequent countries adopting euro while planning their changeover strategies. The efforts of the strategy developers should be directed towards addressing the real challenges people face before the changeover.
   Originality/value - A distinctive contribution of this study lies in the addressing of the pre-changeover attitudes and opinions before the currency change took place. Although there have been surveys asking respondents to recall their pre-changeover opinions, the accuracy of the respondents' memory over time has decreased, which is why such surveys may not give a valid picture. This paper contributes to the understanding of the pre-adoption phase in a currency changeover process as seen from the point of view of consumers.

AB  - Fishing cat populations appear to have declined significantly in recent years due to the loss and fragmentation of inland and coastal wetland habitats. Moreover, there are still large gaps in data on population and density estimates, and threat evaluation, which are vital for conservation assessments. This research aimed to help fill these critical knowledge gaps. Our study is the first density estimate for fishing cat from mainland Southeast Asia. We conducted a camera-trap survey and used a spatially-explicit capture-recapture analytical framework to estimate the abundance of fishing cats in and around Khao Sam Roi Yot area (KSRY), which hosts an isolated, threatened population of the felid in Thailand. We also conducted interviews among adjacent communities to better understand local perspectives toward fishing cats, conflict with local people, and as a consequence of both, anthropogenic threats to the population. Over 6966 trap-days, we identified at least 33 individual adult cats and based on our top model (g0 similar to bk, sigma similar to h2), we estimated fishing cat density to be 18 +/- SE 6 individuals/100 km(2) (95% CI 10 - 33). Among 80 interviewees, we recorded 25 incidents of conflict, most relating to raids on poultry (n = 18) and damage to fishing gear in pursuit of fish (n = 5). Land use type, land use change, and human activity, did not significantly affect fishing cat density and movements. Our findings further suggest that a proposed tax policy governing land use may force landowners to convert suitable fishing cat habitat to unsuitable areas, resulting in the loss of up to 30% of existing suitable habitat from our study area. We also found that local communities would support either an exemption for landowners not wishing to develop suitable fishing cat habitat, and/or an additional policies that incentivize the maintenance and/or preservation of areas suitable for fishing cats. Finally, we conclude that the official presence of park officers in communities beyond the protected area would be beneficial, as would the implementation of public outreach programming to mitigate negative attitudes toward fishing cats, and provide recommendations on strategies for coexisting with them.

AB  - Because stigmatized individuals are viewed as incongruent with commonly held implicit leadership theories, they are often deemed less fit to lead than their nonstigmatized counterparts (Eagly & Karau, 2002). This suggests consumers might use such views to discredit not only stigmatized leaders, but also the companies they represent. However, cognition based on social categories (1 potential form of stigma) may be more likely when there are readily available alternative factors to account for one's decisions via casuistry. Across 2 complementary studies (field and experiment), we find that customers react negatively to stigmatized leaders only when the physical state of the company venue provides an ostensible defense to mask their biased behavior. When facilities are of lower quality, consumers appear to use a leader's stigma to infer lower product quality, coinciding in less patronage for companies with stigmatized as opposed to nonstigmatized leaders. Thus, consumers penalize companies with stigmatized leaders only when doing so can easily be attributed to an alternative factor (e.g., a lower quality venue) not involving the leader's stigma.

AB  - Negative (vs positive) intergroup contact may have a disproportionately large impact on intergroup relations because of valence-salience effects, whereby negative contact causes higher category salience (Paolini, Harwood, & Rubin, 2010). One correlational and three experimental studies in three conflict areas (Northern Ireland, Arizona's border area, and Cyprus; Ns=405, 83, 76, and 91) tested the moderation of these valence-salience effects by individuals' histories of outgroup contact. Consistent with a perceived fit principle valence-salience effects of face-to-face, television-mediated, and imagined contact held among individuals with negative or limited histories of outgroup contact; these effects were significantly reduced or nonsignificant among individuals with positive or extensive past outgroup contact. These moderation effects suggest that positive and diverse intergroup contact in the past buffers against the harmful effects of negative contact experiences in the present, thus limiting the potential for negative spiralling of intergroup relations.

KW  - Agatha Christie
KW  - detective fiction
KW  - Ellis Peters
KW  - Holocaust
AB  - Scholars including David Cesarani have noted that there was no concerted effort to represent what we now term the Holocaust in British fiction of the immediate post-war years. What can be found in novels from the late 1940s and early 1950s, however, are suggestive glimpses of how British understandings of the Holocaust were beginning to develop. Detective fiction is a useful point of reference because in the interwar years this form was typically based on simplified or even stereotyped characters, with the war years and the post-war period signalling a turn to greater realism. As Gill Plain has argued, detective fiction expresses a desire both to see and to evade seeing the dead body. Plain explores this as an expression of post-First World War cultural anxieties but, in the wake of the widespread circulation in Britain of images of the opening up of the concentration and death camps, such ambivalence takes on a particular significance. Examining two quite different examples, Agatha Christie's A Murder Is Announced (1950) and Ellis Peters's Fallen into the Pit (1951), Stewart's article reveals contrasting early engagements with the Holocaust. Both novels feature peripheral characters who are refugees from Europe, and whose stories, although told only in fragments, nevertheless destabilize the process of reinstating order that is the usual narrative trajectory of the detective novel. Stewart will argue that such glimpses of the Holocaust are as telling about contemporary attitudes as more concerted, explicit and direct engagements might be.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine empirical, epistemological and conceptual challenges and clinical narratives in the application of risk assessment and management in mental health.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors used a narrative review of empirical, conceptual and clinical literature.
   Findings - The worldwide prevalence of violence in mental health settings remains high. Risk assessment and management approaches, while well intentioned as an attempt to reduce harm and increase people's safety, have negligible effect on both. They are invariably individual centric, ignore wider environmental, societal and behavioural influences that foment violence and have a stigmatising effect on people using mental health services. They also reinforce the myth that people who are mentally unwell threaten society and that through current risk assessment and management approaches, we can minimise this threat.
   Research limitations/implications - There is a need to reconsider the study and application of violence risk assessment in mental health.
   Practical implications - The practice of risk assessment and management in mental health is marred by an overuse of risk assessment measures that are limited in their predictive efficacy. As a result, they have little value in preventing, reducing and/or managing harm. The language of risk punishes and stigmatises service users and reinforces the image of menace. An alternative language of safety may nourish and protect. A collaborative approach to safety assessment based upon recovery-focussed principles and practices may fuse professionals and service users' horizons. Combining service users' self-perception, professionals' sound clinical judgement, assisted by electronically derived risk algorithms and followed by evidence-based risk management interventions, may lessen the threat to service users, reduce harm and transform the practice of violence risk assessment and management.
   Social implications - Risk appraisals discriminate against the small number of people who have a mental illness and are risky, an example of preventive detention that is ethically questionable. On the basis of the limitations of the predictive efficacy of actuarial measures, it is ethically dubious to subject people to interventions with limited benefits. Risk assessment processes tend to reinforce stigma by classifying individuals as risky, sanctioning society's prejudices and fear through scientific authority.
   Originality/value - The increasing focus on risk assessment and management to tackle violence in mental health is fraught with empirical, conceptual and practical concerns; the authors have suggested ways in which these concerns can be addressed without compromising people's safety.

AB  - Purpose Although preferential treatment has been considered a positive relationship marketing tactic, this research aims to examine how perceived harm to others as a result of preferential treatment invokes consumers' negative moral emotions and negative attitudes towards the service provider. Design/methodology/approach Four studies are presented in this research. A pilot study first provides empirical evidence that customers who receive preferential treatment are aware of potential harm caused to other customers. Three experimental studies then test the hypothesis that shame and embarrassment mediate the effect of perceived harm to others on consumers' responses to earned and unearned preferential treatment, respectively. Findings The present studies demonstrate that consumers naturally scan the environment and seek out information about others when judging their own experience; consequently, when preferential treatment is perceived to cause harm to others, it can trigger negative moral emotions. In particular, the authors show that shame mediates the effect of perceived harm to others when preferential treatment is earned, whereas embarrassment mediates this effect when preferential treatment is unearned. Research limitations/implications The results of this research contribute to the literature on earned and unearned preferential treatment and negative moral emotions. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first research to show that negative moral emotions may arise because of perceptions of harm to other customers, particularly in the context of earned preferential treatment. The authors demonstrate that ordinary shopping contexts have the potential to elicit these negative emotions, raising concerns about ethical and moral practices in service environments. Practical implications When designing relationship marketing programs incorporating preferential treatment, firms need to consider both the ethics of justice and the ethics of care. Guidelines considering ethics of care should be developed for employees to ensure appropriate training to deliver preferential treatment effectively and avoiding situations causing potential harm to others. Strategies could include encouraging employees to better scan the servicescape to identify if other customers' needs should be attended first, and providing clearer justifications when administering preferential treatment. The provision of choices such as delayed redemption and passing on benefits to others can help minimise harm and potentially enhance customer service experience. Originality/value The studies presented here are the first to examine the role of perceived harm to others as an antecedent of consumers' negative responses to preferential treatment. In particular, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to show that negative moral emotions may arise in the context of earned preferential treatment, calling into question some basic principles of relationship marketing.

KW  - MYTH
AB  - The federal courts are often accused of being too parochial, favoring U.S. parties over foreigners and U.S. law over relevant foreign or international law. According to what this Article terms the "parochialcritique," the courts' U.S.-centrism generates unnecessary friction with allies, regulatory conflict, and access-to-justice gaps. This parochialism is assumed to reflect the preferences of individuals judges: persuade judges to like international law and transnational cases better, the standard story goes, and the courts will reach more cosmopolitan results.
   This Article challenges that assumption. I argue instead that parochial doctrines can develop even in the absence of parochial judges. Our sometimes-parochial procedure may be the unintended result of decisionmaking pressures that mount over time within poorly designed doctrines. As such, it reflects not so much the personal views of individual judges but the limits of institutional capacity, the realities of behavioral decisionmaking, and the path dependence of the common law. This Article shows how open-ended decisionmaking in the midst of complexity encourages the use of heuristics that tend to emphasize the local, the familiar, and the concrete. These decisionmaking shortcuts, by disfavoring the foreign, put a parochial thumb on the scale but that tilt is not limited to individual cases. Rather, it is locked in and amplified through the accumulation of precedent, as later judges rely on existing decisions to resolve new cases. Over time, even judges with positive conceptions of international law and transnational order will find themselves, in applying these doctrines, consistently favoring U.S. litigants over foreigners and U.S. law over foreign or international law.
   To explore this theory, this Article traces the evolution of four procedural doctrines: discovery of foreign evidence, forum non conveniens, service of process abroad, and therecognition of foreign judgments. The decisionmaking pressures outlined here can explain why the first two doctrines (framed as open-ended standards) are often criticized as parochial while the latter two (framed in more rule-like terms) are not. And if that account is at least plausible, it supports the primary claim of this Article: the occasional parochialism of our courts does not necessarily reflect the personal prejudices of our judges. If so, then avoiding the costs of parochialism will require structural, not just personal, solutions.

AB  - Aim: This study aims to discuss how narrative pedagogy of improving the positive attitude toward older people among nursing students and increasing students' willingness to practice older people's care.& nbsp;Background: Considering the progress of population aging, the requirement for nursing manpower in older people care is on the rise. However, related studies have demonstrated that nursing students generally have a negative attitude toward older people, which affects students' willingness to engage in older people's care in the future.& nbsp;Design: This study applied mixed method research design. For the quantitative study design, we have adopted a quasi-experimental study, pretest-posttest design.& nbsp;Methods: The study adopted purposive sampling. A total of 87 nursing students in two classes of five-year junior college program in northern Taiwan were selected as the study subjects. The students were randomly allocated into an experimental group of 43 subjects and a control group of 44 subjects. The experimental group received narrative pedagogy of geriatric care course for 18 weeks with 2 h per week, the control group received general lectures. This study was conducted between October 2019 and February 2020. The quantitative data were collected using the structured questionnaire. The qualitative data were collected by individual interviews and students' reflective writing.& nbsp;Results: The average scores of the older people's attitude (F=4.60, p < 0.05) and the willingness to care for the older people (F=4.19, p < 0.05) in the experimental group increased significantly, reaching a statistically significant level. According to the adjusted post-test score averages of the two groups, under the control of the pretest, the Older Adults Attitude Scale (64.02 > 60.22) and the post-test of the Older Adults Care Willingness Scale (11.63 > 9.93) in the experimental group were significantly higher than those in the control group. In the qualitative analysis, four themes were emerged, which were negative stereotypes about the older people, myth breaking for prejudice against the older people, new older people impression for replacement and rethinking for older people care.& nbsp;& nbsp;Conclusion: Narrative pedagogy is an effective teaching method, which can improve nursing students' older people's positive attitudes and increase students' willingness to practice older people's care.

AB  - This research seeks to broaden our understanding of weight stigma and discrimination in healthcare by exploring the influence of social norms on the treatment of higher-weight individuals. We conducted two experimental studies to investigate: (a) how health professionals' treatment decisions are influenced by patient weight; (b) the effect of norms that endorse weight stigma on health professionals' treatment decisions for patients of different weights; and (c) how these norms may operate differently within healthcare, compared with the general public. Practising health professionals (Study 1;N = 243) and laypeople (Study 2;N = 242) were randomly assigned to view the medical profile of either an average-weight or higher-weight patient who was seeking health care for migraines. Study 1 revealed that health professionals tended to treat the higher-weight patient for both their presenting conditionandtheir weight. Health professionals who perceived weight stigma to be more normative among their colleagues displayed a hyper-vigilance toward weight, treating weight significantly more among both higher-weight and average-weight patients than those who perceived weight stigma to be less normative. Study 2 found that, unlike health professionals, laypeople treated the higher-weight patient for their weight at the expense of the presenting condition; and such differential treatment was inflated among those who perceived weight stigma to be the norm. The present research found clear evidence of bias in health professionals' treatment decision making-particularly for patients with larger bodies. However, unlike laypeople, this bias did not come at the expense of treating the presenting problem.

AB  - Background: China is at greatest risk of the Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 due to its huge population and high residential density. The unclear comprehension and negative attitudes towards the emerging infectious disease among general population may lead to unnecessary worry and even panic. The objective of this study was to investigate the Chinese public response to H1N1 pandemic and provide baseline data to develop public education campaigns in response to future outbreaks.
   Methods: A close-ended questionnaire developed by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention was applied to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 among 10,669 responders recruited from seven urban and two rural areas of China sampled by using the probability proportional to size (PPS) method.
   Results: 30.0% respondents were not clear whether food spread H1N1 virusand. 65.7% reported that the pandemic had no impact on their life. The immunization rates of the seasonal flu and H1N1vaccine were 7.5% and 10.8%, respectively. Farmers and those with lower education level were less likely to know the main transmission route (cough or talk face to face). Female and those with college and above education had higher perception of risk and more compliance with preventive behaviors. Relationships between knowledge and risk perception (OR = 1.69; 95% Cl 1.54-1.86), and knowledge and practices (OR = 1.57; 95% Cl 1.42-1.73) were found among the study subjects. With regard to the behavior of taking up A/H1N1 vaccination, there are several related factors found in the current study population, including the perception of life disturbed (OR = 1.29; 95% Cl 1.11-1.50), the safety of A/H1N1 vaccine (OR = 0.07; 95% Cl 0.04-0.11), the knowledge of free vaccination policy (OR = 7.20; 95% Cl 5.91-8.78), the state's priority vaccination strategy(OR = 1.33; 95% Cl 1.08-1.64), and taking up seasonal influenza vaccine behavior (OR = 4.69; 95% Cl 3.53-6.23).
   Conclusions: This A/H1N1 epidemic has not caused public panic yet, but the knowledge of A/H1N1 in residents is not optimistic. Public education campaign may take the side effects of vaccine and the knowledge about the state's vaccination strategy into account.

AB  - O'Donnell analyses the confluence of Islamophobia and anti-government conspiracy theory in the works of the far-right think tank, the Center for Security Policy (CSP). He argues that, rather than only being a contemporary form of the religious and racialized demonologies that code Islam' as being the constitutive outside of the Westirrational, religious and authoritarian versus rational, secular and democraticIslamophobic conspiracism should also be examined in the context of anxieties over the erosion of personal and state sovereignty under neoliberalization. Mobilizing an Islamophobic demonology that constructs Muslims' as inassimilable to American' subjectivity, the CSP's Islamophobic conspiracism projects this construction of absolute alterity on to American social and state systems. In doing so, O'Donnell contends, Islamophobic conspiracism takes neoliberalization's estrangement of the state and its citizens to its logical conclusion, transfiguring the societal processes that impact on the freedom of the individualnotably the state and civil societyinto something inassimilable to that individual's claims to self-ownership and self-mastery.

AB  - Positive inclusive teacher attitudes are a key factor in achieving inclusive education due to the many benefits they generate for schools and social contexts. Studies have focused on analysing which variables may promote positive attitudes. The objective of this study was to analyse the predictive power of sociodemographic variables, empathy (cognitive and emotional), and social dominance orientation (social dominance and opposition to equality) on teachers' attitudes, sentiments, and concerns about inclusion by comparing linear relationship models and models based on fuzzy-set comparative qualitative analysis. The sample consisted of 268 teachers of different educational levels aged between 20 and 64 years (M = 42.46, SD = 9.22), 66% of whom were women. The teachers were administered the Sentiments, Attitudes, and Concerns about Inclusive Education Revised (SACIE-R) scale, the Basic Empathy Scale (BES), and the Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) scale. Two different statistical methodologies were used: traditional regression models and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) models. The results of the regression models suggest that social dominance is the main predictor of attitudes, sentiments, and concerns about inclusion. Social dominance is negatively related to attitudes and positively related to sentiments and concerns. Only opposition to equality and emotional empathy are related to attitudes. On the other hand, the results of the QCA models suggest that low social dominance and high cognitive and emotional empathy, as well as female sex, predict higher levels of positive attitudes, sentiments, and concerns about inclusion. Since teachers interact most with students, it is important to be aware of how their empathy and social dominance orientations influence inclusion to develop intervention programmes that seek to train teachers in these capabilities.

AB  - Leidig's article addresses a theoretical and empirical lacuna by analysing Hindutva using the terminology of right-wing extremism. It situates the origins of Hindutva in colonial India where it emerged through sustained interaction with ideologues in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany who, in turn, engaged with Hindutva to further their own ideological developments. Following India's independence, Hindutva actors played a central role in the violence of nation-building and in creating a majoritarian identity. Yet Hindutva was not truly 'mainstreamed' until the election of the current prime minister, Narendra Modi, in 2014. In order to construct a narrative that furthered Hindu insecurity, Modi mobilized his campaign by appealing to recurring themes of a Muslim 'threat' to the Hindu majority. The result is that Hindutva has become synonymous with Indian nationalism. Leidig seeks to bridge the scholarly divide between, on the one hand, the study of right-wing extremism as a field dominated by western scholars and disciplines and, on the other, the study of Hindutva as a field that is of interest almost exclusively to scholars in South Asian studies. It provides an analytical contribution towards the conceptualization of right-wing extremism as a global phenomenon.

KW  - USA
KW  - science
AB  - Background: the belief that women and science, including mathematics and medicine, are incompatible has had a long and complex history and still often works to exclude women from and/or marginalise them in science. Purpose: this article will seek to explore gender and educational achievement through investigating how such gendered presumptions have persisted at various levels of science, despite perceptions of science itself changing over time and scientific studies expanding, differentiating and becoming professionalized. In particular, after a brief discussion of the historical debates on the provenance and lasting recurrence of gendered assumptions in science, it will try to discover how these prejudices affected the education of girls and women in England from c.1910 to c. 1939 and then, to widen the picture, make some comparison with the USA in the same period, although, necessarily in an article of this length, this analysis will be somewhat cursory. It will then bring the history up-to-date by examining the situation in England today. Sources of evidence: the article will proceed by using extensive local sources in case study research on Birmingham, by then the second largest English city. The comparisons with the situation in the USA in the same period and the examination of the present situation will be based largely on secondary sources. Main argument: factors of location, family background, supportive networks and greater educational, political and employment rights will be shown to have allowed some women to break through the barriers that hindered many from accessing or rising in science. Thus, it will be seen through the Birmingham example that there was a growing yet limited field of scientific practice for women, ordered by a gendered philosophy which routed them into specific areas. This picture was further permeated by class, wealth, identity, contacts, networks and location albeit this was modified by the scholarship system. Comparisons with the USA show that similar factors were present there, albeit in a different context. Twenty-first century sources indicate that on the one hand there is still gendered access and progress for females in science in England yet, on the other hand, there have been, and are at present, a number of initiatives seeking to overcome this. Conclusion: Even today, therefore, whatever sciences females do is affected by underlying gendered assumptions and structural power relationships which need to be understood.

AB  - We investigated why women may have lower desires and intentions to apply to become a member of a leadership group (i.e., committee) than men when the majority of its members are men. In four studies, we examined the interaction between gender and gender composition of the leadership group on leader candidates' sense of power, desire to lead, and intentions to apply to become a member of a leadership group. Informed by research on gender, perceived power, and the model of goal-directed behavior, we found that women, compared to men, expected lower sense of power when considering applying to a majority-male (vs. gender-balanced) online leadership committee (Study 1A,N= 294; Study 1B,N= 278). This pattern observed for women in majority-male leadership committees was not, however, evident for men in majority female leadership committees (Study 2,N= 560). Furthermore, women's lower sense of power explained why they expressed lower desires to lead and intentions to apply for a majority-male leadership committee compared to men. Finally, we found that increasing women's sense of power increased their desires and intentions to lead in a majority-male committee (Study 3,N= 460). We contribute to understanding why there still exists a discrepancy in the number of men versus women in leadership groups despite ongoing efforts to reduce it. We hope readers will apply these findings by identifying ways to increase women leader candidates' sense of power in order to increase women's representation on leadership committees and groups (e.g., boards).

AB  - Public Significance Statement Dehumanization denies human vulnerabilities to a group of people by portraying them as physically or magically superior to the average person. Self-infrahumanization is a dehumanization form in which one perceives themselves as lacking the experience of uniquely human emotions. We found that the more African American women believe they do not experience uniquely human emotions, the greater risk they are of not seeking professional psychological help, especially if they endorse SBW schema about Black women (e.g., ideals of not expressing vulnerability; self-superhumanization). Collectively, this research suggests that dehumanization and superhumanization are psychosocial determinants of health among African American women.
   Objective: Self-infrahumanization or perceiving oneself as lacking the experience of uniquely human emotions, and endorsement of Strong Black Woman (SBW) schema, or self-superhumanization, are two forms of dehumanization. Among African American women, SBW schema endorsement is associated with greater negative attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help (ATSPPH) and poorer mental health. Self-infrahumanization is associated with fewer adaptive stress responses and poorer well-being. This research examines the relationship between self-infrahumanization and self-superhumanization on ATSPPH and mental health among African American women. We hypothesized that self-infrahumanization and self-superhumanization will be associated with greater negative ATSPPH and greater mental health symptomatology. We also hypothesized that ATSPPH will mediate the interactive effect of self-infrahumanization and SBW schema endorsement on mental health symptomatology. Method: Four hundred and forty-nine self-identified African American women (M-age = 37.96; SDage = 15.55; age range: 18-87) completed an online, self-administered Qualtrics survey investigating the social and psychological determinants of health. Results: Self-infrahumanization was not associated with mental health symptomatology. Greater SBW schema endorsement was associated with greater mental health symptomatology. Self-infrahumanization and SBW schema endorsement were not associated with ATSPPH. ATSPPH mediated the interaction between SBW and self-infrahumanization on mental health symptomatology. At high and average-but not low-levels of SBW schema endorsement, greater self-infrahumanization was associated with lower positive ATSPPH, which was then associated with greater mental health symptomatology. Conclusions: Among African American women, believing that one lacks the experience of uniquely human emotions exacerbates the negative effects of endorsing SBW schema. We discuss the role of dehumanization processes in health disparities research.

AB  - Between the 1890s and the 1960s, Jews faced significant levels of racial discrimination within British golf. Antisemitism originating from individuals, private clubs, the golfing press and golfing authorities was prevalent across this period and was geographically widespread (affecting every sizeable Jewish community in Great Britain). Mirroring wider majority community discrimination towards the growing middle-class Jewish population, Jewish golfers faced racial hostility and exclusion: a racism driven by crude stereotypes, snobbery, ignorance and a basic irrational fear of the Other. Golfing racism was powerful and extensive in Britain, yet Jews did not simply accept the hostility they faced and cease playing the sport. While Dee's article illustrates and analyses antisemitism in British golf, it also highlights the response to discrimination by Jewish communitieslarge and smallacross the country. Unwilling to allow antisemitism to prevent their participation in the sport, Jewish golfers strove to create their own clubs and courses. Symbolically, these Jewish' organizations remained open to all, regardless of race or creed. Jews not only protected their own sporting interests in the face of racism, but also provided a retort to golfing bigotry and racism.

AB  - Cochlear implant (CI) users can only access limited pitch information through their device, which hinders music appreciation. Poor music perception may not only be due to CI technical limitations; lack of training or negative attitudes toward the electric sound might also contribute to it. Our study investigated with an implicit (indirect) investigation method whether poorly transmitted pitch information, presented as musical chords, can activate listeners' knowledge about musical structures acquired prior to deafness. Seven postlingually deafened adult CI users participated in a musical priming paradigm investigating pitch processing without explicit judgments. Sequences made of eight sung-chords that ended on either a musically related (expected) target chord or a less-related (less-expected) target chord were presented. The use of a priming task based on linguistic features allowed CI patients to perform fast judgments on target chords in the sung music. If listeners' musical knowledge is activated and allows for tonal expectations (as in normal-hearing listeners), faster response times were expected for related targets than less-related targets. However, if the pitch percept is too different and does not activate musical knowledge acquired prior to deafness, storing pitch information in a short-term memory buffer predicts the opposite pattern. If transmitted pitch information is too poor, no difference in response times should be observed. Results showed that CI patients were able to perform the linguistic task on the sung chords, but correct response times indicated sensory priming, with faster response times observed for the less-related targets: CI patients processed at least some of the pitch information of the musical sequences, which was stored in an auditory short-term memory and influenced chord processing. This finding suggests that the signal transmitted via electric hearing led to a pitch percept that was too different from that based on acoustic hearing, so that it did not automatically activate listeners' previously acquired musical structure knowledge. However, the transmitted signal seems sufficiently informative to lead to sensory priming. These findings are encouraging for the development of pitch-related training programs for CI patients, despite the current technological limitations of the CI coding.

AB  - The individual physical appearances of robots are considered significant, similar to the way that those of humans are. We investigated whether users prefer robots with male or female physical appearances for use in daily communication situations and whether egalitarian gender role attitudes are related to this preference. One thousand adult men and women aged 20-60 participated in the questionnaire survey. The results of our study showed that in most situations and for most subjects, "males" was not selected and "females" or "neither" was selected. Moreover, the number of respondents who chose "either" was higher than that who chose "female." Furthermore, we examined the relationship between gender and gender preference and confirmed that the effect of gender on the gender preference for a robot weakened when the human factor was eliminated. In addition, in some situations for android-type robots and in all situations for machine- type robots, equality orientation in gender role attitudes was shown to be higher for people who were not specific about their gender preferences. It is concluded that there is no need to introduce a robot that specifies its gender. Robots with a gender- neutral appearance might be more appropriate for applications requiring complex human-robot interaction and help avoid reproducing a gender bias.

AB  - National Socialist Black Metal (NSBM) emerged in the early 1990s as a subsidiary genre of the broader black metal movement. NSBM is distinguished by thematic content that promotes Aryan superiority, pagan spirituality and opposes globalization. Buesnel's article explores the history of the early NSBM movement through an analysis of the bands Graveland (Poland) and Absurd (Germany), which have both played vital roles in the establishment of the NSBM genre. Buesnel highlights the current state of National Socialist ideology within metal subcultures and concludes with observations about the future of far-right extremism in heavy metal.

AB  - This study assesses the impact of character-audience similarity, a core aspect of tailored communication, on evaluation of antismoking public service announcements (PSAs). Smoker and persuader characters are distinguished to explore their different roles in message effectiveness. Daily adult smokers (n=1,160) were exposed to four video PSAs randomly selected from a larger pool. Similarity scores were determined from matching in demographic (age, gender, race) and motivational factors (quitting status) between the audience and the PSA's characters. Results show that PSAs featuring distinctive smoker and/or persuader characters yielded significantly higher message engagement and perceived effectiveness (PE) than PSAs without characters. Given the presence of characters, smoker-audience similarity was positively associated with the engagement, which in turn enhanced PE. Persuader-audience similarity failed to predict increases in either engagement or PE.

AB  - Some popular ideas about diversity today emphasize the uniqueness and potential in each individual and posit that all differences across individuals count the same as long as they are "true to themselves." These ideas saturate current antidiscrimination discourses, but their impact on what might be perceived as discrimination has hardly been tested empirically. This article argues that the direction of that impact may not be taken for granted and advances two hypotheses. First, individual diversity (ID) ideology may direct attention to the alleged psychological attributes of minority group members, rather than to social inequalities and discrimination. Secondly, ID ideology may direct attention towards discrimination only if the target is seen as "authentically unique" (the prototype of ID). Both hypotheses were tested and supported in two studies addressing Greek participants' perceptions of immigrant children's difficulties. Study 2 further controlled for possible mediation effects. The discussion suggests that ID ideology might paradoxically rationalize inequalities and discrimination, as well as implicitly raise elitist expectations from minority group members.

AB  - Balint examines the current case of Karoly Zentai, an Australian wanted for war crimes in Hungary, his country of origin. She explores the evidence for his extradition, the broader historical context of the Zentai case, from 1944 until the present day, and its implications for historical understanding in Hungary and Australia. In the former, the complicity of the state in the Holocaust remains subject to historical denial, drowned out by the dominant narrative of Hungarian victimhood in the war. In the latter, the migration of war criminals to the country via the mass immigration programme conducted in the Displaced Persons (DP) camps of post-war occupied Europe has been hidden by the more widely known story of rescue. Balint also explores the wider history of connection between these two countries, forged during the post-war voyages of immigrants from the DP camps in occupied Europe. She questions to what extent Zentai's extradition and possible trial would help to promote collective understanding of the 'lessons of history' in contemporary Australian or Hungarian society, and argues that, even in this 'twilight time' of Holocaust memory, such efforts are necessary, though risky, for the future as well as to do justice to the past.

AB  - Kolvraa's article focuses on the cultural imaginary of the Scandinavian extreme right by analysing the online presence of the so-called Nordic Resistance Movement. He seeks to show how the cultural imaginaries of this National Socialist organization make use of the Scandinavian Viking heritage in three distinct ways. First, to produce a distinctly Nordic form of National Socialism and thus potentially make this ideology palatable to Nordic publics. Second, to differentiate their racially oriented political project from a wider far-right or populist right concern with the defence of European Christian heritage and/or civilization against Islam. And, third, to thematize and perform a certain hyper-masculine identity, especially in the context of martial and sporting competitions arranged by the organization.

AB  - There has been much rhetoric about tourism's role in promoting world peace. This research takes a global perspective examining the relationship between peace and tourism across 111 different countries using a panel data model using two indicators, international tourist arrivals and the Institute for Economics and Peace's Global Peace Index. The results indicate that tourism is the beneficiary of peace rather than grounds for peace. Peace is most important to tourism in medium income destinations but still important for high income nations. No relationship exists between peace and tourism arrivals for low income nations.

AB  - Background Experiences of HIV stigma remain prevalent across Canada, causing significant stress and negatively affecting the health and wellbeing of people living with HIV. While studies have consistently demonstrated that stigma negatively impacts health, there has been limited research on the mechanisms behind these effects. This study aims to identify which dimensions of stigma have significant relationships with self-rated health and examine the mechanisms by which those types of stigma impact self-rated health. Methods We recruited 724 participants to complete the People Living with HIV Stigma Index in Ontario, designed by people living with HIV to measure nuanced changes in stigma and discrimination. The present study utilizes data from externally validated measures of stigma and health risks that were included in the survey. First, we conducted multiple regression analyses to examine which variables had a significant impact on self-rated health. Results from the multiple regression guided the mediation analysis. A parallel mediation model was created with enacted stigma as the antecedent, internalized stigma and depression as the mediators, and self-rated health as the outcome. Results In the multiple regression analysis, internalized stigma (coefficient = -0.20, p < 0.01) and depression (coefficient = -0.07, p < 0.01) were both significant and independent predictors of health. Mediation analyses demonstrated that the relationship between enacted stigma and self-rated health is mediated in parallel by both internalized stigma [coefficient = -0.08, se = 0.03, 95% CI (-0.14, -0.02)] and depression [coefficient = -0.16, se = 0.03, 95% CI (-0.22, -0.11)]. Conclusions We developed a mediation model to explain how HIV-related stigma negatively impacts health. We found that that enacted stigma, or experiences of prejudice or discrimination, can lead to internalized stigma, or internalization of negative thoughts regarding one's HIV status and/or increased depressive symptoms which then may lead to worse overall health. Highlighting the importance of internalized stigma and depression has the potential to shape the development of targeted intervention strategies aimed at reducing the burden of stigma and improving the health and wellbeing of people living with HIV.

AB  - The study of authoritarianism has a long history in the field of psychology; however, much of this research focuses on Western countries, especially the United States. In effort to better understand authoritarianism cross-culturally, we explore the current state of authoritarianism in an important cultural context: Russia. Thus, the current paper reports on large-scale research of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation in the modern Russian context. Six studies (total N = 1,358) included personality traits, basic human values, social beliefs, and intergroup attitudes that allowed us to comprehensively consider authoritarian attitudes in Russia. The results showed that personological profile and pattern of reaction to threat among Russian authoritarians is similar to Western authoritarians. However, economic views inherited from Soviet ideology make Russians differ in their view of economic conservatism from that supported by Western authoritarians. These data provide insight into the psychology of authoritarianism as well as explore novel aspects of Russian culture.

AB  - When facing socially sensitive issues, people do not often express their real attitudes because of social pressure. The model of dual attitudes is one of the theories that try to explain the phenomenon. According to the theory, the classification of separation patterns between the two attitudes: suppression, independence, motivated override, and automatic override. Recent studies have presented these types of separations in two attitudes indirectly, but direct experimental evidence still is demanded in social attitude research. The present research tries to give such direct evidence and accordingly designs two studies to identify the four kinds of separations above. In the first study, we examine the relationship of the independent and repressed between implicit attitudes and explicit attitudes with cognitive fatigues. In the second study, we consider the rest two types, the motivated and automatic overridden. This paper proposes an experimental design to test attitude duality and explore the deep psychological mechanisms of how cognitive resources and levels of social pressures affect people's social attitudes and behaviors, which can explain the phenomena associated with attitude dissociation, and the analysis of experimental results suggests that dual attitude theory is better than other models to explain this effect in simple and clarity way.

The objective of this study was to investigate knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices towards cervical cancer, its prevention and treatment in Harare, Zimbabwe.MethodsSequential explanatory mixed methods approach consisting of analytical cross sectional survey and a qualitative inquiry was used. Study population consisted of women with cervical cancer, health workers and other stakeholders who are involved in cancer control programmes. Patient survey data were collected using validated structured questionnaire in Surveytogo software in an android tablet. Qualitative study used key informant interviews to understand survey findings better. Data analyses for the survey involved univariate and multivariate analyses using STATA version 14. For qualitative study, themes in transcripts were coded and analyzed using Dedoose software to generate evidence for the study.ResultsParticipants reported different levels of knowledge of causes (23%), risk factors (71%), prevention (72%), screening (73%) and treatment (80%) of cervical cancer. Knowledge of causes of cervical cancer were negatively associated with: being aged 45 or more years (OR=0.02; p=0.004), having no household income (OR=0.02;p=0.007), household income <US$600 per month (OR=0.02; p=0.015), middle class wealth (OR=0.01;p=0.032), watching TV daily (OR=0.01;p=0.007) and 1-6 times per week (OR=0.02; p=0.045). Knowledge of causes of cervical cancer were also positively associated with listening to radio daily (OR=394, CI: 11.02-1406) (p=0.001) and 1-6 times a week (OR=100, CI: 2.95-3364) (p=0.010). Knowledge of prevention was only positively associated with listening to the radio daily (OR=77, CI: 1.89-3114) (p=0.022) and 1-6 times a week (OR=174, CI: 2.42-1255) (p=0.018). Major drivers of lack of knowledge for cervical cancer were: limited awareness programmes, lack of knowledge among health workers, donor prioritization of infectious diseases, infancy of cervical cancer interventions, negative attitudes towards cervical cancer and misconceptions.ConclusionsThis study revealed that knowledge of causes and prevention of cervical cancer was associated with frequent radio listenership. Strengthening of health education through the packaging of messages targeting the wider society using different delivery channels is thus recommended.

AB  - As radio priest Father Charles Coughlin became more openly antisemitic and pro-fascist in the late 1930s, his broadcasts became increasingly divisivemore and more distressing to some listeners and more and more celebrated by othersand inevitably provoked debate about freedom of speech. Goodman analyses letters from Coughlin listeners, and compares them with the more familiar policy history of free speech regulation. Pro-Coughlin listeners attempted to make a civil rights issue of the refusal of some stations to sell time to Coughlin, talking of his right to broadcast and their right to hear him. Anti-Coughlin listeners documented the hurt and harm that the broadcasts caused and argued that limits had to be placed on Coughlin's right to broadcast in order to protect the rights of listeners. In making this case, in addition to clear and present danger' arguments about possible social disturbance, Coughlin opponents were proffering arguments about the harms caused by hateful speech that would only achieve widespread currency and provoke debate decades later, in the 1990s. Goodman argues that we need new histories of free speech that in this way juxtapose the views of Supreme Court justices and legal scholars with discussion of the same issues by ordinary people. This has the potential to change our sense of the chronology of free speech history.

AB  - In the aftermath of the First World War, veterans often became symbols of broken masculinity, standing in the popular imagination every Armistice Day as emblems of the futility of war. In stark contrast, Ulster-reconstituted as Northern Ireland after the partition of Ireland in 1921-did not consign the Great War to the pages of history. Veterans of the trenches became cherished icons of manly heroism and bravery. However, the sectarian tensions that pre-dated the war by many years infiltrated commemorations of ex-servicemen, and some men were honoured far above others. Soldiers from the 36th (Ulster) Division were remembered in a 'language of sacrifice' as valiant unionist heroes whose blood shed at the Somme had sanctified the British connection; men who had fought elsewhere, particularly in the 10th (Irish) or 16th (Irish) Divisions, were pointedly omitted from this pantheon of warrior masculinities. Veterans of the 36th Ulsters were given preference in labour, political and social circles, while presumed nationalists were discriminated against and even terrorized by those who felt that service in the Ulster Division was the only acceptable war record. The consequences of the Great War created a hierarchy that had far-reaching consequences in Northern Ireland for the rest of the century.

AB  - Under Title IX, institutions of higher education are tasked with ensuring students are protected from gender discrimination. Vulnerabilities of trans* individuals call for inclusion of this student population in its assurance of protection and safety. Previous research shows that trans* individuals, both on and off campuses, are vulnerable to a range of interpersonal violence, including physical and non-physical forms. This study seeks to examine the discrimination experiences and interpersonal violence victimization among trans* undergraduate students in a national sample. In the Fall of 2015, undergraduate students (N=15,072) participated in the American College Health Association's National College Health Assessment, of which 1.5% (n=228) identified their gender as trans*. Logistic regression analyses revealed trans* students had significantly higher odds of reporting negative outcomes, compared to non-trans* women, even after adjusting for other demographic variables, such as year in school, racial identity, and sexual orientation. For example, trans* students had significantly increased odds of reporting academic-affecting discrimination and having been verbally threatened, compared to non-trans* women. In addition, trans* students had significantly higher odds of reporting victimization of emotional abuse in a relationship and non-consensual attempted penetration, compared to non-trans* women. Trans* students are vulnerable to a range of victimization experiences that have detrimental effects on health. Implications for campus policy and programming, as well as future research are discussed.

AB  - Purpose - The author argues and explains that the indigenous Eastern epistemological system of Yin-Yang balancing should be taken as a novel system or frame of thinking, which is deeply rooted in the indigenous Eastern culture traditions, but it has significant global implications, especially in the domain of paradox management. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to provide a detailed elaboration of the indigenous Eastern epistemological system of Yin-Yang balancing in contrast to the Western logic systems; and second, to provide a roadmap for applying the system of Yin-Yang balancing to complex issues in the area of management, in general, and paradoxical issues, in particular.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is a conceptual paper with a focus on theory-building.
   Findings - The author elaborates on the indigenous features of Yin-Yang balancing, in contrast to Aristotle's formal logic and Hegel's dialectical logic in the West, to further explore the former's global implications for the increased attention to research on paradox management. In particular, the author posits that Yin-Yang balancing appears to be better suited for paradox management than the more commonly used logics available in the Western literature. Built upon the Yin-Yang balancing, a practical tool of Duality Map for paradox management is proposed.
   Research limitations/implications - The system of Yin-Yang balancing proposed in this paper has the potential to embrace logical systems available in the West into a geocentric (East-meeting-West) meta-system. This paper further shows how to apply Yin-Yang balancing with the tool of Duality Map to the most salient paradoxes in the domain of management, including value-profit balance (triple bottom lines), exploration-exploitation balance (ambidexterity), cooperation-competition balance (co-opetition), globalization-localization balance (glocalization), institution-agency balance (institutional entrepreneurship), simultaneously positive and negative attitudes toward an entity (ambivalence), and etic-emic balance (geocentric) across all domains of management research.
   Originality/value - The primary challenge for management researchers is to find a way to achieve a geocentric integration between the West and the East at the fundamental level of philosophy. The hope is that the philosophical traditions in the East will facilitate such integration. In particular, the Eastern philosophy of wisdom has a unique capacity to reframe paradox from a negative problem (i.e. a problem of inconsistency to be resolved by dualism in terms of separating opposite elements) to a positive solution (i.e. a solution of completeness or holism to be achieved by duality in terms of partially separating and partially integrating opposite elements).

AB  - The formation of Fascist Italy's international imaginary in the 1930s tells a fascinating story of growing global political ambition, of constant recalibration in the face of seismic geopolitical shifts and, in the end, a (frustrated) pursuit of symbolic primacy. Kallis discusses two different Fascist projects underpinned by this imaginary: first, the political project of internationalization promoted through instruments such as the Fasci Italiani all'Estero (Italian Fasci Abroad) and especially the Comitati d'Azione per l'Universalita di Roma (CAUR), as well as through direct diplomatic and political ties with an expanding circle of regimes in Europe and overseas; and, second, the pursuit of a deeper sense of historic-cultural primacy, linked to the idea of Roman universality, which became the discursive lynchpin of the ill-fated plan to host a 1942 world's fair in Rome (EUR/E42). The transformation of Fascism from a hyper-nationalist phenomenon into a force actively seeking international diffusion and finally universality' can be understood as a reflexive adjustment of Fascism's ideological-political horizon, driven as much by new geopolitical opportunities and frustrations as by conquering ambition and ideological continuity. In fact, Italian Fascism's trajectory from CAUR in the 1930s to EUR/E42 in the war-torn 1940s, unfolding against a backdrop of growing antagonism between Italy and Nazi Germany for global influence, retained a primary symbolic point of reference: the ideological, political and cultural-historic estate of the myth of Rome' as a symbolic discourse of trans-temporal and -spatial primacy.

AB  - Acculturation preferences of immigrants and the host population differ substantially. Research on the former predominantly focused on immigrants' preferences for their acculturation process. It remains unclear what they prefer for other immigrants. Therefore, the present study analyses how Muslim immigrants' religious identification shapes their preferences for the acculturation of other immigrants. It focuses on religious identification as the central determinant because Muslim immigrants' faith differentiates them from a Christian or secular host population. Furthermore, it is a source of self-identification that affects attitudes and preferences. The study relies on the Social Identity Theory and utilizes a sample of Muslim immigrants in Germany. The analyses reveal that stronger identification makes it more likely to prefer combined culture and (to a lesser extent) separation, while it makes it less likely to prefer assimilation. Additionally, members of the minority within Islam in Germany are more likely to prefer separation than the majority.

AB  - In reading British fascism as a cultural phenomenon, historians have started to chart the cultural products and visions of British fascists during the interwar and post-war periods. Such analysis has tended to focus on fascists' discourse on culture (particularly the ways that they position liberalism and modernism as degenerate), or on the cultural texts of fascists/fascism in the form of, inter alia, literature, music, dress and art. George Mosse goes as far as to argue that it is only through a cultural interpretation of fascism that we can come to understand the movement 'from the inside out'. However, the notion of fascist culture is contentious, and not simply because the meanings of both 'fascism' and 'culture' are highly contested. Eschewing Mosse's invitation to interpret fascism as culture, Richardson nevertheless argues that 'the cultural' can be understood as one approach to fascism. In this article, Richardson discusses six ways into a critical cultural analysis of the continuing presence of fascist political projects, focusing in particular on the British variant.

   What is known on the subject
   Expert by Experience participation in mental health services is embedded in mental health policy in many countries. The negative attitudes of nurses and other health professionals to consumer participation poses a significant obstacle to this policy goal.
   Involving mental health Experts by Experience in the education of nursing students demonstrates positive attitudinal change. BLACK CIRCLEBLACK CIRCLE
   What the paper adds to existing knowledge
   The paper presents perspectives from Experts by Experience about the unique knowledge and expertise they derive from their lived experience of mental distress and mental health service use. As a result, they can make a unique and essential contribution to mental health nursing education. They utilize this knowledge to create an interactive learning environment and encourage critical thinking.
   The international focus of this research enriches understandings about how Experts by Experience might be perceived in a broader range of countries. BLACK CIRCLEBLACK CIRCLE
   What are the implications for practice
   Mental health policy articulates the importance of service user involvement in all aspects of mental health service delivery. This goal will not be fully achieved without nurses having positive attitudes towards experts by experience as colleagues.
   Positive attitudes are more likely to develop when nurses understand and value the contribution experts by experience bring by virtue of their unique knowledge and expertise. This paper provides some important insights to achieving this end. BLACK CIRCLEBLACK CIRCLE
   Introduction
   Embedding lived experience in mental health nursing education is increasing, with research findings suggesting the impact is positive. To date, research has primarily targeted the perspectives of nursing students and academics from the health professions.
   Aim
   To enhance understanding of the unique knowledge and expertise experts by experience contribute to mental health nursing education.
   Methods
   Qualitative exploratory research methods were employed. In-depth individual interviews were conducted with experts by experience who delivered a coproduced learning module to nursing students in Europe and Australia.
   Results
   Participants described their unique and essential contribution to mental health nursing education under four main themes: critical thinking, beyond textbooks; interactive and open communication; understanding personal recovery; and mental health is health.
   Conclusions
   These findings present an understanding of the unique knowledge and expertise Experts by Experience contribute to mental health education not previously addressed in the literature. Appreciating and respecting this, unique contribute is necessary as Expert by Experience contributions continue to develop.
   Implications for Practice
   Mental health services purport to value service user involvement. Identifying and respecting and valuing the unique contribution they bring to services is essential. Without this understanding, tokenistic involvement may become a major barrier.

AB  - Loughlin's article assesses the activities of The Link, a British pro-Nazi organization promoting Anglo-German conciliation in Northern Ireland in the years leading up to the Second World War. It situates the Ulster branch of the movement within the context of the domestic politics of the region, the British state, Anglo-Irish relations and wider European developments. As a field of activity for The Link, Northern Ireland posed unique and complex problems. The regional branch's prospects for development were complicated, for instance, by how, for nationalists, the aggression of Nazi domestic and foreign policies was reflected in the Northern Ireland government's domestic policies, and also in the way in which Nazi policy towards religion alienated the region's Catholic and Protestant communities. Loughlin also illustrates how the government's approach towards the local Jewish community and Jewish refugeesin a region largely without the levels of antisemitism found in both British and southern Irish public opinionwas informed by a combination of sympathy and local political considerations. Perhaps most uniquely, he illuminates the singularity of the Ulster branch within The Link organization, especially the attitude of its chairman, Admiral Sir Barry Domvile, who regarded Northern Ireland as an obstacle to the establishment of an effective Anglo-Irish defence policy and wished to see the region united with Eire.

AB  - This paper outlines the ways in which the conception of social integration and its practical realization have developed over time in Australia, and the various pathways that models of integration have followed. It makes a distinction between the approaches to inclusion of the indigenous population, the Australian Aborigines in broader Australian social life and social institutions, and those dealing with populations of incoming migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers. Although there are similarities in the models of integration mobilized in both arenas, the differences and interactions are also significant and characteristic of what is specific about settler-colonial societies. The central models in both fields are assimilation, integration and multiculturalism, and the paper will sketch briefly how each model has operated both in theory and in practice, how they have succeeded and interacted with each other, how they have intersected with other types of concerns, such as citizenship, civilization and security, as well as what might be distinctive about the Australian approach to social integration in comparison with other countries.

AB  - Background: Transgender (trans) women face constrained access to gender-affirming HIV prevention and care. This is fueled in part by the convergence of limited trans knowledge and competency with anti-trans and HIV-related stigmas among social and healthcare providers. To advance gender-affirming HIV service delivery we implemented and evaluated 'Transgender Education for Affirmative and Cornpetent HIV and Healthcare (TEACHH)'. This theoretically-informed community-developed intervention aimed to increase providers' gender-affirming HIV prevention and care knowledge and competency and reduce negative attitudes and biases among providers towards trans women living with and/or affected by HIV.
   Methods: Healthcare and social service providers and providers in-training (e.g., physicians, nurses, social workers) working with trans women living with and/or affected by HIV (n = 78) participated in a non-randomized multi-site pilot study evaluating TEACHH with a pre-post-test design. Pre- and post-intervention surveys assessed participant characteristics, intervention feasibility (e.g., workshop completion rate) and acceptability (e.g., willingness to attend another training). Paired sample t-tests were conducted to assess pre-post intervention differences in perceived competency, attitudes/biases, and knowledge to provide gender-affirming HIV care to trans women living with HIV and trans persons.
   Results: The intervention was feasible (100% workshop completion) and acceptable (91.9% indicated interest in future gender-affirming HIV care trainings). Post-intervention scores indicated significant improvement in: 1) knowledge, attitudes/biases and perceived competency in gender-affirming HIV care (score mean difference (MD) 8.49 (95% CI of MD: 6.12-10.86, p < 0.001, possible score range: 16-96), and 2) knowledge, attitudes/biases and perceived competency in gender-affirming healthcare (MD=3.21; 95% CI of MD: 1.90-4.90,p<0.001, possible score range: 9-63). Greater change in outcome measures from pre- to post-intervention was experienced by those with fewer trans and transfeminine clients served in the past year, in indirect service roles, and having received less prior training.
   Conclusions: This brief healthcare and social service provider intervention showed promise in improving gender- ( affirming provider knowledge, perceived competency, and attitudes/biases, particularly among those with less trans and HIV experience. Scale-up of TEACHH may increase access to gender-affirming health services and HIV prevention and care, increase healthcare access, and reduce HIV disparities among trans women.

AB  - Anxiety about perceived threats to liberal freedom has played a double role in liberalism. On the one hand, such anxiety has driven the development of liberal institutions aimed at safeguarding freedoms. Yet another, problematic, side of this anxiety can also be found in the history of liberalism and in the policies and practices of contemporary liberal states. From the beginning, liberal intolerance of those perceived to be connected, through religious affiliation or beliefs, with arbitrary or absolute power and therefore deemed to pose a threat to the existing order has justified social exclusion and, in many cases, systematic violence. Rae's article examines the theoretical and political roots of this distinctive form of liberal anxiety, tracing the connection between anxiety about Catholicism and Catholics in John Locke's time and contemporary anxieties about the relationship between Islamism and Muslims in liberal states.

AB  - Previous analyses of Stand Your Ground (SYG) cases have been primarily descriptive. We examine the relationship between race of the victim and conviction of the defendant in SYG cases in Florida from 2005 to 2013. Using a regression analytic approach, we allow for simultaneous examination of multiple factors to better understand existing interrelationships. Data was obtained from the Tampa Bay Times SYG database (237 cases) which was supplemented with available online court documents and/or news reports. After excluding cases which were, still pending as of January 2015; had multiple outcomes (because of multiple suspects); and missing information on race of victim and weapon of victim, our final analytic sample has 204 cases. We chose whether the case resulted in a conviction as the outcome. We develop logistic regression models using significant bivariate predictors as candidates. These include race of the victim (White, non-White), whether the defendant could have retreated from the situation, whether the defendant pursued the victim, if the victim was unarmed, and who was the initiator of the confrontation. We find race of the victim to be a significant predictor of case outcome in this data set. After controlling for other variables, the defendant is two times (OR 2.1, 95% Cl [1.07, 4.10]) more likely to be convicted in a case that involves White victims compared to those involving non-White victims. Our results depict a disturbing message: SYG legislation in Florida has a quantifiable racial bias that reveals a leniency in convictions if the victim is non-White, which provides evidence towards unequal treatment under the law. Rather than attempting to hide the outcomes of these laws, as was done in Florida, other states with SYG laws should carry out similar analyses to see if their manifestations are the same as those in Florida, and all should remediate any injustices found.

AB  - This paper explores the impact of acculturation conditions, orientations and outcomes on international students in Australia's tertiary education sector. Specifically, we investigate the factors that facilitate or hinder acculturation of international students within a multidimensional acculturation context (Arends-Toth & van de Vijver, 2006). We used a sequential exploratory mixed-methods design in two studies to investigate acculturation of international students at an Australian university and test how these factors are related to psychological and sociocultural outcomes. In Study 1, we conducted a generic qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with a conventional content analyses approach,which compared the experiences of international students who on average had high numbers of positive experiences versus those who had high numbers of negative experiences. We found that a support network of mixed-nationals, and especially host locals, facilitates positive psychological and sociocultural adjustment, and buffers acculturative stress. Study 2 quantitatively tested the association of factors found in Study 1 (perceived stereotypes, intercultural and ethnic network/resources) with psychological and sociocultural acculturation outcomes. Study 2, shows that perceived negative stereotypes loosen ties with the dominant (host) culture and reinforces ties with the ethnic (non-host) culture. The social resources associated with either culture was found to be useful for acculturation, with both independently contributing to participant well-being. Contact with host locals played a particularly crucial role in developing these resources. Our findings provide foundations for pragmatic policy implications, suggesting value in the development of formally organized contact programs in the early sojourn experience of international students.

AB  - Knowledge of the relationships and thus the classification of fungi, has developed rapidly with increasingly widespread use of molecular techniques, over the past 10-15 years, and continues to accelerate. Several genera have been found to be polyphyletic, and their generic concepts have subsequently been emended. New names have thus been introduced for species which are phylogenetically distinct from the type species of particular genera. The ending of the separate naming of morphs of the same species in 2011, has also caused changes in fungal generic names. In order to facilitate access to all important changes, it was desirable to compile these in a single document. The present article provides a list of generic names of Ascomycota (approximately 6500 accepted names published to the end of 2016), including those which are lichen-forming. Notes and summaries of the changes since the last edition of 'Ainsworth & Bisby's Dictionary of the Fungi' in 2008 are provided. The notes include the number of accepted species, classification, type species (with location of the type material), culture availability, life-styles, distribution, and selected publications that have appeared since 2008. This work is intended to provide the foundation for updating the ascomycete component of the "Without prejudice list of generic names of Fungi'' published in 2013, which will be developed into a list of protected generic names. This will be subjected to the XIXth International Botanical Congress in Shenzhen in July 2017 agreeing to a modification in the rules relating to protected lists, and scrutiny by procedures determined by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi (NCF). The previously invalidly published generic names Barriopsis, Collophora (as Collophorina), Cryomyces, Dematiopleospora, Heterospora (as Heterosporicola), Lithophila, Palmomyces (as Palmaria) and Saxomyces are validated, as are two previously invalid family names, Bartaliniaceae and Wiesneriomycetaceae. Four species of Lalaria, which were invalidly published are transferred to Taphrina and validated as new combinations. Catenomycopsis Tibell & Constant. is reduced under Chaenothecopsis Vain., while Dichomera Cooke is reduced under Botryosphaeria Ces. & De Not. (Art. 59).

TI  - Better than nothing? Patient-delivered partner therapy and partner notification for chlamydia: the views of Australian general practitioners

AB  - Background: Genital chlamydia is the most commonly notified sexually transmissible infection (STI) in Australia and worldwide and can have serious reproductive health outcomes. Partner notification, testing and treatment are important facets of chlamydia control. Traditional methods of partner notification are not reaching enough partners to effectively control transmission of chlamydia. Patient-delivered partner therapy (PDPT) has been shown to improve the treatment of sexual partners. In Australia, General Practitioners (GPs) are responsible for the bulk of chlamydia testing, diagnosis, treatment and follow up. This study aimed to determine the views and practices of Australian general practitioners (GPs) in relation to partner notification and PDPT for chlamydia and explored GPs' perceptions of their patients' barriers to notifying partners of a chlamydia diagnosis.
   Methods: In-depth, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 40 general practitioners (GPs) from rural, regional and urban Australia from November 2006 to March 2007. Topics covered: GPs' current practice and views about partner notification, perceived barriers and useful supports, previous use of and views regarding PDPT. Transcripts were imported into NVivo7 and subjected to thematic analysis. Data saturation was reached after 32 interviews had been completed.
   Results: Perceived barriers to patients telling partners (patient referral) included: stigma; age and cultural background; casual or long-term relationship, ongoing relationship or not. Barriers to GPs undertaking partner notification (provider referral) included: lack of time and staff; lack of contact details; uncertainty about the legality of contacting partners and whether this constitutes breach of patient confidentiality; and feeling both personally uncomfortable and inadequately trained to contact someone who is not their patient. GPs were divided on the use of PDPT - many felt concerned that it is not best clinical practice but many also felt that it is better than nothing.
   GPs identified the following factors which they considered would facilitate partner notification: clear clinical guidelines; a legal framework around partner notification; a formal chlamydia screening program; financial incentives; education and practical support for health professionals, and raising awareness of chlamydia in the community, in particular amongst young people.
   Conclusions: GPs reported some partners do not seek medical treatment even after they are notified of being a sexual contact of a patient with chlamydia. More routine use of PDPT may help address this issue however GPs in this study had negative attitudes to the use of PDPT. Appropriate guidelines and legislation may make the use of PDPT more acceptable to Australian GPs.

AB  - Does seeing Spanish-language news in the media change the racial and political attitudes of Whites and Spanish-speaking Latinos? We examine the effects of Spanish-language media on White and Spanish-speaking Latino attitudes using online survey experiments in English and Spanish, respectively. We expect White Americans to react to Spanish-language media options by developing more hostile attitudes toward Hispanics, and Spanish-speaking Latino audiences to feel a greater sense of belonging in America when they see Spanish represented in the media. We find that seeing articles about non-immigration politics in Spanish, as an option next to English articles, significantly raises racial resentment toward Hispanics among Whites. Among Spanish-speaking Latinos, seeing a political news article option in Spanish increases feelings of inclusion and belonging, even when it is not about a racialized issue like immigration. Such evidence suggests that language alone may prime identity and shape political attitudes for White and Spanish-speaking Latino voters.

AB  - Adolescence is a sensitive period for sociocultural development in which facets of social identity, including social status and race, become especially salient. Despite the heightened importance of both social status and race during this developmental period, no known work has examined how individual differences in social status influence perceptions of race in adolescents. Thus, in the present study, we investigated how both subjective social status and objective socioeconomic status (SES) influence neural responses to race. Twenty-three Mexican American adolescents (15 females; mean age = 17.22 years) were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging while they viewed Black and White faces in a standard labeling task. Adolescents rated their subjective social status in US society, while their parents responded to questions about their educational background, occupation, and economic strain (objective SES). Results demonstrated a negative association between subjective social status and neural responses in the amygdala, fusiform face area, and medial prefrontal cortex when adolescents viewed Black (relative to White) faces. In other words, adolescents with lower subjective social status showed greater activity in neural regions involved in processing salience, perceptual expertise, and thinking about the minds of others when they viewed images of Black faces, suggesting enhanced salience of race for these youth. There was no relationship between objective SES and neural responses to the faces. Moreover, instructing participants to focus on the gender or emotion expression on the face attenuated the relationship between subjective social status and neural processing of race. Together, these results demonstrate that subjective social status shapes the way the brain responds to race, which may have implications for psychopathology.

AB  - In this article, Forchtner investigates the construction of an 'ideal', extreme-right, ecologically sensitive subject. A concern for the natural environment is in no way new to the extreme right, and has long been part of its ideological make-up. In particular, claims that the laws of nature are applicable to the social world and that a community is embedded in an ecosystem have long been features of a right-wing ecological imaginary. Through an analysis of all the articles on a paradigmatic ecological issue, biodiversity, published in Germany's exemplary extreme-right magazine preoccupied with ecology, Umwelt & Aktiv (Environment & Active), this cultural imaginary is reconstructed. Included in it as key themes are human responsibility for environmental degradation, the ecological value of flora and fauna, and criticism of modernity's levelling tendencies (both biologically and culturally). Taking responsibility for the community's Heimat (homeland) is, consequently, a crucial element for this subject: a subject who aims for purity, order and the stability of ecosystems.

AB  - In this article, Sayyid's focus is on the relationship between the emergence of Islamophobia and the crisis of Europeanness. What is it about Europeanness right now that makes one of its most vocal expressions an insistence on the Muslim question? To answer, or perhaps address, the question of why the Muslim question and why now, Sayyid places the formation of European identity in a postcolonial context. That is, the horizon opened by the decentring of the West not only geopolitically or economically but also culturally and philosophically is explored. East Central Europe in its various permutations-historical and cultural-provides an excellent platform to study the impact of the postcolonial on Europeanness. The East Central European experience of the postcolonial is inflected through a history of imperial articulations and peripheralizations that demonstrate not only the contingency of the idea of Europeanness but also its imbrication with the Orient.

AB  - While there is almost unanimous consent among scientists that climate change is real and has detrimental consequences, there is a sizable number of people who are skeptical towards these propositions and who are not worried by climate change. In an attempt to understand the basis of climate skepticism, we look at the role of intolerance, a culturally transmitted attitude to the effect that people with certain characteristics are not to be respected. The theoretical link from intolerance to climate skepticism is driven by two elements: insufficient or biased knowledge formation and a value of not caring very much about the welfare of others. Our empirical analysis confirms that intolerance on the basis of race, ethnicity, immigration status, religion or sexual orientation predicts climate skepticism. By using the epidemiological method, relating the views on climate change of second-generation immigrants in Europe to cultural values in their countries of origin, we are able to rule out reverse causality - a novelty in the literature trying to explain climate skepticism. To get a feeling for the importance of intolerance, an increase in the share who are intolerant towards people of a different race in the individual's country of origin by 10 percentage points implies a reduced probability of the individual considering the consequences of climate change extremely bad of 4.3 percentage points (21.5%). An important implication of our findings is that to influence climate skeptics, it may be necessary to go beyond argumentation about the facts as such and to find ways to affect more basic individual characteristics.

AB  - Scholars in the field of community psychology have called for more research dedicated to examining White privilege as part of a system of White supremacy in the United States. One branch of this work focuses on awareness of White privilege, yet to date, this research has typically investigated awareness of White privilege at individual levels of analysis instead of also focusing on neighborhoods, schools, and other levels of analysis beyond the individual. In this study, we combine survey and U.S. Census data to explore both individual- and community-level predictors of White privilege awareness. With a sample of 1285 White college students, we found that gender, modern racism, social dominance orientation, and subjective socioeconomic status (SES) significantly predicted White privilege awareness. After accounting for these individual-level variables, we found that characteristics of students' hometowns (defined by zip code) predicted White privilege awareness. Specifically, greater income inequality was associated with higher White privilege awareness, while greater White racial homogeneity was marginally associated with lower White privilege awareness. There was a significant interaction between community-level White racial homogeneity and individual-level subjective SES, such that students with high subjective SES and low White racial homogeneity had the highest White privilege awareness. This study highlights the importance of examining different facets of ecological context in relation to White Americans' racial attitudes.

AB  - Right-wing discourses and issues of belonging and collective identity in Europe's political and public spheres are often analysed in terms of Islamophobia, racism and populism. While acknowledging the value of these concepts, Kesic and Duyvendak argue that these discourses can be better understood through the logic of nativism. Their article opens with a conceptual clarification of nativism, which they define as an intense opposition to an internal minority that is seen as a threat to the nation due to its 'foreignness'. This is followed by the analysis of nativism's three subtypes: secularist nativism, problematizing particularly Islam and Muslims; racial nativism, problematizing black minorities; and populist nativism, problematizing 'native' elites. The authors show that the logic of nativism offers the advantages of both analytical precision and scope. The article focuses on the Dutch case as a specific illustration of a broader European trend.

AB  - This study explored the effects of shared stereotypes and processing goals on jury decision making. Participants were asked to read a case of a man accused of child molestation and decide if the defendant was guilty or not guilty. The study manipulated the judge's instructions (preponderance of evidence or guilty beyond a reasonable doubt), the sexual orientation of the defendant (gay or straight), and size of the decision maker (individual or group). Analysis revealed that jurors were more likely to acquit the defendant if they were instructed to follow "reasonable doubt" criteria than "preponderance of evidence" criteria. Further, jurors were more likely to convict when they believed the defendant to be a gay rather than a straight male. There was also an interaction effect of decision maker and judge's instructions such that groups were more likely to acquit in the reasonable doubt condition, whereas for individual jurors there was no effect of judge's instructions. Overall, the effects of shared processing goals (judge's instructions) seemed more potent than shared stereotypes on jury decisions.

TI  - THE INCONVENIENT RELATION BETWEEN RELIGION AND SCIENCE: THE PREVALENCE OF THE HELIOCENTRIC THEORY
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY

KW  - religion
KW  - science
KW  - religious dogma
KW  - Cartesian doubt
KW  - heliocentric theory
AB  - The relation between religion and Science is discussed in this article on the example of attitude of Western Churches towards heliocentric theory. Also reasons of such attitude of the Church were considered.
   In order to consider this relation, we will first note that in the case of a religious dogma, faith must be absolute. Dogma as a theory can be proved only through itself and its power is the absence of doubt. On the contrary, in the case of science, according to the philosophical view of Descartes, doubt should be present in any problem arising in order to avoid possible errors and prejudices; through doubt we can be led to the discovery of an indisputable truth.
   The military and political power of the Holy See hindered for a long time the development of knowledge and hence Science. Giordano Bruno was accused and judged because, among other, he was teaching the infinite worlds of Metrodorus of Chios and of Epicurus (4(th) century BC). Similarly, Galileo stood trial on suspicion of heresy and he was condemned into house arrest because the heliocentric system he was supporting was at odds with the Old Testament, according to which Joshua ordered the Sun to stop and not the Earth - during the Gibeon Battle of Israelites against Canaanites.
   The heliocentric theory was not favored by the Western Church because it did not comply with the 'positions' of the Bible and the ancient Greek geocentric theory. When science contributed to the fall of the anthropocentric myth, first by showing that the Earth, the abode of man, is not at the center of the Universe and next by showing that even human itself is a product of evolution, then its separation from the Western Church was definite.
   Therefore, a kind of war was waged against the heliocentrists, not just because the system they supported was at odds with what the Scriptures said, but also because the geocentric theory, which supported an absolutely motionless Earth, was in agreement with the celestial mechanics of the 'divine scientist' Aristotle. Since Aristotle had deeply influenced the mediaeval Catholic theology, the rejection of the geocentric theory would diminish the authority of the great philosopher and consequently the theology of the Church. It thus became clear that the support of the geocentric theory was essentially an issue of Church authority.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: What are oocyte donors and sperm donors' attitudes towards disclosure and relationship to donor offspring?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: Oocyte and sperm donors in an identity-release donor programme support disclosure to donor offspring and have overall positive or neutral attitudes towards future contact with offspring.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: There is a global trend towards open-identity gamete donation with an increasing number of countries introducing legislation allowing only identifiable donors. While women and men who enrol in identity-release donor programmes accept that they may be contacted by donor offspring, there is limited knowledge of their attitudes towards disclosure to donor offspring and how they perceive their relationship to potential donor offspring.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE AND DURATION: The present study is part of the `Swedish study on gamete donation', a prospective cohort study including donors at all fertility clinics performing donation treatment in Sweden. During a 3-year period (2005-2008), donors were recruited consecutively and a total of 157 oocyte donors and 113 sperm donors (who did not donate to a specific `known' couple) were included prior to donation. Participants in the present study include 125 female (80%) and 80 male donors (71%) that completed two follow-up assessments.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTINGS AND METHODS: Participants completed two postal questionnaires 2 months after donation and 14 months after donation. Attitudes towards disclosure to donor offspring were assessed with an established instrument. Perceptions of involvement with donor offspring and need for counselling was assessed with study-specific instruments. Statistical analyses were performed with non-parametric tests.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A majority of oocyte and sperm donors supported disclosure to donor offspring (71-91%) and had positive or neutral attitudes towards future contact with offspring (80-87%). Sperm donors reported a higher level of involvement with potential donor offspring compared with oocyte donors (P = 0.005). Few donors reported a need for more counselling regarding the consequences of their donation.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: While the multicentre study design strengthens external validity, attrition induced a risk of selection bias. In addition, the use of study-specific instruments that have not been psychometrically tested is a limitation.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The positive attitudes towards disclosure to offspring of female and male identity-release donors are in line with previous reports of anonymous and known donors. While our results on donors' general positive or neutral attitudes towards future contact with potential donor offspring are reassuring, a subset of donors with negative attitudes towards such contact warrants concern and suggests a need for counselling on long-term consequences of donating gametes.
   STUDY FUNDING: The `Swedish study on gamete donation' was funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare, and the Regional Research Council in Uppsala-Orebro. There are no conflicts of interest to declare.

AB  - Objective Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, social stigma towards COVID-19 infection has become a major component of public discourse and social phenomena. As such, we aimed to develop and validate the COVID-19 Public Stigma Scale (COVID-PSS). Design and setting National-based survey cross-sectional study during the lockdown in Thailand. Participants We invited the 4004 adult public to complete a set of measurement tools, including the COVID-PSS, global fear of COVID-19, perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, Bogardus Social Distance Scale, Pain Intensity Scale and Insomnia Severity Index. Methods Factor structure dimensionality was constructed and reaffirmed with model fit by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and non-parametric item response theory (IRT) analysis. Psychometric properties for validity and reliability were tested. An anchor-based approach was performed for classifying the proper cut-off scores. Results After factor analysis, IRT analysis and test for model fit, we created the final 10-item COVID-PSS with a three-factor structure: stereotype, prejudice and fear. Face and content validity were established through the public and experts' perspectives. The COVID-PSS was significantly correlated (Spearman rank, 95% CI) with the global fear of COVID-19 (0.68, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.70), perceived risk of COVID-19 infection (0.79, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.80) and the Bogardus Social Distance Scale (0.50, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.53), indicating good convergent validity. The correlation statistics between the COVID-PSS and the Pain Intensity Scale and Insomnia Severity Index were <0.2, supporting the discriminant validity. The reliability of the COVID-PSS was satisfactory, with good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.85, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.86) and test-retest reproducibility (intraclass correlation of 0.94, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.96). The proposed cut-off scores were as follows: no/minimal (<= 18), moderate (19-25) and high (>= 26) public stigma towards COVID-19 infection. Conclusions The COVID-PSS is practical and suitable for measuring stigma towards COVID-19 in a public health survey. However, cross-cultural adaptation may be needed.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Surgeons are frequently faced with clinical adverse events owing to the nature of their specialty, yet not all surgeons disclose these events to patients. To sustain open disclosure programs, it is essential to understand how surgeons are disclosing adverse events, factors that are associated with reporting such events, and the effect of disclosure on surgeons.
   OBJECTIVE To quantitatively assess surgeons' reports of disclosure of adverse events and aspects of their experiences with the disclosure process.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An observational study was conducted from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2013, involving a 21-item baseline questionnaire administered to 67 of 75 surgeons (89%) representing 12 specialties at 3 Veterans Affairs medical centers. Sixty-two surveys of their communication about adverse events and experiences with disclosing such events were completed by 35 of these 67 surgeons (52%). Data were analyzed using mixed linear random-effects and logistic regression models.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-reports of disclosure assessed by 8 items from guidelines and pilot research, surgeons' perceptions of the adverse event, reported personal effects from disclosure, and baseline attitudes toward disclosure.
   RESULTS Most of the surgeons completing the web-based surveys (41 responses from men and 21 responses from women) used 5 of the 8 recommended disclosure items: explained why the event happened (55 of 60 surveys [92%]), expressed regret for what happened (52 of 60 [87%]), expressed concern for the patient's welfare (57 of 60 [95%]), disclosed the adverse event within 24 hours (58 of 60 [97%]), and discussed steps taken to treat any subsequent problems (59 of 60 [98%]). Fewer surgeons apologized to patients (33 of 60 [55%]), discussed whether the event was preventable (33 of 60 [55%]), or how recurrences could be prevented (19 of 59 [32%]). Surgeons who were less likely to have discussed prevention (33 of 60 [55%]), those who stated the event was very or extremely serious (40 of 61 surveys [66%]), or reported very or somewhat difficult experiences discussing the event (16 of 61 [26%]) were more likely to have been negatively affected by the event. Surgeons with more negative attitudes about disclosure at baseline reported more anxiety about patients' surgical outcomes or events following disclosure (odds ratio, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.16-2.06).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Surgeons who reported they were less likely to discuss preventability of the adverse event, or who reported difficult communication experiences, were more negatively affected by disclosure than others. Quality improvement efforts focused on recognizing the association between disclosure and surgeons' well-beingmay help sustain open disclosure policies.

AB  - Purpose Hypertension is prevalent in Uganda and achieving treatment goals remains a challenge. Our aim was to assess the impact of a bundled nurse-led intervention on hypertension physiologic measures and lifestyle modification, and to explore perceptions of the interventions to enhance sustainability. Design and setting We employed a sequential explanatory mixed-method design. The study was conducted at a large urban private hospital in Uganda from September 2018 to May 2019. Sample Participants were clinic patients with hypertension currently under care. A total of 54 participants were enrolled in two study groups. Two focus groups with 16 participants and 2 nurse-educator interviews were conducted. Methods Blood pressure and weight were measured at baseline, three, six, and nine months. The Self-Care of Hypertension Inventory was used to assess lifestyle modification. Monthly education and group-support with text-message follow-up were implemented. Two focus-groups and nurse-educator interviews were conducted to assess perceptions post-implementation. The analysis included descriptive statistic, multivariate analysis and qualitative analysis for themes and subthemes. Findings Overall, participants had a mean weight loss of 7.7 kg (p = 0.001) and a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 9.5 mm Hg (p = 0.001). Improvement in biometric outcomes was associated with lifestyle modification such as taking medicine as prescribed (p = 0.008), eat lots of fruit and vegetables (p = 0.043), and control your body weight (p = 0.015). Thematic analysis yielded the following themes: Knowledge and understanding, Attitude change, Adherence-a real struggle, and Adapting to what suits us. Participants found group support, shared learning, and knowledge reinforcement enhanced their knowledge and self-efficacy. Nurse educators were motivated by the patients' favorable responses to the Bundled Education and Support with Text (BEST) intervention. Conclusion Findings support the use of nurse-led interventions to enhance the achievement of hypertension treatment goals. To sustain the achieved lifestyle modification and blood pressure outcomes, participants expressed a desire for continued support, information access, and inclusion of patients as champions for knowledge dissemination. Future studies need to explore the provision of enabling structures to support nurse-led interventions in routine non-Communicable disease (NCD) care. Clinical relevance Hypertension knowledge-gaps exist among patients and may reflect missed opportunities for patient engagement and education for behavior change. Bundled nurse-led hypertension interventions can significantly improve lifestyle modification and enhance hypertension outcomes. Persons supported and empowered with knowledge can act as conduits to wider communities in championing knowledge dissemination.

AB  - Extending previous research on the Computers Are Social Actors paradigm and the human-to-human interaction script, this study examines the interpersonal impressions of a social robot evaluator versus a human evaluator in a performance evaluation context. A between-subjects experiment was conducted to measure participants' impressions of the credibility, task and social attractiveness, and social presence of a social robot or a human evaluator of their public speaking performances. Additionally, participants rated the competence of the feedback they received. Both evaluators (human and social robot) garnered mostly "favorable" interpersonal impressions. Moreover, both agents' feedback was rated favorably. In all cases, the human evaluator was rated significantly higher than the social robot evaluator. Implications for the use of social robots in educational evaluator roles and for future human-robot interaction research are discussed.

AB  - Conceptually, populism has no specific relationship to gender; in fact, gender differences, like all other differences within 'the people', are considered secondary, if not irrelevant, to populist politics. Yet populist actors do not operate in a cultural or ideological vacuum. So perhaps it is the national culture and broader ideology used by populists that determine their gender position. To explore this argument, we compare prototypical cases of contemporary populist forces in two regions: the Dutch Partij voor de Vrijheid (PVV, Party for Freedom) and the Dansk Folkeparti (DF, Danish People's Party) in Northern Europe, and the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV, United Socialist Party of Venezuela) and the Bolivian Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS, Movement for Socialism) in South America. Populists in Northern Europe are predominantly right-wing, yet mobilize within highly emancipated societies, while populists in South America are mainly left-wing and mobilize in strongly patriarchal societies. Our analysis provides a somewhat muddled picture. Although populists do not necessarily have a clear view on gender issues, the latter are clearly influenced by ideology and region. While left-wing populists tend to be relatively progressive within their traditional South American context, right-wing populists mainly defend the status quo in their progressive Northern European context. However, in absolute terms, the relatively high level of gender equality already achieved in Northern Europe is at least as advanced as the one proposed by the populists in South America.

AB  - Starting out from the proposition that modern antisemitism is a grotesque form of social theory that provides in its notion of 'Jewification' a critique of processes of capitalist modernization, Stoetzler points to the shared ground between classical sociological theory and modern antisemitism, and examines how their conceptual overlap influenced the ways in which sociologists responded to antisemitism or to the phenomena to which antisemitism also spoke. His argument is built around analyses of 'L'individualisme et les intellectuels', Emile Durkheim's intervention in the Dreyfus affair, and passages from Max Weber's Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus, which are placed in the context of 'classical' and 'early' sociology, including positivism, early French socialism and German Katheder-socialism (academic socialism). He argues that sociologists developed a discourse that aimed to defend liberal society and modernization and, at the same time, attack a caricature of 'egotistical utilitarianism', which they blamed for the dismal aspects of the emerging new form of society. In doing so they offered an alternative to the antisemites but also mimicked their discourse even when-as in the case of Durkheim-they explicitly opposed antisemitism. Stoetzler argues that this was an intrinsic characteristic of classical sociology that weakened its ability to oppose antisemitism and fascism.

AB  - Although scholarship on the general ideological orientation of right-wing populist parties is well established, few scholars have studied their ideas about gender. De Lange and Mugge therefore ask how differences in ideology shape right-wing populist parties' ideas on gender. Drawing on the qualitative content analysis of party manifestos, they compare the gender ideologies and concrete policy proposals of national and neoliberal populist parties in the Netherlands and Flanders from the 1980s to the present. They find that some parties adhere to a modern or modern-traditional view, while others espouse neo-traditional views. Moreover, some right-wing populist parties have adopted gendered readings of issues surrounding immigration and 'Islam', while others have not. The variation in stances on 'classical' gender issues can be explained by the genealogy and ideological orientation of the parties, whereas gendered views on immigration and Islam are influenced by contextual factors, such as 9/11.

AB  - Gestational surrogacy, in which the surrogate mother is not biologically related to the child she is carrying, is the most common type of surrogacy today. Although technologically well-developed and legal in many countries, it is stigmatized socially because it provokes and even contradicts basic traditional concepts of family, motherhood, and gender roles. The present study examines the types and expressions of the surrogacy stigma in Russia, applying a dual-pathway stigma model to a qualitative content analysis of 15,602 posts on a Russian-language online forum for surrogate mothers. Our findings reveal that the women's choice to become surrogate mothers initiated a social process in which these women experienced four types of stigma: Bad mothers, bad wives, pathetic losers, and greedy women. Surrogate mothers described the experience and internalization of stigma as threatening their social roles in the traditional family and financial realm alike. Our study places surrogacy stigma in the context of the post-Soviet financial and social climate as experienced and expressed by participants. Furthermore, understandings of the essence of perceived surrogacy stigma may help professionals develop a more nuanced and accurate approach for psychological and social care and may lead to increased accuracy in media, law, and political representation of members of this vulnerable group.
