T1  - Predictors of out‐group empathy among majority and minority children in a conflict‐affected society
AN  - 2697332692
AB  - We examined the predictors of out‐group empathy in children growing up in a city devastated during the fall of the Former Yugoslavia. Children (N = 155; 76 male, 79 female) from both majority (64.5% Croatian) and minority (35.5% Serbian) ethnic groups, ranging from 6 to 11 years old (M = 8.77, SD = 1.15) participated. A multiple‐group path analysis in Mplus found that age, general empathy, quality contact and perceived intergroup conflict related to higher out‐group empathy. There were no significant links from gender, quantity contact or out‐group friends to out‐group empathy. The findings were consistent across majority and minority ethnic groups. Implications are discussed.

T1  - “Remember that we suffered!” The effects of historical trauma on anti‐Semitic prejudice
AN  - 2661293153
AB  - A history of group traumatization exerts significant influence on group members as well as their outgroup relations. In particular, historical trauma events and their ongoing repercussions may lead to feelings of control deprivation within groups. Members of traumatized groups are prone to believe in conspiracy theories, including ones that are anti‐Semitic in nature, in an attempt to find explanations for their trauma and regain some sense of control. Often, these narratives depict Jews as those who possess control. In our study, we examine how the frequency of thoughts about historical trauma as well as historical trauma symptoms (behavioral, emotional, and depressive tendencies) are related to three forms of antisemitism: traditional antisemitism, secondary antisemitism, and a belief in anti‐Semitic conspiracy theories. The study was conducted in Hungary (N = 350) where traumatic historical events often reverberate in the national narratives. The results indicate that a higher frequency of thoughts about historical trauma is associated with higher prejudice across all three forms of antisemitism. The effects of historical trauma on secondary and conspiracy antisemitism were partly driven by behavioral symptoms of historical trauma. The explanations and implications of these results are discussed.

T1  - A social virus: Intergroup dehumanization and unwillingness to aid amidst COVID-19 − Who are the main targets?
AN  - 2667854074
AB  - Previous studies have shown that external threats, such as financial crises and natural disasters, might fuel negative attitudes, emotions, and behaviors towards outgroup members. However, it is unclear what types of outgroups are likely to be targeted when an external threat is taking its toll. In this study, we examine two types of outgroups that might be at risk of becoming victims of intergroup hostility. The first is the "ultimate scapegoat" outgroup which has a long history of negative relations with the ingroup. The second is the "context-dependent" outgroup which is viewed as an outgroup only in certain contexts. We utilized the COVID-19 crisis and the highly diverse social makeup of Israeli society to explore the extent to which each type of outgroup would be targeted. Results from our study (N = 664), conducted during the first peak of COVID-19 in Israel, show that higher levels of exposure to COVID-19 predicted lower willingness to aid outgroups and that outgroup dehumanization mediated this association. However, this held true only when the target outgroup was a context-dependent outgroup. When the target group was the ultimate scapegoat, exposure to COVID-19 did not predict ingroup willingness to aid them. Our findings contribute to our theoretical and practical knowledge on how intergroup hostility proliferates during external threats and, as such, are valuable to scholars, practitioners, and policymakers working to reduce intergroup tensions during large-scale crises.

T1  - Institutional Anomie, Market-Based Values and Anti- Immigrant Attitudes: A Multilevel Analysis in 28 European Countries
AN  - 2660146886
AB  - Individuals who are strongly oriented towards market-based values are more likely to devalue groups identified as "unprofitable" from an economic point of view. Drawing on insights from Institutional Anomie Theory (IAT), this study explores economically legitimized prejudice in light of a far-reaching economization of the institutional and cultural structure. Multilevel models using data from the European Social Survey (2018) show that hostility towards immigrants is expressed more among individuals who strongly embrace market-based values and in countries where the institutional structure is dominated by the economy and non-economic social institutions are enfeebled (institutional imbalance). Aggregated market-based values (a "marketized anomic culture") mediate the effect of a) individual market-based values and b) institutional imbalance on anti-immigrant attitudes. This study contributes to a better understanding of group prejudice under conditions of economization. It shows that applying IAT within a multilevel framework offers a fruitful explanation not only for crime but for other sociological phenomena.

T1  - Public beliefs about the black/white socioeconomic status gap: What's “upbringing” got to do with it?*
AN  - 2642200975
AB  - ObjectiveCiting the black family as the locus of responsibility for black disadvantage has a long history in the United States; however, only limited research has examined the place of family upbringing in studies of Americans’ beliefs about the causes of racial inequality.MethodsWe use data from the 2010, 2012, and 2014 General Social Surveys (GSS) to examine the prevalence and selected correlates of a newly offered (by the GSS) and culturally centered explanation of the black/white socioeconomic status gap focusing on “differences in upbringing.”ResultsThe “upbringing” explanation is the most popular of the five reasons offered by the GSS in all three waves of data available for examination. Three‐quarters of GSS respondents endorse this view, while less than half endorse the next most popular explanation. Upbringing is also the most popular explanation among all three race/ethnic groups we examine, though non‐Hispanic whites endorse this view most strongly.ConclusionOur results offer important insights for future survey design and investigations of public beliefs about racial inequality.

AN  - 2631960115
AB  - Entre los estudios sobre el prejuicio que consideran sus expresiones indirectas, se advierte la ausencia de instrumentos para la medición del prejuicio hacia personas afectadas por la pobreza. El objetivo del presente estudio fue adaptar y validar una escala de prejuicio sutil y manifiesto hacia personas en situación de pobreza, así como analizar sus relaciones con variables asociadas a la justificación del sistema. Se trabajó con una muestra, de 712 estudiantes universitarios de Argentina, con edades entre 17 y 48 años. Los resultados obtenidos evidenciaron que la versión propuesta de la escala cuenta con adecuadas propiedades psicométricas en cuanto a su consistencia interna y validez de constructo, para la estructura de dos dimensiones correlacionadas. Estos resultados son análogos a los obtenidos en otras versiones de la escala con diferentes grupos sociales. Asimismo, se observaron correlaciones positivas entre el prejuicio sutil, el prejuicio manifiesto, la orientación a la dominancia social y la creencia en un mundo justo. Se concluye que la escala propuesta sería un instrumento adecuado para evaluar las nuevas formas de expresión del prejuicio hacia personas en situación de pobreza.Alternate abstract:Among the studies on prejudice that consider its indirect expressions, we point out the absence of instruments for measuring prejudice towards people affected by poverty.

We worked with an convenience sample of 712 university students from Argentina, aged between 17 and 48 years. The results obtained showed that the proposed version of the scale has adequate psychometric properties in terms of its internal consistency and construct validity, for the structure of two correlated dimensions. These results are analogous to those obtained in other versions of the scale with different social groups. Likewise, positive correlations were observed between subtle prejudice, blatant prejudice, social dominance orientation and belief in a just world. It is concluded that the proposed scale would be an adequate instrument to evaluate the new forms of expression of prejudice towards people in poverty.

T1  - Loneliness and Its Association With Social Media Use During the COVID-19 Outbreak
AN  - 2583827467
AB  - Social distancing rules during the COVID-19 pandemic changed social interaction for many and increased the risk of loneliness in the general population. Social media use has been ambiguously related to loneliness, and associations may differ by age. The study aimed to examine loneliness and its association with social media use within different age groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia during April/May 2020, and 3,810 participants aged 18 years or above were recruited. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between social media use and social and emotional loneliness within separate age groups. Emotional loneliness was higher among young adults and among those who used social media several times daily. Adjusting by sociodemographic variables, using more types of social media was associated with lower social loneliness among the oldest participants, and with higher emotional loneliness among the youngest participants. Among middle-aged participants, using social media more frequently was associated with lower social loneliness. We found that the associations between social media use and loneliness varied by age. Older people’s engagement on social media may be a resource to reduce loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed higher levels of loneliness among high-frequent social media users of younger age.

T1  - Perceived racial discrimination on the change of suicide risk among ethnic minorities in the United States
AN  - 2545445668
AB  - Objective: Suicide ideation and attempts are serious public health concerns in the U.S. Previous studies focus mainly on individual factors that cause suicide and therefore, it is imperative to examine the impact of the environment on the onset of suicide risk. This study explored the effects of perceived race/ethnicity-based discrimination (PD; perceived institutional discrimination and perceived interpersonal discrimination) on the change in suicidal thoughts and attempts among racial/ethnic minority (REM) participants at risk for depression over time using a longitudinal nationally representative dataset.Design and methods: The sample consisted a total of 1,253 REM participants from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions Wave 1 and 2 datasets. Participants were categorized into three conditions: (1) no suicidal thoughts/attempts at Wave 1, who were at risk for onset of suicidal thoughts at Wave 2, (2) no suicidal thoughts/attempts at Wave 1, who were at risk for onset of both suicidal thoughts and attempts at Wave 2, and (3) had suicidal thoughts but no attempts at Wave 1, who were at risk for initiating suicidal attempt at Wave 2. Three logistic regressions were performed to examine the associations between PD and the three suicidal conditions, controlling for sociodemographic factors.Results: Regression results showed that perceived institutional discrimination predicted onset of suicidal thoughts for Condition 1 (OR = 1.67, 95% CI:1.05–2.66) and initiation of suicidal attempts for Condition 2 (OR = 2.67, 95% CI:1.30–5.48), whereas perceived interpersonal discrimination predicted onset of suicidal thoughts and attempts for Condition 1 (OR = 2.34, 95% CI:1.17–4.66).Conclusions: PD may have detrimental effects on suicidal behaviors among REM individuals with depressive symptoms. Development of suicide prevention programs needs to take into account PD and be specific for different at-risk groups. This also foregrounds the importance of promoting anti-discrimination policies/programs as a suicide preventive intervention for REM individuals with depressive symptoms.

T1  - Multiculturalism in Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea and E. M. Forster's Where Angels Fear to Tread
TT  - Jean Rhys'ın Geniş Geniş Bir Deniz ve E. M. Forster'ın Meleklerin Uǧramadıǧı Yer Romanlarında Çokkültürlülük
AN  - 2579142894
AB  - Bu makalenin amacı, Jean Rhys'ın Geniş Geniş Bir Deniz ve E. M. Forster'ın Meleklerin Uǧramadıǧı Yer romanlarında, karakterlerin yaşam tarzları, dil, milletler arası evlenme, özgürlüǧün idaresi, kültürel uygulamalar baǧlamında, çokkültürlülüǧün, Büyük ve Küçük Antiller ve İngiltere'de, yirminci yüz yılın karmaşasında nasıl ele alındıǧını, karşılaştırmaktır. Çokkültürlü toplumlarda, Forster humanist bakış açısını sorgulayarak ikili zıtlıkları açıklamakta, Rhys ise kölelik sonrası dönemdeki deǧişimden kaynaklanan yıkıma odaklanmaktadır. Her iki romanda da karakterlerin önyargıları, deǧerleri; sosyal entegrasyon olan milletlerarası evlilik ve göçe karşıt oluşturur. Kültürel çeşitliliǧi olan toplumlar, yirminci yüzyılda azınlıkları kendi kültürlerine entegre etmek için baskın kültürün zorlayıcı uygulamalarına maruz kalırlar. Bu makale şemsiye terim çokkültürlülüǧün altında, önyargının ve kültürel entegrasyonun reddini her iki romanda inceler.Alternate abstract:The aim of this article is to compare and contrast how multiculturalism is handled in Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea and E. M. Forster's Where Angels Fear to Tread regarding the lifestyles of the characters, language, intermarriage, management of freedom, the cultural practices in the West Indies, and Monteriano Italy, within the tumultuous time of the twentieth century. In multicultural societies, Forster elucidates cross-binaries questing humanistic views whereas Rhys focuses on subversion of the post-slavery era. In both novels, the characters' prejudices, values run counter to the practices of social integration such as intermarriages, immigration. The culturally diverse societies undergo the dominant culture's enforced practices to integrate minorities into their own culture in the twentieth century. Thus, this article explores the denial of prejudice, the denial of cultural integration under the umbrella term multiculturalism in these two novels.

T1  - ‘Peasants are peasants’: Prejudice against displaced villagers in newly-built urban neighbourhoods in China
AN  - 2526045791
AB  - This article explores contemporary prejudice against displaced villagers in urban China, drawing on a project on urban sprawl in Yinchuan where rural villages are absorbed into the urban area. The research demonstrates that media discourses about chaiqian baofahu and suzhi that stigmatise displaced villagers are being actively reproduced in everyday life in newly built urban neighbourhoods. Urbanites’ prejudice against displaced villagers can be viewed as, on the one hand, a result of the feelings of relative deprivation from unfavourable comparisons with displaced villagers, while on the other hand, a response to maintain a positive ingroup identity – in this case, an urban and ‘civilised’ way of life. The article then examines the effectiveness of contact as a means for reducing prejudice, and reveals that intergroup contact in urban neighbourhoods does not necessarily create mutual understanding and trust. The article highlights the structural causes of prejudice and concludes by arguing for social transformation to challenge and reduce prejudice.

T1  - Homophobia and national collective narcissism in populist Poland: European Journal of Sociology
AN  - 2598939609
AB  - Opposition to sexual minority rights in Poland is among the highest in the EU. Populist political actors in the country repeatedly scapegoat gays and lesbians, presenting them as a threat to the Polish nation and its shared norms and values, particularly those derived from religion. Building upon previous research which shows how discourse constructing homosexuality as a threat to the nation has been used by social and political actors to legitimize homophobic rhetoric and behaviour, our paper shows whether nationalism—understood here as national collective narcissism—predicts prejudice towards gays and lesbians at the level of individual beliefs.

T1  - Boundaries of the nation(s) in a multinational state: Comparing Quebecers and other Canadians' perspectives on national identity
AN  - 2509212192
AB  - Drawing on the Canadian case, this study examines whether, in a multinational state, majority and minority nations emphasize different criteria when tracing the borders of their respective national community. It does so by comparing native‐born French speakers in Quebec and native‐born English speakers in the rest of Canada from three different perspectives. We examine (a) the way ascriptive and attainable groupings of characteristics are constructed in Quebec and in the rest of Canada, (b) the importance given to attainable and ascriptive characteristics, and (c) the implications of ascriptive and attainable characteristics for attitudes toward immigration and generalized trust. The findings suggest that majority‐group members in Quebec and in the rest of Canada broadly draw the boundaries of their nation in similar ways and with similar implications.

T1  - Media portrayals of Muslims: a comparative sentiment analysis of American newspapers, 1996–2015
AN  - 2571102579
AB  - Are Muslims portrayed more negatively than other religious groups? If so, what factors are associated with this negativity? We apply computer-assisted, lexicon-based coding to over 850,000 articles that mention Muslims, Hindus, Jews, or Catholics in 17 national and regional US newspapers over the 20-year period of 1996–2015 and compare them to a representative baseline of articles. We show that the average tone of articles about Muslims is considerably more negative than both this baseline and compared to articles about the other groups. The negative tone is most strongly associated with stories about extremism and events in foreign settings. However, even controlling for a wide range of factors does not eliminate the negativity in stories mentioning Muslims. We discuss the implications of these findings for media objectivity and for public attitudes and policy preferences with respect to Muslims and other social groups.

T1  - Friendship and romance across the U.S. political divide: Hindrance or help for outgroup political attitudes?
AN  - 2509281679
AB  - Consistent with the intergroup contact literature, cross‐political relationships (e.g., friendships or romantic relationships between different partisans) may help reduce inter‐political group prejudice. Given that unfavorable attitudes based on the political group membership are particularly heightened at present in the United States, we explored whether having cross‐political friendships (Study 1) or romantic relationships (Study 2) predict more positive interpersonal or intergroup attitudes among American Democrats and Republicans. In Study 1, using a social network measure (N = 301), where participants reported on their closest friends, cross‐political (versus same‐political) friendship was associated with less positive interpersonal attitudes when this relationship was unsatisfying. Having any (versus no) or more (versus less) cross‐political group friendships was not associated with holding more positive intergroup attitudes. In Study 2, cross‐political romantic relationships were examined (N = 392). Having a cross‐ (versus same‐) political romantic relationship was associated with relatively less positive attitudes toward the political outgroup via lower empathy when relationship satisfaction was low. Study findings highlight the potential limitations of the beneficial effects of intergroup contact.

T1  - Gendered outgroup prejudice: An evolutionary threat management perspective on anti-immigrant bias: GPIR
AN  - 2473715946
AB  - Are male and female immigrants viewed similarly or differently? Consistent with an evolutionary threat management perspective, we suggest that the answer to this question depends upon what types of threats immigrant groups are perceived as posing. In the present study, we compared attitudes toward male and female immigrants from either a violent ecology (e.g., Syria) or a pathogen-rich ecology (e.g., Liberia). We hypothesized that people would have more negative attitudes toward male than female immigrants from a violent ecology, but that attitudes would be similar toward male and female immigrants from a pathogen-rich ecology. Internal meta-analyses of three studies (total N = 1,488) were in line with our hypothesis. They showed that attitudes toward male immigrants from a violent ecology were more negative than attitudes toward female immigrants from the same ecology. In contrast, attitudes toward male and female immigrants were similar when those immigrants came from a pathogen-rich ecology. Our findings are consistent with an evolutionary threat management perspective on outgroup prejudice and are aligned with the male warrior hypothesis: Attitudes toward male versus female outgroup members vary with the potential threats these outgroups pose.

T1  - Intersectional identifications: Ethnicity and sexuality among diasporic queer women in Belgium
AN  - 2429520741
AB  - While research on migration and diasporas tends to be heteronormative, research on sexual minorities tends to ignore migrants and ethnic minorities. The current paper aims to problematize both tendencies by taking a queer perspective on migration and a diasporic perspective on sexuality. As part of a larger project on diasporic LGBTQs living in Belgium, this paper discusses the social positions and identifications of six non-heterosexual women with a migration background, as narrated in individual in-depth interviews. Drawing on intersectionality theory, the relative importance and mutual interplay between their sexual and ethno-cultural identifications are analysed. This analysis discloses the irreducible individuality of each narrative, where the balance and interaction between ethno-cultural and sexual identifications is part of an intricate interplay of social positions and contexts. The participants’ migration background is a key structuring element, leading to a combination of geographic and/or social distance from their family and ethno-cultural community in which religious, family and gender norms lead to a range of expectations and pressures. Sexual identifications tend to be more salient when they are strongly rejected, in which case they lead to more social and often also geographic distancing. This is further modulated by race, as non-white participants tend to identify more strongly along racial lines because they are continuously reminded of their otherness.

T1  - Evaluation and Revision of an Instrument Measuring Attitudes toward the Amish
AN  - 2439231661
AB  - The attitudes non-members hold toward the Amish—or any ethnic, racial, and religious group—has consequences for that population, from criminal victimization to an ability to exercise human rights. Given their rapid growth and expansion in North America, an effective tool is needed to measure public attitudes toward the Amish. William McGuigan recently led the development of an Attitudes Toward the Amish (ATA) instrument, which was tested in northwestern Pennsylvania. In using the ATA in northeastern Missouri, we encountered problems with the instrument’s operational validity: no significant differences were found in the responses between a university undergraduate population of largely urban/suburban origin and the local rural population when we would otherwise expect differences. We revised the instrument and administered it to the same populations. Of the 16 items in the revised version, 14 were significantly different at the p < .05 level. A factor analysis revealed four components with face validity. Based on these results, we offer the Revised ATA (RATA) as an improved instrument and make recommendations for designing instruments intended to measure attitudes toward outgroups.

T1  - Patterns of Middling Migrant Sociabilities: a Case Study of a Disempowered City and Towns
AN  - 2182957272
AB  - Drawing on scalar theory of locality and the concept of urban sociabilities, this paper discusses sociabilities, social encounters based on domains of commonality, between middling migrants and local inhabitants in three different settings in Poland. At the same time, however, the paper points out to the feeling of strangeness and otherness experienced by migrants due to cultural and social distance. In contrast to mainstream literature that concentrates on low-skilled migrants or elite professionals in global cities, the article focuses on middling migrants in two disempowered towns (Jelcz-Laskowice and Strzelin) and one city (Opole) within the Walbrzych Special Economic Zone in Poland. It shows the particularities of urban sociabilities in locations that lack well-established migrant communities and have peripheral status in the global economy.

T1  - Discrimination in the United States: Perspectives for the future
AN  - 2315697094
AB  - ObjectiveTo summarize findings from this Special Issue, which examine reported experiences of discrimination among six underrepresented groups in public opinion research—blacks, Latinos, Native Americans, Asian Americans, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) adults, and women.Data Source and Study DesignData come from a nationally representative, probability‐based telephone survey of 3453 US adults, conducted January—April 2017.MethodsWe calculated the percent of adults reporting discrimination in several domains, including health care.Principal FindingsIn health care encounters, 32 percent of black adults reported discrimination, as did 23 percent of Native Americans, 20 percent of Latinos, 18 percent of women, 16 percent of LGBTQ adults, and 13 percent of Asian Americans. Significant shares also reported experiencing racial, gender, or LGBTQ identity‐based violence against themselves or family members, including 51 percent of LGBTQ adults, 42 percent of blacks, 38 percent of Native Americans, and 21 percent of women. At least one in seven blacks (22 percent), LGBTQ adults (18 percent), Latinos (17 percent), and Native Americans (15 percent) reported avoiding health care for themselves or family members over concerns of anticipated discrimination or unfair treatment.ConclusionsTaken together, this polling effort illustrates the significant and widespread level of discrimination against many groups in America today, as well as the complex manifestation of these experiences across different groups and different areas of life. While it is beyond the scope of these results to make specific recommendations for how to end discrimination in each area of life we studied, this Special Issue provides important evidence that more research and practice on discrimination are sorely needed in health services research.

T1  - "They are all alike": When negative minority outgroups are generalized onto superordinate inclusive outgroups
AN  - 2350370467
AB  - Two studies investigated outgroup-to-outgroup generalization, addressing whether members of negatively perceived minority outgroups are perceived as prototypical of larger partially-inclusive outgroups and whether this tendency is enhanced under intergroup threat. Both experimental studies were conducted with Italian undergraduate participants. Experiment 1 (N = 186) tested whether Roma are generalized onto (i.e., perceived as prototypical of) Romanians to a higher extent under intergroup realistic and symbolic threat than under no-threat. It also explored the direction of the phenomenon and its underlying mechanism. Experiment 2 (N = 90) provided additional evidence on the effect of threat on such generalization phenomenon considering a different pair of groups (Islamic terrorists, Arabs) and employing a less blatant measure of generalization. Overall, these studies provided consistent evidence of outgroup-to-outgroup generalization, clarifying the conditions of its occurrence. These results contribute to the understanding of the phenomenon of outgroup-to-outgroup generalization and of its impact on outgroup perception and prejudice.

T1  - Marry who you love: Intergroup contact with gay people and another stigmatized minority is related to voting on the restriction of gay rights through threat
AN  - 2312955855
AB  - The study examined factors associated with discrimination against gay people in a public referendum aimed at the restriction of gay rights. We tested whether positive and negative intergroup contact with gay people and intergroup contact with another stigmatized minority, the Roma, were associated with how the heterosexual majority voted in the referendum (i.e., discrimination). We tested two mechanisms underlying the link between intergroup contact and discrimination—the mediation by intergroup threat and the mediation by outgroup attitudes. We found that negative contact with both gay people and the Roma was associated with a higher probability of gay discrimination while positive contact was associated with a lower probability of gay discrimination. Intergroup threat, not intergroup attitudes, mediated the link between intergroup contact and discrimination. In the case of contact with gay people, intergroup contact was linked to discrimination through threat from gay people. In the case of contact with Roma, intergroup contact was linked to discrimination through the generalization of threats from the Roma to gay people but not via the generalization of outgroup attitudes. Our research brings novel evidence that contact with one minority can affect discrimination against another minority in both positive and negative way and that perceived threat, but not attitudes, plays a key role in majority's decision to discriminate against gay people.

T1  - The return of the 'Black Babies': how development education affects schoolchildren's attitudes to the majority world - the Trócaire 2012 Lenten campaign
AN  - 2282427469
AB  - This article investigates how development education campaigns affect schoolchildren's understanding of both global and domestic poverty, through examining the 2012 Lenten campaign by the Irish agency, Trócaire. It analyses Trócaire campaign material as well as its reception by schoolchildren, aged 10-12. We found the material contained neo-colonial stereotypes about Africa as a primitive place dependent on Western aid, displaying continuity with the prior 'Black Baby Phenomenon'. This refers to the collection boxes Irish children were given with a picture of a black baby on them, which fostered an understanding of Africans as helpless childlike victims, Children in our focus groups understood the Africans portrayed by the Trócaire campaign as hopeless, primitive, intellectually inferior Others. Furthermore, this there was strong indication that this imagery fostered social distance towards ethnic minorities in Ireland and encouraged children to minimise domestic poverty, through considering this to be only an issue in 'developing countries'.

T1  - Perceived racial/ethnic discrimination, marketing, and substance use among young adults
AN  - 2353557442
AB  - Perceived experiences of discrimination have been linked to negative health behaviors including tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use across various racial/ethnic groups. Tobacco and alcohol marketing exposure have also been linked with substance use. This study examined the independent and interacting effects of perceived experiences of discrimination and exposure to alcohol and tobacco marketing, and receptivity to marijuana marketing on substance use in an online survey of a multiethnic sample of young adults in 6 metropolitan areas (n = 505). African Americans (mean (M) = 1.96, 9% 5CI [1.84, 2.09]) and Hispanics (M = 1.98, 95% CI [1.87, 2.09]) reported higher levels of perceived discrimination than Whites (M = 1.52, 95% CI [1.40, 1.64]), p <  .001. African Americans had higher levels of exposure to tobacco and alcohol marketing; Hispanics reported higher levels of exposure to alcohol marketing and receptivity to marijuana promotion. Discrimination and marketing exposure were independently associated with higher odds of all 3 outcomes, controlling for covariates (AOR from 2.1 to 3.4 for discrimination; AOR from 1.4 to 13.8 for marketing). Models showed a significant interaction of discrimination and tobacco marketing on past 30-day cigarette use (F = 5.5; p = .02). Individuals with high levels of tobacco marketing exposure were likely to report high past 30-day cigarette use regardless of level of discrimination, while those with low exposure were only at increased risk of reporting cigarette use at higher levels of discrimination. Both perceived discrimination and marketing exposure play a role in substance use. Interventions should consider discrimination as a significant risk factor underlying vulnerability to substance use among young adults.

T1  - Identity Questioning: Antecedents and Consequences of Prejudice Attributions
AN  - 2241815629
AB  - Many ethnic minorities in the United States hold both an ethnic minority and national American identity. Yet, they often encounter identity questioning when asked questions such as, “Where are you really from?,” which may operate as an ambiguous threat to their national identity. Because varied motivations (curiosity versus exclusion) create ambiguity, targets likely vary in their tendency to view identity questioning as prejudicial. Study 1 examined the extent to which ethnic minorities attribute identity questioning to prejudice, and the associated well‐being consequences. Study 2 examined the immigration policy‐oriented antecedents of identity questioning prejudice attributions. The results suggest that prejudice attributions are psychologically harmful (Study 1) and are associated with anti‐immigration policies (Study 2). Because identity questioning challenges one's ability to maintain a dual identity, it is important to better understand identity questioning. Specifically, these findings provide initial evidence of the role policy contexts may play in shaping identity questioning attributions.

T1  - Neoliberal Ideology and the Justification of Inequality in Capitalist Societies: Why Social and Economic Dimensions of Ideology Are Intertwined
AN  - 2190815277
AB  - In this article we analyze data from high‐quality surveys conducted in the United States and the United Kingdom that included multiple symbolic and operational measures of political ideology and psychological orientations. Our overarching goal is to elucidate the nature of conceptual and empirical connections between neoliberalism and social conservatism. In so doing, we revisit three major questions about public opinion in neoliberal societies: (1) Are ordinary citizens “innocent” of ideology? (2) Are social and economic dimensions of ideology structurally and functionally independent? (3) Are support for laissez‐faire capitalism and opposition to welfare—hallmarks of neoliberal ideology—unrelated or negatively related to authoritarianism? In contrast to previous investigations relying upon fewer and poorer measures, we found that ordinary citizens do indeed hold coherent political attitudes, and their attitudes about social and economic issues are closely aligned. For instance, we observed that for five previously published ideological instruments, social and economic attitudes were robustly correlated in two large U.S. samples (with rs ranging from .40 to .69)—for respondents who were relatively low (.31 ≤ r ≤ .60) as well as high in political sophistication (.50 ≤ r ≤ .77). Contradicting prior claims, we found no evidence that support for the free market was negatively associated with authoritarianism for any group of respondents or any measure of authoritarianism. On the contrary, economic conservatism and the endorsement of neoliberal attitudes were strongly associated with right‐wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, economic system justification, and gender‐specific system justification (with rs ranging from .53 to .76). We conclude that the political belief systems of ordinary citizens are coherently organized around support for versus opposition to both social and economic forms of inequality in contemporary capitalist societies.

T1  - Different forms of intergroup contact with former adversary are linked to distinct reconciliatory acts through symbolic and realistic threat
AN  - 2178496160
AB  - In a society burdened with the most severe type of intergroup conflict, we examined the association between willingness to reconcile with former adversary, intergroup contact with, and perceived threat from former adversary. We focused on three reconciliatory acts—forgiveness to the outgroup, support for ingroup apology and support for financial compensation to the outgroup. We included different forms of positive and negative intergroup contact—direct and indirect (extended and mass‐mediated). In the link between contact and reconciliation, we tested the mediating role of two types of intergroup threat—realistic and symbolic. The sample comprised Bosniaks (N = 267) and Croats (N = 278) from Bosnia and Herzegovina. In both samples, reconciliation associated with indirect forms of intergroup contact even when controlling for its link with direct contact. This indicates the potential of indirect contact to promote reconciliation in the lack of direct contact, characteristic for segregated post‐conflict societies. Symbolic threat mediated the relationship between intergroup contact and symbolic forms of reconciliation—forgiveness and support for ingroup apology. Realistic threat mediated the link between intergroup contact and a more tangible form of reconciliation—support for financial compensation. This highlights the importance of considering different types intergroup threat when targeting distinct reconciliatory acts. Our results suggest that practitioners promoting reconciliation in post‐conflict societies need to implement different means when tailoring interventions that should enhance different sides of peace‐making process.

T1  - Majority rule vs. minority rights: immigrant representation despite public opposition on the 1986 immigration reform and control act
AN  - 2571083575
AB  - What explains legislators’ behavior when they are uncertain whether they will be rewarded or punished at re-election? Typically, politicians are incentivized to deliver policies preferred by the majority. Less well understood is what happens when legislators face decisions on issues on which their traditional supporters disagree. Owing to the unavailability of public opinion data for congressional districts, however, studies evaluating competing theories of representation on such issues are scarce. We examine this question by evaluating leading theories of representation on the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), a complex, historically significant, highly salient, and controversial bill that gave citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants – precisely the type of group that past research suggests should struggle to obtain representation. We employ recent advances in estimating public opinion using multilevel regression and post-stratification to estimate district-level public opinion on IRCA. Contrary to traditional conceptions of subconstituency politics, the results suggest that, under at least some circumstances, traditionally marginalized groups are able to make important policy advances in the face of negative opinion, particularly when they are able to build coalitions that cross party lines and divide their opposition.

T1  - Not Just a National Issue: Effect of State‐Level Reception of Immigrants and Population Changes on Intergroup Attitudes of Whites, Latinos, and Asians in the United States
AN  - 2151163668
AB  - National discourse about immigration in the United States has become increasingly unwelcoming. In two studies, we examine whether regional‐level (state) information about welcoming (vs. unwelcoming) immigrant policies in the context of either stable or increasing rate of immigration can influence intergroup relations in receiving communities. Among Whites (Study 1), welcoming policy proposals elicited more positive attitudes toward immigrants generally and toward Latinos, the ethnic group most closely associated with immigration in the United States, but only when rate of immigration is constant. In contrast, among Latinos (Study 2), an unwelcoming reception led to more positive attitudes toward immigrants (legal and undocumented) but again only when rate of immigration is constant. Asians’ attitudes (Study 2) toward immigrants were not affected by contextual information about immigration. Together, these findings suggest that local conditions can affect community members’ attitudes toward immigrants and toward specific ethnic groups associated with immigration.

T1  - A system for intergroup prejudice detection: The case of microblogging under terrorist attacks
AN  - 2114675679
AB  - Intergroup prejudice is a distorted opinion held by one social group about another, without examination of facts. It is heightened during crises or threat. It finds expression in social media platforms when a group of people express anger, resentment and dissent towards another. This paper presents a system for automated detection of prejudiced messages from social media feeds. It uses a knowledge discovery framework that preprocesses data, generates theory-driven linguistic features along with other features engineered from textual content, annotates and models historical data to determine what drives detection of intergroup prejudice especially during a crisis. It is tested on tweets collected during the Boston Marathon bombing event. The system can be used to curb abuse and harassment by timely detection and reporting of intergroup prejudice.

T1  - Linguistic Cultural Capital among Descendants of Mixed Couples in Catalonia, Spain: Realities and Inequalities
AN  - 2081349727
AB  - Spain, along with the region of Catalonia in particular, has seen a significant increase in mixed unions between immigrants and natives, which, in turn, has given rise to a growing number of young people with mixed origins. Yet little is known about how these mixed families and individuals negotiate cultural differences and view their 'mixed cultural capital.' Drawing on 29 in-depth interviews with youth of diverse mixed cultural, racial, and religious backgrounds residing in Catalonia and 58 in-depth interviews with immigrants in mixed unions, this paper focuses on the role of language as a form of cultural capital. Do mixed families use a number of languages in their everyday lives? Which languages are transmitted, preferred, and used, and why? We find that mixed families are generally multilingual, as the knowledge of different languages is thought to contribute to communication with relatives, social integration, and social mobility. However, children and youth of mixed descent who belong to minoritized ethnic or racial groups may resist learning or actively using the language of their immigrant parent to avoid stigmatization and socially imposed categories of 'foreignness.' Therefore, stigmatization and prejudice may be limiting linguistic cultural capital - a key benefit of mixedness - in Catalonia.

T1  - Crossing the Border: Latino Attitudes Toward Immigration Policy
AN  - 2015562494
AB  - In the midst of the ongoing and highly polarized immigration debate, it seems that little attention has been paid to how Latinos view efforts to address the issues of undocumented immigrants residing in the United States and enhanced enforcement efforts along the U.S.–Mexico border. Consequently, questions arise as to the degree of support for or rejection of such measures within the Latino community and among the various segments of that community. Do U.S.-born Latinos, foreign-born naturalized citizens, and undocumented immigrants from various parts of Latin America have similar or divergent views on these issues? It is generally assumed that ethnicity is an important factor in influencing attitudes toward immigrants and immigration policies. Some studies have found that foreign-born Latinos have more positive attitudes toward immigration than native-born Latinos due in part to their shared immigration experience. There are, however, other studies demonstrating that Latino immigrants have often expressed support for more restrictive immigration policies. It may hold true, in fact, that many Latinos have ambiguous and conflicting attitudes about these issues. This article will try to shed some light on Latinos’ attitudes regarding specific policy measures by analyzing data from the Pew Hispanic Center National Survey of Latinos, which allows for considerable differentiation among various sectors of the Latino population.

T1  - The psychology of social class: How socioeconomic status impacts thought, feelings, and behaviour
AN  - 2020475637
AB  - Drawing on recent research on the psychology of social class, I argue that the material conditions in which people grow up and live have a lasting impact on their personal and social identities and that this influences both the way they think and feel about their social environment and key aspects of their social behaviour. Relative to middle‐class counterparts, lower/working‐class individuals are less likely to define themselves in terms of their socioeconomic status and are more likely to have interdependent self‐concepts; they are also more inclined to explain social events in situational terms, as a result of having a lower sense of personal control. Working‐class people score higher on measures of empathy and are more likely to help others in distress. The widely held view that working‐class individuals are more prejudiced towards immigrants and ethnic minorities is shown to be a function of economic threat, in that highly educated people also express prejudice towards these groups when the latter are described as highly educated and therefore pose an economic threat. The fact that middle‐class norms of independence prevail in universities and prestigious workplaces makes working‐class people less likely to apply for positions in such institutions, less likely to be selected and less likely to stay if selected. In other words, social class differences in identity, cognition, feelings, and behaviour make it less likely that working‐class individuals can benefit from educational and occupational opportunities to improve their material circumstances. This means that redistributive policies are needed to break the cycle of deprivation that limits opportunities and threatens social cohesion.

T1  - From Personal Experiences to Classroom Teaching: A Socio-Psychological Study of Social Inclusion and Exclusion
AN  - 2088824939
AB  - Creating an inclusive classroom environment where learners appreciate diversity and value positive interpersonal associations is a challenge faced by the teachers worldwide. This is particularly so in the Indian context, where the complex phenomena of social categorization impacts the individual in manifold ways from a tender age. In the context of student-teacher relationship, the personal experiences of the teacher have a trickle-down effect on student socialization patterns. This paper explores the teachers' personal experiences of social inclusion and exclusion and its impact on his/her classroom interactions with students. Our sample consisted of 23 teachers (18 females and 5 males) working in low-income schools in Delhi. Extensive narratives were undertaken and subject to thematic analysis. Teachers expansively described their experiences of facing social exclusion. Although the staff maintained an outward semblance of inclusivity, the undercurrents of exclusion and marginalization were noted. The need for social approval and maintenance of a politically correct façade was the guiding force for many teachers. Yet many of them expressed their own prejudices and biased thoughts about social groups. The findings are discussed in the light of current theorization in the area.

T1  - Neighborhood Effects of Intergroup Contact on Change in Youth Intergroup Bias
AN  - 1983623187
AB  - Intergroup contact plays a critical role in the reduction of prejudice; however, there is limited research examining the multiple ways through which contact can impact trajectories of development for adolescents in divided societies. Thus, the goal of the current study was to examine individual- and context-level effects of intergroup contact on change in intergroup bias through adolescence. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze five waves of data from 933 youth (Mage = 15.5, SD = 4.03; range: 10–20 years old; 52% female) living in 38 neighborhoods in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The results suggest that youth increase in bias with age. Adolescents with more frequent intergroup contact increase more quickly, and those who report higher quality of contact increase more slowly. Both frequency and quality of contact at the neighborhood level predicted slower increases in bias across adolescence. The results add to a growing literature that combines social and developmental approaches to understanding how intergroup processes and intergroup divide impact youth development of intergroup attitudes and behaviors. The results are discussed in terms of the importance of both individual experiences and the context of intergroup contact for youth development in divided contexts.

T1  - Positive and negative intergroup contact predict Black and White Americans' judgments about police violence against Black Americans
AN  - 1959042580
AB  - We examined whether past positive and negative interracial contact predict people's views of interracial police violence. White (N=207) and Black (N=116) Americans reported on their past intergroup experiences before viewing information about one of two true events involving the death of a Black man at the hands of a White police officer. For White Americans, negative contact predicted a reluctance to blame the officer and a willingness to believe that people's responses to the events involved "playing the race card." For Black Americans, positive contact predicted marginally less officer blame and lower beliefs that the victim was racially profiled. This suggests the potential for a vicious cycle, whereby past contact experiences color perceptions of intergroup conflict in the present.

T1  - Minority Stress, Resilience, and Mental Health: A Study of Italian Transgender People
AN  - 1940950412
AB  - Transgender people often experience oppression because of gender nonconformity. They represent an extremely stigmatized population at high risk of developing mental health problems. The minority stress model is a theoretical model used to understand social stigma as a potential cause of mental health disparities faced by the transgender population. In Italy, studies applying this model to the transgender population are limited. The current study applied the minority stress model to a sample of Italian transgender people (n = 149), analyzing effects of prejudice events, expectations of rejection, and internalized transphobia, and their interaction with protective factors (resilience and social support), on mental health. The results suggest that exposure to everyday discrimination and internalized transphobia are associated with increased mental health problems, while perceived social support from family and resilience significantly reduced the strength of association between everyday discrimination and mental health. Findings have important implications for both social issues and policies.

T1  - Between the Public and the State: The Shipping Lobby's Strategies against US Immigration Restrictions 1882-1917: IMR
AN  - 1911516200
AB  - Based on Freeman's model of interest group-driven migration policies, the article gives a qualitative inside look on a neglected actor during the formative years of US immigration reform. It analyzes the central role of the shipping companies in coordinating the pro-immigration campaign with and against other interest groups. Their lobbying is divided into two complementary sections: inside top-down efforts (lobbyists) to influence legislators and outside bottom-up efforts (migrant communities and the press) to mobilize the public. It assesses the importance of public opinion in their lobby campaigns and the shipping companies' success in delaying far-reaching restrictions until 1917.

T1  - Multiculturalism, Racialism and the Dilemma of the African-American in the Twenty-First Century
AN  - 1943051080
AB  - The paper sets out to explore the nature and dynamics of multiculturalism- an ideology that has the potency of integrating and interconnecting the world by the promotion of cultural identity, diversity and equity. The paper argues that decades after the dismantling of the apparatus of legal segregation and subsequent erosion of many of the cultural supports of racial domination in America, racial discrimination has remained a norm and pervasive fact of life which has been demonstrated both in mundane social interactions and in the major institutional contexts. The paper further argues that the birth of multiculturalism in America has done little to circumvent the rising tide of racial inequality and stigma against the African-Americans. The effects of this are more subtle and deeply embedded in the symbolic and expressive life of the American society. A secondary method was used to collect data which included review of journal articles, books, electronically downloaded materials and critical reviews of official documents. Qualitative descriptive analysis was employed to analyze the data.

T1  - Affect-based stock investment decision: The role of affective self-affinity
AN  - 1942723838
AB  - This paper studies the role of affective self-affinity for a company in the stock investment decision by investigating the factors triggering it. Based on the social identity theory and the affect literature we hypothesize that three types of identifications, namely group related, company-people related and idea/ideal related, trigger affective self-affinity for a company which results in extra affect-based motivation to invest in the company's stock. The two ideas included in the idea/ideal related affective self-affinity are socially responsible investing and nationality related ideas. Based on the survey data of 133 active individual investors, we find that the more the investors perceive the company supports/represents a specific group or idea or employ a specific person, with which the investors identify themselves, the higher is the investors' affective self-affinity for the company. This results in higher extra affective motivation to invest in the company's stock over and beyond financial indicators. Thus, investors' identification with groups, people, or ideas such as socially responsible investing and nationality results in higher affect-based investment motivation through affective self-affinity aroused in the investors. Moreover, positive attitude towards the company is another factor that explains the affect-based extra investment motivation.

T1  - Health-related quality of life in Jewish immigrants from the Former Soviet Union in Germany
AN  - 1908832308
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to test a hypothesized structure of interrelations between pre-migration dispositional factors (cultural identity and optimism/pessimism) and immigration-related experiences (level of integration and perceived discrimination) in association with mental and physical components of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a sample of Jewish people from the Former Soviet Union (FSU) who immigrated to Germany.Design/methodology/approachA questionnaire in Russian, including items about the immigration background, level of integration, perceived discrimination as well as cultural identity, dispositional optimism/pessimism (Life Orientation Test-R) and HRQoL (SF-12) was handed out to Jewish immigrants from the FSU living in Germany. The data of 153 participants were analyzed using structural equation modeling.FindingsWhereas no significant associations between Jewish identity and HRQoL could be found, both a positive association between optimism and level of integration with a link to physical and mental health, and an inverse relation between optimism and perceived discrimination with a link to mental health, were observed. Opposite associations were found for pessimism.Originality/valueThe results replicate prior research findings on Jews from the FSU living in Israel and the USA and suggest more detailed assessment methods for further investigations on integration processes and cultural identity in the selected group of immigrants. Additionally, HRQoL is significantly lower in the Jewish sample than in the general population. These findings underline the need for a better integration policy, especially for Jewish people from the FSU.

T1  - Does Size Really Matter? On the Relationship between Immigrant GroupSize and Anti-Immigrant Prejudice<sup> 1 </sup>: IMR
AN  - 2558410318
AB  - Group threat theory understands prejudice as a manifestation of the threat,either actual or assumed, that minority groups pose to majority groups. Thistheory is often operationalized by analyzing the impact of group size onanti-immigrant prejudice. We test this hypothesis with a new dataset documenting487 effects of group size on prejudice provided in 55 studies. More than half ofthese results show no relationship and the remainder shows both positive andnegative relationships. Three explanations for this divergence are that thereare (1) differences in the measurement of prejudice and immigrant group sizeacross studies; (2) differences in the model through which size is hypothesizedto lead to prejudice; and (3) differences in the geographic unit of analysis atwhich these relationships have been considered. Our analyses support themeasurement explanation: results vary across studies because they reflectdifferent measures of group size and prejudice.

T1  - Does Closeness to Someone Who Is Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual Influence Etiology Beliefs About Homosexuality?
AN  - 1831273196
AB  - Research suggests that contact with sexual minorities and etiology beliefs regarding the origins of homosexuality are associated with antigay bias; however, factors related to etiology beliefs have received little empirical attention. Our primary research question is: Does closeness to someone who is gay, lesbian, or bisexual influence etiology beliefs? Students (n = 851) from four U.S. universities completed an anonymous survey, and regression results indicated that contact and closeness were not significantly associated with etiology beliefs. Because both contact and relationship closeness were associated with antigay attitudes, and closeness demonstrated the largest effect, we tested three alternative structural equation models to determine if contact and closeness mediated etiology beliefs. Results suggested that contact and the degree of closeness are indirectly associated with students' etiology beliefs through antigay bias.

T1  - Political and institutional determinants of immigration policies
AN  - 1820665616
AB  - This paper investigates how the interplay of parties' preferences, political institutions and electoral competition affects the liberalisation of immigration policies. It joins a growing body of research that focuses on the role of domestic factors in shaping immigration policies. While several studies point to the important role of partisanship and the activation of public opinion, they fail to provide a clear mechanism that takes into account differences in parties' preferences as well as the institutional context they act in. By adding two crucial factors to the analysis, this paper presents a new framework for liberal change in the field of immigration politics. First, institutional veto points determine if left-of-centre parties can reform policies according to their preferences. Second, the degree of electoral competition and the politicisation of immigration issues affect how susceptible political parties are to the anti-immigrant sentiment in the population. A time-series cross-section analysis of 11 countries from 1980 to 2006 shows that left-of-centre governments are more likely to pass liberal reforms, but only if they are not facing an open veto point. Moreover, increased levels of electoral competition coupled with a politicisation of the immigration issue reduces the likelihood of liberal reforms.

T1  - Occupational aspirations and ethnic school segregation: social contagion effects among native German and immigrant youths
AN  - 1809640290
AB  - In this study, I broaden the perspective on young immigrants' aspirations by looking at their social embeddedness in the host society in terms of their institutionally predefined ties to school peers. In particular, I investigate the relationship between the aspirations of immigrant and native youths with special regard to the social mechanisms that may underlie peer influences. My analyses are based on multilevel data on ninth graders from the German National Educational Panel Study. The results show that a high ratio of immigrants in schools positively influences the aspirations of both immigrant and native German youths by way of school climate. However, the same context has different effects on different groups of origin. For those of Turkish descent, 'ethnic schools' are of twofold significance: first, the aspiration gap between Turks and native Germans decreases with increasing segregation, an effect that may be attributable to less perceived discriminatory experiences in school. Second, Turkish young people's stronger adaptation to the climate in ethnically segregated schools reinforces the protective effect of ethnic segregation and, additionally, lowers the aspirations of these youths. That is, immigrants' stronger orientation towards their in-group seems to contribute to a buffer against discrimination.

T1  - Political involvement moderates the impact of worldviews and values on SDO and RWA
AN  - 1799173957
AB  - The Dual Process Model (DPM) of social attitudes and prejudice proposes that Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) and Right Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) reflect two distinct motivational processes. In two studies, we investigated how political involvement moderates the impact of social worldviews and value-based dimensions on SDO and RWA. We proposed that political involvement constrains SDO, RWA and their antecedents into a tighter left-right ideological dimension, therefore transforming the double dissociation pattern of the DPM into a double additive pattern. As expected, for stronger political involvement, Study 1 (N=237) showed that SDO and RWA were a function of both the competitive jungle and the dangerous world worldviews, whereas Study 2 (N=143) pointed out that SDO and RWA were both connected with the value dimensions of self-enhancement and conservation.

T1  - Racialization of Subaltern Populations Across the Globe: the Politics of Difference
AN  - 1795747424
AB  - Issue Title: African Americans, Dalits and Tribals: A Comparative Analysis of Subaltern communities in India and the U.S.A The politics of difference - also named race or racism in various critical discourses - is the focus of this essay. The charge of being deviant, uncultured, "illegal" and out of place is leveled in a variety of ways, by those who claim the status of natural belonging, against subordinated and marginalized groups - from immigrants recently arrived in a place, to ancient inhabitants driven away from their lands and property and opportunities. The issue is not one of race but of racism, or what I describe as the deployment of difference. Whether grounded in genetic or biological condition, as it was in the 19th and early 20th centuries, or described more euphemistically as very deeply rooted (even if its sources supposedly lie in "history" and "culture"), the proposition commonly is that the difference at hand is not really bridgeable - at least in the foreseeable future. The deployment of such arguments of radical, incommensurable difference very often marks a shifting of weight from a barely acknowledged to a much more palpable prejudice and discrimination. A disdainful tolerance of groups that were generally ignored, that counted for little and sometimes remained literally uncounted, gives way to an increased marking and targeting of otherised communities.

T1  - The Sociocultural Context of Mexican-Origin Pregnant Adolescents' Attitudes Toward Teen Pregnancy and Links to Future Outcomes
AN  - 1779612919
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Understanding Wanted and Unwanted Relationships 
Given the negative developmental risks associated with adolescent motherhood, it is important to examine the sociocultural context of adolescent mothers' lives to identify those most at risk for poor outcomes. Our goals were to identify profiles of Mexican-origin pregnant adolescents' cultural orientations and their attitudes toward teen pregnancy, and to investigate how these profiles were linked to adolescents' pregnancy intentions, family resources, and short-term family, educational, and parenting outcomes. With a sample of 205 Mexican-origin adolescent mothers, we identified three profiles based on cultural orientations and attitudes toward teen pregnancy: Bicultural-Moderate Attitudes, Acculturated-Moderate Attitudes, and Enculturated-Low Attitudes. The results indicated that enculturated pregnant adolescents had the least favorable attitudes toward teen pregnancy, and the lowest levels of family income, pregnancy intentions, pregnancy support, and educational expectations compared to acculturated and bicultural pregnant adolescents; acculturated adolescents (with the highest family income and high levels of pregnancy support) had the highest levels of parenting efficacy 10 months postpartum. Our findings suggest that enculturated adolescent mothers (with less positive attitudes toward teen pregnancy) may benefit from educational support programs and enculturated and bicultural adolescent mothers (with moderately positive attitudes toward teen pregnancy) may benefit from programs to increase parenting efficacy. Such targeted interventions may, in turn, reduce the likelihood of adolescent mothers experiencing negative educational and parenting outcomes.

T1  - Attitudes towards Immigrant Workers and Asylum Seekers in Eastern Croatia: Dimensions, Determinants and Differences/Stavovi prema migrantskim radnicima i traziteljima azila u istocnoj Slavoniji: dimenzije, odrednice i razlike
AN  - 1794127140
AB  - Croatia's accession to the EU has brought new challenges and issues in researching and analysing migration flows and trends as well as attitudes and perceptions of real and potential newcomers. The aim of this paper is to explore attitudes of the residents of the two most easterly Croatian counties towards two distinct categories of newcomers: immigrant workers and asylum seekers. The research was conducted shortly after Croatia's entry into the EU, in September 2013, and the presented data are a part of a larger survey that included various migration and ethnicity issues. The survey was applied on a convenience sample of 1 110 adult respondents in two counties: Osijek-Baranja and Vukovar-Srijem. Data were analysed in a series of multivariate procedures. Results indicated significant perceptions of immigrant workers within the dimension of cultural threat, along with the expression of a considerable degree of social distance towards them.

T1  - Framing competitiveness: the advocacy of migration as an essential human resources strategy in Europe
AN  - 1784151152
AB  - This paper examines how competitiveness has been framed rhetorically and politically by interested actors in France, Germany, and the UK. Skilled rhetorical advocacy clothes particular political demands in the language of competitiveness and purported exigencies of the global economy, thus advancing political goals more easily that might otherwise encounter significant political opposition. In theoretical terms, the paper analyses the ideational framing of policy discourses. Empirically, the emphasis rests on exploring how governments, organised business, and business think tanks have attempted to advance demands for liberalised labour migration schemes in Europe by linking them rhetorically to the prerogative of economic competitiveness. Despite an adverse political climate, sceptical public opinion, and persistent unemployment, it has thus been politically possible to liberalise the regulation of labour migration considerably.

T1  - Extreme Right in Quebec? The Facebook Pages in Favor of the "Quebec Charter of Values"
AN  - 1778916085
AB  - In August 2013, the Government of the Parti Québécois first introduced the idea for a Quebec Charter of Values. This led to a stiff debate during which anti-immigration and anti-Islam sentiments were expressed by government officials, newspaper columnists and other well-known public figures. These opinions were in turn appropriated and disseminated by a number of citizens throughout social medias. In some regards, these attitudes and opinions are akin to those of extreme right movements and parties in Europe and the United States. In this article, we ask whether we are witnessing the rise of an extreme right in Quebec, a political stance so far estranged to this society. We start with a conceptual discussion of the notion of extreme right and then proceed to analyze the arguments put forward to support the Charter of Values. We conclude that even though the debates do reveal the “radicalization” of certain segments of public opinion toward the right, it is not possible to categorize this shift as the blooming of an “extreme right” in the full sense of the term.

T1  - News as a Cultural Mirror: Historically Black Newspapers Reflecting Public Views of Loving v. Virginia (1967)
AN  - 1748050440
AB  - This study examined seven historically Black newspapers' coverage of the landmark Supreme Court case Loving v. Virginia (1967), which overturned anti-miscegenation laws that prevented non-White individuals from marrying White individuals. A content analysis of frames and source usage within 31 news stories about the case indicated that about half of the stories (N = 14) advocated for the Lovings and a small number (N = 1) advocated for the State of Virginia; the remaining stories were either informational (N = 7) or objectivist (N = 9). Because the media is said to be a cultural mirror of public opinion, the results of this study may indicate the public's views on the issue of intermarriage laws. This study's findings also showed that historically Black newspapers agreed with their mainstream counterparts more than they disagreed.

T1  - Willingness to Record Police-Public Encounters: The Impact of Race and Social and Legal Consciousness
AN  - 1945406088
AB  - Although using personal electronic devices to record police-public encounters has surfaced as an important social phenomenon that could potentially shape public perceptions of the police and police-community relations, very little research has investigated factors affecting people's willingness to record the police. Using survey data collected from two universities, this study assessed whether race/ethnicity and social and legal consciousness influence college students' inclination to record public interactions with the police. Results indicated that minority students and those who believed that recording served social justice, had a deterrent effect on the police, and was legally justified were more likely to engage in such behavior. Past recording experience and negative encounters with the police also led to higher levels of willingness to record police activity. Implications for policy and future research are discussed.

T1  - Public Support for Corporate Social Responsibility in the Welfare State: Evidence from Sweden
AN  - 1718067562; 201531352
AB  - Several scholars have claimed that we are currently witnessing a growing saliency of so-called 'corporate social responsibility' (CSR). Yet, while there is a lot of work suggesting that public opinion might prompt firms to behave in socially responsible ways, there is a lack of empirical studies exploring the extent ordinary to which citizens actually support CSR. Moreover, the state is conventionally theorised as the main institutional device for governing markets and their social consequences, and there is a growing literature exploring the relationship between CSR and the state. On the basis of these observations, this article juxtaposes public attitudes towards CSR and state intervention in the market. Considering that attitudes might vary across groups with different structural relationships to the firm, this study also looks at the social bases of support for different attitude profiles. Using Swedish survey data collected in 2011 and latent class analysis, the empirical results demonstrate that most Swedes in favour of CSR are highly supportive of state intervention in the market. The study of social cleavages restates this pattern: social groups with fewer marketable resources are strongly over-represented in supporting a combination of CSR and state intervention in the market. No clear social profile is found for the relatively small group of people who support CSR but not state intervention. It is concluded that voluntary CSR is unlikely to offer a serious full-scale alternative to the welfare state: Swedes continue to think of public authorities as the ultimate institutional guarantor of social welfare. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Can we really reduce ethnic prejudice outside the lab? A meta-analysis of direct and indirect contact interventions
AN  - 1700674929; 201525026
AB  - The present meta-analysis tested the effectiveness of contact-based interventions for the reduction of ethnic prejudice. Up to now, a meta-analysis summarizing the results of real-world interventions that rest on the intergroup contact theory has been missing. We included evaluations of programs realizing direct (i.e.,face-to-face) and/or indirect (i.e.,extended or virtual) contact in real-world settings outside the lab. The interventions' effectiveness was tested shortly after their end (k=123 comparisons, N=11371 participants) and with a delay of at least 1 month (k=25, N=1650). Our data show that contact interventions improve ethnic attitudes. Importantly, changes persist over time. Furthermore, not only direct but also indirect contact interventions are successful. In addition, contact programs are effective even in the context of a serious societal conflict (e.g.,in the Middle East). Although changes are typically larger for ethnic majorities, there is an impact on minorities, too. Finally, contact interventions not only improve attitudes toward individuals involved in the program, their effects also generalize to outgroups as a whole. In sum, social psychology provides an intervention for prejudice reduction that can be successfully implemented in the practical field. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Imagined Contact Works in High-Prejudice Contexts: Investigating Imagined Contact's Effects on Anti-Gay Prejudice in Cyprus and Jamaica
AN  - 1648864932
AB  - A growing body of evidence demonstrates that imagined contact can reduce prejudice in a variety of ways, against numerous groups, and in varied social contexts. Imagined contact has thus been suggested as an option for prejudice reduction where direct contact strategies may not be easy or practical. However, no research to date has tested imagined contact in high-prejudice contexts where direct contact is not a feasible option. In two experiments (N=42, N=100), we investigated whether imagined contact could be successfully applied as an intervention to reduce prejudice against gay men in two societies where direct contact would be particularly difficult or rare--Cyprus and Jamaica. Despite the relatively high prejudice against gay men reported in both societies, we found that imagined contact successfully improved attitudes, behavioral intentions, and social acceptance. We discuss the implications for imagined contact's use as a real-world intervention when direct contact strategies might not be plausible.

T1  - The presence of the past: Identity continuity and group dynamics
AN  - 1758417025
AB  - Social psychologists are increasingly interested in the temporal dimensions of social life and in identity continuity in particular. Focusing on ethnicity and national identity we discuss the implications of perceived group continuity and collective self-continuity, and their interplay, for group dynamics. Using the social identity perspective and theories of identity motivation, we show, first, that the need for collective self-continuity forms a unique motivational basis for group identification. Second, we demonstrate that people are more likely to derive a sense of collective self-continuity from groups that are seen as relatively stable and immutable over time (i.e., essentialist in-groups). Third, we find that existential threats to group identity strengthen a sense of collective self-continuity, which, in turn, increases in-group defence mechanisms in the form of negative attitudes towards immigrant out-groups and towards social developments that potentially undermine in-group continuity. Fourth, we discuss empirical findings that indicate that group-based nostalgia for the nation is an identity management strategy in response to ingroup continuity threats and that nostalgia leads to immigrant out-group exclusion.

T1  - Attitudes toward Immigrants in Nebraska
AN  - 1667951676; 201509453
AB  - We examined the relative effects of three theories of prejudice: perceptions of threat, contact with immigrants, and a cosmopolitanism outlook, in predicting attitudes toward immigrants in Nebraska, a state experiencing a substantial rise in immigrant populations. We found perceived threat was associated with unfavorable attitudes toward immigrants while contact with immigrants and a cosmopolitan outlook were associated with favorable attitudes. Furthermore, we found that the presence of a perceived threat of immigrants is more likely to increase negative attitudes toward immigrants than does contact with immigrants or a cosmopolitan attitude in increasing positive attitudes toward immigrants. Additionally, we found the absence of perceived threat has a stronger effect on attitudes (positively) than does its presence (negatively) in the case of respondents' view that immigrants contribute to an increase in crime. The effect of the presence of contact and a cosmopolitan outlook on attitudes toward immigrants is at least as great (positively) as the effect of their absence (negatively). We discuss implications for the changing attitudes toward immigrants in the state and differences between state and national attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Wish to Leave Ethnically Concentrated Neighbourhoods: The Role of Perceived Social Cohesion and Interethnic Attitudes
AN  - 1667952254; 201512663
AB  - This paper aims to investigate the motives behind people's wishes to move out of ethnically concentrated neighbourhoods. We focus on the impact of perceived social cohesion and negative interethnic attitudes and hypothesise on moving wishes of ethnic majority and minority residents in the Netherlands (i.e. Turks and Moroccans). Data were derived from the first wave of the 2009 Netherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study, collected in 35 municipalities covering 800 neighbourhoods. Taking into account household, housing and other neighbourhood attributes, multilevel logistic regression models show that ethnic majority residents are more likely to have a wish to move when they live in neighbourhoods with a large percentage of ethnic minorities. This can be explained by a lack of perceived social cohesion, but not by their negative attitudes towards ethnic minorities. Controlling for housing and neighbourhood conditions, the percentage of ethnic minorities neither increases nor decreases minority residents' moving wishes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnic Differences in the Attitudes and Practice of Consanguineous Marriage among Kurds and Turks in Uromiyeh District, Iran
AN  - 1586126261
AB  - Despite the spread of modem familial values and norms and the rapid pace of modernization in Iran, kinship marriages remain a common practice among some ethnic groups, including Turk and Kurd. This study is informed by modernization and development idealism theories to examine factors associated with the practice and attitude of Kurdish and Turkish women to consanguineous marriage, utilizing data from a representative sample of 768 evermarried women residing in the district of Uromiyeh in Iran. The results indicated that consanguineous marriage was more prevalent among Kurds rather than Turks, and Kurdish rather than Turkish women held more positive orientations to consanguineous. Multivariate results showed that being a Kurd than a Turk was strongly associated with the likelihood of practicing kinship marriage and having positive attitudes to consanguineous marriage, while the levels of modernization and development idealism showed no or weak association. The results suggest that ethnic belonging can reinforce consanguineous marriage regardless of being modernized or holding modern development ideals.

T1  - Beyond co-ethnicity: the politics of differentiating and integrating new immigrants in Singapore
AN  - 1660020423; 201505705
AB  - This essay joins the ongoing debates about the role of co-ethnic ties in the making of diaspora identity by examining Singaporean Chinese perceptions of new immigrants from the mainland and the state's strategies in integrating the newcomers. The public discourses on new Chinese immigrants have produced three interlinked narratives: (1) newcomers are socially and culturally different from the mainstream and earlier immigrants; (2) newcomers have intensified the competition for scarce resources; and (3) newcomers are politically attached to China, whose rise as a global power only serves to reinforce such linkages. I argue that co-ethnicity and common cultural heritage play little role in shaping local Singaporeans' view of the new diaspora; instead, political pragmatism and new identity politics that prioritize the nation above ethnicity are the key factors influencing public attitudes and policy options regarding new immigrants. Furthermore, intra-diaspora differences/conflicts have reinforced interracial solidarity and contributed to the nation-building project. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Blacks, Jews, gays and immigrants are taking over': how the use of polling data can distort reality and perpetuate inequality among immigrants
AN  - 1551001527; 201428968
AB  - According to public opinion polls majorities in the UK and US believe that increased immigration poses a serious threat to maintaining a shared common culture, strains social services, compromises national security and undermines the employment opportunities of long term native born residents. The average American believes the United States is 39% black, 26% Jewish, 33% Latino, 38% foreign born and 25% gay. These beliefs and estimates of group size are incorrect or vastly distort the impact immigrants have on society. What are the public policy implications, particularly for the foreign born population, when such distortions are the basis for how individuals respond to public policy survey questions? This paper examines how survey research may unintentionally cement stereotypes and result in public policy measures which increase social inequality. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Minority nations and attitudes towards immigration: the case of Quebec
AN  - 1542002539; 201426959
AB  - Growing international migration constitutes a tremendous challenge for contemporary democracies, no more so than for minority nations. An important challenge for the latter is one of acceptance of immigration from the native-born population, in a context in which immigrant can be seen as both a cultural and a political threat. In this article we ask what explains attitudes towards immigration in minority nations. More specifically, we seek to provide answers to these questions: What is the impact of cultural insecurity on attitudes towards immigration in minority nations? Is strong attachment to a minority nation associated with less positive attitudes towards immigration? And finally, are proponents of independence for minority nations more likely to favour a reduction in the level of immigration than those who oppose it? The article seeks to answer these questions by exploring the case of Quebec. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Less than the sum of its parts: institutional realities and legal aspirations in early twenty-first century American immigration
AN  - 1551002305; 201428922
AB  - This essay considers the implications of some of the legal and institutional forces shaping immigration in the early twenty-first century, and explores what the character of the American system implies for citizenship and migration in an advanced industrial democracy with a complex regulatory state. The essay argues, first, that immigration law must be understood not as a raw reflection of mass public attitudes or a carefully reasoned prescriptive scheme, but instead as a politically generated, fractured system allocating benefits and burdens among a variety of constituents and public agencies. This allocation plainly affects more than just actual or potential migrants. It also shapes the lives of employers, law enforcers, politicians, and the larger public of American citizens. These interactions showcase how much the future of the nation-state may depend not only on seemingly inexorable forces reshaping the international system, but on how law is understood by the public, adjudicated by courts, and enforced by public organizations. Put differently, how much even powerful nation-states are able to shape their context heavily depends on often-tenuous compromises at the intersection between law, politics, and organization.

T1  - Transnational Undocumented Marriages in the Sino-Vietnamese Border Areas of China
AN  - 1728660989; 201534172
AB  - For many countries, irregular immigration usually engenders adverse public reaction and restrictionist policies. However, public attitudes often vary and looser policies have been adopted at certain times and for certain reasons. The purpose of this paper is to explore the phenomenon of undocumented, transnational marriages in the Sino-Vietnamese border areas of China, and to explain why many undocumented immigrants are treated leniently and/or have not been deported. Research reveals that this could be due to female immigrants considerably relieving the marriage market crisis along China's border. Thus, unauthorized border crossing continues despite prohibition and de facto marriage is prevalent and uncontrollable. China and Vietnam have yet to establish a bilateral cooperation to address the problematic aspects of this phenomenon. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Avenge the Lusitania': The Anti-German Riots in South Africa in 1915
AN  - 1512219026; 201408782
AB  - The anti-German riots which erupted simultaneously in many countries in response to the torpedoing of the Lusitania by a German U-boat in 1915 reflected shifts in the status of minorities in multi-ethnic societies at a time of escalating nationalist emotions. This article shows that the situation of the Germans in South Africa differed in important respects from the dilemma in which Germans found themselves in other parts of the world during the First World War. The dominion of the Union of South Africa was embroiled in a struggle between Afrikaners and English-speaking settlers for the definition of white South Africanism. Since most German immigrants had previously tended to amalgamate with the Afrikaner section of the colonial society and had not laid claims to a hyphenated identity, many Afrikaners perceived the attacks on German residents as an assault by urban English-speakers on the Afrikaner community, and Afrikaner public opinion requested that Germans should be treated in a fair manner. The intra-white dispute about a shared South African identity prevented, therefore, the state from sustaining the kind of assimilationist or even discriminatory pressure which German residents had to face in countries such as the USA or Brazil during and after the Great War.

T1  - Online Network Influences on Emerging Adults' Alcohol and Drug Use
AN  - 1442601453; 23212348
AB  - Researchers have reported that network characteristics are associated with substance use behavior. Considering that social interactions within online networks are increasingly common, we examined the relationship between online network characteristics and substance use in a sample of emerging adults (ages 18-24) from across the United States (N = 2,153; M = 21 years old; 47 % female; 70 % White). We used regression analyses to examine the relationship between online ego network characteristics (i.e., characteristics of individuals directly related to the focal participant plus the relationships shared among individuals within the online network) and alcohol use and substance use, respectively. Alcohol use was associated with network density (i.e., interconnectedness between individuals in a network), total number of peer ties, and a greater proportion of emotionally close ties. In sex-stratified models, density was related to alcohol use for males but not females. Drug use was associated with an increased number of peer ties, and the increased proportion of network members' discussion and acceptance of drug use, respectively. We also found that online network density and total numbers of ties were associated with more personal drug use for males but not females. Conversely, we noted that social norms were related to increased drug use and this relationship was stronger for females than males. We discuss the implications of our findings for substance use and online network research.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Assessing the Effects of Immigration and Diversity in Europe: Introduction to the Special Issue
AN  - 1448995189; 201342892
AB  - This article introduces the special issue on "Assessing the Effects of Immigration and Diversity in Europe" to the JEPOP readers. The article starts with a summary of the controversy generated by Putnam's 2007 article "E pluribus unum". Next, it provides a brief account of the state of the art in the scholarship analysing the link between diversity, trust, social capital and social cohesion. The article continues with a discussion of a number of key problems that affect the existing scholarship, and highlights how the contributions to this special issue overcome some of these limitations. After this, the article considers the implications of this debate for the study of elections and public opinion. It concludes with a succinct overview of the contributions to the special issue and a discussion of how they help move forward the scholarship in this area. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms among immigrant-origin adolescents
AN  - 1622296606; 201438445
AB  - Although discrimination has been found to contribute to psychological distress among immigrant populations, there are few studies that have examined the relationship between racial and ethnic discrimination in the school setting among foreign-born immigrant and U.S.-born immigrant-origin adolescents. This study examined the relationship between perceived discrimination by adults and peers in the school setting and depressive symptoms in a sample (N = 95) of racial minority immigrant-origin adolescents (13 to 19 years of age) attending an urban high school. We examined the relation between perceived discrimination and depressive symptomology across gender and nativity status (foreign born vs. U.S. born), and the potential moderating role of ethnic identity and social support. Consistent with previous research, girls reported higher levels of depressive symptomology than boys, although the relationship between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms was significant for both boys and girls. Perceived discrimination by adults and by peers at school was positively related to depressive symptoms for U.S.-born adolescents. For U.S.-born adolescents, ethnic identity mitigated the negative effects of perceived adult discrimination on depressive symptoms. However, ethnic identity did not moderate the relationship between perceived peer discrimination and depressive symptoms. Social support did not moderate the relationship between adult and peer discrimination and depressive symptoms for either foreign-born or U.S.-born adolescents. The findings support previous research concerning the immigrant paradox and highlight the importance of context in the relationship between perceived discrimination and mental health. Implications for future research and intervention are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Black Supporters of Racial Profiling: A Demographic Profile
AN  - 1438556182; 201340217
AB  - As an anomaly of extant literature that maintains Blacks as a collective are less supportive of racial profiling than other ethnic groups, this article explores the backgrounds of Blacks who support the practice of racial profiling (referred to as Black Supporters). This study analyzed a national Gallup poll that included measures on profiling and had a significant number of Black respondents (N = 534). Black Supporters tended to be female; live in the Southern United States; and be politically conservative. Although multivariate analyses revealed few differences between Black Supporters and nonsupporters, the study represents an earnest attempt to explore Black support for a policing strategy that has both historically and contemporarily had negative effects on Black communities. We conclude the article by discussing the benefits of studying Black Supporters. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Finding 'Safe' Campuses: Predicting the Presence of LGBT Student Groups at North Carolina Colleges and Universities
AN  - 1567045662; 201435147
AB  - A key indicator of a supportive campus climate for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) college students is the existence of an LGBT student organization. This article integrates the research on high school LGBT policies and programs with social movement studies of campus activism to examine the characteristics associated with the existence of university-approved LGBT groups on North Carolina campuses. Drawing on data from the National Center for Education Statistics, campus Web sites, and other sources, logistic regression is used to examine the importance of public opinion, campus and community resources, and the institutional context in predicting the location of these student groups.

T1  - Aspirations for a cooperative community and support for mental health advocacy: a shared orientation through opinion-based group membership
AN  - 1433108238
AB  - This research examines the role of aspirations for cooperative relations between people with mental disorders and other community members in influencing commitment to stigma-reducing practices and promoting positive social change. Two studies demonstrated that a measure of aspirations for a cooperative community is distinct from social and community identification measures and strongly predicts positive beliefs and behavioral intentions. Findings support the proposal that these aspirations reflect a shared ideology for members of an opinion-based group that support mental health advocacy. The findings provide evidence that the aspirations construct adds to knowledge about collective identities and offers a useful tool for designing stigma reduction and social-change strategies for the benefit of people with mental disorders.

T1  - Retribution as Revenge and Retribution as Just Deserts
AN  - 1438560685; 201340687
AB  - Public attitudes towards law-breakers shape the tone and tenor of crime-control policy, and the desire for retribution seems to be the main motivation underpinning punitive attitudes towards sentencing. Yet, there is some confusion in the research literature over what retribution really means. In this paper we distinguish between retribution as revenge (as the desire to punish criminal offenders to retaliate a past wrong by making the offender suffer) and retribution as just deserts (as the preference to restore justice through proportional compensation from the offender). Results from an online survey (n = 176) provide evidence of two distinct dimensions of retribution. But we also show that these two dimensions have different ideological and motivational antecedents, and have different consequences in terms of the treatment of criminal offender. We find that retribution as revenge is associated with the motivation to enforce status boundaries with criminal offenders, as well as ideological preferences for power and dominance (as expressed by social dominance orientation) and in-group conformity (as expressed by right-wing authoritarianism). Endorsement of retribution as revenge also predicts the support of harsh punishment and the willingness to deny fair procedures. By contrast, retribution as just deserts is mainly predicted by a value restoration motive and by right-wing authoritarianism. After controlling for revenge, retribution as just deserts predicts support for procedural justice in the criminal courts. We conclude with the idea that beliefs about proportionality and compensation work as a buffer against the negative effects of revenge. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The performativity of colour blindness: race politics and immigrant integration in France, 1980-2012
AN  - 1551002144; 201428901
AB  - France is usually conceived of as an assimilationist country, where national identity is based on principled colour-blind values. The emergence of values running counter to the dominant French model during the 1980s and 1990s has therefore led to the formation of two dominant positions in the literature: advocates of the path-dependent nature of models have refused to acknowledge the existence of structural and durable dissonances with this formal colour blindness a la francaise, while the epigones of Gunnar Myrdal have only seen a contradiction between formal colour-blind principles and the actual treatment of minority groups in France, described in terms of a 'French dilemma'. Both positions are unsatisfying insofar as they fail properly to articulate the co-existence of, on the one hand, principles of colour blindness that have saturated public discourses in France over the last 30 years and, on the other, the no less omnipresent framing of French citizens with postcolonial immigrant origins in public and political discourses in racial and ethnic terms. To overcome this difficulty, Bertossi suggests we look at the mutually supportive relationship between colour blindness and the culturalization of French citizenship, and examine how the performative effects of the French colour-blind model have produced a framing of membership and identities in ethnic and racial terms in contemporary France. This analysis focuses on two different settings in which these effects can be observed: first, the official narrative on French citizenship, as provided by a series of public reports on immigrant integration published over the last three decades; second, the negotiations on ethnic and racial diversity in the French military after the end of conscription in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

AB  - Dixon et al. accurately describe subtle mechanisms of discrimination that inhibit minorities' collective action in modern democratic societies. This commentary suggests that in contemporary non-Western societies, where ethnic conflicts are more violent, traditional overt forms of prejudice still exist and predict discrimination of ethnic and racial minorities. Thus, prejudice reduction models should and do improve intergroup relations in such contexts. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Human behavior is guided by evolutionarily shaped brain mechanisms that make statistical predictions based on limited information. Such mechanisms are important for facilitating interpersonal relationships, avoiding dangers, and seizing opportunities in social interaction. We thus suggest that it is essential for analyses of prejudice and prejudice reduction to take the predictive accuracy and adaptivity of the studied prejudices into account.

T1  - Moving from Victims to Victors: African American Attitudes on the "Culture of Poverty" and Black Blame
AN  - 1417527342; 201332016
AB  - Bill Cosby's controversial remarks at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's (NAACP) 50th Anniversary Commemoration for Brown v. Board of Education questioned the "culture of poverty" among blacks. This paper explores blacks' support of major themes raised in Cosby's speech -- improving blacks' parenting of youth, relying less on government to transcend poverty, being contentious of black behavior, and ending out-of-wedlock births among blacks. By analyzing data in an original, national web-based survey of black, Latino, and white public opinion, results indicate most blacks strongly subscribe to several of these themes and often subscribe to them more than non-blacks. Despite class implications for supporting these themes, class indicators do not predict such attitudes. Several themes cohere on one factor, suggesting tenets of black blame.

T1  - ALL RESPONSES ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL
AN  - 1531930754; 201423237
AB  - This exploratory study makes a contribution to the literature on antiracism by analyzing how first-generation French Blacks of sub-Saharan African descent practice everyday antiracism. In doing so, it expands the demographic terrain of this research to highlight some particularities in the experience of everyday racism and antiracism for ethnoracial minorities of immigrant origins. In addition to experiencing forms of racism encountered by both immigrants and other native ethnoracial minorities, first-generation French Blacks (like other non-White first-generation Europeans), face symbolic exclusion from the national community and delegitimization of their claims to Europeanness. Examining their experiences sheds light on how race, immigration, and national identity intersect to generate unique experiences of racism and antiracism. This paper also contributes to our understanding of how social context shapes the range of everyday antiracist strategies at a person's disposal. Specifically, integrating Kasinitz et al.'s framework for categorizing incidents of racial discrimination and prejudice with Fleming et al.'s categorization of responses to stigmatization, I present an analysis of antiracist responses that takes into account both the nature of the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator of racism (i.e., impersonal vs. personal) and the social context in which the encounter occurs (e.g., school, work, public space, etc). In doing so, I highlight how the conditions of a given incident of racism or discrimination set constraints on the range of antiracist responses an individual can practically (or feasibly) employ.

T1  - The Electoral Consequences of Skin Color: The "Hidden" Side of Race in Politics
AN  - 1315602296; 201307739
AB  - Despite the significant role that skin color plays in material well-being and social perceptions, scholars know little if anything about whether skin color and afrocentric features influence political cognition and behavior and specifically, if intraracial variation in addition to categorical difference affects the choices of voters. Do more phenotypically black minorities suffer an electoral penalty as they do in most aspects of life? This study investigates the impact of color and phenotypically black facial features on candidate evaluation, using a nationally representative survey experiment of over 2000 whites. Subjects were randomly assigned to campaign literature of two opposing candidates, in which the race, skin color and features, and issue stance of candidates was varied. I find that afrocentric phenotype is an important, albeit hidden, form of bias in racial attitudes and that the importance of race on candidate evaluation depends largely on skin color and afrocentric features. However, like other racial cues, color and black phenotype don't influence voters' evaluations uniformly but vary in magnitude and direction across the gender and partisan makeup of the electorate in theoretically explicable ways. Ultimately, I argue, scholars of race politics, implicit racial bias, and minority candidates are missing an important aspect of racial bias. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Romaphobia: A unique phenomenon
AN  - 1322724630; 201310790
AB  - This study seeks empirical justification for conceptualizing negative feelings towards the Roma as a distinct type of prejudice, as compared to common prejudice manifested in commonalities between Romaphobia, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and anti-Chinese feelings. We conducted secondary analyses of Hungarian national representative data collected in 2002 by the TARKI Institute (Budapest), using face-to-face interviews. Principal component analyses revealed that respondents' feelings towards all four groups were partially explained by social distance at work and antipathy in general. However, the presence of a separate component, dealing specifically with all Roma, supports a notion of Romaphobia as a qualitatively distinct construct. Recommendations for future research and practical implications are presented. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Understanding Cooperation with Police in a Diverse Society
AN  - 1018347265; 201214500
AB  - Past research has shown that procedural justice enhances an authority's legitimacy and encourages people to cooperate with them. However, this past research has examined legitimacy by focusing solely on the perceived legitimacy of authorities and has ignored how people may perceive the legitimacy of the laws and rules authorities enforce. This distinction has relevance to the policing of ethnic minority groups who may come from different cultures or countries where distrust in the law and legal institutions is prevalent. Using survey data collected from a random sample of 1,203 Australians, this paper explores how procedural justice and both institutional and legal legitimacy impact on people's willingness to cooperate with police. The findings will be explained using Braithwaite's (2003; 2010) social distancing framework. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Vicarious Moral Licensing: The Influence of Others' Past Moral Actions on Moral Behavior
AN  - 914768163; 201200104
AB  - This article investigates the effect of others' prior nonprejudiced behavior on an individual's subsequent behavior. Five studies supported the hypothesis that people are more willing to express prejudiced attitudes when their group members' past behavior has established nonprejudiced credentials. Study 1a showed that participants who were told that their group was more moral than similar other groups were more willing to describe a job as better suited for Whites than for African Americans. In Study 1b, when given information on group members' prior nondiscriminatory behavior (selecting a Hispanic applicant in a prior task), participants subsequently gave more discriminatory ratings to the Hispanic applicant for a position stereotypically suited for majority members (Whites). In Study 2, moral self-concept mediated the effect of others' prior nonprejudiced actions on a participant's subsequent prejudiced behavior such that others' past nonprejudiced actions enhanced the participant's moral self-concept, and this inflated moral self-concept subsequently drove the participant's prejudiced ratings of a Hispanic applicant. In Study 3, the moderating role of identification with the credentialing group was tested. Results showed that participants expressed more prejudiced attitudes toward a Hispanic applicant when they highly identified with the group members behaving in nonprejudiced manner. In Study 4, the credentialing task was dissociated from the participants' own judgmental task, and, in addition, identification with the credentialing group was manipulated rather than measured. Consistent with prior studies, the results showed that participants who first had the opportunity to view an in-group member's nonprejudiced hiring decision were more likely to reject an African American man for a job stereotypically suited for majority members. These studies suggest a vicarious moral licensing effect. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Perceived Discrimination, Identification, Social Capital, and Well-Being: Relationships With Physical Health and Psychological Distress in a U.K. Minority Ethnic Community Sample
AN  - 1909882611
AB  - This study examined racism, ethnic and majority identification, cognitive aspects of social capital (i.e., a sense of trust), and perceived stress and evaluated the relationships between these variables and two indices of adjustment (physical health, psychological well-being) in three minority ethnic community samples in Scotland, United Kingdom. Pakistani (n = 211, 101 female), Indian (n = 155, 81 female), and African and Caribbean (n = 244, 119 female) individuals participated in semistructured interviews. Racism was associated with higher levels of perceived stress, lower levels of social capital, higher levels of minority identity, and lower levels of majority identity. Racism was also associated with psychological well-being (though in different ways for different groups) and with poorer physical health. Minority identification was positively associated with psychological well-being and negatively with perceived stress, while majority identification was positively associated with social capital and negatively with physical health. Implications of these findings are discussed with reference to the literature.

T1  - Changing Patterns of Interracial Marriage in a Multiracial Society
AN  - 1324449901
AB  - We use incidence data from the 1980 Census and 2008 American Community Survey to track recent trends in interracial marriage. Intermarriage with Whites increased rapidly among Blacks but stalled among Asians and American Indians. Black-White intermarriage increased threefold over 1980-2008, independent of changing socioeconomic status, suggesting declining social distance between Blacks and Whites. Marriages between the U.S.- and foreign-born populations also grew rapidly. Marriages to immigrants increased fivefold among U.S.-born Asian women and doubled among U.S.-born Latinas since 1980. Out-marriage to Whites also was higher among self-identified biracial than monoracial individuals, but these differences were smallest among Blacks. Interracial couples were overrepresented among cohabiting couples. Finally, log-linear models provide evidence of growing racial exogamy, but only after adjusting for changing demographic opportunities for intermarriage. Marriages between U.S.- and foreign-born coethnics have been driven by new immigration while slowing the upward trajectory of interracial marriage in America. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Essentialist beliefs predict automatic motor-responses to social categories
AN  - 919903952; 201201478
AB  - Essentialist thinking has been implicated in producing segregation between social groups even in the absence of negative attitudes. This mode of category representation brings social group information to the fore in social information processing, suggesting that the social consequences of essentialism are associated with basic categorization processes. Drawing on recent work demonstrating that automatic approach and avoidance behaviors are directly embedded in intergroup categorization, we show that people who hold essentialist beliefs about human attributes are faster to approach their ingroup. Moreover this relationship is not accounted for by explicit prejudice towards the outgroup and essentialist beliefs were unrelated to implicit evaluation of either group. The findings demonstrate that essentialist beliefs are associated with immediate behavioral responses attached to social category exemplars, highlighting the links between these beliefs and basic categorization processes.

T1  - Making Women's Suffrage Support an Ethnic Duty: Norwegian American Identity Constructions and the Women's Suffrage Movement, 1880-1925
AN  - 907928737; 201124757
AB  - Between 1901 and 1913, Norwegian women won a series of legislative victories, including the universal right to vote. To Norwegian Americans, these events held special meaning. They represented verifiable and contemporary proof of what Norwegian Americans had been arguing for some time: namely, that their homeland was a bastion of progress and democracy and that they had carried this particular legacy to the New World. Many argued that as Norwegian Americans, they were committed to modern, forward-looking ideas and democratic principles, thereby making them model citizens in their adopted home. Women's suffrage advocates also used this particular rhetorical emphasis to substantiate their claims that Norwegian Americans had a duty to support women's suffrage based on their cultural connection to progress and equality. A rich literature has documented how immigrants and their offspring encountered racial and ethnic hierarchies in the United States that influenced their own efforts at constructing an American ethnicity. Some European ethnic groups, including the Irish and the Italians, struggled to achieve a status of "whiteness" in the United States. Others, such as immigrants from the Nordic countries, encountered less racial prejudice, but as an ethnic group they were -- as all others -- keen to establish an identity that supported and justified their claims to inclusion. An investigation into the particular case of Norwegian Americans living in Minnesota and North Dakota reveals an intriguing relationship between Norwegian American cultural arguments that asserted a common ethnic past and women's suffrage debates. This article seeks to understand how Norwegian immigrant claims to American inclusion became a foundation upon which ethnic suffragists were able to build a strategic argument in their call for women's suffrage supporters. Suffragists translated an established rhetoric of Norwegian American progressiveness into assertions that Norwegians were culturally obligated to support women's political equality in the United States.

T1  - Invisible norms? Statistics of racial polarization and consensus
AN  - 887496684; 201118098
AB  - Social scientists often arrive at opposite portrayals of American race relations, despite relying on identical data sources. Depending on their ideological predispositions, they either minimize or maximize remaining racial inequalities. The election of President Obama suggests that the reality of American race relations likely falls somewhere in between -- but where? This paper applies a simple method of comparing racial gaps across domains on a shared metric. Results suggest that non-violence represents a shared norm rendered invisible by traditional data presentation formats that exaggerate existing 'crime gaps.' Other racial gaps are more substantial, e.g., in education, income, and race-related public opinion. However, even in these domains Black-White agreement (group concordance) tends to outweigh disagreement (group discordance). Exceptions are monetary reparations for slavery and presidential approval ratings of Obama. Thus, characterizations of America as 'post-racial' seem premature. However, given that racial equality (once achieved) will be marked by group concordance and shared norms, equality measures should capture emerging commonalities in addition to remaining gaps.

T1  - Pater familias and homo nationalis: Understanding nationalism in the case of Turkey
AN  - 887498503; 201118164
AB  - The aim of this article is to question, on the basis of the findings of a public opinion survey conducted by the authors in February 2006, the commonsense belief in the recent rise of nationalism in Turkey. Building on a conceptual and theoretical framework that rejects the view of nationalism as a conjunctural force that waxes and wanes in particular historical moments, the article will explore how nationalism is understood by the 'people on the street' in order to make sense of what we would describe as the 'continual' appeal of nationalism in Turkey. In this context, we will argue that the 'tidal wave approach' to nationalism, which treats it as a force hitting on particular occasions, or as a temporary aberration, does scant justice to the pervasiveness of nationalism in contemporary societies, western or non-western, including Turkey. Drawing on Hannah Arendt's concept of 'family man', we will explore the role of family in the production and reproduction of nationalism in Turkey with a view to showing the extent to which nationalism is embedded in the fabric of society, delimiting the boundaries of responsibility and providing a template that lays down the standards of morality.

T1  - Social dominance-based threat reactions to immigrants in need of assistance
AN  - 881468842; 201116313
AB  - The present investigation examined how individuals higher in social dominance orientation (SDO) react to experimentally induced intergroup threat in terms of support for helping immigrants. Participants read editorials describing an incoming immigrant outgroup posing realistic threats (to tangible resources and well-being), symbolic threats (to values and traditions) or no threats. Participants higher in SDO exhibited greater resistance to helping immigrants upon exposure to realistic, symbolic, (Experiments 1 and 2), or combined realistic-symbolic (Experiment 2) intergroup threats, but not when the same immigrants posed no threats. In Experiment 2, SDO exerted indirect effects on modern prejudice through both heightened infra-humanization and intergroup anxiety, with modern prejudice itself predicting greater resistance and indifference to helping immigrants. Moderated mediation analyses revealed strongest SDO-infra-humanization relations under conditions of symbolic threat. Implications for prejudice-reduction interventions are considered.

T1  - Discrimination and Mexican-Origin Adolescents' Adjustment: The Moderating Roles of Adolescents', Mothers', and Fathers' Cultural Orientations and Values
AN  - 847003500; 19882238
AB  - Drawing on García Coll et al.'s integrative framework and the risk and resilience model, this study examined the relationships between adolescents' perceived discrimination and psychosocial adjustment and the moderating roles of adolescents', mothers', and fathers' cultural orientations and values, and adolescent gender in a sample of 246 Mexican-origin families. Using multilevel modeling with data from mothers, fathers, seventh graders (M^sub age^ = 12.8 years; SD = .57 year) and older siblings (M^sub age^ = 15.7 years; SD = 1.5 years), findings revealed that perceived discrimination was positively related to depression, risky behaviors, and deviant peer affiliations. In addition, parents' cultural orientations and values and adolescent gender moderated the relationships between perceived discrimination and some indicators of adjustment. These findings suggest that parents' cultural orientations and values can serve as protective and vulnerability factors in the associations between Mexican-origin adolescents' perceived discrimination and their psychosocial adjustment.

T1  - Ethnic Peer Preferences Among Asian American Adolescents in Emerging Immigrant Communities
AN  - 964200146; 201209328
AB  - Growing diversity and evidence that diverse friendships enhance psychosocial success highlight the importance of understanding adolescents' ethnic peer preferences. Using social identity and social contact frameworks, the ethnic preferences of 169 Asian American adolescents (60% female) were examined in relation to ethnic identity, perceived discrimination, and language proficiency. Adolescents with same- and mixed-ethnic friends reported significantly greater ethnic centrality than those with mostly different-ethnic friends. Adolescents with same-ethnic friends reported significantly higher perceived discrimination and lower English proficiency than those with mixed- and different-ethnic friends. Open-ended responses were linked to quantitative data and provided further insight into specific influences on peer preferences (e.g., shared traditions, homophily). Results speak to the importance of cultural experiences in structuring the friendships and everyday lives of adolescents. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Impact of the Group of Co-migrants on Strategies of Acculturation: Towards an Expansion of the Berry Model
AN  - 896197445; 201120126
AB  - This article proposes expanding Berry's theory of acculturation strategies into a three-fold model to be applied to the case of acculturation among migrants. The expanded model includes the community of co-migrants as a distinct referent. It addresses the dynamic and multi-directional relationship between the three referents and the individual migrant, which all interact to create the experience of acculturation among migrants. An expanded typology is presented representing positive or negative attitudes toward each referent. The typology delineates eight possible strategies of acculturation among migrants, namely positive attitudes towards all three referents, negative attitudes towards all three, and the six possible variations between these extremes. Though not previously conceptualized and formalized, examples of all eight strategies were found in the existing literature. Some examples are cited, supporting the assertion that in the socio-psychological phenomenon of acculturation among migrants, the community of co-migrants plays a role which may be differentiated from the home culture and the host culture referents of the Berry model. The model provides a structure for exploring expression of these acculturation strategies among various sub-groups within a community of co-migrants. The current article is essentially a hypothesis paper, citing support for each of the proposed strategies of acculturation from published empirical studies carried out among a wide variety of migrant populations. A preliminary testing of the typology (Taieb, 2008) found that the cultures of the home, host and co-migrant communities do play distinct roles in the acculturation process, and verified that the eight profiles may be recognized in an empirical study. Directions for further empirical verification and refining the preliminary model are suggested. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A regulatory fit perspective in majority versus minority support to attitudes toward homosexuals
AN  - 852898387; 201103080
AB  - Three studies examined the attitude toward homosexuals as a function of regulatory focus and social support for non-discrimination. Regulatory orientation toward non-discrimination was measured by differentiating promotion and prevention emotions when anticipating a non-discriminatory (studies 1 and 2) and a discriminatory interaction with homosexuals (study 2). Study 3 assessed attitude toward non-discrimination through a social dominance orientation (SDO) scale and manipulated experimentally regulatory focus. Across the three studies, social support was manipulated by informing participants that either a majority or a minority of the Swiss population supported non-discrimination in general (study 1), or specifically toward homosexuals (studies 2 and 3). Results showed more positive attitudes toward homosexuals when non-discriminatory participants were regulated in terms of prevention focus and non-discrimination was supported by a majority, and when non-discriminatory participants were regulated in terms of promotion focus and non-discrimination was supported by a minority. These findings are consistent with a regulatory fit perspective on the interplay between regulatory focus and social support. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Today's Deportees
AN  - 1010632414; 201210489
AB  - This essay examines the multiple forms that law, policy, and public attitudes take toward immigrants and the role of undocumentedness in maintaining systems of national and global inequalities. It is based on firsthand testimonies from the U.S.-Arizona border and the Streamline court system that illustrate how racism and discrimination are reproduced and justified. It compares today's forms of legal marginalization, and their justifications, to the slave system. Today, an insistence that discrimination against Mexicans does not constitute discrimination at all since it is based on "nationality" instead of "race" offers a convenient rationale for the legal marginalization of approximately 10 percent of the U.S. population: the "undocumented." And this marginalization keeps them trapped in the cycle of providing the cheap labor upon which our overconsumption is based. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "Our Club": Place-Work and the Negotiation of Collective Belongingness
AN  - 1928217792
AB  - This research examines the process by which vying social groups negotiate collective belongingness within contested space. At an American Legion veterans' post, two factions--the Skeet Club and the New Regime--developed strong emotional attachments to the location. The Skeet Club consisted of ineligible townspeople who had illegally gained access to the post through the help of several legitimate members. For Skeet Club members, the post was a beloved social club where strong social bonds had developed over the course of many years. For the New Regime, the post was first and foremost a shrine to honor and assist military veterans. These divergent interpretations resulted in a process the author calls place-work, whereby members of the two factions struggled to establish a definition of the location that would allow their respective groups to feel that "we belong." The four place-work strategies observed include (1) the presentation of group value, (2) deference to organizational culture, (3) spatial control, and (4) out-group intimidation. Through these strategies, "collective belongingness" was constructed, presented, and maintained as a resource in intergroup conflict. This study builds on the literatures regarding place, emotion, and intergroup conflict.

T1  - The Effect of Question Framing and Response Options on the Relationship between Racial Attitudes and Beliefs about Genes as Causes of Behavior
AN  - 758123696; 201057912
AB  - Prior research suggests that the attribution of individual and group differences to genetic causes is correlated with prejudiced attitudes toward minority groups. Our study suggests that these findings may be due to the wording of the questions and to the choice of response options. Using a series of vignettes in an online survey, we find a relationship between racial attitudes and genetic attributions when respondents are asked to make causal attributions of differences between racial groups. However, when they are asked to make causal attributions for characteristics shown by individuals, no such relationship is found. The response scale used appears to make less, if any, difference in the results. These findings indicate that the way questions about genetic causation of behavior are framed makes a significant contribution to the answers obtained because it significantly changes the meaning of the questions. We argue that such framing needs to be carefully attended to, not only in posing research questions but also in discourse about genetics more generally. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - RACIAL-ETHNIC INTOLERANCE AND SUPPORT FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT: A CROSS-NATIONAL COMPARISON
AN  - 748837723
AB  - This article tests cross-nationally the minority group threat thesis that public sentiments toward repressive crime-control policies reflect conflicted racial and ethnic relations. Using multiple data sets representing France, Belgium, the Netherlands, East and West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Denmark, Great Britain, Greece, Spain, Finland, Sweden, Austria, Canada, Ireland, and Portugal, we examine whether racial and ethnic intolerance -- animus, resentments, or negative sentiments toward minorities -- predicts greater support for the death penalty. Our results reveal that the respondents were significantly more likely to express support for capital punishment if they were racially or ethnically intolerant while controlling for other covariates of public opinion. These findings indicate that the link between support for capital punishment and racial and ethnic animus may occur universally in countries with conflicted racial and ethnic relations.

T1  - Investigating Differences in Public Support for Gay Rights Issues
AN  - 754039630; 201049791
AB  - Public opinion surrounding two of the most well-known gay rights issues--same-sex marriage and adoption by gays and lesbians--varies widely: About 30% of the public favors same-sex marriage, while about 50% favors adoption. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the demographic variables that predict attitudes toward same-sex marriage and adoption by gays and lesbians. Political ideology and attendance at religious services emerged as the strongest predictors. However, a close examination of the two issues shows that there were important differences between them. These differences may aid gay rights advocates in crafting media campaigns designed to increase support for same-sex marriage. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Attitudes Toward Homosexuals Among Youth in Multiethnic Brussels
AN  - 743046809; 201031991
AB  - This study examined attitudes toward lesbians and gay men (referred to in the literature as sexual prejudice ) in a sample of pupils from 70 secondary schools in Brussels. We used items measuring traditional and modern sexual prejudice and support for gay civil rights. We performed a multilevel linear multivariate response analysis to assess both the impact of individual characteristics and school influence on pupils' attitudes. Controlling for sociodemographic variables, second-generation migrants had more prejudice toward homosexuals than pupils from the ethnic majority group. Identification with the receiving society and perception of group-level institutional discrimination, however, mediated the association between ethnic origin and homonegativity. In contrast to traditional sexual prejudice and gay civil rights issues, modern sexual prejudice items were less affected by individual sociodemographic variables. Modern sexual prejudice also remained rather stable across schools; however, schools did appear to affect civil rights issues and traditional sexual prejudice. This contribution sheds light on the relationship between ethnic origin and sexual prejudice and on the variation of several sexual prejudice dimensions across social groups and schools.

T1  - American Indian Women Report on the Community Impact of a Tribal Casino
AN  - 868013651; 201112972
AB  - This qualitative study of the community impact of a Midwest American Indian casino examined semi-structured interview data (N = 20) from American Indian women. Results indicate that the opening of the tribal casino has provided opportunities for intergroup contact to occur resulting in improved relations between Indians on the reservation and those who are not Indian from surrounding communities. These improved relations are positively affecting the relationships that develop between the members of the communities. The findings highlight the need for social workers to examine the impact of intergroup contact that is naturally occurring in tribal casino communities and develop interventions that can assist in reducing stereotypes and prejudices.

T1  - Crime Victimization in Latin America and Intentions to Migrate to the United States
AN  - 60347024; 201017707
AB  - Among the challenges faced by Latin America at the onset of the 21st century is the increase in crime and violence that began in the mid-1980s, and which, to one degree or another, has afflicted most countries in the region. In this study we explore the potential implications of the upsurge in crime on migration by testing the hypothesis that crime victimization in Latin America increases the probability that people have given serious thought to the prospect of migrating with their families to the United States. Using Latinobarometro public opinion surveys of approximately 49,000 respondents residing in 17 countries in 2002, 2003, and 2004, the results of a Hierarchical Generalized Linear Model found that, net of individual and country-level control variables, the probability of seriously considering family migration to the United States was around 30 percent higher among respondents who reported that they or a member of their family was a victim of a crime sometime during the year prior to the survey. Evidence that victimization promotes the propensity to emigrate is a finding that contributes to an understanding of the transnational consequences of the increase in crime in Latin America, and adds a new variable to the inventory of factors that encourage people to migrate to the United States. Adapted from the source document.
