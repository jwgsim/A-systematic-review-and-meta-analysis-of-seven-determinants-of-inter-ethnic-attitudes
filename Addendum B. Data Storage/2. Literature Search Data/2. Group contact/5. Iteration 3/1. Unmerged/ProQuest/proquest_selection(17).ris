T1  - Partisan-motivated sampling: Re-examining politically motivated reasoning across the information processing stream
AN  - 2692279160
AB  - The United States is increasingly politically polarized, fueling intergroup conflict and intensifying partisan biases in cognition and behavior. To date, research on intergroup bias has separately examined biases in how people search for information and how they interpret information. Here, we integrate these two perspectives to elucidate how partisan biases manifest across the information processing stream, beginning with (a) a biased selection of information, leading to (b) skewed samples of information that interact with (c) motivated interpretations to produce evaluative biases. Across three experiments and four internal meta-analyses, participants (N = 2,431) freely sampled information about ingroup and outgroup members or ingroup and outgroup political candidates until they felt confident to evaluate them. Across experiments, we reliably find that most participants begin sampling information from the ingroup, which was associated with individual differences in group-based motives, and that participants sampled overall more information from the ingroup. This sampling behavior, in turn, generates more variability in ingroup (relative to outgroup) experiences. We find that more variability in ingroup experiences predicted when participants decided to stop sampling and was associated with more biased evaluations. We further demonstrate that participants employ different sampling strategies over time when the ingroup is de facto worse-obfuscating Real Group Differences-and that participants selectively integrate their experiences into evaluations based on congeniality. The proposed framework extends classic findings in psychology by demonstrating how biases in sampling behavior interact with motivated interpretations to produce downstream evaluative biases and has implications for intergroup bias interventions.

T1  - Profiles of Racial Socialization Messages from Mothers and Fathers and The Colorblind and Anti-Black Attitudes of Asian American Adolescents
AN  - 2661728877
AB  - Racial equality requires coalitions and solidarity across racial groups, but there continues to be racially colorblind and anti-Black attitudes within the Asian American community, a diverse community consisting of individuals with ancestral origins in East, Southeast, and South Asia. However, there is limited research on the factors that contribute to the development of these attitudes among Asian Americans. Parents could potentially play an important role in perpetuating or challenging the colorblind and anti-Black messages that pervade U.S. society. Thus, the current study investigates how 309 Asian American adolescents’ (M age = 16.8; SD = 1.15; 50.5% female) perceptions of parents’ racial socialization messages about race and racism relate to the youth’s racial attitudes. Latent profiles of youth’s perceptions of mothers’ and fathers’ racial socialization messages and their associations with colorblind racial attitudes and anti-Black attitudes were examined. For mothers, three socialization profiles were identified: Race Avoidant, Race Hesitant, and Race Embracing; for fathers, two socialization profiles were identified: Race Avoidant and Race Embracing. Adolescents with Race Embracing mothers reported less anti-Black attitudes compared to those who had Race Hesitant mothers. For fathers, there were no differences among the profiles and anti-Black attitudes. However, surprisingly, adolescents with Race Embracing fathers were more likely to have colorblind racial attitudes compared to those with Race Avoidant fathers. The findings highlight the importance of racial socialization in the development of Asian American adolescents’ racial attitudes to continue fighting for interracial solidarity.

T1  - A link between social isolation during the coronavirus outbreak and social alignment in balcony parties
AN  - 2647648790
AB  - With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing need for assessing the psychological costs of social isolation (SI). We examine whether the balcony party during the first outbreak of the pandemic is associated with how individuals cope with SI as well as its causes and consequences during the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 303 quarantined persons responded to a Web-based survey. We found that the effect of balcony parties on the psychological costs of SI is dependent on the self-reported levels of SI. Those who experienced high levels of causes of SI perceived the balcony parties as more beneficial in inducing positive affect and reducing negative affect in comparison to those who experienced low levels of causes of SI. The opposite pattern was observed when individuals were asked about their participation in these parties: individuals with high levels of consequences of SI experienced balcony parties as less beneficial than similar pre-outbreak gathering events, while individuals with low levels of consequences of SI showed an opposite pattern. Finally, for those with high levels of causes of SI and consequences of SI, balcony parties did not meet the expectation of creating feelings of communal solidarity. However, a discrepancy between high SI expectations and experience was not found for those with low SI. Our findings demonstrate that the balcony parties are beneficial in reducing the emotional cost of social isolation–but only for those who feel low levels of SI. The fact that individuals with high levels of SI expected more out of these parties suggests the need to develop interventions aimed at optimizing their expectations. As society enters a new period in which the costs of social distancing may be higher, our findings are valuable for understanding the psychological battle that individuals face while in social isolation.

T1  - Exploring LGBT+ campus climate in the UK and Philippines: How prejudice and belonging shape inclusion in higher education
AN  - 2675939324
AB  - Although recent global developments suggest progress toward LGBT+ equality, institutional structures perpetuating differential treatment based on sexual orientation and gender identity persist. The present research employed a mixed‐method campus climate study of LGBT+ and cis‐heterosexual students sampled from Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the Philippines and the UK. Phase 1 reports a large‐scale survey assessing relationships among students’ social attitudes toward LGBT+, campus climate perceptions and experiences of harassment, well‐being, academic persistence, and social identity belonging within the university (LGBT+ = 877; cis‐heterosexual = 2107). Phase 2 reports focus groups and interviews with 35 LGBT+ students, further exploring their campus climate experiences. Triangulated results highlight the role of social identity belonging in creating positive LGBT+ campus climates. Fostering belonging, through visible institutional support for intersectional LGBT+ student organisations and endorsement of LGBT+ inclusive policies and programmes, is recommended for creating safe and inclusive spaces for LGBT+ students.

T1  - What did COVID-19 Change? The Impact of COVID-19 on Korean Parents’ and Children’s Daily Lives and Stress
AN  - 2625124517
AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak has not only posed a threat to physical health but has also changed our daily lives. This study explored how the COVID-19 pandemic affected Korean parents’ and children’s daily lives and stress levels. Parents’ childcare time, children’s screen time, the time spent for social interactions and learning, and parents’ and children’s stress levels before and after the pandemic were compared. The main caregivers’ childcare time increased significantly during the pandemic (4.00 h/day). For children, the time spent for screen time (1.76 h) and online interactions (0.95 h) increased significantly, whereas face-to-face interaction time (4.17 h) and time spent learning (2.16 h) decreased significantly. In addition, parents’ and children’s stress levels increased significantly during the pandemic. Other descriptive information is provided and discussed. Our results indicate that Korean parents and children experienced significant disruption to their daily lives and increased stress during the pandemic.

T1  - The association between perceived racial discrimination and subclinical symptoms of psychosis
AN  - 2624479516
AB  - BackgroundSchizophrenia is one of the most disabling disorders with the poorest outcomes. Cross-cultural research indicates an association between perceived racial discrimination and depression, anxiety, general psychological distress, and psychotic-spectrum disorders. Studies also find that coping moderates the relationship between discrimination and depression. Assessing subclinical symptoms may be useful in prevention efforts.AimsThe study aims to (1) assess if perceived racial discrimination is associated with psychosis subclinical symptoms among a non-clinical sample and (2) examine the role of maladaptive coping and depression, anxiety, and stress.MethodsThe sample consisted of 261 ethnic minority undergraduate students. A structural equation model using a subclinical psychosis latent variable within a moderated mediation model assessed relationships between racial discrimination, maladaptive coping, depression, anxiety, and stress, and subclinical psychosis.ResultsPerceived racial discrimination was associated with greater subclinical symptoms of psychosis through increased depression, anxiety, and stress at greater levels of maladaptive coping.ConclusionsKnowing risk factors that can be targeted, such as perceived discrimination and maladaptive coping, may have implications for vulnerable populations.

T1  - What do we measure when we measure perceptions of everyday discrimination?
AN  - 2630311185
AB  - Rationale The Everyday Discrimination Scale forms the backbone of hundreds of studies documenting the health effects of perceived discrimination. Researchers regularly use the scale to examine specific types of discrimination (e.g., racial, ethnic, gender- and age-based) as well as discrimination more generally among the "general population." To date, no study has analyzed the frameworks respondents use to interpret and answer the questions that comprise the scale. As such, what exactly researchers are measuring when they ask about "everyday discrimination" – and how this may vary within and across social groups – remains unknown. Objective This study analyzes data from cognitive interviews to assess patterns of interpretation and response to the EDS to assess whether the meaning of the resulting data may vary across diverse social groups. Methods Researchers conducted structured cognitive interviews with a diverse sample of thirty-eight adults in the Southeastern United States (US). Interview transcripts were qualitatively analyzed using MAXQDA, in a process of reiterative coding. Results Results show that respondents interpret the survey questions in markedly different ways, with some interpreting the scale as asking about negative interactions; others viewing it through a lens of social inequalities; and still others through a lens specifically of racism. Racial/ethnic and gender statuses may structure question interpretation. Conclusions Pronounced and patterned variation in respondents' interpretation raises questions about its validity. Findings underscore the importance of schemas for assessing the meaning of data generated by the EDS and for measuring the health effects of perceived discrimination and mistreatment.

T1  - Cognitive and neural bases of decision-making causing civilian casualties during intergroup conflict
AN  - 2574932303
AB  - Civilian casualties occur during military attacks. Such ‘collateral damage’ is prohibited by international laws but increases with substantial consequences when intergroup conflict escalates. Here, we investigate cognitive and neural bases of decision-making processes resulting in civilian harm, using a task that simulates punishment decision-making during intergroup conflict. We test two groups of Chinese participants in a laboratory setting, and members of two ethnic groups (Jewish and Palestinian) in Israel. The results dissociate two psychological constructs, harm preference and harm avoidance, which respectively characterize punishment decision-making related to outgroup combatants and outgroup noncombatants during intergroup conflict. In particular, individuals show decreased avoidance of harming outgroup noncombatants when conflict escalates. Brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) reveals that decreased harm avoidance is predicted by inhibition of the left middle frontal activity during selection of punishment decisions. Our findings provide insight into the cognitive and neural bases of decision-making involving civilian harm during intergroup conflict.During intergroup conflict, decision-makers must often consider whether their actions will harm noncombatant members of the outgroup. Here, Han et al. examine cognitive and neural processes during ‘collateral damage’ scenarios, revealing decreased avoidance of harm to outgroup civilians when conflict escalates.

T1  - Are universal welfare policies really more popular than selective ones? A critical discussion of empirical research
TT  - Popularity of universal vs selective welfare
AN  - 2580793408
AB  - PurposeIn the social policy literature, it is often assumed that universal policies are more popular than selective ones among the public, because they supposedly generate broader self-interested coalitions and are considered morally superior. The present article revisits and challenges this assumption.Design/methodology/approachThe article critically reviews the existing empirical literature on public support for universal and means-tested welfare schemes.FindingsThe main conclusion is that the popularity of universal vis-à-vis selective welfare remains very much an open question. First, the studies that are typically cited to support the claim that universalism is indeed more popular are inconclusive because they conflate the institutional design of welfare programs with their respective target groups. Second, there is considerable variation in public support for universal and selective welfare across countries, time and policy domains.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings suggest that future research should focus on scrutinizing under which circumstances – when, where and why – universal social policies are more popular than selective ones.Originality/valueThe article makes an original case for considering perceived welfare deservingness of social policies' target groups alongside the policy design when studying popular support for differently targeted welfare schemes.

T1  - (Sub)national and supranational identity among majority and minority youth in superdiverse urban schools
AN  - 2534832068
AB  - This article studies the extent to which ethnic minority and ethnic majority students in highly diverse urban schools identify with Flemish and European identity. In doing so this paper aims to discuss to what extent these sub-national and supranational identities can function as shared identities within the multiple identity belongings of teenagers and what the impact is of teacher support and perceived discrimination in schools on these phenomena. The analysis is based upon a survey among Belgian native and Moroccan origin students in the 5th and 6th year of secondary education in Antwerp, one of Europe’s most diverse cities. The results show that Moroccan students identify more strongly with a European identity than with a Flemish identity, while Flemish native students identify more strongly with Flemish than with European identity. This results in a large ‘identity gap’ with respect to Flemish identity but a much smaller gap with respect to European identity. In addition, our results show a positive effect of teacher support on Flemish and European identity for Belgian students, while it only has a positive effect on European identity for Moroccan students. The broader implications of the findings are discussed.

T1  - Intergroup Contact Reduces Dehumanization and Meta-Dehumanization: Cross-Sectional, Longitudinal, and Quasi-Experimental Evidence From 16 Samples in Five Countries
AN  - 2524143051
AB  - In 16 independent samples from five countries involving ~7,700 participants, we employ a mixture of cross-sectional, longitudinal, and quasi-experimental methods to examine the effect of intergroup contact on (a) the blatant dehumanization of outgroups, and (b) the perception that outgroup members dehumanize the ingroup (meta-dehumanization). First, we conduct a meta-analysis across 12 survey samples collected from five countries regarding eight different target groups (total N = 5,388) and find a consistent effect of contact quality on dehumanization and meta-dehumanization. Second, we use a large longitudinal sample of American participants (N = 1,103) to show that quality of contact with Muslims at Time 1 predicts dehumanization of Muslims and meta-dehumanization 6 months later. Finally, we show that sustained semester-long “virtual contact” between American and Muslim college students is associated with reduced American students’ (N = 487) dehumanization of, and perceived dehumanization by, Muslims.

T1  - Do young dating app users and non-users differ in mating orientations?
AN  - 2485496832
AB  - In recent years, dating apps have changed the way people meet and communicate with potential romantic and/or sexual partners. There exists a stereotype considering that these apps are used only for casual sex, so those apps would not be an adequate resource to find a long-term relationship. The objective of this study was to analyze possible individual differences in the mating orientations (short-term vs. long-term) between users and non-users of dating apps. Participants were 902 single students from a mid-size Spanish university, of both sexes (63% female, and 37% male), aged between 18 and 26 years (M = 20.34, SD = 2.05), who completed a battery of online questionnaires. It was found that, whereas dating apps users had a higher short-term mating orientation than non-users (more frequent behavior, higher desire, and more positive attitude), there were no differences in the long-term orientation as a function of use/non-use. Considering this, dating apps are a resource with a strong presence of people interested on hooking-up while, simultaneously, not a bad (nor good) option for finding long-term love.

T1  - Cultural stress in the age of mass xenophobia: Perspectives from Latin/o adolescents
AN  - 2516238074
AB  - During the last four years, xenophobic rhetoric directed toward Latino immigrants in U.S. media outlets and political forums has greatly increased. Using a general inductive approach, this qualitative study examined the forms of cultural stress, with a focus on discrimination and xenophobia, experienced by Latino adolescents in urban U.S. settings in 2018 and 2019. Six focus groups were conducted in Miami and Los Angeles (three groups per city) with first- and second-generation tenth-grade Latino students (n = 34). The following four themes emerged from the data: perceived discrimination from other Latino subgroups (in-group discrimination), perceived discrimination from non-Latino groups (out-group discrimination), internalization of stressors and discrimination experienced by participants' parents, and the current U.S. political rhetoric surrounding immigration. Understanding cultural stress among Latino adolescents provides valuable insight for future interventions to offset negative health outcomes associated with cultural stress.

T1  - The romantic imperative: discourses of romance and heterosexual marriage
AN  - 2465703031
AB  - The contact hypothesis predicts that positive contact will reform attitudes towards the out-group and lead to less prejudice as a result. In contexts facing ongoing gender inequality – such as South Africa – romance is usually seen as a beneficial point of contact between unequal groups (heterosexual men and women), because of the sense of intimacy it brings. We investigated romantic practices in a discursive-ethnographic study, by recruiting five young, westernised, middleclass South African couples and interviewing them a number of times about romance and their relationships. We found that these couples positioned being-romantic extremely positively, as a means of sustaining intimacy in marriage. However, we also found that they positioned one version of romance as something they needed to engage in, in order to do relationship-work. We have called this the romantic imperative and suggested that it appears to channel these couples into being romantic in a particular way; one which is restrictive in the way it may be performed and which carries a high cost in terms of the effort, time and financial resources required to perform it successfully. This links to critiques of the contact hypothesis, in that positive contact does not always equate to positive outcomes.

T1  - Religious identity and psychological well-being among middle-eastern migrants in Australia: The mediating role of perceived social support, social connectedness, and perceived discrimination
AN  - 2463170128
AB  - This study aims to examine the relative contribution of religious identity, social support, social connectedness, and perceived discrimination on psychological well-being (PWB) among Middle Eastern (ME) migrants in Australia. This cross-sectional study was conducted within Queensland, Australia. A total of 382 first-generation young adult ME migrants, aged 20–39 years, filled out a self-administered questionnaire. The hypothesized model was tested using a 2-step process: measurement and structural model testing. First, confirmatory factor analysis was performed to test the fitness of the measurement model, and reliability and validity indices were calculated. Structural equations modeling was then applied to test the structural model. The mediation analyses were tested using a bootstrapping method. Social support had the largest total effect on PWB through both a direct and an indirect effect via perceived discrimination and social connectedness with ethnic community (SCETH). Religious identity demonstrated both a direct and an indirect effect on PWB through social support, perceived discrimination, SCETH, and social connectedness with mainstream community (SCMN). Perceived discrimination showed a direct and an indirect effect on PWB, mediated by SCMN. The SCETH and SCMN had only direct effects on PWB. Developing interventions that assist religious institutions/networks in offering support and/or strategies to provide support to ME migrants through religious organizations could be helpful in increasing their PWB. Protecting ME migrants against discrimination based on their religious affiliation is a main area of action. Interventions that promote ME migrants' interaction with others could result in their better mental health outcomes.

T1  - Opening the black box of contact: Unravelling the ways through which positive contact is imagined in a post‐conflict context
AN  - 2457211583
AB  - While there is growing support for the prejudice‐reduction effects of imagined contact, knowledge of the content of imagery in imagined contact studies remains scarce. This qualitative study aims to address this gap by unravelling the ways of imagining an intergroup encounter that is indeed positive. Our data consist of the imagined contact stories of 43 participants in two imagined contact studies conducted in Cyprus, a post‐conflict context characterised by low levels of contact because of long‐standing division across ethnic lines. Our analysis yielded four themes corresponding to four ways of construing positive contact: imagining a good Other, a similar Other, an inferior Other, as well as imagining successfully overcoming obstacles emerging before or during contact. While participants came up with ways to imagine positive contact that are consistent with intergroup contact literature (e.g., intergroup similarities, decategorisation), a closer look at the findings reveals that in composing a positive intergroup experience, participants made use of dysfunctional stereotypes and conflict‐perpetuating narratives whose objective is to protect their superior status and to ensure their safety during contact. The findings serve as a word of caution for imagined contact as a prejudice‐reduction intervention and they also attest to the importance of deeply knowing the psychological composition of the groups which (imagined) contact interventions typically aim to tackle.

T1  - Love knows no colour bar: Windrush, racism and <i>Flame in the Streets</i>
AN  - 2428991997
AB  - Released in the aftermath of the 1958 Notting Hill riots, Flame in the Streets [Baker, Roy. 1961. UK: The Rank Organisation.] remains a distinctive British film of the 1960s in its examination of the racial prejudices that defined African-Caribbean's antagonous relations with the wider British Society. In Baker's attempt to expose the passive racisms of Jacko Palmer by paralleling his family conflict between his wife and daughter with his industrial conflicts as a trade union representative defending the rights of a black co-worker despite the disquiet that his ethnicity has generated from the white workers, the film presents ethnic minority characters in a form that links the personal with the political, interweaving themes of both class and race. Through a historicization and contextualization, this article sets out to examine the ways in which twentieth century post-war immigration and subsequent race struggles influenced the socio-political character of Flame in The Streets.

T1  - Justifying Social Inequalities: The Role of Social Darwinism
AN  - 2409933815
AB  - Three studies supported a model whereby associations between ideologies that share roots in biological determinism and outcomes that reinforce inequality (based on gender, race, or class) were mediated by system justification beliefs (SJB). Outcomes included support for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton as president (Study 1), justifying police brutality (Study 2), and support for a White House budget that slashed the social safety net to endow the wealthy with tax cuts (Study 3). These findings provoke a vital question: How do people deem unequal systems worthy of defense? Each study compared social Darwinism, social dominance orientation (SDO), and biological essentialism. We expected social Darwinism to account for the most variance in SJB because it provides both the rationale for social hierarchies (natural selection) and defends them as required for human welfare. This prediction was supported in each study. Implications for the psychology of legitimacy are discussed.

T1  - How Would Low-Income Communities Prioritize Medicaid Spending?
AN  - 2507993099
AB  - Context: Medicaid plays a critical role in low-income, minority, and medically underserved communities, particularly in states that have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Yet, the voices of underresourced communities are often unheard in decisions about how to allocate Medicaid's scarce resources, and traditional methods of public engagement are poorly suited to gathering such input. We argue that deliberative public engagement can be a useful tool for involving communities in setting Medicaid priorities.
Method: We engaged 209 residents of low-income, medically underserved Michigan communities in discussions about Medicaid spending priorities using an exercise in informed deliberation: CHAT (CHoosing All Together). Participants learned about Medicaid, deliberated in small groups, and set priorities both individually and collectively.
Findings: Participants prioritized broad eligibility consistent with the ACA expansion, accepted some cost sharing, and prioritized spending in areas—including mental health—that are historically underfunded. Participants allocated less funding beyond benefit coverage, such as spending on healthy communities. Participants perceived the deliberative process as fair and informative, and they supported using it in the policy-making process.
Conclusion: The choices of participants from low-income, medically underserved communities reflect a unique set of priorities and suggest that engaging low-income communities more deeply in Medicaid policy making might result in different prioritization decisions.

T1  - Power of Suggestion? Leadership Signals, Politics, Religion, and Women’s Support for the Disadvantaged
AN  - 2464951929
AB  - We assess the role of social signals about the appropriateness of women in leadership roles in either the political or religious domain. The relevant literature leads to expectations of a relatively clear effect on women’s efficacy levels when encountering social suggestions that women’s skills are better used in other ways. However, less certain is whether encouraging women away from leadership in religious organizations impacts their sense of effect on political outcomes, including policies in support of disadvantaged outgroups. Utilizing a framing experiment embedded in a statewide public opinion poll, we find that social suggestion that women should stay away from religious leadership has statistically significant and negative effects on efficacy levels among our sample’s subset of evangelical women. At the same time, these anti-religious leadership signals move evangelical women away from supporting policy statements benefitting a disadvantaged outgroup. Given that it is the power of suggestion regarding religious, not political, leadership that leads to the effects among evangelical women, we offer additional paths for future research to explore on this wider topic.

AN  - 2335666561
AB  - The present study deals with standard informative and expressive language tools in publicistic and journalistic texts of newspaper in the Chinese and Thai languages. The study aims to explore syntactic and grammatical features of Chinese and Thai publicistic and journalistic texts in detail in order to conduct a deep comparative analysis of the translation of such texts in both languages. A characteristic feature of journalism is also in the fact that it can affect not one person but masses; namely, society as a whole and its individual social groups. The overall goal of a publicistic and journalistic style is thus to influence public opinions, convince readers or listeners whose interpretations given by authors or speakers are the only correct ones, and force them to accept points of view expressed in speech, essays, or articles not only through logical reasoning but also via emotional appeal.

T1  - Personality and ideological bases of anti-immigrant prejudice among Croatian youth
AN  - 2291296473
AB  - In this paper, we explore the relationship between personality, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO) and anti-immigrant prejudice of Croatian youth (N = 1050). We base our hypotheses on the Dual-process motivational model of ideology and prejudice (DPM) and the meta-theoretical framework of McCrae and Costa's five-factor theory of personality (FFT), assuming that dispositions (basic tendencies) relate to ideological attitudes (characteristic adaptations) that further relate to prejudice (objective biography). The present study contributes to the existing literature by disentangling the mechanism of the personality-prejudice relation in thus far under-researched anti-immigrant prejudice domain. In addition, as one of the rare examinations of the personality-prejudice relation conducted outside the Western Europe and North America, the study offers valuable insight about the cross-cultural stability of the current findings. On the present sample, extraversion and openness to experience exerted direct effects on anti-immigrant prejudice. Indirect effects via RWA were found for extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness, and indirect effects via SDO were found for agreeableness, neuroticism and openness. Intriguingly, indirect effects of agreeableness on prejudice via RWA and SDO operated in opposite directions. Overall, the results support the DPM and FFT assumptions and provide fair replication of the existing empirical evidence.

T1  - The social‐psychological bases of far‐right support in Europe and the United States
AN  - 2283187210
AB  - The roles of authoritarianism, social dominance orientation (SDO), and prejudice in the prediction of far‐right support were examined in Europe and the United States. A meta‐analysis shows remarkably similar, positive, and strong associations of far‐right support with these three variables in previous studies conducted in Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Results from two cross‐sectional studies in the United States further indicated that higher levels of authoritarianism and SDO related to higher voting intentions and support for Trump, via increased prejudice. In a three‐wave longitudinal study in the United Kingdom, authoritarianism and SDO predicted pro‐Brexit attitudes and support for the U.K. Independence Party, again via prejudice. These results shed a new light on the widely held beliefs in “American and British exceptionalism,” as Trump and Brexit adherents share the same social‐psychological underpinnings as far‐right supporters observed in several European countries.

T1  - Online public services usage and the elderly: Assessing determinants of technology readiness in Japan and the UK
AN  - 2312776325
AB  - The aim of this study is to identify the impact of the personal beliefs of the elderly on their attitude toward using online public services. To test hypotheses regarding the determinants and background of technology readiness, questionnaires were administered to the elderly in Japan and in the UK, countries with a well-developed online public services infrastructure and an aging population. After structural equation modelling analysis, the research identified that aging satisfaction is the strongest factor in terms of influencing online public services usage, and this is developed through social interaction. Additionally, the research identified similarities and differences stemming from the cultural background of the respondents regarding their fear of using ICT. Our findings contribute to an understanding of the elderly's personal beliefs in terms of online technology usage and relevant social support, which may pave the way for determining an elderly-friendly social policy for diffusing new technology and services.

T1  - The Relationships of Intergroup Ideologies to Ethnic Prejudice: A Meta-Analysis
AN  - 2252656494
AB  - This meta-analysis summarizes the results of research on the relationships of majority group members’ endorsement of assimilation, colorblindness, multiculturalism, and the relative relationships of colorblindness and multiculturalism to ethnic prejudice. Random effects analyses found that assimilation was positively related to explicit prejudice (g. = 0.80), multiculturalism was negatively related to both explicit (g. = −0.26) and implicit prejudice (g. = −0.19), and colorblindness was negatively related to explicit prejudice (g. = −0.07). Multiculturalism was more closely associated with low prejudice than colorblindness (g. = 0.15). Effect sizes varied as a function of methodology (experimental vs. correlational), country in which research was conducted (United States vs. other countries), and, in experimental studies of multiculturalism, type of prime used (abstract vs. concrete). Discussion points include methodological issues, groups used as targets of prejudice, national diversity norms, additional issues raised in the studies reviewed, and directions for future research.

T1  - Culture, Religion and Sexual Diversity in Lesotho
AN  - 2229915428
AB  - This paper explores community dialogues as social interaction in search for sexual diversity in Lesotho, in an effort to influence positive and more directional thinking towards sexuality and sexual behaviour. Guided by queer theory, we firstly explore cultural and religious dimensions defining acceptable and unacceptable sexual behaviour; their influence on attitudes towards the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning (or queer) and intersex (LGBTQI) community, leading to their daily negative encounters; and, lastly, we suggest community dialogues as a mediator that influences more positive attitudes and guides acceptability towards this vulnerable population. Three main themes emerged after the adoption of a thematic analysis: there is denial of the LGBTQI existence; stigma and discrimination towards this minority population also prevail; and the LGBTQI population in Lesotho experience emotional and physical attacks.

T1  - Decomposing Income-Related Inequalities in Self-Reported Depression and Self-Rated Health Among Married Immigrants in South Korea
AN  - 2330854434
AB  - According to the 2015 national survey on multicultural families conducted in South Korea, about one in three married immigrants/nationalised citizens were found to have experienced depressive symptoms in the past year [8], which is about triple that reported among native South Koreans [9].

The authors postulated that financial strain, not an actual level of income, could more consistently influence mental health of married immigrant women in South Korea.

Demographic and Socio-Economic Variables The following demographic and socioeconomic variables were included in this analysis: age, sex, years of residence in South Korea, area of residence (rural vs. urban), disability card holder (yes vs. no), level of satisfaction with a spouse measured with a five-point scale (very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, fair, satisfied, very satisfied), perceived discrimination measured with a modified version of the Experience of Discrimination questionnaire, which asks the respondents whether they have ever experienced discrimination (yes vs. no) and other further details on the places of discrimination experienced [19], no one around for help when they were sick (yes vs. no) as a proxy for social relationship, level of education (≤middle school, high school, ≥university), employment status (regular work, temporary work, not working), level of average monthly gross household income in the past year (<1 million KRW, 1–2 million KRW, 2–3 million KRW, 3–4 million KRW, 4–5 million KRW, 5–6 million KRW, 6–7 million KRW, ≥7 million KRW (purchasing power parities: 1 U.S. $ = 866 KRW [20], exchange rate: 1 U.S. $ = 1130 KRW [21])), and subjective social status measured with a three-point scale (top, middle, bottom).

A substantial proportion of women from low/middle-income countries were likely to have entered South Korea through brokered international marriage, especially in the mid-2000s, whereas a high proportion of men from low/middle-income countries could have entered the country for economic opportunities prior to marriage and have pushed into low-quality jobs (i.e., dirty, dangerous, and demeaning jobs).

T1  - How does intergroup threat affect the shifting function? The moderating role of group identification
AN  - 2274268149
AB  - In this study we examined whether the shifting function can be modulated by intergroup threat, and if so, how this works. We conducted 2 experiments, using a task-switching paradigm, the results of which provide converging evidence that intergroup threat can impair the shifting function. Results showed that participants in the threat condition in each study (Study 1 symbolic threat: n = 29; Study 2 realistic threat: n = 29) experienced greater shifting costs than did those in the control condition (Study 1: n = 29; Study 2: n = 28). Further, group identification moderated the depletion effect in the intergroup threat condition, with participants closer (vs. less close) in group identification showing greater switching costs following the intergroup threat intervention. In sum, these results suggest that intergroup threat could deplete switching ability, and this effect could be influenced by group identification. In future studies researchers should investigate more kinds of intergroup threat than those we used in this study to assess the generalizability of our findings.

T1  - Social psychological research on prejudice as collective action supporting emergent ingroup members
AN  - 2162391435
AB  - Why does social psychological research on prejudice change across time? We argue that scientific change is not simply a result of empirical evidence, technological developments, or social controversies, but rather emerges out of social change‐driven shifts in how researchers categorize themselves and others within their larger societies. As mainstream researchers increasingly recategorize former outgroup members as part of a novel ingroup, prejudice research shifts in support of emergent ingroup members against their emergent outgroup opponents. Although social change‐driven science results in valuable opportunities for researchers, it also results in significant risks for research – collective, scientific biases in the inclusion and exclusion of social groups in prejudice research that are not readily detected or managed by traditional controls. We present the Emergent Ingroup Model (EIM) to encourage reflection on shared biases, as well as to spark a broader conversation on how to strengthen our field for a rapidly changing and increasingly global world.

T1  - Conspiracy and Misperception Belief in the Middle East and North Africa
AN  - 2118793623
AB  - Misperceptions and conspiracy theories about foreign powers and religious and ethnic groups can inflame intergroup conflict and distort public opinion, especially in divided and contentious regions like the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Why do people acquire and maintain these false or unsupported beliefs? This study reports the results of a novel survey experiment examining conspiracy beliefs in the MENA region. We find that belief in conspiracy theories about the West, Jews, and Israel is widespread and strongly associated with generalized anti-Western and anti-Jewish attitudes, especially among individuals with high political knowledge. However, both experimental and observational data indicate that these beliefs do not appear to be the result of feelings of powerlessness-our findings provide little support for the hypothesis that a lack of control makes people more vulnerable to conspiracy theories.

T1  - New Media and Support for Same-Sex Marriage
AN  - 2150387944
AB  - Research in advanced industrialized democracies on social attitudes toward same-sex marriage suggests that intergroup social contact and positive media coverage play an important role in promoting tolerance and support for same-sex marriage. Using AmericasBarometer survey data for eighteen countries in 2010, 2012, and 2014, this article examines the ways in which individual-level Internet use interacts with news exposure, country-level quality of democracy, Internet penetration, and their association with support for same-sex marriage. The results suggest that not only is Internet use associated with greater support for same-sex marriage, but that among those who both use the Internet and pay more attention to the news, the positive effects are amplified. In addition, national level of democracy, economic development, and Internet use are also associated with overall higher probabilities of supporting same-sex marriage. We find that Internet use has a strong positive association with the probability of supporting same-sex marriage as the percentage of the national population on the Internet increases. These findings extend our understanding of social and political tolerance of same-sex marriage in Latin America.Alternate abstract:Investigación en países industrializados sugiere que el contacto entre grupos sociales y la cobertura positiva de los mismos en medios de comunicación juegan un papel importante en la promoción de tolerancia y en aumentar apoyo al matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo. Basándonos en las encuestas del AmericasBarometer de 2010, 2012 y 2014, este artículo examina cómo el uso de la Internet interactúa con el consumo de noticias, la calidad de la democracia en el país, el grado nacional de penetración de la Internet, y su asociación con mayor apoyo al matrimonio igualitario. Estos resultados sugieren que no solamente existe una asociación entre el uso de la Internet y apoyo al matrimonio igualitario, pero que esta asociación amplifica los efectos positivos entre las personas que usan la Internet y prestan atención a las noticias. Además, la calidad de la democracia al nivel nacional, niveles de desarrollo económico, así como el uso de la Internet están también asociados con probabilidades mayores de apoyo. Encontramos que existe una fuerte asociación positiva entre el uso de la Internet y probabilidades de mayor apoyo conforme aumenta el porcentaje de la población con acceso a la Internet.

T1  - The Changing Norms of Racial Political Rhetoric and the End of Racial Priming
AN  - 2098782539
AB  - We explore the conjecture that norms of racial rhetoric in US campaigns have shifted over the last several years. Prior work suggests that the way politicians talk about race affects the power of racial attitudes in political judgments. Racial priming theory suggests that explicit racial rhetoric-messages overtly hostile toward minorities-would be rejected. When race is cued subtly, however, the power of racial attitudes on issues is significantly enhanced. Replication attempts have recently failed. We identify two historically related shifts that lead us to expect that the effective distinction between explicit and implicit racial rhetoric has declined in recent years. Four nationally representative survey experiments strongly support our predictions: regardless of whether political messages are racially explicit or implicit, the power of racial attitudes is large and stable. Finally, many citizens recognize racially hostile content in political communications but are no longer angered or disturbed by it.

T1  - The education of minorities in Bulgaria and Romania: Analyzing the formation and articulation of preferences
AN  - 2036642551
AB  - This paper investigates explanations in variation in the education-related preferences of comparable minorities in Bulgaria and Romania (i.e., Turks and Hungarians, respectively) as articulated by political, institutional, and civil society actors claiming to speak on their behalf. The study, which is based on original data extracted from 32 in-depth interviews, begins with a classification of the preferences that the interviewees articulated and the diverse arguments on which these were grounded. Subsequently, I turn to the potential explanations of the observed variation by examining a number of themes that emerged during the discussions and that also correspond to the factors usually considered in the literature on ethnic politics. These include the constraining effect of majority public opinion, the minorities' political representation, and notions related to the opportunities of exit and voice. I argue that actors' preferences adapt to the prevailing circumstances through an incremental process: before higher order preferences can be met or even conceived all the lower steps along the way have to be accounted for.

T1  - An heretical consumer research perspective on music, culture and heritage
AN  - 2031357796
AB  - This special issue presents both empirical and conceptual papers on music, culture, and heritage as a discursive site of human action and social interaction. The theme of this special issue of music, culture, and heritage are aspects symbolically embedded throughout the market, as well as within cultural and ritualistic practice. The work featured in this special issue captures the essence of the 2015 Heretical Consumer Research Revival conference held 28-30 September in New Orleans, LA (partially funded by Association of Consumer Research). This diverse gathering of critical thinkers and consumer researchers considered various avenues to enrich future directions for consumer culture research. In line with that conference, this special issue is oriented towards generating innovative, radical, and even heretical schools of thought in consumer culture research surrounding markets, music, culture, and heritage in a nonconventional, nonconformist manner.

T1  - Fear of small numbers? Immigrant population size and electoral support for the populist radical right in Switzerland
AN  - 2076977885
AB  - In this paper, we examine the association between contact with migrant populations and support for the populist radical right (PRR) in Switzerland. Building on group threat and intergroup contact theories, which offer opposing predictions, and drawing on Appadurai's thesis of the 'fear of small numbers', we propose a new theoretical framework to explain this association. We predict that the relationship between the size of the migrant populations and PRR voting is nonlinear: a small but noticeable minority triggers the formation of anti-immigrant attitudes, which soften as the minority grows and people start having meaningful interactions with foreigners. To test these theories, we combine individual-level data with municipality-level information. Mixed-effects multilevel models confirm that individuals in municipalities with a moderate proportion of foreigners are more likely than those with fewer or a greater number of migrants to cast their vote in support of PRR parties; this is particularly so for certain stigmatised minorities. We further explore the effect of perceived immigrant threat in moderating these relationships.

T1  - Majority No More? The Influence of Neighborhood Racial Diversity and Salient National Population Changes on Whites’ Perceptions of Racial Discrimination
AN  - 2132248262
AB  - This article examines whether the size of racial minority populations is associated with whites’ perceptions that different racial groups face discrimination. Correlational studies reveal that both the perceived size (studies 1 and 2) and actual size (study 2) of the racial minority population in their local environment predicts the extent to which whites report that they personally, and that whites as a group, face racial discrimination. Two experiments (studies 3 and 4) reveal that reading about growth in the racial minority share of the national population (versus control information) similarly increases whites’ concerns about antiwhite discrimination. Overall, these findings suggest that increasing racial diversity, real or perceived, local or national, can elicit identity-relevant concerns among white Americans, including perceived vulnerability to racial discrimination.

T1  - Understanding intergroup conflicts in tourism
AN  - 2122768906
AB  - This research note highlights an important yet rarely explored phenomenon in tourism: the intergroup conflicts between residents and tourists. A growing number of stories regarding local residents' discontent toward tourism as well as disputes between residents and tourists are being reported worldwide. Against these issues, this paper proposes a research program to advance tourism research on three fronts: to understand how resident-tourist intergroup relations and conflicts evolve under different conditions of social interactions; to examine the possible impacts of tourist misbehavior on shaping intergroup conflicts; and to explore how intergroup conflicts in various tourism contexts affect community attitude toward tourism and tourist perception of destination image. The sustainability of tourism development relies on the support of residents to deliver tourism products and services. Prior studies attempted to categorize residents' attitudes toward tourism in a unidirectional continuum, or explored individuals' evaluations of economic, social or environmental issues associated with tourism development, often explained by Social Exchange Theory or its derivatives.

T1  - Who Says What to Whom: Content Versus Source in the Hostile Media Effect
AN  - 2506669614
AB  - Hostile-media-effect research has been built on the assumption that partisans are motivated to adjust their evaluations to accommodate preexisting attitudes that are especially sensitive to content. More recent literature, however, has suggested a rival hypothesis—that perceptions of media bias spring from social identity, keyed to source differences. To test these competing explanations, we designed an experiment around the teaching-alternatives-to-evolution controversy. Partisans from two adversarial groups read an op-ed article with manipulations of content (agreeable, balanced, or disagreeable) and source (in-group, neutral, or out-group). Both content and source influenced hostile media perceptions, but nuanced differences speak to the dynamic ways in which content, source, as well as group-level characteristics impact the processing and evaluation of news content.

T1  - Contact with bisexual individuals reduces binegativity among heterosexuals and lesbian women and gay men
AN  - 1935253888
AB  - Although binegativity, the stigmatization of bisexuality, is prevalent among heterosexual and lesbian and gay communities, little research has addressed how the quantity and quality of intergroup contact affect binegativity. Drawing on intergroup contact theory, this study examined contact with and attitudes toward bisexuals among heterosexual undergraduates, heterosexual adults, and lesbians and gay men. Knowing more bisexuals (quantity) predicted more positive attitudes toward and decreased intergroup anxiety with male and female bisexuals. A multilevel structural equation model indicated that contact quality simultaneously predicted higher perceived stability of female bisexuality (but not male bisexuality) and tolerance of and less intergroup anxiety with male and female bisexuals when contact quantity was controlled for. This research suggests that both quantity and quality of contact with bisexuals predicts improved intergroup attitudes. Implications for future research on reducing binegativity are discussed.

T1  - Authoritarianism and National Identity: Examining the Longitudinal Effects of SDO and RWA on Nationalism and Patriotism
AN  - 1928333191
AB  - The resurgence of right-wing political parties across the globe raises questions about the origins of national identity. Based on the Dual Process Model of Ideology and Prejudice, we argue that people's tendency to submit to ingroup authorities (Right-Wing Authoritarianism [RWA]) and preference for group-based hierarchy (Social Dominance Orientation [SDO]) underlie people's belief in the superiority of their nation (nationalism) and attachment to their homeland (patriotism). We examine these hypotheses using three waves of data from an annually conducted national longitudinal panel study of New Zealanders (N = 3,838). As predicted, RWA had positive cross-lagged effects on nationalism and patriotism. Conversely, SDO had a positive cross-lagged effect on nationalism, but a negative cross-lagged effect on patriotism. Little evidence of reciprocal cross-lagged effects (i.e., national identity on authoritarianism) was found. These results demonstrate that nationalism and patriotism are related, albeit distinct, ways of identifying with one's nation that are ultimately rooted in authoritarianism.

T1  - The Determinants of Civic and Ethnic Nationalisms in Kazakhstan: Evidence from the Grass-Roots Level
AN  - 1961171875
AB  - This article investigates the determinants of ethnic and civic nationalism in post-Soviet Kazakhstan. Using data from an original nation-wide survey (N = 1600), the regression analysis is applied to evaluate the influence of trust and perceptions of discrimination as well as sociodemographic factors on people's support of civic and ethnic nationalism(s) in Kazakhstan. The results show that trust in political institutions, perceived discrimination, and the knowledge of the Kazakh language have an impact on both types of nationalism. In addition, intragroup (ethnic) trust and income determine civic-nationalist attachments, while rural residence, Kazakh ethnicity, income, and other ethnic minorities influence ethnonationalism in Kazakhstan.

T1  - Stigmatized portrayals of single women: a content analysis of news coverage on single women and single men in China
AN  - 1891105045
AB  - This study explored the stigmatized portrayals of single womanhood in news media by content analyzing news coverage from Mainland China of single women and single men from 2008 to 2013. Among the three prevalent news frames (conflict, responsibility, and human interest), the results showed that news reports relating to single women commonly employed more human-interest frames and concentrated on single women's conflicts with other social groups as well as the conflicts between singles and societal expectation of population sustainability. News stories also unduly ascribed the responsibility for being 'single' to the women themselves, but such individual attribution was not applied to single men. As an exploratory study, our research shed light on how news framing is gendered to reinforce stereotypes and facilitate mechanisms for control. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in relation to public opinion about single womanhood and the intersectional oppression of single women in Chinese society.

T1  - When school meets the Other: intercultural policies in the Basque inclusive school
AN  - 1862143788
AB  - Gatti, Irazuzta and Martinez address the intercultural public policies implemented in the education system of the Autonomous Region of the Basque Country (Spain). Focusing on the education system allows them to reconstruct the historicity of identity-alterity production in a region in which language has been central for the establishment of ethnic frontiers. More specifically, they examine the implementation of these policies in three pre-school and primary educational institutions in a multicultural neighbourhood of the city of Bilbao. They look at Euskara-the Basque language-as a key element of the us-them distinction. The various education models regarding language and the teaching in/of Euskara or Spanish pave the way for the specialization and spatialization of the schools analysed. 'Integration' policies are implemented in ethnically marked schools only, based on a rhetoric of interculturality that assumes that any 'racial or ethnic discrimination' can be overcome through knowledge of the Other. Moreover, the assessment of public policies through 'interculturality figures and best practice' developed to address the so-called 'immigration issue' promotes a protectionist intervention on behalf of the assumed social vulnerabilities of immigrant schoolchildren and their families, which are read as 'problematic characteristics'. The article argues that, as a result of the approach based on the social conditions of immigrant children and their families in the Basque Country, the race issue evaporates.

T1  - Exploring Perceived Discrimination Among LGBT Individuals in Turkey in Education, Employment, and Health Care: Results of an Online Survey
AN  - 1892727828
AB  - This article explores the discrimination practices encountered by lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals in education, income, employment, and health care in Turkey. Limited quantitative data on LGBT individuals are available in Turkey. This study collected data from 2,875 LGBT individuals through a Web-based survey. The findings suggest that LGBT individuals report perceived direct and indirect discrimination in accessing education, employment, and health care. In a country where LGBT rights are not yet recognized and antidiscrimination legislation covering sexual orientation and gender identity is still nonexistent, findings demonstrate perceived discrimination of LGBTs rarely turns into a legal complaint. Even when they do, most LGBTs in our sample report that they did not feel that the justice system addressed their grievances.

T1  - Shaping the Development of Prejudice
AN  - 1840909693
AB  - Social dominance orientation (SDO) has been theorized as a stable, early-emerging trait influencing outgroup evaluations, a view supported by evidence from cross-sectional and two-wave longitudinal research. Yet, the limitations of identifying causal paths with cross-sectional and two-wave designs are increasingly being acknowledged. This article presents the first use of multi-wave data to test the over-time relationship between SDO and outgroup affect among young people. We use cross-lagged and latent growth modeling (LGM) of a three-wave data set employing Norwegian adolescents (over 2 years, N = 453) and a five-wave data set with American university students (over 4 years, N = 748). Overall, SDO exhibits high temporal rank-order stability and predicts changes in outgroup affect. This research represents the strongest test to date of SDO's role as a stable trait that influences the development of prejudice, while highlighting LGM as a valuable tool for social and political psychology.

T1  - Who Does (Not) Participate in Intergroup Conflict?
AN  - 1835210709
AB  - Prior research on the participation in intergroup conflict suggests that prosocial individuals are parochial cooperators who escalate intergroup conflict. However, evidence on this conjecture is currently inconclusive. We provide a critical empirical test of the link between individuals' prosocial tendencies (operationalized via Social Value Orientation [SVO] and trait Honesty-Humility) and cooperative behavior in different intergroup conflict games (i.e., variants of the Intergroup Prisoner's Dilemma). Contradicting the view that prosocial individuals fuel intergroup conflict, both trait dimensions were positively associated with cooperative behavior toward others in general, irrespective of others' group membership. That is, individuals with a prosocial SVO or high levels of Honesty-Humility, respectively, refrained from harming out-group members and, if possible, even benefited them. Overall, the results imply that the cooperativeness of prosocial individuals is universal in nature, thus exceeding the in-group boundary. Prosocial individuals are hence willing to foster intergroup cooperation rather than fueling intergroup conflict.

T1  - Network Models of Minority Opinion Spreading: Using Agent-Based Modeling to Study Possible Scenarios of Social Contagion
AN  - 1822381941
AB  - Although several models in the literature analyze the dynamics of opinion formation, less attention has been paid to explain how the structure of social networks and their contextual circumstances can influence the course of minority public opinions. This work aims to pose three basic questions: (1) how the structure of social networks can affect the spread of minority opinion, (2) how committed agents influence this process, and (3) how mass media action, as a contextual factor, can vary different agents' opinions and network composition. Agent-based modeling is used to create a network model of preferential attachment to explore how phenomena of minority opinion spreading can evolve under different simulated scenarios. This study shows that the success of minority opinions depends on network structure and composition and thus on external factors such as mass media action that can mediate the strength of these internal determinants. Although people tend to remain silent when they feel that their opinions are in the minority, our findings suggest that prevailing majority opinion may be promptly replaced by what was formerly minority opinion if core agents in the network structure and/or external sources support this view.

T1  - Is There an Oppositional Culture Among Immigrant Adolescents in the Netherlands?
AN  - 1772855778
AB  - This study examines oppositional culture among immigrant and majority adolescents in the Netherlands. Oppositional culture theory expects that immigrant adolescents would uphold positive attitudes towards education. The social exclusion theory predicts instead that immigrant adolescents develop an oppositional culture, particularly in ethnically concentrated schools. To test these ideas, we make use of one of the first large-scale studies on oppositional culture in the Netherlands, and in Europe more generally. Applying multilevel analyses to a survey across 340 schools among 11,215 adolescents aged 11 to 19, we find no clear evidence that immigrant adolescents support oppositional culture either more or less than majority adolescents. Results however showed that oppositional culture differs across schools and that in more ethnically concentrated schools, there is a higher tendency for ethnic minority adolescents to skip classes. Furthermore, oppositional culture finds more support among adolescents who are in a higher grade, male, and who attend a lower education track.

T1  - Macro-conditions and immigrants' happiness: Is moving to a wealthy country all that matters?
AN  - 1770928688
AB  - Migrants look for a better life. In what kind of country will they live happiest? Many migrants aspire to move to wealthy countries, but non-economic factors might be important as well in making a country livable for migrants. This issue is addressed here by examining the impact of macroeconomic conditions and non-economic macro-conditions (good governance and a pleasant social climate) on immigrants' happiness in twenty European nations. We find that immigrants' happiness depends both on economic and non-economic macro-conditions. The social climate is especially important, particularly in terms of a positive attitude in society towards migrants. Our findings imply that the choice of destination country matters for migrants' happiness and that the discrepancy between migration motives and migration outcomes may constrain immigrants from maximizing subjective gains via migration.

T1  - Prejudice and paranoia: a comparative study of antisemitism and Sinophobia in turn-of-the-century Britain
AN  - 1784144946
AB  - Renshaw examines in comparative terms two of the most virulent manifestations of racial prejudice in early twentieth-century British society. The language of antisemitism and Sinophobia in the Edwardian period and the years preceding the First World War, the similarities and differences in the ways that these two forms of prejudice were articulated, and the overlap between them are analysed. Five strands of anti-Jewish and anti-Chinese sentiment and action are discussed. The first examines how international manifestations of antisemitism and Sinophobia, suspicions aimed at Jews and Chinese as transnational diasporic communities, and perceptions of these minorities, through Russian pogroms, the Boxer Rebellion in China and the post-Boer War economic situation in South Africa, were framed in narratives of victimhood and aggression. Second, the transnational and colonial circuits of racialized discourse and the relationship between periphery and metropole are considered, as are divergences in the articulation of anti-Jewish and anti-Chinese prejudice. The third strand investigates the use of the language of 'invasion', used by both the political right and the left in discussing Jewish and Chinese immigration and economic activity in Britain, with Chinese employment in British industries (in this period particularly as sailors on British ships) framed in the context of a demographic 'Asiatic' takeover of European societies. The fourth strand looks at the intersection of racial prejudice and sexual and social angst, the visceral association of immigrant groups with dirt and disease, and the sexual threat that racist and antisemitic literature attributed to Jews and Chinese. Finally, physical manifestations of antisemitism and Sinophobia in the period and the racial violence that occurred in Cardiff and Tredegar in 1911 will be described and placed in context. The article positions Edwardian antisemitism and Sinophobia as a transitory stage in the evolution of British racism: a bridge between the separate domestic and colonial forms of prejudice present in late Victorian discourse, and the new manifestations of racism located in British cities and ports, but aimed at non-white minorities, that emerged in the interwar period.

T1  - Social networking in an academic conference context: insights from a case study
AN  - 2093342813
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to propose a conference-based online social network (OSN) for academics’ knowledge sharing and collaboration around and beyond a conference, while exploring the entanglement of the social and technical aspects of the system. Design/methodology/approach – Following an exploratory study, an OSN prototype was developed and implemented in ECIS 2014. The usage of the OSN platform was monitored and in-depth interviews were conducted with seven of its active users. Findings – Academic researchers have positive attitudes toward using conference-based OSN. However, there is a gap between academics’ perceptions and their actual behavior. Several barriers for engagement were identified, leading to technical and social recommendations, including the following needs: integrating the OSN platform with other conference information systems; addressing privacy concerns; allowing on-going collaboration; increasing OSN vitality; using the wisdom of the crowd; and promotion and its timing. Research limitations/implications – The case study highlighted existing benefits, and identified potential future benefits from implementing a conference-based OSN. Future research is required to generalize the findings and evaluate the proposed strategies for enhancing user engagement. Practical implications – This study revealed the set of considerations that should be taken upon launching a new academic OSN, which are beyond the technical issues per se. Social implications – The paper presents the expected benefits from, and existing barriers to using a conference-based OSN, and suggests recommendations for encouraging academics to engage in such OSN, in order to enhance long-term social interactions, knowledge sharing and collaboration among conference participants. Originality/value – This is a first study to examine a conference-based OSN.

T1  - Group cues and public opposition to immigration: evidence from a survey experiment in South Korea
AN  - 2076972417
AB  - One view in the study of attitudes towards immigration is that public reactions depend on who the immigrants are. Using a survey experiment, we confirm that group cues matter: South Koreans are more likely to support liberal immigration policies, when immigrants are framed as North Korean defectors (coethnic group). When other groups cues-Korean Chinese (semi-coethnic group) or guest-workers from Indonesia (non-coethnic group)-are given, the level of support becomes significantly lower. Apparently clear evidence on the existence of favouritism towards coethnic group notwithstanding, the relationship between in-group favouritism and immigration threat is not simple, as demonstrated by the finding that individuals exposed to Korean Chinese cues are more likely to feel culturally and socially threatened than those exposed to Indonesian cues. Also, South Koreans experience higher levels of economic threat from North Korean defectors than from Korean Chinese and Indonesians. Additional analysis reveals that ethnic group cues affect public attitudes towards immigration policies not necessarily by heightening perceived threat towards immigrants, but by facilitating individuals' emotional reactions to them.

T1  - Social justice and affirmative action
AN  - 1759163786
AB  - While the concept 'justice' undergirds every discourse on affirmative action, its meaning is feverishly contested with contradictory definitions wielded as battling swords in a zero sum struggle over the distribution of scarce material resources and symbolic goods. In part, the issues have become even more important since the number of states that have now embarked on affirmative action policies have been growing and the results have been diverse. Affirmative action policies have occurred most frequently in internally heterogeneous societies marked by deep ethno-cultural divisions in which one ethnic community has tended to dominate the rest. To overcome inequalities and ingrained segmental prejudices in these multi-ethnic countries that witnessed over the years the cementing of advantages and privileges among certain ethnic groups has been the primary aim of affirmative action policies. Upheavals and ongoing conflicts have generally dogged these experiences, attesting to some successful societal changes in institutions and practices, to winners and losers. In this paper, we examine some of the controversies, especially in relation to two paradigms and perspectives of social justice.

T1  - Immigrants' Attitudes toward Homosexuality: Socialization, Religion, and Acculturation in European Host Societies: IMR
AN  - 1753039184
AB  - With increasing diversity of migrants in Europe, questions around cultural integration are gaining importance. This study focuses on attitudes towards homosexuality amongst first and second generation immigrants from 186 origin countries to examine the role of religion, origin country socialization and acculturation. There is clear evidence for intra- and intergenerational acculturation of attitudes with declining importance of origin country context. While individual characteristics of migrants and origin country context can explain a substantial part of religious group differences particularly amongst the first generation, Muslims and to a lesser extent other non-Christian and Eastern Orthodox migrants hold overall more negative attitudes.

T1  - The Naked Wind Turns/the Corner in Surprise: A Transformative Narrative About Roma Inclusion
AN  - 1751005652
AB  - This article constitutes a narrative of the life events of Antonio, a man belonging to the Roma community. His life story combines passages of exclusion, in which Antonio was the target of cultural bias that even led him to be imprisoned, with transformative experiences that were greatly influenced by his participation in a Dialogic Literary Gathering. Through the shared reading of Federico Garcia Lorca's Gypsy Ballads, he strengthened his identity as a man who is deeply proud of belonging to the Roma community and became an agent of social transformation. The interactions and meaning created in the Dialogic Literary Gathering allowed him to rewrite his story, tearing down the walls of prejudice that Lorca masterfully denounced in his works.

T1  - Impact of Identity on Support for New Roles in Health Care: A Language Inquiry of Doctors' Commentary
AN  - 1735732704
AB  - Identity threat can be understood from a social identity perspective where people interrelate based on group memberships. Language use may indicate the presence of identity threat. We explored reactions of doctors to planned expanded roles for nurses to perform gastrointestinal endoscopy in Australia. Specialist doctors have traditionally performed endoscopic procedures, yet the level of doctor support for nurse endoscopy is relatively unknown. We present results of our valence and discourse analyses of text box responses in a national survey that explored doctors' attitudes toward this role expansion. We found low levels of support for the role, and frequent expression of identity threat in three main areas: (1) framing nurses as incompetent, (2) use of contracted statements to evoke authority, and (3) emotive expression. Findings indicated that stakeholders should consider intergroup attitudes when facilitating changes in health professional scope of practice.

T1  - TO TEST OR NOT? SINGULAR OR MULTIPLE HERITAGE?
AN  - 1733239665
AB  - DNA ancestry testing may seem frivolous, but it points to two crucial questions: First, what is the relationship, if any, between biology and race? Second, how much and why do people prefer clear, singular racial identities over blurred, mixed racial self-understandings, or the reverse? We posit that individuals of different racial or ethnic backgrounds will have different levels of support for this new technology. In particular, despite the history of harm caused by the biologization of race, we theorize that African Americans will be receptive to the use of DNA ancestry testing because conventional genealogical searches for ancestral roots are mostly unavailable to them. This "broken chain" theory leads to two hypotheses, of disproportionately high Black interest in DNA ancestry testing--thus an implicit acceptance of a link between biology and race--and high acceptance among Blacks of multiple heritages despite a preference for evidence of roots in Africa. To test these hypotheses, we analyze two databases of U.S. newspaper articles, one with almost 6,000 items and a second with 700. We also analyze two new public opinion surveys of nationally representative samples of adult Americans. Most of the evidence comes from the second survey, which uses vignettes to obtain views about varied results of DNA ancestry testing. We find that the media increasingly report on the links between genetic inheritance and race, and emphasize singular racial ancestry more than multiple heritages. The surveys show, consistent with our theory, that Blacks (and Hispanics, to some degree) are especially receptive to DNA ancestry testing, and are pleased with not only a finding of group singularity but also a finding of multiple points of origin. Qualitative readings of media reports illuminate some of the reasons behind these survey findings. We conclude with a brief discussion of the broader importance of DNA ancestry testing.

T1  - Contextual Approach to Acculturative Stress Among Latina Immigrants in the U.S.
AN  - 1710150195
AB  - Based on Family Stress Management theory, we explored the contextual influence on acculturative stress and psychological distress. We included 639 Latinas from the National Latino Asian American Survey. We hypothesized that (a) impact of acculturative stress on psychological distress depends on specific contexts; (b) U.S. climate (i.e., perceived discrimination, happiness with U.S. move, years in the U.S.) impacts acculturative stress and psychological distress the most, and (c) contextual factors interact in impacting acculturative stress. Acculturative stress did not always lead to psychological distress. Perceived discrimination and difficulty visiting family abroad were positively associated with acculturative stress. Years in the U.S. and happiness with the U.S. move were negatively associated with acculturative stress. Years in the U.S. and perceived discrimination interacted in predicting acculturative stress. These results can aid formulation of effective interventions that target contexts likely to impact acculturative stress and psychological distress among Latinas.

T1  - An essentialism perspective on intercultural processes
AN  - 1676297077
AB  - Essentialist theories are the beliefs that there are immutable essences underlying observed differences between social groups (e.g. racial group, cultural group). This paper reviews the intergroup dynamics and intrapersonal processes associated with essentialism. It also explores the interplay between the two. By explicating the intricate relationship between these psychological processes, the current paper aims to advance our understanding of intergroup relations and identify their implications for the study of multiculturalism. We posit that although the commonly observed negative intergroup outcomes, such as prejudices and biases, can be the byproducts of basic cognitive processes associated with essentialist theories, the social power dynamics in a given society also play important roles in shaping the relationships between essentialism and intergroup outcomes. We then discuss the implications of this understanding to our increasingly multicultural world.

T1  - In Good Company? Perception of Movement Synchrony of a Non-Anthropomorphic Robot
AN  - 1682657090
AB  - Recent technological developments like cheap sensors and the decreasing costs of computational power have brought the possibility of robotic home companions within reach. In order to be accepted it is vital for these robots to be able to participate meaningfully in social interactions with their users and to make them feel comfortable during these interactions. In this study we investigated how people respond to a situation where a companion robot is watching its user. Specifically, we tested the effect of robotic behaviours that are synchronised with the actions of a human. We evaluated the effects of these behaviours on the robot’s likeability and perceived intelligence using an online video survey. The robot used was Care-O-bot3, a non-anthropomorphic robot with a limited range of expressive motions. We found that even minimal, positively synchronised movements during an object-oriented task were interpreted by participants as engagement and created a positive disposition towards the robot. However, even negatively synchronised movements of the robot led to more positive perceptions of the robot, as compared to a robot that does not move at all. The results emphasise a) the powerful role that robot movements in general can have on participants’ perception of the robot, and b) that synchronisation of body movements can be a powerful means to enhance the positive attitude towards a non-anthropomorphic robot.

T1  - Perceptions of Commonality and Latino-Black, Latino-White Relations in a Multiethnic United States
AN  - 1708527508; 201528700
AB  - This study examines the extent that Latinos' sense of social, economic, and political power shapes their perceptions of commonality with blacks and whites. In accordance with my theory, which builds on the racial threat and group position theories, I find that Latinos' sense of power structures their perceptions of blacks and whites. When native-born Latinos feel economically threatened, they are less likely to perceive commonality with blacks. When native-born Latinos gain some political influence, they identify less with whites. Among Latino immigrants who perceive discrimination, residing in a high-threat economic setting is negatively related to perceiving commonality with whites. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - To Know You is Not Necessarily to Love You: The Partisan Mediators of Intergroup Contact
AN  - 1680150718; 201514634
AB  - We propose the contact-cue interaction approach to studying political contact-that cues from trusted political elites can moderate the effect of contact on the formation of public policy opinions. Allport's initial formulation of the contact effect noted that it relies on authority support. In a highly polarized political era, authoritative voices for individuals vary based on party identification. Social experiences may affect public policy, but they must also be considered in light of partisan filters. Using data from the 2006 CCES, we examine the manner in which straight respondents with gay family members, friends, co-workers and acquaintances view same-sex marriage policy, finding a strong contact effect among Democrats, but no contact effect among the strongest Republican identifiers. Our data and analyses strongly support the perspective that social interactions (and their effect on policy) are understood through the lens of partisanship and elite cues.

T1  - Assimilation of Foreigners in Former West Germany
AN  - 1650148270; 201502269
AB  - Migration movements to industrialized countries have grown in number and size, and the presence of large numbers of immigrants has raised concerns about their integration and assimilation into host societies. This article is an empirical study of assimilation of foreign nationals in Germany. Their experience may hold lessons for other relatively recent immigration destinations. As expected, language is one of the most critical factors for determining integration and assimilation at the workplace and in society. Our results indicate uneven success in these two areas, and suggest that greater language skills may be required for social assimilation, compared to economic assimilation. Among the most important findings of our study are the strong and statistically significant effects of the attitudes by Germans toward immigrants, the significant influence of the region of residence, and the ambivalence of German-born foreign residents toward naturalization and continued stay. This signals the failure of past integration and assimilation policies. The results show that negative attitudes by ethnic Germans against others at work or in society, in general, reduce interest in integration and assimilation. This is neither new nor surprising and this research does not contribute new theoretical insights, but it demonstrates the magnitude and significance of the effects. The question of why different locations seemed to have different impacts on citizenship aspirations is beyond the scope of this article. The data do not provide information to pursue this question and we suspect that the causes are too complex for a short answer. As expected, non-EU citizens showed greater interest in acquiring German citizenship than EU citizens. Finally, the results also indicate that the immediate post-World War II notion of 'guest workers' was not completely false. There has been significant return migration and a significant number of respondents to the survey say that they intend to return. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1520555454; 24249527
AB  - Issue Title: Special Topics in Immigrant Health:  The Health of Indigenous Mayan Migrants from Yucatán México              The three studies presented in this Special Topics in Immigrant Health report findings from a novel transnational, mixed-methods study with indigenous Mayans in Yucatán, Mexico, and their satellite communities in Southern California. Indigenous migrants comprise the largest proportion of recent, first-time migrants from Mexico to the United States and are among the migrant populations most vulnerable to discrimination (e.g. work place) and health disparities. The studies presented focus on three topics: perceived discrimination and mental health among indigenous migrants and non-migrants, risky alcohol use behaviors associated with migration to the U.S. and within Mexico, and gendered power dynamics related to sexual health care access and utilization. This transnational research sheds new light on health issues and gender differences affecting indigenous Mexican migrant men, women and their families. Findings can serve to inform intervention research to improve migrant health in the U.S. and Mexico as well as transnational collaboration between countries. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Importance of Image Management for a Good Society
AN  - 1665210261
AB  - The paper deals with the importance of managing the image of a private or public organization and of any government, especially. There are underlined two important matrix used in the image and communication field and in the management field. The paper shows how these two matrices can be applied by a Government that wants to lead the mass people to a good society. Comparison and analogy are used as scientific methods together with the direct experience of the author as a private manager of the first private television after 1989, SOTI TV. For a good society, the Government must search continuously the needs, expectations, desires and aspirations for the mass people and find the dynamic ratio between individual and collective mind together with the signals of changing between different ways of thinking: PRO, AGAINST and NEUTRAL. The result is that in the end, the public opinion is moving from AGAINST to PRO, regarding the Government's decision, even it is an unpopular decision. Why this paper? As politician, as civil servant working within a public organization and as a member of the government, all must know the difference between myth and reality and all must improve the power to manage the image in order to become more consciousness about their own free will against so easily manipulation in a consumer society..

T1  - 'He is Armenian but he was born that way; there isn't much he can do about it': exploring identity and cultural assumptions in Turkey
AN  - 1559005848; 201431922
AB  - If Armenians have a core belief, it is that they are an endangered people. They live as if under constant threat. After the annihilation of the Armenian population living in their historical lands-the Armenian heartlands were in eastern Turkey-by the Young Turk government during 1915-16, a new Turkish republic emerged from the old Ottoman-Turkish state in 1923, including an oppressive nationalistic hegemony. The resulting identity politics only fuelled the sense of being Other among Armenians and other minorities. By assessing the consequences and social impact of anxiety on this minority population defined as the Other, Anahit's paper aims to explore identity and cultural assumptions in Turkey through the Armenian experience. Leaving behind conceptualizations of the shifting modes of cultural representation, it seeks to go beyond the existing sociopolitical constraints that have persisted since 1915. Based on field research conducted between 2005 and 2011, Anahit examines the ever-changing set of norms of cultural identity by exploring the politics of collective memory. She asks whether a dominant culture is dependant on counter-cultural movements to remain all-powerful. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social Exclusion of Children: Developmental Origins of Prejudice
AN  - 1543801910
AB  - Over the past decade, developmental and social psychological research has explicitly adopted a developmental intergroup framework, integrating social and developmental psychology fields to understand the origins of social exclusion and prejudice. This article argues that a social developmental analysis of how groups and individuals experience, evaluate, and understand exclusion is essential for a complete picture of the human experience, interpretation, and consequences of exclusion. What has been missing in much of the social psychological research on exclusion is an incorporation of developmental perspectives; likewise, what has been missing in development psychological research is a focus on group identity and group dynamics for understanding the basis for exclusionary behavior in childhood. Yet, the roots of adult forms of exclusion can be documented in childhood, and children who experience exclusion are particularly at risk for negative outcomes, and especially when exclusion is based on group membership. Moreover, interventions designed to ameliorate social problems associated with exclusion need to be based on an understanding of how, why, and under what conditions, children and groups make decisions to exclude others, how they experience this exclusion, and how exclusion originates and changes over the course of the lifespan. Thus, a growing body of psychological work, exemplified in this issue of the Journal of Social Issues (2014), highlights implications for theory in psychology and related social sciences, and for interventions and policies to tackle social exclusion.

T1  - Natural kind and entitative beliefs in relation to prejudice toward mental disorders
AN  - 1494243338
AB  - Mental health campaigns often promote biogenetic beliefs to reduce stigma, but their effectiveness may vary across disorders. Our study (N=127) examined two components of essentialist beliefs--entitative (i.e., characterizing groupness) and natural kinds (i.e., biogenetic)--about two stigmatized mental disorders (schizophrenia, alcoholism) as well as a somatic disorder (Parkinson's disease), and their relation to prejudice. The three disorders significantly differed in natural kind beliefs (Parkinson's highest, then schizophrenia, and alcoholism lowest) and prejudice (alcoholism highest, then schizophrenia, and Parkinson's lowest), but not entitative beliefs. Entitative beliefs, however, was a stronger predictor of prejudice against schizophrenia than natural kind beliefs even after controlling for social dominance orientation and prior contact. Implications for anti-stigma efforts and strategies are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Perceived Discrimination in LGBTIQ Discourse from Australia: A Typology of Verbal Discrimination
AN  - 1718069789; 201530769
AB  - New within the field of discourse analysis, perceived discrimination (PD) is the study of discourse that focuses on the perspectives of the victims of discrimination. This article explores the experiences of verbal discrimination as reported by eighteen LGBTIQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex, Queer/Questioning) participants during semi-structured, co-constructed interviews. Data was classified in order to develop a taxonomy of discrimination based on Mellor (2003; 2004) who foregrounds two types of discrimination: verbal and behavioural. In this paper, I identify the forms of verbal discrimination encountered by the participants and offer an analysis of the discourse used in the construction of the experiences and effects reported. The results show that verbal discrimination is mainly triggered by a perceived transgression of the normalised standards of people's behaviour, movements and appearance in a heterosexist society.

T1  - Perceptions of a Superordinate Identity in Northern Ireland
AN  - 1718067781; 201530747
AB  - Northern Ireland is still a deeply divided society where national and religious identities remain important. In recent years, the emergence of a new identity, 'Northern Irish,' has attracted researchers' attention. It has been suggested that it may be acting as a common ingroup identity, associated with more positive intergroup attitudes. This study aimed to examine perceptions of the Northern Irish identity. It was predicated that British Protestants and Irish Catholics would perceive the Northern Irish identity differently and that identity strength would influence perception of inclusion, but only through subgroup identity threat. Using a cross-sectional survey, participants who self-identified as British Protestant (n = 76), Irish Catholic (n = 41), Northern Irish Protestant (n = 78), or Northern Irish Catholic (n = 13) were asked to report their strength of identity in addition to how inclusive and threatening they felt the Northern Irish identity to be. They were also asked to indicate who they think uses the Northern Irish identity and what it means. Result show that Irish Catholics were less likely to perceive the Northern Irish identity as inclusive, compared to British Protestants but there were no differences on perceptions of threat. Threat was found to mediate the relationship between identity strength and superordinate identity inclusion. The Northern Irish identity was suggested to be mostly used by British Protestants but the meaning of this identity differed, both within and between identity groups. These findings have implications for understanding the real world applicability of a superordinate identity and for societies trying to move forward from sustained periods of conflict.

T1  - The impact of local black residents' socioeconomic status on white residents' racial views
AN  - 1559005916; 201432026
AB  - This paper extends the study of contextual influences on racial attitudes by asking how the SES of the local black community shapes the racial attitudes of local whites. Using responses to the 1998-2002 General Social Surveys merged with year 2000 census data, we compare the influences of black educational and economic composition on white residents' attitudes. Finally, the independence of these effects from the impact of white contextual SES is assessed. Across three dimensions of racial attitudes, white residents' views are more positive in localities where the black population contains more college graduates. However, such localities tend also to have highly educated white populations, as well as higher incomes among blacks and whites, and the multiple influences are inseparable. In contrast, many racial attitude measures show an independent effect of black economic composition, white residents reporting more negative views where the local African American community is poorer.

T1  - Europe against the Roma
AN  - 1512220834; 201408794
AB  - The ancient hatred of Roma minorities is now being compounded in Europe by a post-austerity fear of the destitute 'scrounger'. Romani communities, many consisting of those forced by market economics and far-right politics to flee westwards from former 'eastern bloc' countries, facilitated in the latter 2000s by the free movement enabled by accession to the EU, now find themselves the victims of open hostility to 'foreigners' and state-sponsored removal. The author examines the variations of anti-Roma prejudice and state strategies in southern, eastern and western Europe, which send the Roma from pillar to post.

T1  - The Racial Gap in Confidence in Science: Explanations and Implications
AN  - 1748866182; 201600277
AB  - African Americans, compared to Whites, are starkly underrepresented in scientific and technological professions, are especially reluctant to participate as research subjects, and they express attitudes that are skeptical of science and scientific institutions. This article seeks to explain the racial gap in confidence in science (race being socially defined), putting to empirical test explanations suggested by research on human capital, inequality in educational opportunity, and culture. The results show that differential returns to schooling account for about a third of the racial divide, with various cultural mechanisms explaining most of the balance.

T1  - A "Subterranean Agenda"? Racial Attitudes, Presidential Evaluations, and Tea Party Membership
AN  - 1494749802; 201403152
AB  - Recent research suggests that fiscally conservative policy preferences and disapproval of President Obama are significant predictors of Tea Party membership (Maxwell and Parent 2012). Unfortunately, however, we know very little about the reasons why Tea Party members so aggressively disapprove of President Obama. While Tea Party members adamantly deny that President Obama's race plays any role in their motivations, their critics argue that racial attitudes are a primary reason why individuals choose to join the movement. In this article, using national survey data conducted by Knowledge Networks (n = 1649), we explore the possibility that three unique racial attitudes have been influential in the establishment of the Tea Party. Specifically, we investigate the role of symbolic racism, racial stereotypes, and ethnocentrism as predictors of self-identified Tea Party membership among whites. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1433108442
AB  - Research on human and civil rights has only rarely addressed people's attitudes toward disability rights in the context of American society. This study was designed to gain a better understanding of why certain individuals might oppose expanded rights for people who have disabilities. Pearson's correlations revealed that individuals high on social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) were more likely to reject rights for persons with intellectual and physical disabilities than individuals scoring lower on these factors. Structural equation analyses indicated that both SDO and RWA are directly implicated in opposition to expanded rights for these groups. Moreover, the effects of SDO on rights attitudes appear to be mediated through internal motivation to respond without prejudice.

T1  - A review of the challenges of achieving the goals in the African Plan of Action for people with disabilities in Nigeria
AN  - 1417526942; 201331889
AB  - The Plan of Action (POA) document was produced at the Pan-African Conference on African Decade of Persons with Disabilities attended by representatives of all African countries in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (4-7 February 2002). The POA is aimed at implementing priority activities to enhance the services provided to Africans with disabilities during the decade by formulating and implementing meaningful policies and programmes, creating national disability service coordination committees, supporting community-based service delivery, developing poverty alleviation programmes, enhancing preventive programmes, and promoting positive attitudes and awareness of the needs of people with disabilities. While the goals of the POA are noble, evidence raises concerns about the actions so far taken by the Nigerian Government to ensure the implementation of the programme for the benefit of citizens with disabilities. Obstacles to implementing the provisions of the POA document and the implications for strategies that could facilitate the achievement of the goals of the POA are discussed.

T1  - Intergroup Threat and Outgroup Attitudes: Macro-level Symbolic Threat Increases Prejudice Against Gay Men
AN  - 1504422883; 201405314
AB  - Two studies examined the impact of macrolevel symbolic threat on intergroup attitudes. In Study 1 (N = 71), participants exposed to a macrosymbolic threat (vs. nonsymbolic threat and neutral topic) reported less support toward social policies concerning gay men, an outgroup whose stereotypes implies a threat to values, but not toward welfare recipients, a social group whose stereotypes do not imply a threat to values. Study 2 (N = 78) showed that, whereas macrolevel symbolic threat led to less favorable attitudes toward gay men, macroeconomic threat led to less favorable attitudes toward Asians, an outgroup whose stereotypes imply an economic threat. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for understanding the role of a general climate of threat in shaping intergroup attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - From extreme emotions to extreme actions: Explaining non-normative collective action and reconciliation
AN  - 1417521426; 201331893
AB  - A key argument of Dixon et al. in the target article is that prejudice reduction through intergroup contact and collective action work in opposite ways. We argue for a complementary approach focusing on extreme emotions to understand why people turn to non-normative collective action and to understand when and under what conditions extreme emotions may influence positive effects of contact on reconciliation.

T1  - Romaphobia Among Serbian Adolescents: The Role of National In-group Attitudes and Perceived Threat
AN  - 1283642562; 201303381
AB  - This study employed the integrated threat theory to examine Serbian adolescents' attitudes towards the Roma. The sample consisted of 687 secondary school students (mean age 17), of whom 53% were females. In a survey-based study, we assessed adolescents' national in-group attitudes (i.e., nationalism), their feelings toward the Roma, and their perception of economic and symbolic threat. Findings suggest that perceived threat to either real resources or worldviews of the dominant group was related to more negative attitudes towards the Roma minority. Further, Romaphobia was positively related to adolescents' nationalism and this relationship was partially mediated by perceived economic and symbolic threat. The theoretical and educational implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Differentiating Islamophobia: Introducing a New Scale to Measure Islamoprejudice and Secular Islam Critique
AN  - 1283642550; 201305339
AB  - Since 2001 there has been a steadily increasing awareness of discrimination against Muslims based on their religion. Despite the widespread use of the neologism Islamophobia to refer to this phenomenon, this term has been harshly criticized for confounding prejudiced views of Muslims with a legitimate critique of Muslim practices based on secular grounds. In the current research a scale was developed to differentiate Islamoprejudice (based on the influential Islamophobia definition of the British Runnymede Trust) and Secular Critique of Islam. Across two studies, Islamoprejudice was related to explicit and implicit prejudice, right-wing authoritarianism, and social dominance orientation whereas Secular Critique was unrelated to any forms of prejudice but negatively related to religiosity and authoritarianism. The two scales were mostly independent or only moderately related. Importantly, the new Islamoprejudice scale outperformed all other scales in predicting actual opposition versus support for a heatedly debated, newly built mosque. These results demonstrate the necessity to differentiate between Islamoprejudice and Secular Critique in future research on attitudes towards Islam. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Imagining intergroup contact is more cognitively difficult for people higher in intergroup anxiety but this does not detract from its effectiveness
AN  - 1283641070; 201303092
AB  - Imagined intergroup contact (Crisp & Turner, 2009) is a new indirect contact strategy for promoting tolerance and more positive intergroup attitudes. We asked whether the positive effects of imagined contact are contingent upon characteristics that define the experience of intergroup relations. Specifically, we tested whether precontact intergroup anxiety makes imagining contact more cognitively effortful, and if it does, whether this detracts from its effectiveness. In two studies participants were asked to either imagine contact with an outgroup member or a control scene. We found that imagining contact counteracted the negative impact of intergroup anxiety on outgroup communicative behavior. Furthermore, performance on an ostensibly unrelated Stroop task revealed that this compensatory benefit requires cognitive resources proportional to the level of precontact anxiety. We conclude that the detrimental impacts of intergroup anxiety can be assuaged by imagining contact, but that doing so requires the allocation of attentional resources proportional to the positivity of preintervention contact experiences.

T1  - Racial Respect and Racial Socialization as Protective Factors for African American Male Youth
AN  - 1125219707; 201240387
AB  - African American adolescents must negotiate the transition to adulthood in a society that makes the achievement of positive cultural identity and self-respect difficult. Frequently, young men turn to violence in an attempt to achieve respect in their communities. This article explores factors that predict the use of violence among African American male youth. Adolescents from 14 through 18 years of age who completed a written survey in group settings in Oregon included 100 youth who were detained in the juvenile justice system and 100 who were members of a community youth development program. A history of witnessing violence strongly predicted the intensity of violent behavior of study youth; however, endorsing positive attitudes toward racial respect significantly moderated the effects of chronic exposure to violence. Additionally, racial socialization was negatively correlated to violence intensity and was marginally significant in moderating the effects of witnessing violence. Implications for practice with male African American youth are highlighted. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright The Association of Black Psychologists.]

T1  - Exploring Teachers' Racial Attitudes in a Racially Transitioning Society
AN  - 1023031264; 201223841
AB  - The growing diversity of America's public school enrollment makes it essential that all teachers be prepared for teaching students from diverse backgrounds. This paper explores the racial attitudes of teachers, specifically probing whether, and if so how, they may differ across schools of different student racial contexts. In particular, this paper compares how diverse or segregated schools, conceptualized in three different ways, may impact teachers' racial attitudes and awareness. Teachers' racial attitudes may influence teacher behavior towards students of different racial backgrounds, and relate to other aspects of professional behavior and decision-making. School racial context, particularly racial stability, was found to be an important predictor of teachers' racial attitudes. This paper illuminates important patterns to consider and study further as the racial composition continues to become more diverse and school racial contexts become more complex in terms of composition, stability, and in relation to district composition.

T1  - Quantitative Evidence of the Continuing Significance of Race: Tableside Racism in Full-Service Restaurants
AN  - 1081863362; 201235190
AB  - Despite popular claims that racism and discrimination are no longer salient issues in contemporary society, members of racially underrepresented groups continue to experience disparate treatment in everyday public interactions. The context of full-service restaurants is one such public setting wherein African Americans, in particular, encounter racial prejudices and discriminatory treatment. To further understand the pervasiveness of such anti-Black attitudes and actions within the restaurant context, this article analyzes primary survey data derived from a community sample of servers (N = 200). Participants were asked a series of questions ascertaining information about the racial climate of their workplaces. Findings reveal substantial server negativity toward African Americans' tipping and dining behaviors. Racialized discourse and discriminatory behaviors are also shown to be quite common in the restaurant context. The anti-Black attitudes and actions that the authors document in this research are illustrative of the continuing significance of race in contemporary society, and the authors encourage further research on this relatively neglected area of inquiry.

T1  - Sexual Minority Youth Victimization and Social Support: The Intersection of Sexuality, Gender, Race, and Victimization
AN  - 1283641906; 201303265
AB  - In comparison to heterosexual youth, sexual minority youth are more likely to experience victimization. Multiple studies have connected anti-gay prejudice and anti-gay victimization to negative outcomes. Research shows that social support may protect sexual minorities from the harmful effects of anti-gay victimization. However, rates of victimization and the negative outcomes linked to sexual identity within the sexual minority community have been relatively unexplored. Using data from three years of statewide data from heterosexual and sexual minority adolescents in grades 9-12, this study examines victimization, substance use, suicidality, and access to social support by sexuality. Results indicate that sexual minority youth are at increased risk for victimization, substance use, suicidality, and social isolation compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Results also indicate that there is very little bivariate difference within the sexual minority community. Multivariate results indicate differences among sexual minorities' experiences with victimization and substance use. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - No Room for New Families? A Field Experiment Measuring Rental Discrimination against Same-Sex Couples and Single Parents
AN  - 925712460; 201204163
AB  - We suggest that new forms of family households, especially same-sex couples and single parents, are likely to face discrimination in their interactions with rental markets. Following the contact hypothesis, we hypothesize that the geographic distribution of discrimination is likely to vary. Specifically, in places with more new family households we are likely to find less discrimination against these households. We investigate these issues in the metropolitan area of Vancouver, Canada, through analysis of 1,669 inquiries made about one- and two-bedroom apartments. Using a field experimental design similar to audit studies, we analyze landlord responses to five different two-person household scenarios, including one heterosexual couple, two same-sex couples, and two single parents. Evidence suggests that male same-sex couples, single mothers, and single fathers all face significant discrimination relative to heterosexual couples. The contact hypothesis was supported for male same-sex couples, but not for single parents. This could indicate that single parents are facing discrimination primarily based upon their economic marginalization rather than other forms of prejudice. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Inside the Opponent's Head: Perceived Losses in Group Position Predict Accuracy in Metaperceptions Between Groups
AN  - 1347780815; 201318371
AB  - Members of groups in conflict typically perceive the same reality in opposing ways. We investigated individuals' ability to accurately perceive out-group members' views of the conflict. Drawing on research on power and metaperceptions, we hypothesized that perceiving losses to in-group position would increase accuracy in predicting out-group members' views. Study 1 was conducted immediately following the Gaza flotilla incident. Israelis, who perceived the event as causing political losses to their group, were more accurate in predicting out-group members' views of the incident than were Palestinians, who perceived the event as causing political gains for their group. Moreover, Israelis' accuracy increased with their perception of political losses for Israel, whereas Palestinians' accuracy decreased with their perception of political gains for Palestinians. These effects were particularly pronounced among those participants who were highly identified with their group. Study 2 replicated the relationship between perceived losses and accuracy, and demonstrated that it could not be accounted for by factors such as education, political orientation, or empathy.

T1  - Intergroup Conflict in Russia: Testing the Group Position Model
AN  - 907924802; 201124584
AB  - The group position model (Blumer 1958; Bobo and Than 2006) assumes that attempting to secure a privileged position for the ingroup is a main determinant of perceived intergroup conflict. This assumption is tested with survey data collected in 1999 and 2000 among eight titular groups in autonomous republics of the Russian Federation. The survey included an experiment that was aimed at disentangling the effects of perceived threat and the fear of outgroup encroachment (growing outgroup influence). The findings indicate that more conflict was perceived when the ingroup was larger (corresponding to stronger entitlement claims to privilege), especially among those who felt more threatened. This association was further strengthened among those whose fear of outgroup encroachment was made salient. This study shows the relevance of the group position model in understanding perceived intergroup conflict among national minority groups with a local privileged status.

T1  - Towards a Social Psychology of Citizenship? Introduction to the Special Issue
AN  - 919902928; 201201503
AB  - The concept of citizenship is currently the subject of extensive, and often heated, debate on the part of policy makers and social scientists. Many of the key concerns encapsulated in the idea of citizenship -- collective identity, solidarity, pro-social behaviour, group boundaries, intra and intergroup conflict -- also represent longstanding concerns on the part of social and community psychologists. However, at present, very little psychological theory or research directly addresses the subject of citizenship. The aim of this Special Issue is to explore how the construct of citizenship might contribute to social psychological understandings of social conflict and solidarity and, conversely, to consider how existing social psychological theories and methods might contribute to contemporary understandings of citizenship. The authors of the six articles in the Special Issue apply a range of theoretical perspectives (self-categorization theory, social identity theory, rhetorical psychology, the theory of social representations) and methods (experiments, surveys, interviews, ethnography) to examine situated understandings of citizenship in a variety of domains (civic and political participation, immigration attitudes, minority identities, nationalism). Despite their different approaches, the authors display a common concern to recognize complexity, contradiction and contestability as inherent, and often productive, features of the everyday construction and performance of citizenship. As a consequence, social psychological perspectives may have the potential to restore the damaged reputation of the citizen currently apparent in much policy and social scientific discourse.

T1  - Recent advances in intergroup contact theory
AN  - 1417524805; 201332225
AB  - Recent advances in intergroup contact theory and research are reviewed. A meta-analysis with 515 studies and more than 250,000 subjects demonstrates that intergroup contact typically reduces prejudice (mean r = -.21). Allport's original conditions for optimal contact -- equal status, common goals, no intergroup competition, and authority sanction -- facilitate the effect but are not necessary conditions. There are other positive outcomes of intergroup contact, such as greater trust and forgiveness for past transgressions. These contact effects occur not only for ethnic groups but also for such other groups as homosexuals, the disabled and the mentally ill. Intergroup friendship is especially important. Moreover, these effects typically generalize beyond the immediate outgroup members in the situation to the whole outgroup, other situations, and even to other outgroups not involved in the contact. They also appear to be universal -- across nations, genders, and age groups. The major mediators of the effect are basically affective: reduced anxiety and empathy. And even indirect contact reduces prejudice -- vicarious contact through the mass media and having a friend who has an outgroup friend. Of course, negative contact occurs -- especially when it is non-voluntary and threatening. Criticisms of the theory and policy implications are also discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

AN  - 881468154; 201117316
AB  - The relationships between the proportion of ethnic minority adolescents in school classes, the proportion and quality of majority-minority friendships and intergroup attitudes were examined using multi-level analysis (N = 2386 adolescents in 117 school classes in the Netherlands). In school classes with high proportions of ethnic minority adolescents, both ethnic majority and ethnic minority adolescents reported more negative out-group attitudes. Moreover, in these school classes, ethnic majority adolescents showed more positive in-group attitudes, whereas ethnic minority adolescents showed less positive in-group attitudes. The proportion of majority-minority friendships was related to less negative out-group attitudes for ethnic majority adolescents only. The quality of majority-minority friendships was related to less negative out-group and in-group attitudes for both the ethnic majority and ethnic minority adolescents. The results are discussed in the light of contact theory and ethnic competition theory. [Copyright Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - The "Obama Effect" and White Racial Attitudes
AN  - 862595549; 201109744
AB  - To what extent did the presidential candidacy and election of Barack Obama affect whites' more general perceptions of African Americans? Responses to survey questions in which respondents were asked to place blacks on scales running from "stupid" to "intelligent" and from "lazy" to "hardworking" revealed that whites' views of blacks' intelligence and work ethic have become somewhat more positive, though whites continued to be rated higher on these attributes than were blacks. The fact that negative stereotypes of blacks were least pronounced among younger whites implies that these stereotypes will continue to fade in the future. These data do not constitute proof positive of an "Obama effect" on whites' racial attitudes, but they are largely consistent with that idea.

T1  - Britney Spears Remained in Russia: Dynamics of Musical Preferences in the Integration of Immigrant Adolescents
AN  - 862595819; 201109624
AB  - This study examined the roles of popular music in the lives of immigrant adolescents from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS -- former Soviet Union) in Israel. Based on 70 in-depth interviews with newly arrived adolescents aged 12-18, our research revealed that these adolescents' musical preferences matched different stages of adaptation to their new country, with different music styles fulfilling different integration needs. During their first two years in Israel, interviewees enthusiastically explored local musical fare. This stage was also characterised by positive attitudes towards their new home & their anticipated integration. In dramatic contrast, the next three to five years were characterised by disappointment with the local culture, accompanied by growing social alienation. Many adolescents found consolation in late-1980s Russian rock music, as texts critical of the Soviet regime helped them express anger & frustration felt as they came of age in new, difficult & often hostile surroundings. It seems, therefore, that, for immigrant adolescents, different types of popular music not only serve as a marker of their evolving cultural identity but also as indicators of social & psychological adaptation.

T1  - "I've Never Looked at Someone and Thought What Colour They Are": Contact Theory and Interracial Friendship in New Zealand
AN  - 1081865044; 201235232
AB  - Little is known about the micro-level social processes that give rise to the 'contact effect', a reduction in levels of prejudice and stereotyping resulting from interpersonal contact between members of different races or ethnic groups. Reporting findings from a qualitative study, this paper challenges the notion that interracial friendships will necessarily lead to empathy and decreased stereotyping. In interviews, Maori and Pakeha (white New Zealanders) describe race as invisible in close friendships, but also as the basis around which a great deal of 'relationship management' occurs. Contradictory discourses of trust and closeness on the one hand, and guardedness and self-regulation on the other, point to the complexity of these relationships. The potential for open communication, exchange of knowledge, reductions in anxiety and threat perception, and the development of affection are thus constrained. The findings suggest that the normative social context along with structures of intergroup relations provide an omnirelevant milieu in which interracial friendships occur and are managed, consequently moderating the effects of contact.

T1  - Challenging the Public Denial of Racism for a Deeper Multiculturalism
AN  - 1081863772; 201235223
AB  - The further development of Australian multiculturalism must squarely address racism, and a primary step must be the acknowledgement of racism. The Challenging Racism Project (2001-2008) data provide a clear picture of the acknowledgement of racism and of Anglo cultural privilege among Australians. Encouragingly, most Australians recognise that racism is a problem in Australian society. A little under half, however, deny that there is Anglo cultural privilege. Perhaps surprisingly, respondents from non-Anglo-Australian backgrounds, including those born in the Middle East and South Asia, were significantly more likely than those from Anglo backgrounds and Australian-born respondents to deny that racial prejudice exists in Australia. Cultural hierarchies of citizenship regulate the acknowledgement of racism, encouraging denial and deflection, and punishing 'complaint' from those more exposed to racism. The broader social pathology identified by this paper is an unevenness in the sense of citizenship across ethnic groups, and addressing this social weakness must be a macro-level ambition for the further development of Australian multiculturalism.

T1  - Gendered Egos: Attitude Functions and Gender as Predictors of Homonegativity
AN  - 835111464; 201100527
AB  - This study used a correlational design with a sample of university students to clarify the relationships between attitude functions and homonegativity with respect to gender. Classic work on attitude functions posits that attitudes serve psychological needs for the attitude holder. Herek (1986b) adapted this theory to explain attitudes toward homosexuality. Herek (1987) identified four functions: ego-defensive (defense of threats to the self), value-expressive (expression of key values), social-expressive (expression of important social norms), and experiential (based on past experiences). Results suggested that men were more likely to attribute their attitudes to the ego-defensive function. Men and women were equally likely to attribute their attitudes to the experiential function. The ego-defensive function was the best predictor of homonegativity for men and women, whether they held generally positive or generally negative attitudes toward homosexuality. The experiential function did not predict homonegativity. Participants tended to be neither very homonegative nor very ego-defensive. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Personality Bases of Ideology: A One-Year Longitudinal Study
AN  - 764425730; 201064481
AB  - The cross-lagged effects of the Big-Five personality dimensions on Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) were examined over 1 year (N = 112). Consistent with the Dual Process Cognitive-Motivational Model, SDO and RWA exhibited markedly different personality bases. Low Agreeableness and unexpectedly high Extraversion predicted change in the motivational goal for group-based dominance and superiority (SDO), whereas Openness to Experience predicted change in the motivational goal for social cohesion and collective security (RWA). Neuroticism and Conscientiousness did not predict change in SDO or RWA over time. These findings extend previous cross-sectional (correlational) research and indicate that key dimensions of personality (primarily Agreeableness and Openness to Experience) are an important temporal antecedent of the group-based motivational goals underlying individual differences in prejudice.

T1  - Prejudice: rethinking geographies of oppression
AN  - 758129750; 201059867
AB  - Despite equal opportunities legislation in many western societies, overt prejudice against minority groups is still evident. Yet, despite the persistence of equality issues, 'prejudice' is a term that is not widely employed in geography because of its association with a particular history of meaning within social psychology. In this paper I explore the concept of prejudice and its relationship to geographical research on discrimination and oppression. Then using original empirical research in three communities I examine how prejudice is justified and articulated by majority people. In doing so, I explore the complex intersectionalities of negative attitudes towards specific minority groups and the ways that specific mechanisms of sub-ordination can reinforce and support one another.

T1  - System-perpetuating asymmetries between explicit and implicit intergroup attitudes among indigenous and non-indigenous Chileans
AN  - 758124405; 201056774
AB  - The present research demonstrates a dissociation between explicit and implicit intergroup evaluation in the reciprocal attitudes between indigenous (Mapuche) and non-indigenous Chileans. In both social groups, the explicit measures of attitudes towards the respective in-group and out-group were compared with the Implicit Association Test scores. The results indicate that the members of the low-status minority might explicitly express a moderate evaluative preference for their in-group but might implicitly devalue it. Conversely, the members of the high-status majority might implicitly devalue their out-group but might explicitly express no bias. These results are theoretically framed in terms of system justification, conventional stereotypes and motivated correction processes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Culturally Distinctive and Academic Socialization: Direct and Interactive Relationships with African American Adolescents' Academic Adjustment
AN  - 204636738; 20084565
AB  - Theories of ethnic minority development have largely suggested that African American parents engage in a combination of practices that include culturally distinctive socialization as well as behaviors that are characteristic of more universal forms of academic socialization. However, few studies have examined how these socialization dimensions interact to influence the academic adjustment of African American adolescents. The current study explored the independent and interactive roles of parental academic and culturally distinctive socialization on the academic adjustment of African American adolescents. The sample was comprised 144 African American adolescents (M = 12.4; SD = 1.14; 56% female). Findings provided partial support that cultural and academic socialization were independently associated with indicators of academic adjustment. However, the interaction between these dimensions also was associated with youths' adjustment in the academic domain. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]
