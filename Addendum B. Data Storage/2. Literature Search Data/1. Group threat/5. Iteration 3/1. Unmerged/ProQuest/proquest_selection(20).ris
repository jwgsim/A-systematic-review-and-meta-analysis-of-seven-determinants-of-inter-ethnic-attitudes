T1  - Mapping principal dimensions of prejudice in the United States
AN  - 2681521756
AB  - Research is often guided by maps of elementary dimensions, such as core traits, foundations of morality, and principal stereotype dimensions. Yet, there is no comprehensive map of prejudice dimensions. A major limiter of developing a prejudice map is the ad hoc sampling of target groups. We used a broad and largely theory-agnostic selection of groups to derive a map of principal dimensions of expressed prejudice in contemporary American society. Across a series of exploratory and confirmatory studies, we found three principal factors: Prejudice against marginalized groups, prejudice against privileged/conservative groups, and prejudice against unconventional groups (with some inverse loadings for conservative groups). We documented distinct correlates for each factor, in terms of social identifications, perceived threats, personality, and behavioral manifestations. We discuss how the current map integrates several lines of research, and point to novel and underexplored insights about prejudice.

T1  - ‘Look not at what is contrary to propriety’: A meta‐analytic exploration of the association between religiosity and sensitivity to disgust
AN  - 2617655413
AB  - Previous research has suggested that disgust sensitivity contributes to moral self‐regulation. The relationship between religiosity and disgust sensitivity is frequently explored as a moderator of moral‐regulating ideologies, such as conservative and traditional ideologies. However, religiosity is suggested to differ from these in moral attitudes against social dominance and racial prejudice. Psychological theories, such as the societal moral intuition and the evolved hazard‐perception models, have proposed that there could be reasons to support a distinct relationship between religiosity and disgust sensitivity. These reasons relate to the intuitive pursuit of spiritual purity and the non‐secular transcendental emotional‐reward value of moral behaviour for religious individuals. In the present manuscript, we conducted the first dedicated meta‐analytic review between religiosity and disgust sensitivity. We analysed a summary of forty‐seven experimental outcomes, including 48,971 participants. Our analysis revealed a significant positive association (r = .25) between religiosity and disgust sensitivity. This outcome suggests that sensitivity to disgust could have distinct spiritual purity and moral self‐regulatory response value for religious individuals.

T1  - Why Do Immigrant and Swedish Adolescents Engage in Ethnic Victimization? Common and Distinct Underlying Factors
AN  - 2580805930
AB  - Youth of immigrant background are at risk of experiencing victimization due to their ethnic or cultural background. However, limited knowledge is available regarding why youth victimize their immigrant peers, and whether the factors associated with engagement in ethnic victimization vary across adolescents of different background. To address this gap in knowledge, the present study aimed to elucidate the common or differential factors associated with engagement in ethnic victimization among immigrant and native youth. The analytical sample included seventh grade students residing in Sweden from 55 classrooms (N = 963, Mage = 13.11, SD = 0.41; 46% girls; 38% youth of immigrant background). The results showed that being morally disengaged and engaging in general victimization are the common denominators of engagement in ethnic victimization for immigrant and Swedish youth. Low levels of positive attitudes toward immigrants provide a foundation for ethnic victimization among Swedish youth, but not youth of immigrant background. Classroom ethnic composition was not significantly related to engagement in ethnic victimization in either group. Predictors of engagement in ethnic victimization seem to have similarities and differences among immigrant and Swedish youth. The factors involved require further attention in developing strategies to combat bias-based hostile behaviors in diverse school settings.

T1  - How intergroup social connections shape immigrants’ responses to social exclusion: GPIR
AN  - 2513520659
AB  - K. D. Williams (2009) theorized that chronic social exclusion would inescapably lead to a detrimental stage of resignation, characterized by depression, alienation, unworthiness, and helplessness. However, few studies empirically addressed this assumption. Considering immigrants as a population at risk of persistent exclusion, we investigated how social connections with the native-born majority and other immigrant minorities moderate the exclusion–resignation link. In Study 1 (N = 112 asylum seekers), participants mainly connected with other immigrants showed a significant association between chronic exclusion and resignation. Crucially, this link vanished for people with social connections mainly composed of native people. In Study 2, we replicated and extended these results running secondary analyses on a data set of 2,206 immigrants (CILS4EU). This work, suggesting that the exclusion–resignation link can be moderated by social factors, highlighted the relevance of immigrants’ connections with the native majority for counteracting the risk of segregation when tackling the social issue of immigrants’ everyday exclusion.

T1  - Personality traits and public support of minority rights
AN  - 2487091864
AB  - This study investigates how personality relates to citizens’ willingness to extend political, social, and cultural rights for minorities, including voting rights for immigrants, religious rights for Muslims, and affirmative action measures. Moving beyond explanations centred on intergroup relations, we argue that political efficacy (i.e. beliefs about personal political competences and the responsiveness of political elites) operates as a mechanism linking personality and policy preferences on minority rights. We test these arguments using mediation models on data from a large-N survey conducted in Germany in 2016. Results show that high openness, high agreeableness, and low conscientiousness predict permissive views on minority rights. In addition to indirect effects via group-specific attitudes, we find empirical support for substantial links via political efficacy. In particular, people high in conscientiousness or high in neuroticism have lower faith in government responsiveness, which in turn is related to less willingness to approve minority rights.

T1  - Why public health framing matters: An experimental study of the effects of COVID-19 framing on prejudice and xenophobia in the United States
AN  - 2510602542
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a notable increase in the expression of prejudicial and xenophobic attitudes that threaten the wellbeing of minority groups and contribute to the overall public health toll of the virus. However, while there is evidence documenting the growth in discrimination and xenophobia, little is known about how the COVID-19 outbreak is activating the expression of such negative attitudes. The goal of the current paper therefore was to investigate what aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic may be contributing to this rise in expressions of prejudice and xenophobia. More specifically, this study used an experimental design to assess the effects of using stigmatized language to describe the virus as well as the threat to physical health and economic wellbeing posed by the virus on COVID-19 prejudice. Data were collected from a national sample of 1451 adults residing within the United States. Results from 2 × 2 x 2 between-subjects analyses of covariance demonstrated that emphasizing the connection between China and COVID-19, rather than framing the virus neutrally, increased negative attitudes toward Asian Americans, beliefs that resources should be prioritized for Americans rather than immigrants, and general xenophobia. Emphasizing the severity of the economic impact of the virus also increased beliefs that Asian Americans are a threat to resources and general xenophobia. In contrast, messages which emphasized the serious health risks of COVID-19 did not increase bias toward Asian Americans or xenophobia. Our findings suggest that specific types of public health messaging related to infectious diseases, especially framing the virus in terms of its country of origin or its likely economic impact, may elicit prejudice and xenophobia. Public health campaigns that emphasize the severity of the virus, however, are not likely to trigger the same negative attitudes. Implications for public health responses to health crises are discussed.

T1  - Smoker identity and resistance to antismoking campaigns: The role of group entitativity: GPIR
AN  - 2473715923
AB  - Past works have shown that identification with smokers predicts increased resistance to antismoking campaigns. In this research, we hypothesized that group entitativity, because it affects the extent to which people feel committed to act for their group, can mitigate this link. We conducted two studies with convenient samples of smokers that both included a measure of identification and measured (Study 1) or manipulated (Study 2) entitativity. Then, participants read an antismoking message and, finally, reported their attitude toward smoking (Studies 1 and 2), as well as their urge to smoke and intention to quit (Study 2). Consistently, both studies revealed more resistance among high (vs. low) identifiers, but only when they perceived smokers as a highly entitative group. These findings emphasized the importance of group processes and social identity factors for accounting for responses to antismoking information.

T1  - Radicalization and violent extremism: Perspectives from research on group processes and intergroup relations: GPIR
AN  - 2466740292
AB  - Radicalization and violent extremism leading to violent protests, repression, and terrorist attacks constitute important issues in our world. Social psychological group processes and intergroup dynamics play a key role in creating resilience against or facilitating the path towards violent extremism. The present body of work brings together and furthers our understanding of these factors by integrating insights from other fields, most centrally political science. In this introductory article, we summarize the state of the literature and suggest a social psychological research agenda for studying radicalization and violent extremism. This agenda (a) focuses on how the radicalization process commences and festers in ordinary people; (b) is ambitious in bringing research into the real world with protesters, the repressed, and groups engaged in conflict; (c) is pragmatic in measuring outcomes of interest; and (d) applies field experimental methodology, among other methodologies. With this perspective, we argue, social psychology is ideally positioned for a new decade of impactful research into radicalization and violent extremism.

T1  - Evaluation and Revision of an Instrument Measuring Attitudes toward the Amish
AN  - 2439231661
AB  - The attitudes non-members hold toward the Amish—or any ethnic, racial, and religious group—has consequences for that population, from criminal victimization to an ability to exercise human rights. Given their rapid growth and expansion in North America, an effective tool is needed to measure public attitudes toward the Amish. William McGuigan recently led the development of an Attitudes Toward the Amish (ATA) instrument, which was tested in northwestern Pennsylvania. In using the ATA in northeastern Missouri, we encountered problems with the instrument’s operational validity: no significant differences were found in the responses between a university undergraduate population of largely urban/suburban origin and the local rural population when we would otherwise expect differences. We revised the instrument and administered it to the same populations. Of the 16 items in the revised version, 14 were significantly different at the p < .05 level. A factor analysis revealed four components with face validity. Based on these results, we offer the Revised ATA (RATA) as an improved instrument and make recommendations for designing instruments intended to measure attitudes toward outgroups.

T1  - Self-uncertainty and group identification: A meta-analysis: GPIR
AN  - 2407985479
AB  - A key prediction of uncertainty-identity theory is that under conditions of high self-uncertainty, people will identify more strongly with their group. This has been supported by numerous studies. To quantify this relationship, a meta-analysis was conducted on 35 studies from 30 papers (N = 4,657). The relationship between self-uncertainty and group identification varied significantly as a function of how psychologically real the uncertainty was, as reflected in how uncertainty was operationalized and how the study was conducted. Self-uncertainty operationalized as social identity uncertainty had the strongest relationship with identification (r = −.26, 6.8% variance accounted for), followed by indirect operationalization of self-uncertainty (r = .23, 5.3% variance accounted for), and direct operationalization of self-uncertainty (r = .14, 2.0% variance accounted for). The relationship did not differ between measured self-uncertainty (r = −.13, 1.7% variance accounted for) and manipulated self-uncertainty (r = .17, 2.9% variance accounted for). Implications and future directions are discussed.

T1  - Searching for a Roommate: A Correspondence Audit Examining Racial/Ethnic and Immigrant Discrimination among Millennials
AN  - 2474445826
AB  - Survey research finds that millennials have less prejudiced views of racial/ethnic minorities than other generations, leading some to label millennials as postracial. However, attitudinal survey research may be subject to social desirability bias because it documents statements or beliefs instead of actions. Moreover, most audit studies focus on people who make hiring decisions or own rental property and are therefore often older than millennials. This study uses a correspondence audit to investigate discrimination among millennials via “roommate wanted” advertisements. We sent over 4,000 emails and found a tiered pattern of discrimination against Asian (Indian and Chinese), Hispanic, and Black room-seekers. However, whether Asian and Hispanic room-seekers face significant discrimination varies based on whether they use predominantly White first names or traditional first names. Our findings shed light on the future of our racial system, expand our knowledge of discrimination beyond the traditional Black/White binary, and illustrate the persistence of anti-Blackness.

T1  - From hierarchy to rivalry: Asian candidate evaluation in changing racial contexts
AN  - 2310132601
AB  - Existing studies on candidate evaluation have posited that racial cues would invoke negative attitudes toward outgroups, thus lowering support for minority candidates. However, recent studies have found that even implicit racial cues show no negative effect but actually work positively in favor of the minority candidates. In this study, I explore this puzzle by setting up a survey experiment that pairs an Asian candidate against competitors with varying racial backgrounds. Consistent with the existing evidence, I found that White voters tend to support an Asian candidate to a greater degree than a co‐ethnic, White competitor. However, departing from the previous studies that have explained this tendency as a reward for model minority, I argue that such a pattern is associated with reaffirming Whites’ ingroup identity in a racial hierarchy by compensating minorities. When the apparent racial hierarchy—White versus non‐White—is replaced with a minority‐only context, Whites no longer need to favor an Asian candidate and divide their support more evenly to the two minority candidates. I further show that this tendency is moderated by the intensity of their ingroup attitudes.

T1  - Justice reactions to deviant ingroup members: Ingroup identity threat motivates utilitarian punishments
AN  - 2301338563
AB  - To maintain a positive overall view of their group, people judge likeable ingroup members more favourably and deviant ingroup members more harshly than comparable outgroup members. Research suggests that such derogation of deviant ingroup members aims to restore the image of the group by symbolically excluding so‐called ‘black sheeps’. We hypothesized that information about a harm‐doer's group membership influences observers’ justice‐seeking reactions. Motives for punishment vary based on whether the goal is to punish past harm‐doing (i.e., retributive motives), help harm‐doers recognize the harm inflicted and reintegrate into society (i.e., restorative motives), or control harm‐doer's future behaviour through incapacitating practices and exclusion from society (i.e., utilitarian motives). We hypothesized that immoral behaviours by ingroup rather than outgroup members jeopardize the group's reputation and therefore activate utilitarian (i.e., exclusion‐oriented) motives for punishment. Study 1 (N = 187) confirmed that people displayed more utilitarian motives and less restorative motives when sanctioning an ingroup as opposed to an outgroup harm‐doer. Study 2 (N = 122) manipulated typicality to the ingroup. Participants displayed stronger utilitarian (i.e., exclusion‐oriented) punishment motives when the harm‐doer was presented as a typical ingroup rather than an outgroup member. Study 3 (N = 292) replicated the findings of Studies 1 and 2 and further showed that people displayed stronger utilitarian punishments against an ingroup offender through the experience of increased identity threat. Contrary to our expectations, observers’ ingroup identification did not moderate the effect of group membership or typicality to the ingroup on justice reactions. Yet, ingroup identification influenced both experienced identity threat (i.e., mediator) and utilitarian motives for punishment with high identifiers experiencing higher threat and displaying stronger utilitarian punishment motive. We discuss the results in terms of people's concern for the protection of their group identity.

T1  - On the Descriptive and Expressive Function of Derogatory Group Labels: An Experimental Test
AN  - 2289483358
AB  - By using a pseudoword paradigm, we tested whether derogatory labels (e.g., pejorative labels addressing group members) differed from category labels and general slur in their descriptive (i.e., pointing to group membership) and expressive functions (i.e., perceived offensiveness and social acceptability). Results indicated that derogatory labels were similar to category labels in their descriptive function, and had higher expressive function than slurs. Participants’ prejudice toward the groups that were targets of derogatory label reduced their perceived offensiveness than in turn increased their social acceptability.

T1  - Sport and peacebuilding in post-conflict societies: the role of Open Fun Football Schools in Kosovo
TT  - Sport and peacebuilding in post-conflict societies
AN  - 2246112641
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to fill the gap in the research literature on how sport can be used more productively as a peacebuilding device in post-conflict countries.Design/methodology/approachThis paper uses interviewing method that includes both semi-structured and unstructured interviews with trainers, instructors and children involved in implementing Open Fun Football Schools (OFFSs) in Kosovo.FindingsFindings show that OFFSs have played a vital role in peacebuilding in Kosovo by bringing together people from different ethnic backgrounds in Kosovo, which contributed to social inclusion of Albanians and Serbs, and other communities by changing their initial attitudes toward one another.Research limitations/implicationsThe main research limitation is the usage of semi-structured and unstructured questionnaires instead of structured questionnaires, which would provide more generalized conclusions about the OFFSs. More research is needed on this topic to investigate the effect of similar programs in other country contexts.Practical implicationsThe most important practical implication of the research is that conflict mitigation through football sports programs and activities can be used in other similar contexts by donors and the international community. OFFSs offer a hope for peacebuilding, and if adequately implemented can contribute to peacebuilding in post-conflict societies similar to Kosovo’s context. The positive attitude changes as a result of participation in the OFFS programs shows that these joint programs can promote better ethnic relations. There is a need for the expansion of such programs to reach more people.Originality/valueThe study provides an original contribution as there has been almost no prior research which actually measured the effects of OFFSs on change of youth attitudes through the integrated sport programs with different ethnicity in Kosovo.

T1  - “They've conspired against us”: Understanding the role of social identification and conspiracy beliefs in justification of ingroup collective behavior
AN  - 2133256884
AB  - The present research investigates conditions under which beliefs in conspiracy theories predict the desire to justify ingroup behavior in the context of intergroup conflict. We propose that within the context of Ukraine's intergroup conflict over the annexation of Crimea, supporters (but not opponents) of the “Euromaidan” social movement are likely to validate protesters’ collective actions as just to the extent that they believe that the authorities are engaged in annexation‐related conspiracies. We also examine the moderating role of perceived political corruption in these processes. Using a public opinion survey of 315 Ukrainians, we found support for our hypothesized moderated mediation model—identification with “Euromaidan” increased beliefs in the annexation‐related conspiracy theories, which in turn, increased justification of protesters’ actions in the setting of intergroup conflict. However, this mediation was only observed among those supporters of the Euromaidan who perceived political corruption to be at a low or average level.

T1  - The dynamic relations between economic conditions and anti-immigrant sentiment: A natural experiment in times of the European economic crisis
AN  - 1950778094
AB  - Theories on intergroup relations suggest that negative attitudes toward immigrants tend to rise when economic conditions deteriorate. However, these arguments were mostly tested during times of economic prosperity in Europe. We put this theoretical expectation to test by analyzing two rounds of the European Social Survey (ESS) with data from 14 West European immigration countries before (2006) and after (2010) the peak of the European economic crisis. Results show that anti-immigrant sentiments increased in countries where perceptions of economic insecurity also increased. Anti-immigrant sentiments decreased in countries where perceptions of economic insecurity declined. In contrast, changes in objective economic conditions (i.e. unemployment rates) during the same period of time did not display the expected effects in a similarly robust way.

T1  - What's the Difference? Access to Health Insurance and Care for Immigrant Children in the US
AN  - 1938528647
AB  - Children in immigrant families are especially inﬂuenced by gaps in insurance coverage and access to healthcare services (BeLue et al., 2014; Brown et al., 1999), but extant literature focuses primarily on disparities between aggregate racial/ethnic groups, without consideration of immigrant generation status (Burgos et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2015). When researchers examine multiple measures of health access that affect health outcomes such as insurance coverage, sources of regular care, delays or difficulties with getting care, etc., few compare disparities across multiple measures of access (Brown et al., 2009). The Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) was designed to improve access to healthcare for children in the United States by expanding insurance coverage to millions of American families. The ACA additionally includes many provisions to improve access to healthcare services (e.g. minimum benefit requirements for insurance plans, free preventative screenings, measures to increase the paediatric healthcare workforce, and extension of the CHIP programme)(Emanuel, 2014). Despite the new law, a large proportion of immigrant children and children of immigrants continue to remain outside the scope of coverage, especially in the short-term (BeLue et al., 2014; Pandey et al., 2014). We analyse whether disparities regarding insurance coverage differ from disparities in service access according to race, ethnicity, and immigrant-generation status, demonstrating incongruities that inform interventions to reduce barriers that block children from accessing the American healthcare system.

T1  - Commentary on: Sexual and Gender Minority Health Disparities as a Social issue: How Stigma and Intergroup Relations Can Explain and Reduce Health Disparities
AN  - 1940969616
AB  - The broadly defined field of stigma research has made enormous advances since the watershed moment created by the publication of Goffman's (1963) influential essay. Advances have been made in the conceptualization of what stigma is, how stigmatizing circumstances differ one from another and what the origins of stigma are thought to be. Beyond this useful expansion of concepts has been a robust development of methods aimed at operationalizing important stigma dimensions. In this commentary I point out how several of the papers in this special issue further elaborate and deepen the concepts and measures that have developed since Goffman. But this special issue goes further by bringing an intergroup relations orientation to bear in a focused way. Like other major advances such as concepts and theories associated with "minority stress" and "structural stigma" the current project portends a new set of lenses for further understanding the origins and consequences of stigma.

T1  - Perceived racial discrimination, heavy episodic drinking, and alcohol abstinence among African American and White college students
AN  - 1933966454
AB  - Previous research has demonstrated that White college students are more likely to drink alcohol at a greater frequency and quantity compared to their African American counterparts. Examining race-related factors that structure alcohol use among college students remains an important area of research. In this study, we specifically examine perceived discrimination and its association with both heavy episodic drinking (HED) and alcohol abstinence among college students. Items that measured perceived racial discrimination in alcohol use contexts and demographic characteristics were used as independent and control variables. African American students were more likely to abstain from alcohol and less likely to engage in HED compared to their White counterparts. Results also suggest that students who believe their drinking will solicit race-based police bias have lower odds of engaging in HED and greater odds of alcohol abstention. We conclude that unsolicited policing, experienced by African Americans generally, and White Americans on campuses, explains effect sizes.

T1  - Why Do People from Low-Status Groups Support Class Systems that Disadvantage Them? A Test of Two Mainstream Explanations in Malaysia and Australia
AN  - 1878226280
AB  - The recent global recession revealed a huge social-class divide between the economic outcomes of the affluent and their less endowed counterparts. Although this divide has bred social unrest in some societies, in many others such disturbances have been absent. Two mainstream theories of intergroup relations offer competing propositions for this paradox. System-justification theory (SJT) proposes that people from lower status groups are most likely to support class systems that disadvantage them when their group interests are weak. In contrast, we put forward an explanation based on social identity theory (SIT) that proposes that class-system justification is an identity-management strategy that should be most apparent amongst individuals from lower-status groups when group interests are strong. Results from three experiments (combined N = 626), conducted in Malaysia and Australia, which varied subjective social class, provided stronger support for the SIT-based explanation that lower-status individuals endorse societal class systems more strongly when group interests are strong (Studies 1 a-b) and when the class system is perceived to be unstable in the long-term (Study 2).

T1  - What Would I Know About Mercy? Faith and Optimistic Expectancies Among African Americans
AN  - 1872753533
AB  - A small body of research has begun to explore the association between faith and optimism among African Americans. However, missing from the extant work is an examination of the extent to which traditional indices of religious commitment work together with beliefs about God to shape optimism. The present study examines the utility of indices of social location, religious commitment (i.e., early and current religious service attendance, subjective religiosity), belief about the quality of one's relationship with God (i.e., a belief that one is connected to a loving God), and beliefs about being the recipient of divine forgiveness for predicting dispositional optimism among a sample of community residing African American adults (N = 241). Age, subjective religiosity, and organizational religiosity were positively related to optimism in bivariate analyses. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated a significant association between age, subjective religiosity, and optimism; however, those associations were eliminated once relationship with God and belief in one's forgiveness by God were entered into the model. Only belief in God's love predicted optimism in multivariate analyses. Serial mediation analyses revealed that beliefs about the quality of one's relationship with God and belief in divine forgiveness fully mediated the relationship between subjective religiosity and optimism, but that the relationship is driven largely by relationship with God. Implications of these findings are discussed.

T1  - Young Africans' representations of the origins of same-sex attraction and implications for sexual and mental health
AN  - 1867554350
AB  - Sexual minorities are stigmatised in much of sub-Saharan Africa, restricting their access to sexual health services and undermining their mental health. Although public attitudes and social representations inform the experience of sexual stigma, little is known about how young Africans make sense of sexual diversity. We conducted a thematic analysis of 56 texts contributed by young people from 10 countries in response to a prompt in a scriptwriting competition inviting participants to 'tell a story about someone who is attracted to people of the same sex'. We analysed accounts of the origins of same-sex attraction, a prominent theme in the narratives. Two-thirds of the texts provide an explicit or implicit explanation, presenting same-sex attraction as innate (15/38) and/or the consequence of environmental influences (32/38), including parental behaviour, gender separation, trauma, foreign influences and evil spirits. Expressions of the potential to avert or cure same-sex attraction are common. Young people's sense-making around sexual diversity draws on available sociocultural and symbolic resources, some of which may be highly stigmatising, and reflects local, national and transnational influences. The need to explain same-sex attraction and the preponderance of harmful explanatory frameworks compounds sexual minority youth's vulnerability to sexual stigma, harmful coping strategies and mental health challenges.

T1  - Ethnicity and Sexual Attitudes Affect Women's Judgments of Sexual Victimization Risk
AN  - 1857963163
AB  - This study evaluated the effects of ethnicity, sexual attitudes, and sexual victimization history on women's judgments of sexual victimization risk in a set of dating and social scenarios. An ethnically diverse sample of undergraduate women (n = 408) were asked to rate how risky the situations were in terms of having an unwanted sexual experience. American Indian women rated the situations as more risky than did non-Hispanic White or Hispanic women. In addition, participants with more positive attitudes toward a range of sexual experiences rated the situations as less risky than did women with less positive attitudes. Possible implications are discussed.

T1  - A cross-national examination of prejudice toward immigrants: the role of education and political ideology
AN  - 1823116346
AB  - PurposeMore than ever before, people from around the world are migrating away from their country of birth. Yet citizens of host countries do not always welcome these immigrants – instead, citizens sometimes express prejudice toward them. The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors that influence attitudes toward immigrants cross-nationally.Design/methodology/approachSecondary data from the International Social Survey Programme, which includes data from 30 countries across two time points, were analyzed.FindingsFindings indicate that people with higher level of education tend to have more favorable attitudes toward immigrants, while those with more politically conservative leanings and those with a greater sense of national identity tend to hold more prejudicial attitudes toward immigrants. At the country/regional level, education is consistent in its relationship with more favorable attitudes. However, political conservatism is less consistent in predicting prejudice – the relationship is strong in western democracies, but is largely negligible in other parts of the world.Originality/valueThe present analyses carry implications for improving anti-immigrant prejudice throughout the world.

T1  - Ethnicity without ethnicity: 'I'm beyond that story' state arrangements, re-education and (new) ethnicity in Israel
AN  - 1802902033
AB  - This article examines the connection between state ethnic classifications and the way they are perceived by individuals in everyday life. Using the case of the Boarding School for the Gifted Disadvantaged in Israel which is open to immigrants, an attempt was made to reach an understanding of how individuals who have experienced deliberate state intervention in the ethnic component of their selfhood, experience this intervention years after the (re)construction. The main findings illuminate how boarding school graduates transformed the governmental intervention into a unique ethnic identity for everyday life: 'ethnicity without ethnicity'. This identity rejects any overt engagement with the ethnic component of the concept of self. This identity even relies on the subject's constant reminders to himself that 'he is beyond the ethnic story' and that meritocratic identity (devoid of ethnic consciousness) is preferable to ascriptive identity. The findings also show that ethnic identity is not necessarily expressed in everyday practices (language, food consumption, music, festivals) but rather in ongoing cognitive engagement of the agent distanced from the available official ethnic classifications. The discussion section tracks the state-organizational sources of this ethnic identity and its relation to the unmarked ethnicity amongst the upper-middle classes.

T1  - LIBERALS, CONSERVATIVES, AND LATIN AMERICA: How Ideology Divides Americans over Immigration and Foreign Aid
AN  - 1841362148
AB  - Based on an original US survey, this article argues that, on average, US conservatives today feel substantially cooler toward Latin American countries than liberals do. They also desire massively tougher Mexico border policies and much less foreign aid than liberals do. Averages can hide substantial differences within groups, however. Not all liberals and conservatives are alike, and their differences shape attitudes toward Latin America. For instance, our survey reveals that libertarians and economic conservatives oppose foreign aid to places like Haiti out of a belief in the Protestant ethic of self-help and opposition to income redistribution. Communitarians and economic liberals, by contrast, are more supportive of foreign aid to Haiti. Cultural conservatives fear the impact of Mexican immigration on Christian values and a WASP American national identity more than cultural liberals do. But race and racism continue to divide Americans the most consistently in their attitudes and policy preferences toward Latin America. The policy implications of ideologically divided public opinion for US immigration reform are also addressed.

T1  - Institutional Allyship for LGBT Equality: Underlying Processes and Potentials for Change
AN  - 1793546255
AB  - Discussions of outgroup activism in support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) equality reflect two shortcomings. First, such discussions generally present uncritically positive views of ally activism; second, research on ally activism has overly focused on individual allies. The aim of this article is twofold: to suggest that action toward LGBT equality may often be influenced by sexual prejudice and may thus recapitulate longstanding power dynamics between majority and sexual minority groups, and to expand our understanding of ally behavior beyond individuals by presenting an ethnographic study exploring the development of institutional ally identity in a mainstream church that underwent a marked shift from an explicit anti-LGBT to an expressly LGBT-supportive stance. The study employed critical discourse analysis to examine interview, textual, and participant-observation data. Dimensions of individual and institutional ally activism, and potential pitfalls in each, are explored. Suggestions for promoting more constructive collective action are offered.

T1  - Can online contacts between immigrants and veterans facilitate immigrants' social integration?
AN  - 1790894078
AB  - The current study analyzes whether cross-cultural communication through online social platforms between immigrants from the Former Soviet Union and different sectors of veteran Israelis reduces social distances and facilitates immigrants' integration. The research was conducted through an online survey of 296 Former Soviet Union immigrants who use social media sites in Hebrew. The findings show a positive impact of online contacts, only on social distances toward groups with very different cultures from Former Soviet Union immigrants: Arabs and ultra-orthodox Jews. Online contacts were found not to have a positive impact on social distances between immigrants and veteran Israelis from the dominant culture. In other words, online contact was not found to contribute to the social integration of Former Soviet Union immigrants, but the social media were found to have the potential to narrow cleavages in Israeli society by reducing stigmas and alienation.

T1  - Racial-Ethnic Socialization and Youth Ideological Formations in an Era of Diversity and Inclusion
AN  - 1793655944
AB  - This article introduces a special issue of 
 
  Humanity & Society
  which aims to expand approaches to the development of racial and ethnic minority youths' beliefs regarding the role of race and racism in shaping U.S. society. In this introduction, I highlight the increasingly contradictory nature of our public discourse on race as signaling a unique moment in which taking stock of how racial and ethnic minority youth learn race must be linked more directly to their ideological development. I suggest that at the core of these contradictions is the ethos of individualism which is both a key principle of our national identity and a pillar that sustains the racialized character of our social system. A brief review of two parallel lines of inquiry--the micro-oriented field of race and ethnic socialization and macro-sociological perspectives on the determinants of ideological formations among American Blacks--is offered in support of a call to wed insights from these fields.

T1  - Sharing distress increases helping and contact intentions via social identification and inclusion of the other in the self: Children's prosocial behaviour after an earthquake: GPIR
AN  - 1786223640
AB  - We surveyed young children (N = 517) affected by two major earthquakes to shed light on the role of identity processes in relation to the common observation that disasters can bring survivors closer together and enhance helping amongst them. As expected, posttraumatic stress symptoms caused by the earthquake were positively associated with intentions to have contact with and help other survivors of the earthquake, these effects being sequentially mediated by inclusion of the other in the self and by one-group representation. These findings extend previous research on both the antecedents and the behavioural effects of identity-fusion. The results are also the first quantitative test of a social identity account of collective resilience in children. We argue that these findings have practical as well as theoretical significance, as they demonstrate the adaptive function of group processes in informal responses to disasters.

T1  - NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE
AN  - 1801833398
AB  - This article provides a thematic overview of a subset of controversial officer involved shootings that have occurred in Denver, Colorado during a period of thirty years (1983-2012). Determining whether a shooting was legally justified involved multiple participants, including local, national, and international representatives. The primary stakeholders were City and County District Attorneys regarding whether to file criminal charges against the officer, and Managers of Safety for whether officers acted within police departmental policy. Although most cases were processed without conflict, a small number were challenged by members of the community based on thematic reasons of shooting individuals who had not committed a crime, violating continuum of force standards, and entrusting law enforcement officers with the power to use deadly force both off-duty and while working secondary jobs. Despite outcome legitimacy vested in a small number of public officials, community members often reported a lack of justice and accountability. They struggled to get public officials to take notice and implement systematic change. Reviewing controversial shootings highlights the multiple issues involved in protecting law enforcement officers from encountering criminal charges, and in essence the procurement of colonial control. Critical Race Theory (interest convergence and storytelling), Social Dominance Theory, along with the historical framework of W. E. B. Du Bois, were utilized to explore a number of officer-involved shootings that continue to produce disparate outcomes by race, class, and gender.

T1  - The deradicalisation of education: terror, youth and the assault on learning
AN  - 1780542295
AB  - A high profile anti-radicalisation agenda in schools and other educational institutions throughout Europe has risen in response to terrorist attacks on European countries in the first decades of the twenty-first century. This article looks critically at anti-radicalisation in education, arguing that it needs to be placed in the broader context of ongoing neoliberal educational reform and questioned not just in terms of its dubious efficacy in addressing terrorism, or the civil rights harm it inflicts on Muslim and ethnic minority citizens in Europe, but also as a direct attack on the centuries-old radical tradition in European education. In particular, anti-radicalisation diverts attention from the analysis of structural root causes of social problems, opposes the use of education for fundamental social change, and stigmatises transformational educational practices that many would argue are now vitally important in helping us collectively address a range of contemporary global social, economic and environmental crises.

T1  - Wealth Inequality Among Immigrants: Consistent Racial/Ethnic Inequality in the United States
AN  - 1777281812
AB  - Wealth is a strong indicator of immigrant integration in U.S. society. Drawing on new assimilation theory, we highlight the importance of racial/ethnic group boundaries and propose different paths of wealth integration among U.S. immigrants. Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation and quantile regression, we show that race/ethnicity shapes immigrant wealth inequality across the entire distribution of net worth, along with immigrants' U.S. experience, such as immigrant status, U.S. education, English language proficiency, and time spent in the United States. Our results document consistent racial/ethnic inequality among immigrants, also evidenced among the U.S. born, revealing that even when accounting for key aspects of U.S. experience, wealth inequality with whites for Latino and black immigrants is strong.

T1  - Shades of Race: How Phenotype and Observer Characteristics Shape Racial Classification: PROD
AN  - 1773540125
AB  - Although race-based discrimination and stereotyping can only occur if people place others into racial categories, our understanding of this process, particularly in contexts where observers categorize others based solely on appearance, is limited. Using a unique data set drawn from observers' assessments of photos posted by White, Black, Latino, and multiracial online daters, this study examines how phenotype and observer characteristics influence racial categorization and cases of divergence between self-identities and others' classifications. I find that despite the growth in the multiracial population, observers tend to place individuals into monoracial categories, including Latino. Skin color is the primary marker used to categorize others by race, with light skin associated with Whiteness, medium skin with Latinidad, and, most strongly, dark skin with Blackness. Among daters who self-identify as Black along with other racial categories, those with dark skin are overwhelmingly placed solely into a Black category. These findings hold across observers, but the proportion of photos placed into different racial categories differs by observers' gender and race. Thus, estimates of inequality may vary depending not only on how race is assessed but also on who classifiers are. I argue that patterns of racial categorization reveal how the U.S. racial structure has moved beyond binary divisions into a system in which Latinos are seen as a racial group in-between Blacks and Whites, and a dark-skin rule defines Blacks' racial options.

T1  - Demand and Supply: Racial and Ethnic Minority Candidates in White Districts
AN  - 1951415284
AB  - Do voters in white districts systematically obstruct minority representation? Despite a great deal of public and scholarly attention, this question remains largely unresolved. We demonstrate that the narrow focus on the relationship between white voters and minority representation is inadequate to understand why we do not see more minority-elected officials in the United States. We use a matching technique to investigate three theoretical perspectives of descriptive representation using a unique dataset from the 2012 general elections for state legislative seats in 14 states, the first elections after the 2010 redistricting process. Our findings challenge the venerable notion that minority candidates consistently underperform in white districts, and complicate our understanding of the political expression of bigotry in the voting booth.

T1  - 'Playing' at the ethnic boundary: strategic boundary making/unmaking among ethnic Chinese groups in Australia
AN  - 1789875733
AB  - The sociological literature has constructed a systematic typology of 'modes' and 'means' of strategic ethnic boundary making/unmaking. Through exploring different strategies, scholars illustrate the processes and contexts of boundary expansion or contraction. Other scholars also distinguish ethnic elements and 'moral' values attached to certain ethnicities but not to others. This paper acknowledges dynamic boundary making/unmaking and moral aspects of ethnicity, while exploring the different degrees to which national and pan-national identity nest within each other among ethnic Chinese groups, as well as how ethnic boundary becomes a field where people 'play' in their everyday interactions. Based on participant observations and in-depth interviews from two pan-Chinese work-sites in Australia, the paper argues that different interpretations of ethnic identity as well as how different identities (national and pan-national) are nested give people room to 'play' at the ethnic boundary and result in different outcomes. This paper also shows that people can cross the ethnic boundary (between Taiwanese/Hong Kongese and PRC-Chinese) without expanding/contracting the existing categories or 'repositioning/transvaluing' their ethnic statuses.

T1  - Parents' living arrangement and the political and civic attitudes of 13- and 14-year-old children/Der Einfluss der elterlichen Familienform auf die politischen und staatsbürgerlichen Einstellungen 13- und 14-jähriger Kinder
AN  - 1856414965
AB  - This paper focuses on the role of parents' living arrangement in the attitudes of their children toward society. It uses data from the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study conducted by the International Educational Association in 2009, which surveys the civic attitudes and participation of 13- and 14-year-old students across 38 countries. In this paper, we use only 22 European countries and examine adolescents' attitudes toward trust in civic institutions, positive attitudes toward one's own country, equal rights for all ethnic groups, and positive attitudes toward gender equality. We distinguish between five living arrangements: two-parent families, stepfamilies, single fathers, single mothers who live alone with their children, and single mothers in multi-generational households. The analysis shows strong and significant differences between the civic attitudes of 13- and 14- year-old students living in a two-parent family and those living in other family forms, irrespective of the country, and also after controlling for parental socioeconomic background.

T1  - Ethnic penalties? The role of human capital and social origins in labour market outcomes of second-generation Moroccans and Turks in the Netherlands
AN  - 1784151153
AB  - In Western Europe, the children of Moroccan and Turkish migrants were found to be significantly disadvantaged in the labour market. This ethnic gap was found to persist after considering differences in schooling, which was argued to reflect 'ethnic penalties' driven by cultural, religious, or racial factors. This study uses data from the 1st Wave of the 'Netherlands Longitudinal Life-Course Study' (2009-2010) to revisit the analysis of 'ethnic penalties' for second-generation Moroccans and Turks. Unlike in previous research, empirical analyses not only consider differences in schooling, but also skills and social origins. Results show substantial ethnic inequalities in the labour market, with the exception of women from Moroccan origins. For men, these ethnic inequalities do not disappear when human capital factors are considered, but they do when accounting for the unprivileged social origins of ethnic minorities. For women, the disadvantage of second-generation Turks in achieving privileged occupations clearly disappears when human capital and social origins are considered. Yet, the chances of being unemployed among women of Turkish origins persist after controlling for education, skills, and social origins. Overall, this study has global academic and public policy implications to understand the socioeconomic integration of the Moroccan and Turkish second generation in Western Europe.

T1  - The denial of racism in Latina/o students' narratives about discrimination in the classroom
AN  - 1763751075
AB  - This study examines how Latina/o students perceive and frame experiences of prejudice against them in the classroom through narratives told in informal interviews in Spanish. This project started as an inquiry about these students' general perceptions and experiences in their Advanced Spanish-language classes and how these compared to their experiences in other classes on campus. Narratives are essential to understanding how speakers perceive and evaluate the experiences narrated and how they position themselves in relation to their group as well as to outsiders. The results show that, in most cases, when recounting narratives of discrimination or situations that can be considered instances of prejudice, students were hesitant to recognize that they were the subjects of discrimination or to qualify the story as an occurrence of racism. Different strategies were used to avoid this recognition, including assigning others the role of recognizing the situation as discriminatory and also using narrative evaluations or introductions to justify or mitigate the reasons that motivated these incidents. Discourses of prejudice and racism denial have been broadly documented, yet most studies focus on those who deny being racist themselves or being part of a racist group. This study shows how the underrepresented group might incorporate these discourses of denial and also how their discourses support or, at least, do not challenge the ideologies of majority groups about race, language, and immigration.

T1  - Ritualized ethnic identity: Asian Indian immigrants in the southern plains
AN  - 1750418041
AB  - This study examines identity construction among first-generation Asian Indian immigrants who reside in the Southern Plains region of the United States. Employing structural ritualization theory this study focuses on how three types of ritualized behaviors -- regional-ethnic, pan-ethnic, and host -- play a crucial role in constructing "multi-ritual" ethnic identity of Indian immigrants. In determining the rank or overall importance of ritualized symbolic practices (RSPs) we argue that the higher the rank of a practice, the greater its impact on the cognitions and behaviors of immigrants. The results of this qualitative study indicate that in the process of ethnic identity formation, Indian immigrants negotiate with their distinctive pan-Indian RSPs, retain and alter their regional-Indian RSPs, and bring their ethnicity into the mainstream society. This study contributes to the micro-sociological analysis of ethnic identity and enhances our empirical understanding of an understudied Asian Indian immigrant community.

T1  - Ethno-religious identities and persisting penalties in the UK labor market
AN  - 1750999893
AB  - Most studies of minority group penalties in the UK labor market have focused on groups classified by their self-assessed ethnicity only, without taking into account major divisions within such groups, notably by religion. Using a large sample taken from the quarterly Labor Force Survey, this paper analyze levels of both unemployment and obtaining posts within the salariat for fourteen separate ethno-religious groups. Estimates of both gross and net penalties are derived, the latter taking the individuals' human capital resources into account. They show that most non-White groups face an employment penalty, but Muslim groups -- both men and women -- experienced the greatest penalties. These penalties are exacerbated when searching for any job turns into searching for a managerial or a professional job suggesting that inequality is preserved through mechanisms of color and cultural racism which intensifies as minority workers seek jobs at the more lucrative end of the labor market -- which, if persistent, could have long-term implications for the cohesion of the UK's multi-ethnic, multi-cultural society.

T1  - Migration and Ethnicity in Coalfield History: Global Perspectives
AN  - 1744618395
AB  - This article provides a general background to the case studies in this Special Issue by highlighting some general themes in the history of migration to coalfields worldwide. All over the world, mining companies have struggled with labour shortages and had to find ways to recruit sufficient numbers of mineworkers. The solutions adopted ranged from the involvement of part-time peasant miners, organized mediation by labour contractors, and systems of forced labour, to state regulation of national and international migration. The importance of these kinds of "intervening institution" in mobilizing labour for the coalmines is illustrated by examples from different parts of the world. Efforts to find new workers for the mines often resulted in the recruitment of ethnic groups of a lower social status, not only because they were rural and unskilled, but also because they were considered inferior from a cultural or ethnic viewpoint. In this respect there was a huge difference from the migration and settlement of skilled miners, like those from Britain and other countries. Ethnic differences were often closely related to differences in skill and social status. Although there are many instances of inter-ethnic solidarity and cooperation, depending on the time-frame and circumstances, these differences could have a profound effect on social relations in mining communities.

T1  - Using participatory and creative methods to facilitate emancipatory research with people facing multiple disadvantage: a role for health and care professionals
AN  - 1788497630
AB  - Participatory and creative research methods are a powerful tool for enabling active engagement in the research process of marginalised people. It can be particularly hard for people living with multiple disadvantage, such as disabled people from ethnic minority backgrounds, to access research projects that are relevant to their lived experience. This article argues that creative and participatory methods facilitate the co-researchers' engagement in the research process, which thus becomes more empowering. Exploring the congruence of these methods with their professional ethos, health and care professionals can use their skills to develop them further. Both theory and practice examples are presented.

T1  - Manufacturing Naxi's original ecological culture in contemporary China
AN  - 1784139934
AB  - (ProQuest: ... denotes non-USASCII text omitted)
For over a decade, original ecological (yuanshengtai[...]) has contested ethnic (minzu) as an influential framework in representing minority folk culture in Chinese official and popular media. This article explores the ideological implications of such a shift in the context of state-minority relationships. By examining Han elites' invention of the neologism and Naxi elites' adaptations, I argue that YST transforms local ethnic categories into a transethnic, translocal, and transnational concept, and therefore allows both the nation state and the minority groups to promote their own versions of ethnic identities. Compared to the antagonistic model between state domination and minority resistance, YST reflects a shift from minority political self-determination to cultural self-representation in the drastically changing global environments.

T1  - When bias binds: Effect of implicit outgroup bias on ingroup affiliation
AN  - 1767327297; 201605543
AB  - We tested a novel process we term implicit homophily in which perceivers' implicit outgroup bias shapes their affiliative responses toward ingroup targets with outgroup friends as a function of perceived similarity. Across 4 studies, we tested implicit homophily in the context of racial groups. We found that White participants with higher implicit anti-Black bias reported less affiliative responses toward White targets with Black friends compared with White targets with White friends, and this effect persisted above and beyond the effects of implicit pro-White bias and explicit racial bias (Studies 1-3). We further found evidence that this relationship between implicit anti-Black bias and affiliation exists because participants infer how comfortable targets are around outgroup members (Preliminary Study) and use this information to infer similarity on this dimension (Studies 1-3). Our findings also suggested that stigma transference and expectancy violation were not viable alternative mediators (Preliminary Study and Study 1). Finally, women's implicit anti-Black bias predicted their likelihood of having Facebook friends with Black friends, providing ecological and behavioral evidence of implicit homophily (Study 4). Implications for research on stigma by association, extended contact, affiliation, and network formation are discussed. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - A CONTENT-ANALYSIS OF RACE, GENDER, AND CLASS IN AMERICAN COMIC BOOKS
AN  - 1842827807
AB  - We conducted a content-analysis on Modern Age American comic books recording the gender, race, and class ofthe main and background comic book characters. Our data shows that white males are the majority of overall characters, main characters, and aggressors in altercations. With regard to class, black characters were more likely to be represented as having lower socioeconomic status compared to white characters. Black background characters were significantly underrepresented overall compared to white comic book readers. The implications of the under-representation of women, people of color, and women of color in comic books are discussed for perpetuating stereotypes in those who read them.

T1  - "We have no quarrel with you": Effects of group status on characterizations of "conflict" with an outgroup
AN  - 1660132302
AB  - In three studies, we examined the effect of intergroup status on group members' tendencies to characterize the ingroup's relationship with an outgroup as conflictual following outgroup action. Findings from all three studies supported the prediction that the intergroup relationship would be characterized as less conflictual when the ingroup had relatively high rather than low status. Consistent with the hypothesis that the effect of status reflects strategic concerns, it was moderated by the perceived relevance of the outgroup's action to intergroup status relations (study 1), it was sensitive to audience (study 2), and it was partially mediated by status management concerns (study 3). The role of strategic, status-related factors in intergroup relations is discussed.

T1  - Ethnic Boundaries in Core Discussion Networks: A Multilevel Social Network Study of Turks and Moroccans in the Netherlands
AN  - 1680154361; 201514090
AB  - This study examines ethnic segregation of core discussion networks in the Netherlands. The analysis is based on Netherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study, a large-scale survey of the Dutch population aged 15-45 that contains an oversample of first- and second-generation immigrants from Turkey and Morocco, the two largest non-western immigrant groups in Holland. Results show that among Turks and Moroccans, more than 75% of the confidants are co-ethnic multilevel logistic models of these ego networks which suggest that ethnic closure in core discussion networks of Turks and Moroccans is stronger among women, foreign-born immigrants, those who live in immigrant concentration areas and those who are culturally more dissimilar to the Dutch to (i.e., who speak Dutch less well, who more strongly participate in Muslim practices and who identify stronger with their ethnic group). Results further suggest that the socio-economic gradient in ethnic boundaries is due to both cultural and economic homophily. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Little of Italy? Assumed ethnicity in a New York City neighbourhood
AN  - 1680150910; 201513892
AB  - Utilizing the case study of Albanian Kosovars employed in the restaurant business in Little Italy, New York, this paper introduces the concept of assumed ethnicity. This concept describes one ethnic group strategically presenting itself as another ethnic group, neither assimilating into mainstream society ethnicity nor validating place of origin ethnicity. Such assumed ethnicity is outwardly expressed (assumed) by the ethnic group in question, as well as accepted (assumed to be true) in both mainstream encounters and understandings of self. Applying and building on Goffman's theory of the front stage and back stage elucidates this phenomenon, where migrants instrumentally assume an ethnicity different from their own, in order to facilitate front-stage (mainstream) encounters. On the backstage, they expose their 'true' ethnicity, in the process drawing connections between Kosovo, Albania and Italy: ironically, authenticating assumed ethnicity by linking their front- and back-stage performances of everyday life. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Institutions, information exchange, and migrant social networks in Rome
AN  - 1722763376
AB  - While a considerable body of work examines immigrant networks, inadequate attention has been devoted to understanding how networks regulate the relationship between immigrants and host institutions. A rich immigrant process may reinforce current power structures by providing a convenient buffer between the elite and challengers. Conversely, immigration may challenge the status quo. I employ social network analysis to examine three understudied immigrant groups in Rome, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, and Peruvians. I find that they have developed systems of problem-solving and sense-making that often interrupt their interactions with host institutions. The state tolerates this because it situates immigrants' concerns outside its sphere of responsibility.

T1  - Attributions of responsibility and punishment for ingroup and outgroup members: The role of just world beliefs
AN  - 1700674180; 201524893
AB  - People have a need to believe that the world is a just place. When confronted with injustice, this just world belief (JWB) is threatened. The present research, conducted in the context of relations between Israeli Jews and Arabs, examined how group membership of actor and participants' beliefs in a just world affect attributions of responsibility and punishment as a function of culpability of the actor. In particular, after measuring their JWB, Jewish participants (n = 214) read a description of a Jewish or Arab driver who was guilty or nonguilty in a car accident in which an innocent pedestrian was injured. As predicted, participants attributed less blame and recommended less severe punishment for an ingroup than an outgroup member for the same event and stronger beliefs in a just world predicted recommendations for less severe punishment for ingroup members. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Undocumented Immigrant Threat and Support for Social Controls
AN  - 1777916748
AB  - Popular support for enhanced border and internal controls to deal with undocumented immigration is examined in relation to contextual measures of group threat as well as perceived levels of cultural and economic threat posed by undocumented immigrants. Results from a national survey of non-Latino respondents (N = 1,364) indicate that presumed threatening context measured in static terms is inconsequential. But when context is measured in dynamic terms that also reflect dispersion and potential contact, it significantly predicts support for border controls. Perceived threats are stronger predictors of support for enhanced controls than either contextual indicators of presumed threat or individual characteristics of respondents. Results also show that perceived economic and cultural threats mediate the effects of individual respondent characteristics and dynamic contextual conditions as well. Implications for future research on immigrant threat emphasize the importance of context measured in both change and dispersion-related terms and responses to threat that distinguish alternative dimensions of control. Future work should also consider that perceptions of threat may not only have direct influence on immigration policy preferences but can mediate the effects of context and individual characteristics on those preferences.

T1  - Mexican immigrant experiences with discrimination in southern Appalachia
AN  - 1738476726; 201538489
AB  - Mexican immigrant populations have grown in many Appalachian communities due to increased job opportunities in the Christmas tree, textile, meatpacking and agricultural industries. Racially and ethnically homogeneous communities offer few public resources to support immigrants. On the basis of data collected through a community-based needs assessment, this study examines the experiences of discrimination for immigrants in western North Carolina. This study furthers research on how immigrants define discrimination and the specific experiences they have faced when accessing jobs, housing and public services. The results show how the power of structural discrimination and group threat shape the experiences of discrimination for immigrants. . Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Understanding Xenophobia in Greece: A Correspondence Analysis
AN  - 1559005262; 201431940
AB  - Studies of xenophobia have focused either on socio-economic context that accentuates xenophobic attitudes or on perceptions of immigrants, namely symbolic and realistic threats as well as on social distance from immigrants. This study examines closely the relationship among various components of xenophobia and their contribution in the formation of particular xenophobic groups. The analysis identified four different xenophobic groups, i.e. a) The distant xenophobic group, b) The core xenophobic group, c) The subtle xenophobic group and d) The ambivalent xenophobic group. The groups' profiles are synthesized through negative, neutral and positive properties of overall attitudes towards immigrants, perceived threats, political xenophobia, social distance, authoritarian attitudes and individual social characteristics. The survey results demonstrate that a multidimensional conceptualization of xenophobia is needed both at the level of objective social condition and of individual and collective perceptions.

T1  - A Longitudinal Study of Migration Propensities for Mixed-Ethnic Unions in England and Wales
AN  - 1531932693; 201423271
AB  - Most studies investigating residential segregation of ethnic minorities ignore the fact that the majority of adults live in couples. In recent years there has been a growth in the number of mixed-ethnic unions that involve a minority member and a white member. To our knowledge, hardly any research has been undertaken to explicitly examine whether the ethnic mix within households has an impact on the residential mobility of households in terms of the ethnic mix of destination neighbourhoods. Our study addresses this research gap and examines the tendencies of mobility among mixed-ethnic unions in comparison with their co-ethnic peers. We used data from the Longitudinal Study for England and Wales. Our statistical analysis supports the spatial assimilation theory; ethnic minorities move towards less deprived areas and to a lesser extent also towards less ethnically concentrated areas. However, the types of destination neighbourhood of minority people living in mixed-ethnic unions varied greatly with the ethnicity of the ethnic minority partner. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Asian Values, Ethnic Identity, and Acculturation Among Ethnic Asian Wives in South Korea
AN  - 1520331041; 201413361
AB  - In Korea as of 2009, the immigrant population comprised less than 2.5 % of the total population, whereas almost one in ten marriages taking place during the same year was international, of which more than 75 % were ethnic Asian women married to Korean men. On that ground, this study addresses the importance of Asian values and ethnic identity in ethnic Asian wives' acculturation to Korean society. The subjects of this study have been selected from three ethnic Asian groups-Japanese, Chinese, and Vietnamese women. Acculturation in this study has been measured in three aspects: Korean cultural attitudes and identity, linguistic assimilation, and the level of satisfaction with Korean culture. First, our findings have revealed that their recognition of Asian values plays an important role in improving their acculturation to Korean society, especially in the realms of cultural attitudes and identity, and satisfaction with Korean culture. Then, there has been no evidence that their sense of ethnic identity is a critical factor of their acculturation to Korean society. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Inter-ethnic processes in post-Soviet space: theoretical background
AN  - 1512219146; 201408923
AB  - This introductory article of a special issue outlines the general theoretical background, formulates principles for a continuum of hot and cold ethnicities, gives a brief characterisation of the interethnic developments after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and provides an overview of the papers. This collection of contributions deals with a variety of case studies with a particular focus on the strength of members' emotional attachment to their group. Such a division of ethnicities can be categorised into two prototypes: 'hot' and 'cold'. A 'hot' ethnic group is one whose members have a high emotional attachment to their group. 'Cold' ethnic groups are those whose members' emotional attachment to the groups is low, absent or latent. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Obstacles to intergroup contact: When outgroup partner's anxiety meets perceived ethnic discrimination
AN  - 1541997819; 201426780
AB  - Emerging research suggests that outgroup partner's anxiety can disrupt intergroup rapport-building. This study extends previous findings by investigating the interactive effects of anticipated outgroup partner's anxiety and perceived ethnic discrimination on self-anxiety and intergroup contact avoidance. A sample of immigrant adolescents belonging to different ethnic minorities in Italy (N = 118) was considered. Results showed that when participants expected to interact with an anxious outgroup (Italian) versus in-group partner, self-anxiety increased and, as a consequence, their intentions to avoid future encounters. However, these effects were observed only for participants with higher (vs. lower) perceptions of being discriminated against. The implications of these results for interethnic communication and misunderstandings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Measuring Dimensions of Perceived Discrimination in Five Stigmatized Groups
AN  - 1447470369
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to design and validate a multidimensional scale with the potential to measure perceived discrimination in different stigmatized groups. The study was carried out in Spain with a sample of 1,016 participants belonging to five stigmatized groups: Latin American immigrants, Romanian immigrants, people with HIV, gays and lesbians. Confirmatory factor analysis validated the existence of four dimensions in the scale: blatant group discrimination, subtle group discrimination, blatant individual discrimination, and subtle individual discrimination. In accordance with the literature, the scale presents positive relations with the stigma consciousness scale (Pinel in J Pers Soc Psychol 76:114-128,  1999 ) and negative relations with two measures of psychological well-being, affect balance and self-acceptance. Likewise, the results indicate that the perception of subtle individual discrimination is more negatively associated with participants' psychological well-being.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Of saints and sinners: How appeals to collective pride and guilt affect outgroup helping
AN  - 1504424035; 201405307
AB  - We examined how appeals to collective guilt and pride can motivate people to help members of a disadvantaged outgroup. Results from two experiments supported the prediction that appeals to collective pride are more effective than appeals to collective guilt in prompting high identifying group members', but not low identifying group members' willingness to help the outgroup. Study 2 demonstrated that, as expected, pride appeals generated more empathy for the disadvantaged group than guilt appeals, particularly among high identifiers, and empathy mediated the relationship between emotional appeals and helping. The results complement existing research on collective guilt by demonstrating how high identifiers can be persuaded to help members of a disadvantaged outgroup even in the context of historical harmdoings.

T1  - Exploring the impact of ethnic identity through other-generated cues on perceptions of spokesperson credibility
AN  - 1520341446; 201413497
AB  - Although previous studies indicate that perceived similarity can influence perceptions of source credibility, less is known about the impact of ethnic identity on these perceptions in social media environments. A quasi-experiment was designed to manipulate the strength of ethnic identity of an African American spokesperson promoting a health news story. The results indicate a substantive condition by participant ethnicity interaction, in which African Americans assign greater credibility to high ethnic identity spokes-people, while Caucasian respondents found low ethnic identity spokespersons more credible. The results are discussed in terms of the understanding of credibility perceptions across diverse audiences, and the implications for health communication professionals working with historically underrepresented populations.

T1  - Religious Prosociality and Aggression: It's Real
AN  - 1463006373; 201346835
AB  - Individual religiosity relates to prosocial attitudes, behavioral intentions, and behaviors of minimal (no/low cost; limited to in-group members) prosociality in hypothetical situations. Yet evidence on religious prosociality through other-oriented, costly helping behavior in real life is still to be documented. Similarly, religiosity relates to cognitive, emotional, and attitudinal components of prejudice toward moral out-groups. Evidence on real behavior of prejudice is nevertheless still needed. In two experiments using the same measure of religiosity and samples from the same population, religiosity predicted helping, in a real-life context, of an in-group member in need (Experiment 1) as well as overt and direct aggression by means of allocating hot sauce to a gay, but not to a neutral, target (Experiment 2). Religious prosociality and aggression are real, concern distinct kinds of targets, and are at the heart of personal religiosity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Constructing the Model Immigrant: Movement Strategy and Immigrant Deservingness in the New Sanctuary Movement
AN  - 1463014993; 201345897
AB  - The model minority stereotype has been widely criticized for creating distinctions between racial groups by depicting some as more deserving than others. Immigration scholars have begun exploring similar distinctions among immigrant groups, with most research highlighting the role of anti-immigrant forces, the media, and policymakers in constructing divisions. Ethnographic research on the New Sanctuary Movement, a network of interfaith immigrant rights organizations, reveals that pro-immigrant activists also construct distinctions between "deserving" and "undeserving" immigrants. Building on frame alignment theory, which often focuses on movement discourse, I use a dramaturgical approach to highlight the nonrhetorical framing practices involved in creating these distinctions: in particular, the casting of select members of stigmatized groups and their public and visual association with more powerful actors. Through a type of frame transformation I call the model movement strategy-the use of model cases to challenge negative stereotypes of members of disadvantaged groups-New Sanctuary activists drew distinctions between model immigrants and those who did not share their dominant-friendly characteristics, implicitly portraying certain undocumented immigrants as less deserving of legal residency and citizenship. These findings suggest that the model movement strategy, an approach used by a variety of contemporary social movements, may have insidious consequences for the most vulnerable movement constituents.

T1  - 'Categories We Share': Mobilising Common In-groups in Discourse on Contemporary Immigration in Greece
AN  - 1429639919; 201335620
AB  - Prejudice reduction has been an important concern within social psychology both in theory and applied research. According to the premises of Social Identity Theory, redrawing of the category boundaries is often considered a necessary step in order to battle prejudice, because in-group favouritism when the category boundaries change is diffused to the previously distinct identities. The present paper offers a review of the relevant research, and following a discourse analytic perspective argues that recategorisation can also be viewed as a rhetorical resource that people use in verbal interaction in order to achieve certain rhetorical ends. This point is exemplified using interview data from Greece with Greek participants who mobilise common in-groups between themselves and the immigrants in Greece. Different common in-groups were mobilised on the basis of common human nature, common ethnic descent and through the use of the common experience of migration that many Greek people have because Greece has been an emigrant sending country for the biggest part of the 20th century. Occasionally, these category constructions were used to differentiate between immigrants of different ethnic descent claiming that only certain immigrant groups can integrate to Greek society, whereas on other instances, these common in-groups were used in order to inoculate speakers of accusations of prejudice.

T1  - Examining the Hostile Media Effect as an Intergroup Phenomenon: The Role of Ingroup Identification and Status
AN  - 1448995880; 201343457
AB  - This approach conceptualizes the hostile media effect (HME) as an intergroup phenomenon. Two empirical studies, one quasi-experimental and one experimental, examine the HME in the context of the abortion debate. Both studies show that ingroup identification and group status qualify the HME. Pro-choice and pro-life group members perceived an identical newspaper article as biased against their own viewpoint only if they considered their ingroup to have a lower status in society than the outgroup. In addition, only group members with a stronger ingroup identification showed a HME, particularly because of self-investment components of ingroup identification. Taken together, the findings confirm the important influence of ingroup status and ingroup identification on the HME. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Do We Need Social Cohesion in the 21st Century? Multiple Languages of Belonging in the Metropolis
AN  - 1438555468; 201340287
AB  - Discussions about belonging, national identity and social cohesion are part of a broader debate that emerges from a number of concerns, mainly to do with identity and specifically with ethnic or religious identities versus the perceived homogeneous national identity. One major concern in immigration countries is that many immigrants and ethnic minorities are not integrating into the destination or receiving societies. This perceived lack of integration creates fears about whether newcomers are developing a shared sense of belonging to the national identity. Without this commitment it is feared that social cohesion and indeed the very basis of liberal democracy is under threat. In this paper, I question whether this fear is valid by exploring the relationship between the individual and society through the notion of 'sense of belonging' -- to a community, to a polity and to the nation. What does this mean in terms of national identity and social cohesion? In other words, do we have to have a shared sense of belonging to the nation to be responsible citizens? First, I will briefly explore some of the theoretical debates about belonging to the nation. Second, by analysing immigrant narratives on citizenship, belonging and community in London, I examine the multifaceted modes of belonging and whether migrants and ethnic minorities, who do not have a sense of belonging to the nation or who have a sense of belonging to more than one symbolic or material locality, can still have a sense of belonging and commitment to the common good which in turn contributes to societal cohesion.

T1  - The Moderating Effects of Skin Color and Ethnic Identity Affirmation on Suicide Risk among Low-SES African American Women
AN  - 1494749955; 201402121
AB  - This study examined the influence of concurrent racism and sexism experiences (i.e., gendered racism) on African American women's suicidal ideation and behavior in the context of disadvantaged socioeconomic status. Drawing on a stress process framework, the moderating effects of ethnic identity and skin color were explored using multiple regression analyses. Data were from 204 low-income African American women in the B-WISE (Black Women in a Study of Epidemics) project. Findings suggested that experiencing gendered racism significantly increased these women's risk for suicidal ideation or behavior, though only among women with medium or dark skin color. Also, having strong ethnic identity buffered the harmful effects of gendered racism. The moderating properties of skin color and ethnic identity affirmation likely operate through psychosocial pathways, blocking internalization of negative stereotypes and reducing the level of distress experienced in response to gendered racism.

T1  - Foreigners and Outsiders: Exclusionist Attitudes towards Labour Migrants in Israel
AN  - 1315601669; 201307677
AB  - This paper examines theoretical propositions regarding the social mechanisms that produce hostility and discriminatory attitudes towards out-group populations. Specifically, we compare the effect of perceptions of socio-economic and national threats, social contact and prejudice on social distance expressed towards labour migrants. To do so, we examine exclusionary views held by majority and minority groups (Jews and Arabs) towards non-Jewish labour migrants in Israel. Data analysis is based on a survey of the adult Israeli population based on a stratified sample of 1,342 respondents, conducted in Israel in 2007. Altogether, our results show that Israelis (both Jews and Arabs) are resistant to accepting and integrating foreigners into Israeli society. Among Jews, this is because the incorporation of non-Jews challenges the definition of Israel as a Jewish state and poses a threat to the homogeneity of the nation. Among Arabs, this is probably due to threat and competition over resources. The meanings of the findings are discussed within the unique ethno-national context of Israeli society and in light of sociological theories on ethnic exclusionism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Disadvantage, Ethnic Niching or Pursuit of a Vision
AN  - 1322723965; 201310763
AB  - As immigrant groups grow older, host societies are faced with new challenges of integration. In a labor market that is structured by ethnicity and gender, the demand for culturally competent care provides immigrant women with the opportunity to become entrepreneurs within the care sector. This article analyzes 20 in-depth interviews with immigrant women from 13 countries who are entrepreneurs in home-help services for elderly people. The article analyzes the complex motives behind the women's entrepreneurship. Ethnic entrepreneurship has mainly been approached as a way for immigrants to survive in the labor market-the disadvantage theory-or as a means to create job opportunities for co-ethnics within ethnic economies. Opposed to this, three main motives appear in the analysis: first, the processes of ethnic and gender sorting in the care sector; second, ethnic strategies in the labor market; and third, the wish to gain independence and improve the quality of care. Only in a few cases is ethnic entrepreneurship practiced within ethnic economies; instead, it is mainly found within cross-cultural economies, consisting of employees and customers of mixed origin who are embedded in a majority society. The women construct their ethnic identities to compete in the segmented Swedish labor market by creating ethnic identities of care that are adjusted to meet the needs of their customers in a cross-cultural society.

T1  - Patterns of Ethnic Intolerance in Europe
AN  - 1322723515; 201310848
AB  - This paper examines the patterns of ethnic intolerance in European societies based on data from the 1999/2000 wave of the European Values Survey. We analyze the differences in intolerance targeted toward Muslims, Jews, immigrants, Gypsies, and persons of different race, using modernisation theory and "competition for scarce resource" theories as our point of departure. Furthermore, we focus on the differences in the levels of intolerance in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and Turkey. The present paper builds on previous empirical research, especially findings of recent multilevel analyses. Our larger and more extensive data material enables us to introduce two important improvements in this line of research. Theoretically, we are able to test if there are differences in the patterns of intolerance targeted toward specific minority groups. Methodologically, the number of countries in our data material is much larger, allowing us to apply multilevel models in a more statistically appropriate setting. Our results show that Gypsies stand out as an ethnic group particularly exposed to intolerance. The level of intolerance is lowest in Western Europe and highest in Turkey. In addition, the level of intolerance against Jews is particularly high in Turkey. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Arab American Emerging Adults' Bicultural Identity, Acculturation Stress, and Perceptions of Parenting
AN  - 1520331230; 201412975
AB  - For bicultural individuals in the United States, developing a sense of cultural identity is an important component of self-concept. Such identity exploration is particularly salient for 18- to 30-year-old individuals in the stage of life termed "emerging adulthood" (Arnett, 2000). Most research concerning bicultural identity has been conducted on individuals of Asian, African, or Latino descent (e.g., Benet-Martinex & Haritatos, 2005; de Domanico et al., 1994; Farver, Narang, & Bhadha, 2002; Phinney & Devich-Navarro, 1997; Tsai, Ying, & Lee, 2000; Umana-Taylor, Bhanot, & Shin, 2006; Ying, 1995; Weaver & Kim, 2008). Very few studies, however, have investigated bicultural identity in Arab Americans (e.g., Awad, 2010; Brito & Amer, 2007). For individuals of Arab descent living in the United States post-September 11th, developing a sense of cultural identity may be particularly complex and stressful. Therefore, in response to Britto's (2008) call for more research on Arab American youth, the current study is an attempt to expand our knowledge of this ethnic minority group by exploring bicultural identity in Arab American emerging adults.

T1  - Mexican American Protest, Ethnic Resiliency and Social Capital: The Mobilization Benefits of Cross-Cutting Ties
AN  - 1347784617; 201318893
AB  - Using terms like free spaces and havens, conventional wisdom views social ties by subordinate groups to dominant group members as hindering protest participation. In contrast, we draw on ethnic resiliency and social capital perspectives and argue that there are mobilization benefits to having dominant group members as friends. We offer a unique statistical test by examining the effect of white social ties on Mexican American participation in cultural and political protest. Using survey data, bivariate and multivariate results demonstrate that social connections to whites promote Mexican American activism. We conclude with a discussion of how our findings can be reconciled with previous scholarship. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Two sides of the ostracism coin: How sources and targets of social exclusion perceive themselves and one another
AN  - 1125220039; 201240291
AB  - Ostracism involves two parties: The group doing the exclusion (i.e., sources) and the target of the exclusion. Research on social exclusion has often focused on the targets. The current study, however, considers the experiences of both sources and targets. Members of four-person groups were randomly assigned to the roles of targets or sources of exclusion, and then interacted in a face-to-face setting. Participants' perceptions of themselves and other group members were then evaluated and also compared with control group members. Although targets were negatively affected by exclusion, the sources of exclusion also suffered negative consequences. In addition, these interactions (which were videotaped) were coded by independent judges. The observational data revealed that people use a variety of behaviors to exclude a target, and more stringent forms of exclusion corresponded to more negative outcomes.

T1  - "We are Purified by Fire": The Complexification of Motherhood in the Context of Migration
AN  - 1364700401; 201323496
AB  - The paper examines the relationship between migration, the reconstruction of motherhood as identity and the transnational mothering role. The complexification of the mothering role in a transnational context is unpacked within a phenomenological approach. An in-depth thematic case study analysis of selected Zimbabwean women who had migrated to Port Elizabeth, South Africa, found that migration has implications for the ongoing identity development and relationship dynamics within the transnational family structure and further impacts on the women's perceptions of their social identity. This identity is mediated by a 'double-othering' as a consequence of the rejection of both the host community and her fellow Zimbabwean migrants. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Race-Based Fantasy Realm: Essentialism in the World of Warcraft
AN  - 1081862328; 201235317
AB  - This article explores issues of racial essentialism and ethnicity in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft (WoW). The fantasy world of Azeroth mirrors elements of real-world race-based societies where culture is thought to be immutably linked to race. The notion of biological essentialism is reinforced throughout the gamescape. Race plays a primary role in the social and political organization of Azeroth. Among other things, race determines alliances, language, intellect, temperament, occupation, strength, and technological aptitude. The cultural representation of the respective racial groups in WoW draws upon stereotypical imagery from real-world ethnic groups (e.g., American Indian, Irish/Scottish, Asian, African, etc.).

T1  - Football team identification in Norway: spectators of local and national football matches
AN  - 1792709319
AB  - Football spectators (N=760) at two local and two international matches were surveyed with the aim of investigating how identity is created and sustained in relation to top-level sport in general, and local and national football teams in particular. Two-way between-groups analyses of variance were applied, and effect sizes calculated. There was a statistically significant main effect for gender, showing that male spectators identify more strongly with their favourite team than female spectators. The findings also include an interaction effect between gender and level of matches, indicating different effects on male and female spectators. Male spectators identify more strongly with the national team than the local team, whereas female spectators identify more strongly with the local team. Strong identification with the national team goes together with more positive attitudes towards the nation. The results are analysed within the theoretical framework of social identity theory (SIT) and self-categorization theory (SCT). Team identification is context-dependent and partly explained with reference to the principle of meta-contrast implied in SCT. Positive attitudes towards the nation are interpreted as beneficial from a nation-building point of view, but have possible negative consequences concerning the evaluation of social groups not included in the in-group.

T1  - The Rights of 'Return': Ethnic Identities in the Workplace among Second-Generation Indian-American Professionals in the Parental Homeland
AN  - 1023030517; 201223875
AB  - This article explores the salience of ethnicity for second-generation Indian-American professionals who 'return' from the US to their parental homeland, India. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 48 second-generation Indian-Americans in India, it examines when and how they adopt ethnic identities in the workplace. My findings suggest that, bolstered by their transnational experiences and backgrounds, returnees construct ethnic identities and utilise ethnic options that reflect the cultural and economic environments of their adopted homeland. At the same time, and often contemporaneously, work relationships, experiences and personal interactions with those they encounter in the parental homeland factor into their transnational identity constructions. Also proposed is a preliminary framework within which to explore the conditions that facilitate the construction and assertion of returnees' ethnic identities in the workplace in India.

T1  - Cultural Encoding and Fake Equality in Popular Reality Shows: Lessons from Israel
AN  - 1023030516; 201223876
AB  - This paper critically examines the representation of two major minorities in Israel, Arab citizens of Israel and Jewish immigrants, by focusing on the widely popular genre of reality shows. We demonstrate that this genre contains sophisticated mechanisms of differentiation and selection that inevitably exclude and stigmatise minority participants. To demonstrate this thesis the paper takes a close look at two Israeli reality shows that were conceived to have a public value-Wanted: A Leader and The Ambassador. The examination of these shows reveals how Israeliness-presented as the space of equal opportunity-contains discriminatory mechanisms based on national and ethnic affiliations. Thus, the study illustrates that national identity could be utilised as a meta-narrative of universality and inclusiveness, but actually refers to a particular type of identity that is ethnically restricted.

T1  - Disordered Eating in African American and Caucasian Women: The Role of Ethnic Identity
AN  - 907929312; 201124777
AB  - The influential roles of culture and ethnic identity are frequently cited in developing disordered eating and body dissatisfaction, constituting both protective and risk factors. For African American women, strongly identifying with African American cultural beauty ideals may protect against disordered eating to lose weight, but may actually increase risk in development of disordered eating directed at weight gain, such as binge eating. This study compares African American and Caucasian women on disordered eating measures, positing that African American women show greater risk for binge eating due to the impact of ethnic identity on body dissatisfaction. Findings indicate low levels of ethnic identity represent a risk factor for African American women, increasing the likelihood of showing greater binge eating and bulimic pathology. In Caucasian women, high levels of ethnic identity constitute a risk factor, leading to higher levels of both binge eating and global eating pathology. Implications for prevention and treatment are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Identity and Academic Success among Underrepresented Ethnic Minorities: An Interdisciplinary Review and Integration
AN  - 1037878648; 201232917
AB  - A growing body of literature provides insight into the ingredients for academic success for underrepresented ethnic minority students at all points of the academic pipeline. Theory and research in developmental and social psychology, education, and sociology all point to the important role of identity for students' academic success. The purpose of this article is to review some of the major findings across these social science disciplines to identify points of synergy that can inform effective policy recommendations. The review is structured around three points of convergence across disciplines: (1) prejudice and stereotype threat; (2) the role of social support; and (3) the availability of options for identity development. Reviewing these three topics sheds light on how the relation between identity and academic success must be understood on individual, relational, and institutional levels of analysis.

T1  - How minority members' perceptions of majority members' acculturation preferences shape minority members' own acculturation preferences: Evidence from Chile
AN  - 896180251; 201120090
AB  - Two survey studies were conducted in Chile with members of the indigenous minority group Mapuche (Ns = 566; 394). The aim was to find predictors of minority members' acculturation preferences, especially integration. It was hypothesized that minority members' preferences would depend on their perceptions of what majority members want. Specifically, it was predicted that a perception that majority members want minority members to maintain their original culture would be associated with a greater desire for culture maintenance among minority participants. Further, it was predicted that a perception that majority members want intergroup contact would be associated with a greater desire for contact among minority participants. Finally, it was predicted that a perception that majority members are in favour of both culture maintenance and contact (i.e., integration) would be associated with more support for integration among minority participants. Results bore out these predictions. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnicity and race as 'symbolic': the use of ethnic and racial symbols in asserting a biracial identity
AN  - 887495857; 201118135
AB  - According to Waters (1990), most Americans have some choice in ethnic identity and the ability to practise symbolic ethnicity (Gans 1979). This choice, however, is available to whites only; black Americans have less choice because their ascribed race trumps any ethnic status. Drawing on interviews with forty black-white biracial adults, I ask: can ethnicity be optional for black Americans -- in particular, for black-white biracial Americans who have been historically defined as black? Furthermore, can race, like ethnicity, be symbolic? I find that these biracial respondents frequently draw on white ethnic and racial symbols, not to identify as white or with a particular white ethnic group, but rather to highlight their white ancestries in order to identify as 'biracial'. The functions of appropriating white symbols are explored. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Effects of Intergroup Conflict and Social Contact on Prejudice: The Mediating Role of Stereotypes and Evaluations
AN  - 1545066711
AB  - This study explored the mediating role of stereotypes and evaluations in the relationships between intergroup conflict, social contact, and behavioral intentions to engage in intergroup contact. The hypotheses, derived from realistic group conflict theory and intergroup contact theory, were tested on samples of Arab and Jewish high school students in the context of an ethno-racial intergroup conflict. As hypothesized, the less participants perceived a conflict between the groups, and the greater their past contact with out-group members, the more they were willing to engage in intergroup contact. Moreover, stereotypes and evaluations mediated these effects in the Jewish sample. The implications of these findings for the study of the mechanisms underlying prejudice are discussed.

T1  - Citizenship Attributes as the Basis for Intergroup Differentiation: Implicit and Explicit Intergroup Evaluations
AN  - 919902955; 201201555
AB  - Recent research (e.g. Barnes, Auburn & Lee, 2004) suggests that citizenship opportunities and resources may be afforded or denied to individuals according to their group memberships. We consider how the generic processes of intergroup differentiation by which groups are socially devalued and excluded can reflect divergent conceptualizations of citizenship among different groups. As part of a wider investigation of social exclusion, a combination of methods was used to investigate the relative intergroup perceptions of residents from more and less affluent areas in Limerick city, Ireland. Participants (n = 214) completed the implicit association test and rated a fictional character on a series of citizenship-relevant dimensions. All participants displayed negative implicit associations with designated disadvantaged areas in Limerick. The results of the explicit prejudice assessment illustrated that these negative associations are matched by a lower overall attribution of positive characteristics to residents from these areas relative to residents from a more affluent area. On examination of each group's relative rating of traits, residents from less affluent areas appear doubly disadvantaged as they are devalued in terms of both outgroup and ingroup understandings of citizenship attributes.

T1  - Recent advances in intergroup contact theory
AN  - 872845523
AB  - Recent advances in intergroup contact theory and research are reviewed. A meta-analysis with 515 studies and more than 250,000 subjects demonstrates that intergroup contact typically reduces prejudice (mean r = -.21). Allport's original conditions for optimal contact -- equal status, common goals, no intergroup competition, and authority sanction -- facilitate the effect but are not necessary conditions. There are other positive outcomes of intergroup contact, such as greater trust and forgiveness for past transgressions. These contact effects occur not only for ethnic groups but also for such other groups as homosexuals, the disabled and the mentally ill. Intergroup friendship is especially important. Moreover, these effects typically generalize beyond the immediate outgroup members in the situation to the whole outgroup, other situations, and even to other outgroups not involved in the contact. They also appear to be universal -- across nations, genders, and age groups. The major mediators of the effect are basically affective: reduced anxiety and empathy. And even indirect contact reduces prejudice -- vicarious contact through the mass media and having a friend who has an outgroup friend. Of course, negative contact occurs -- especially when it is non-voluntary and threatening. Criticisms of the theory and policy implications are also discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Between Commitment and Out-migration. Identity Types of Young Slovenes in Bilingual Carinthia (Austria)
AN  - 902083425; 201122334
AB  - The demographic and socioeconomic data show that young Slovenes in Southern Carinthia (Austria) are threatened. Through processes of globalization and individualization they have to redefine their identification. Furthermore, demographic and socio-economic processes such as declining birth-rates, intermarriage and out-migration threaten their ethnolinguistic future. The communication value of autochthonous languages has been in a permanent decline (e.g. English in internet and science). In this article I present the results of the qualitative, biographic approach of my research work. On the basis of eight selected examples I demonstrate how young Slovenes identify and locate themselves in their ethnic group. Whereas young people who are well integrated in Slovene schools, families and cultural organizations still feel deeply rooted in their ethnic group, those living in ethnic mixed families or in German speaking environments with biographical breaks and lack of Slovene cultural membership, show distance, ambivalence and affiliation-conflicts, yet still with a feeling of belonging to their Slovene ethnic roots.

T1  - Measuring Multiple Minority Stress: The LGBT People of Color Microaggressions Scale
AN  - 887499263; 201118074
AB  - Lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals who are also racial/ethnic minorities (LGBT-POC) are a multiply marginalized population subject to microaggressions associated with both racism and heterosexism. To date, research on this population has been hampered by the lack of a measurement tool to assess the unique experiences associated with the intersection of these oppressions. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a three-phase, mixed method empirical study to assess microaggressions among LGBT-POC. The LGBT People of Color Microaggressions Scale is an 18-item self-report scale assessing the unique types of microaggressions experienced by ethnic minority LGBT adults. The measure includes three subscales: (a) Racism in LGBT communities, (b) Heterosexism in Racial/Ethnic Minority Communities, and (c) Racism in Dating and Close Relationships, that are theoretically consistent with prior literature on racial/ethnic minority LGBTs and have strong psychometric properties including internal consistency and construct validity in terms of correlations with measures of psychological distress and LGBT-identity variables. Men scored higher on the LGBT-PCMS than women, lesbians and gay men scored higher than bisexual women and men, and Asian Americans scored higher than African Americans and Latina/os.

T1  - Extreme right-wing vote and support for multiculturalism in Europe
AN  - 870433137; 201114313
AB  - While Europe is unifying, it is also becoming more diverse, making multiculturalism one of the most hotly debated political issues in Western Europe. Minority citizens occupy an important place in the landscape of this challenging issue. Using the Eurobarometer 53 survey of European citizens, I look at the gap between Europeans who claim minority heritage and those who do not in support for multiculturalism in fifteen European Union member nations, taking into account percentage of extreme right-wing vote. This contextual factor has a persistent significant effect on the difference between minority and non-minority attitudes. High levels of support for extreme right-wing parties may have a polarizing effect, heightening awareness of personal heritage and making ethnic identity more salient in attitudes towards multiculturalism. This suggests an extension of group threat theory in which conceptions of what constitutes both a group and a threat can be created at the level of discourse. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Vicarious intergroup contact effects: Applying social-cognitive theory to intergroup contact research
AN  - 902083893; 201122125
AB  - This contribution examines the role of vicarious contact (observing in-group members having successful cross-group contact) as a tool to improve intergroup relations. Expanding previous research on indirect intergroup contact, vicarious contact (1) integrates and applies concepts of social-cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986) to the field of intergroup contact research; (2) broadens the study of indirect contact effects to the observation of successful cross-group interactions; and (3) proposes to increase people's intention for direct cross-group contact. Two video-based experiments indicate that vicarious contact improves attitudes towards the out-group and increases participants' willingness to engage in direct cross-group contact. These studies provide evidence that the relation between vicarious contact and intergroup attitudes (and willingness to engage in direct contact) is sequentially mediated by self-efficacy expectancy and perceived intergroup uncertainty. Implications of these findings for further research on the (indirect) contact hypothesis and their application will be discussed.

T1  - Renovating ethnic identity on Restaurant Makeover
AN  - 1792349473
AB  - Food can be a novel way of understanding and explaining some of the pointed paradoxes of multiculturalism and the 'management' of ethnicity. Many studies of culinary culture are attentive to the exoticization of ethnicity in and through food media, which now includes a vertiginous array of cookbooks, travel literature, magazines and, most important for our purposes here, television series. Among various programs is Restaurant Makeover, a popular Canadian reality series broadcast on Home and Garden Television (HGTV) as well as the Food Network Canada. In each episode, dining experts are hired by struggling restaurateurs (often ethnic) to 'spice up' the existing menu, 'modernize' the décor and, by extension, ensure the welfare of the (immigrant's) family. While the series is not explicitly directed at ethnic restaurants, it seems to be increasingly interested in 'non-white' establishments (i.e., Mexican, Chinese, Thai, etc.). This participation in culinary multiculturalism may be symptomatic of wider political changes in immigration and 'diversity' in Canada. Based on the authors analyses of specific episodes this paper argues, firstly, the growing interest in ethnic cuisine on Restaurant Makeover can be read as a (neo)liberal response to an emerging conservative 'multicultural' agenda that recognizes migrants predominantly as laborers (as opposed to citizens) and, secondly, that behind its rehearsal of liberal benevolence is a skewed set of power relations that authorize the experts' (re)construction, cultivation and containment of ethnicity.

T1  - European identity and national attachment: harmony or dissonance
AN  - 2443381811
AB  - The paper is aiming to answer such questions, where does the development of a new common European identity stand, which countries or regions show stronger or weaker European identification inside the EU, how this has changed over the past decades in the process of enlargement of Europe, what could be the value content of the new common identity, and how this will affect to the traditional national attachment and identity. More narrowly, the question is what changes have happened in Hungary in the public attitudes to Europe since the mid-90s and does the process of accession has an effect or not on the traditional Hungarian national identity.The empirical foundation of our study is the international comparative empirical research series of the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP), in the years 1995 and 2003 aiming to reconstruct the stock of knowledge of national and European identities in the member states. This study uses temporal and spatial comparison to consider national connectedness and the characteristics of European identity in various countries across Europe. Based on this data in our paper we make an effort to explore what characterizes national identity in Europe, how people see foreigners and domestic minorities, whether we can identify the development of a transnational or supranational identity that goes beyond national identity, and if there is a new frame of identification for people in Europe, what extent we can expect increasing conflicts in the relation of the two types of identity.

T1  - Federalism, Ethnicity and Human Rights in Nepal. Or: Althusius meets Acharya
AN  - 1504421930; 201405467
AB  - The article addresses one of the difficult tasks of the Nepal Constituent Assembly: how to translate the idea and mechanisms of federalism in ways that are faithful to the best interests of the Nepal people into a constitution of a democratic, human rights-respecting Nepal republic. The reflections concern four varieties of federal elements, discussing arguments in favour and against each drawn from an interpretation of other states' experiences. Two of the four are territorial: constitutional: an entrenched split of powers, and political: decentralised autonomy. Two are non-territorial: minority rights and minority representation in common decision making bodies. Some of these arguments and lessons may be helpful also for Nepal's challenges, two features of which are especially noteworthy: there are very many different groups that must be accommodated fairly. And members of these groups very often live side by side on the same territory. Human rights protections combined with federal elements of Nepal's new Constitution must serve to prevent future domination, especially by the centres, over these many ethnic groups and castes.

T1  - Social Capital and the Experience of Prejudice, Aggression and Discrimination among Immigrants, US-Born Minorities and Whites in Greensboro, North Carolina
AN  - 1010632419; 201210488
AB  - This study examines the correlates of human relations experiences and social engagement practices of immigrants, U.S. minorities, and Whites in Greensboro, North Carolina. As part of a 2008 State of Human Relations study commissioned by the City of Greensboro, we examined residents' experiences with prejudice, (i.e., ignorance, fear, distrust, superiority), aggression (i.e., names, insults, threats, assault), and discrimination (i.e., blocked access to employment, education, housing, and law enforcement). Descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and ordinal regression analyses were conducted using over 1400 surveys to describe and examine discrimination and prejudice experiences of each racial/ethnic group. Findings indicate that each group has experienced levels of discrimination, prejudice, and aggression in Greensboro. Of specific interest is that, though U.S. minorities are more socially engaged, they reported higher incidences of discrimination and prejudice than any group within the sample.

T1  - Issues in the Assessment of "Race" Among Latinos: Implications for Research and Policy
AN  - 1010630682; 201210459
AB  - Measurement of race and ethnicity is integral to assessing and addressing health disparities experienced by minorities. However, the unique experiences of Latinos related to race and the discordance between understandings of race among Latinos and the predominant U.S. conceptualizations of this construct impact how Latinos respond to measurement approaches. As a result, data collection methodologies often yield ambiguous responses that reveal little about this population. This article examines Latinos' racial responding, and how this relates to their experiences and understanding of their racial identity. We recommend the use of a combined race and ethnicity question and open-ended race and ethnicity questions, when feasible, which will likely yield more meaningful data that can be used to address this populations' health needs.

Even in the absence of dysfunctional group-level processes, group members tend to stick to their suboptimal initial decision preferences due to preference-consistent evaluation of information. However, previous experiments demonstrating this effect retained two group-level processes, namely (a) social validation of information supporting the group members' initial preferences and (b) presentation of the additional information in a discussion format. Therefore, it was unclear whether the individual preference effect depends on the co-occurrence of these group-level processes. Here, we report two experiments demonstrating that the individual preference effect is indeed an individual-level phenomenon. Moreover, by a comparison to real interacting groups, we can show that even when all relevant information is exchanged and when no coordination losses occur, almost half of all groups would fail to solve hidden profiles due to the individual preference effect.

T1  - Ingroup Identification and Group-Level Narcissism as Predictors of U.S. Citizens' Attitudes and Behavior Toward Arab Immigrants
AN  - 1928308170
AB  - In four studies, the authors explored factors contributing to negative attitudes and behavior toward Arab immigrants in the United States. In Study 1, Americans reported greater threat from Arabs, compared to other groups (e.g., Latino, Asian). In Study 2, they tested the effects of ingroup identification and group-level narcissism on attitudes toward Arab, Latino, Asian, and European immigrants. Identification interacted with group narcissism in predicting attitudes toward Arab (but not other) immigrants, such that identification predicted negative attitudes toward Arab immigrants only at mean and high levels of group narcissism. Study 3 explored the convergent and discriminant validity of the group narcissism construct. In Study 4, the authors added a behavioral dependent measure. Again, ingroup identification predicted negative behavior and attitudes toward an Arab immigrant group (but not comparison groups) only at mean and high levels of group narcissism. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - The Politicization of Ethnic Sentiments in the Southern Philippines: The Case of the Bangsamoro
AN  - 743066026; 201043373
AB  - This study examines the politicization of ethnic sentiments in the Philippines with particular focus on the Southern Philippines. It is divided into six parts. The first part analyses the relationship between the Philippine political system and the minority groups within it. The second part explains the impact of ethnic politics in the Philippine political system. The third part discusses the function of ethnic politics. The fourth part examines the organizational base of ethnic politics in the region. The fifth part discusses the patterns of ethnic politics that have developed over the years. And the sixth part synthesizes the theories and practices of ethnic politics in the region. The data for this analysis came from both primary and secondary sources. The study found that the politicization of ethnic sentiment was by product of structural inequalities in the socio-political and economic domains of the Philippine society which play important role in intensifying conflicts. As a result, many ethnic groups established their own ethnic associations or organizations which are responsible for the development of strong group identification leading to the emergence of secessionist groups in the Southern Philippines that threaten the core values of the Philippine Republic.

T1  - From strangers to friends: The interpersonal process model of intimacy in developing interracial friendships
AN  - 60353483; 201018262
AB  - We examine the processes involved in the development of interracial friendships. Using Reis and Shaver's intimacy model, we explore the extent to which disclosure and perceived partner responsiveness influence intimacy levels in developing interracial and intraracial friendships. White and ethnic minority participants completed diary measures of self and partner disclosure and partner responsiveness every two weeks for 10 weeks about an in-group and an out-group person whom they thought they would befriend over time. The results revealed that perceived partner responsiveness mediated the relationships between both self and partner disclosure and intimacy in interracial and intraracial relationships. The implications of these results for intergroup relations are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]
