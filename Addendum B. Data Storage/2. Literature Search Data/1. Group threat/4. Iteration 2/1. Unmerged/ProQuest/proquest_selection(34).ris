T1  - Transformation of National Identity, Geo-politics and Nation Building in Post-colonial African States: The Cases of Cameroon and Senegal
AN  - 2582979407
AB  - This article examines the evolving nature of national identity and its significance to geo-politics and nation-building in post-colonial African states, specifically Cameroon and Senegal. Within the current global context, previous theories and scholars failed to explain how recent changes in national identity inform the choice of geo-politics in post-colonial Cameroon and Senegal. It is against this backdrop that this article examines the extent to which changes in elite and public perception on national identity transcended national borders and spilled over to the geo-political landscape. The paper relied on a mixed-method research design that combines elements of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The mixed-method approach is anchored on comparative case study techniques. The data were largely drawn from both primary and secondary sources; the primary sources included semi-structured interviews, and public statements, while the secondary sources comprised educational curriculums, Afrobarometer, World Bank data and the Swiss Economic Globalization Index. The outcome of the analysis showed that in recent years changes in national identity have transcended national borders and spilled over to the geo-political landscape. Findings revealed the extent to which the underlying features of national identity have been indigenized, Africanized and globalized to symbolize what it means to be a Cameroonian and Senegalese Citizen. Comparatively, it was established that Senegal has assumed a more dynamic image and position in geo-politics than Cameroon. Nonetheless, Cameroon’s and Senegal’s recent dynamic and versatile image accounts for the new type of national identity theorized in this paper as a form of strategic identity. The paper also highlighted the challenges and significance of strategic identity to issues of growth, nation and peace-building.

T1  - Roma undercount and the issue of undeclared ethnicity in the 2011 Romanian census
AN  - 2597935854
AB  - Romania is home to the largest Roma population in Europe. Exactly how large is a matter of intense debate, with estimates ranging between .62 and 1.85 million. The last Romanian census made the ethnic affiliation question unequivocally optional and it counted 1.24 million citizens with undeclared ethnicity, a huge increase from the 1941 cases recorded by the previous census round. Since the Roma are the only ethnic group expected to avoid disclosing ethnic affiliation, previous analyses of this idiosyncratic result attributed it exclusively to Roma discrimination led reticence. The current article corrects this view by analyzing the important role played by a previously ignored methodological change (i.e. recording as ‘undeclared’ the temporary absent citizens for whom their neighbors could not provide any information about ethnic affiliation) and revealing that lack of information about neighbors played a dominant role in urban municipalities.

T1  - Meta‐humanization enhances positive reactions to prosocial cross‐group interaction
AN  - 2547237621
AB  - The present research investigated whether learning that an outgroup humanizes the ingroup (i.e., meta‐humanization) enhances how people react to intergroup prosocial behaviours and their willingness to engage in intergroup contact. In three experiments conducted in two cultural contexts (Kosovo and North Macedonia; n = 601), we manipulated meta‐humanization by informing participants that their ingroup is perceived to be as human as the outgroup by outgroup members. We compare this meta‐humanization condition with a meta‐dehumanization condition in which the participant's ingroup is perceived to be less human than the outgroup (Experiments 1 and 3), a meta‐liking condition in which the participant's ingroup is liked as much as the outgroup (Experiment 2), and a control condition (Experiments 1 and 2). Overall, results showed that participants in the meta‐humanization condition attributed more empathy and prosocial motives to a potential outgroup helper and were more willing to accept outgroup help and engage in future intergroup contact than participants in the other conditions. In addition, positive perceptions of the outgroup helper mediated the effect of meta‐humanization on willingness to accept outgroup help and engage in intergroup contact. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for intergroup relations and reconciliation efforts.

T1  - Reporting Microaggressions: Kinship Carers’ Complaints about Identity Slights
AN  - 2525538512
AB  - The psychological concept of “microaggression” has refocused interest on what counts as prejudicial action. It redirects attention from standard socio-cognitive explanations of overt prejudice among social groups toward recipients’ perspectives of largely unwitting and subtle everyday racism. Microaggression studies define common implicit identity challenges faced by minority groups, including kinship carers. However, criticisms of the “microaggressions program” raise difficulties inherent in establishing prejudicial action from accounts of necessarily ambiguous actions, and contend that reliance on self-reporting inevitably lacks validity. This conversation analytic (CA) study offers a complementary approach: from videos of ten kinship carer support groups it shows how participants construct accountabilities for prejudicial actions in their retrospective reports of questions, challenges and suspicions in ways that build these actions as microaggressive. It addresses methodological shortcomings in microaggression studies, and extends CA research on accountability in offense construction, and on prejudicial social actions that are contested and difficult to analyze.

T1  - Express acceptance or feel anxiety? The effects of trait-related information about foreign residents on endorsement of multiculturalism
AN  - 2559712952
AB  - Apart from direct contact, people also familiarize themselves with other groups through indirect information. For example, as previous studies have revealed, indirect information on personality traits of outgroup members have influences on intergroup attitudes. Extending existing work, the current study specifically examined the effects of such indirect information on people's endorsement of multiculturalism, a set of attitudes regarding the attainment of harmonious coexistence among diverse cultural groups. Based on the Stereotype Content Model, two experiments were conducted to investigate how media coverage and social consensus information about moral, social and competence-related traits of foreign residents in China would affect local people's endorsement of multiculturalism. In experiment 1, when participants learned from the news that foreigners in China possessed high competence, they expressed more appreciation towards the cultural diversity that foreigners brought to the local society, but less support for foreign residents maintaining their own cultural traditions. In experiment 2, participants who learned that other local people perceived foreign residents as having high sociability, morality or competence showed more appreciation towards cultural diversity and more support for maintaining such diversity. Furthermore, in both experiments, perceived anxiety played a mediating role in how indirect trait-related information affected local people's support for maintaining cultural diversity. Lastly, possible explanations for some unexpected findings and implications for future research are discussed.

T1  - Everyone should get the same, but we should get more: Group entitlement and intergroup moral double standard: GPIR
AN  - 2513520398
AB  - Double standard—that is, employing a separate set of norms according to the actor’s and observer’s identity—is common in various contexts, but has not been given much empirical attention in the context of violent conflicts. We introduce group entitlement as a predictor of moral double standard in intergroup conflict. Three studies were conducted to test our research hypothesis. In Study 1, (Jewish Israelis) group entitlement predicted more lenient punishment for ingroup transgressors compared with unspecified outgroup transgressors. In Study 2, (Jewish Israelis) group entitlement predicted lower support for basic human rights for outgroup members compared with ingroup members. Study 3 replicated the results of Study 2 in the context of White Americans and African Americans, and showed that when presented with false feedback indicating substantial double standard among White Americans, high-group-entitlement participants experienced lower levels of moral emotions regarding the purported gap and were less willing to amend their responses compared with low-group-entitlement respondents. Implications of group entitlement in various contexts, its relation to existing constructs, and potential implications are discussed.

T1  - The psychology of justice buildings: A survey experiment on police architecture, public sentiment, and race
AN  - 2509311821
AB  - Empirical investigations examining how the architectural design of justice buildings impacts the public is scant and heavily skewed toward the design of penal institutions. Applying theories of hostile and welcoming building design, this study uses a survey experiment to investigate the impact that welcoming and hostile police station designs have on public affect and behaviorally relevant perceptions. Findings reveal main and interactive effects of architectural design on positive affect. Specifically, building design becomes a significant predictor of perceptions depending on an individual's self-identified racial or ethnic group, where Black and Latino respondents report greater positive emotional responses when presented with hostile as compared to welcoming building designs. However, there was no impact of building design on negative affect or behaviorally relevant perceptions to report crime. The results of this study have potential implications for impacting public perceptions about policing and improving service delivery experiences.

T1  - Intergroup Dialogues in the Landscape of Digital Societies: How Does the Dialogical Self Affect Intercultural Relations in Online Contexts?
AN  - 2576497584
AB  - The effects of intergroup dialogues on intercultural relations in digital societies and the growing conflict, inflammatory and hate speech phenomena characterizing these environments are receiving increasing attention in socio-psychological studies. Based on Allport’s contact theory, scholars have shown that online intercultural contact reduces ethnic prejudice and discrimination, although it is not yet clear when and how this occurs. By analyzing the role of the Dialogical Self in online intercultural dialogues, we aim to understand how individuals position themselves and others at three levels of inclusiveness—personal, social, and human—and how this process is associated with attitudes towards the interlocutor, intergroup bias and prejudice, whilst also considering the inclusion of the Other in the Self and ethnic/racial identity. An experimental procedure was administered via the Qualtrics platform, and data were collected among 118 undergraduate Italian students through an anonymous questionnaire. From ANOVA and moderation analysis, it emerged that the social level of inclusiveness was positively associated with ethnic/racial identity and intergroup bias. Furthermore, the human level of inclusiveness was associated with the inclusion of the Other in the Self and ethnic/racial identity, and unexpectedly, also with intergroup bias. We conclude that when people interact online as “human beings”, the positive effect of online dialogue fails, hindering the differentiation processes necessary to define one’s own and the interlocutor’s identities. We discuss the effects of intercultural dialogue in the landscape of digital societies and the relevance of our findings for theory, research and practice.

AB  - Prior research shows the importance of internalized sexual prejudice and participation in health indicators for sexual minority people, yet no research has used prospective measures or differentiated sexual minority groups. Data come from the longitudinal cohort study Growing Up Today Study 1 (N = 6,606), limited to participants who provided information on internalized sexual prejudice in adolescence and health indicators in adulthood. Completely heterosexual women with same-sex partners and mostly heterosexual women who reported high internalized sexual prejudice during their adolescence were more likely to binge drink during adulthood than completely heterosexual women with no same-sex partners. Similar patterns existed for mostly heterosexual and lesbian women when predicting smoking. Sexual orientation-related disparities in binge drinking smoking were largest for women with high internalized sexual prejudice who identify as completely heterosexual women with same-sex partners and mostly heterosexual women–groups that may have lower levels of connectedness to the buffering effects of sexual minority communities.

T1  - Demobilising by legitimising: Masculine honour, positive and negative contact, and social activism against criminal organisations: GPIR
AN  - 2390112096
AB  - Italian mafia-type groups exert governance over the community. To do so, they must engage in contact with community members. Previous research indicates that individuals’ endorsement of masculine honour values is associated with more frequent contact with members of criminal organisations (COs). The present research examines the relationship between masculine honour and both positive and negative contact, as well as the potential implications of such contact. Structural equation modelling of survey data (N = 327) revealed that masculine honour was associated with positive but not negative contact with COs’ members. Positive contact was, in turn, associated with a stronger tendency to see COs as matching the ideals of honour (romanticisation), and lower perceived threat. In contrast, negative contact was associated with stronger perceived threat from COs’ presence. Finally, romanticisation and lower perceived threat were associated with lower intentions to engage in social activism against COs. Results support the idea that cultural values of masculine honour make the presence of COs in society more acceptable and are an important predictor of contact with this type of group.

T1  - Same same but different. How the play of difference intersects female refugee support workers’ constructions of a common identity
AN  - 2407556884
AB  - As in most parts of Europe, the influx of a large number of refugees from the summer of 2015 on has greatly stirred German society and politics and deeply divided the population on how to deal with asylum seekers and immigration. This article enters this controversy by examining supporters committed to the pro-refugee side of the debate – female volunteers in refugee support work. It investigates how the volunteers interpret their relationship with refugees and adopts the social-psychological hypothesis claiming that the construction of a common identity helps decrease prejudice and facilitate intergroup relations. However, I go on to argue that manifestations of difference continuously interfere with these conceptions of ‘sameness’, as difference is fundamental for the construction of identities and meaning in general. Drawing on 22 in-depth interviews with female refugee support workers in Germany, this paper then traces how female volunteers imagine and locate ‘sameness’ and ‘difference’ when working with refugees. The article shows that while outwardly, participants are keen to develop a sense of a shared identity with the refugees, distinctions through power hierarchies or cultural or gender identities disrupt their experience in ambivalent, complex and covert ways.

T1  - Existence in Black and White: Theatrical Representation of the Varieties of Racism in Amiri Baraka’s Select Plays
AN  - 2234286265
AB  - Racial stereotyping implies a form of racist thought which finds its justification in certain biological and phenotypical characteristics. Insults and slurs are indexical of the racism embedded in the characters’ interactions. Various insinuations and expressions are loaded with racist import. Plays such as Dutchman and The Slave show how racial stereotyping in Baraka’s plays undercuts images of the sambo and the brute, and concentrates on the utmost obvious physical characteristics and skin color. Racism and racialism are both components of the racial attitudes of Baraka’s characters. Racism assumes that members of each race possess qualities specific to that race, so as to distinguish it as superior or inferior to another race. Racism draws a detailed map of differences in terms of physical, moral, and mental properties. In Baraka’s drama, racism has two main forms: one is propositional and the other is dispositional. Propositional (extrinsic) racism conveys fierce racist behavior. Dispositional (intrinsic) racism is the expression of loyalty to the ethnic group and belonging to the community. Propositional racism supposes the salience of the racial character and essence. The belief in a racial essence steers toward racial differentiation, and fosters expansive racialization and classification. The objective of this article is to address the construct of propositional racism and delineate its manifestations. It will also tackle the concept of dispositional racism, and highlight how dispositional racism is connected to principles germane to morality and relevant to community.

T1  - Islamophobia: Social Distance, Avoidance, and Threat
AN  - 2336170347
AB  - A sample of undergraduate college students (N = 610) enrolled in Introductory Sociology courses participated in a study exploring attitudes toward and social distance from persons who are Arab, Pakistani, and Muslim vis a vis other ethnic and religious groups. Data were collected between 2010 and 2016 using the Bogardus Social Distance scale and a 16-item Islamophobia scale. Respondents positioned Arabs, Pakistanis, and Muslims at the bottom of a closeness hierarchy. In multiple regression analyses where race, religion, political affiliation and preferred news source are regressed on Islamophobia scores we find that being Christian, being a Republican and watching Fox News, separately and together, significantly influence negative attitudes toward Muslims and persons from those regions, while knowing someone Muslim diminishes these views. The persistence of these sentiments is explored.

T1  - Black Female Pilot Communicative Experiences: Applications and Extensions of Co-Cultural Theory
AN  - 2206006412
AB  - The study investigates the ways in which Black female pilots experience and manage their elite status as airline transport pilots (ATPs) and as co-cultural group members. Accordingly, Orbe's (1998b) co-cultural theory is used as a frame to understand how women of color negotiate workplaces where White male cultural norms are omnipresent. Using a phenomenological approach, the communicative lived experiences of two Black female ATPs are analyzed to reveal specific co-cultural communication practices enacted. The study is offered here as a testament to engaged research-that which advances theory (i.e., extending co-cultural theorizing in a new setting) and provides pragmatic insight into important contemporary issues (i.e., increased diversity in a historically White male profession).

T1  - African American Men Theological Perspectives
AN  - 2410429335
AB  - The most outstanding characteristics of the African American male are the stereotypes promulgated by whites. He is presented in image physically, intellectually, socially, and sexually as dangerous and intolerable. Although he may have religious orientations to places of worship, he is generally held to be without commitment to theology with soundness of understanding and purpose. This study investigates the self-reported views held by African American men as a function of theology and religion. Employing a mixed descriptive-exploratory methodology, this study sets forth views held by African American men toward religion as it may impact their decision making and lives. The study findings have immediate significance to race relations as a function of religion and church holdings.

T1  - The Diffusion of Tolerance: Birth Cohort Changes in the Effects of Education and Income on Political Tolerance
AN  - 1972210515
AB  - Political tolerance--the willingness to extend civil liberties to traditionally stigmatized groups--is pivotal to the functioning of democracy and the well-being of members of stigmatized groups. Although political tolerance has traditionally been more common among American elites, we argue that as tolerance has increased, it has also diffused to less educated and less affluent segments of the population. The relative stability of political attitudes over the life course and the socialization of more recent birth cohorts in contexts of increased tolerance suggest that this diffusion of tolerance occurs across birth cohorts rather than time periods. Using age-period-cohort models and more than three and a half decades of repeated cross-sectional survey data, we find persistent and robust across-cohort declines in the importance of both income and higher education in determining levels of political tolerance. Declines in the effects of socioeconomic status are evident with tolerance toward all five out-groups in the analysis--anti-religionists, gays and lesbians, communists, militarists, and racists--but to varying degrees. These findings fit with a model of changes in public opinion, particularly views of civil and political rights, through processes of cultural diffusion and cohort replacement.

T1  - Racial equality in France and the United States: media coverage of professional tennis players
AN  - 1864677581
AB  - I engage debates about racial media bias by analysing newspaper coverage of professional tennis players in France and the United States. Tennis is an elite sport that typically does not have many non-white players and may be especially sensitive to racial boundaries. Tennis also offers a new solution to the methodological challenge of establishing that any difference in newspaper coverage across racial groups is due to bias and not actual differences across the groups. I use the professional tennis ranking system, which assigns an objective marker of how good a player is (and therefore the media coverage that s/he should receive) at any point in time. I explore two types of bias (the amount and tone of media coverage) and uncover no systematic racial differences in the relationship between ranking and media coverage. My findings have several implications for our understanding of racial boundaries and the media.

T1  - The making of tribes: The Chang and Chakhesang Nagas in India's Northeast
AN  - 1873923375
AB  - Highlighting 'pre', 'trans' and 'new' tribal formations amongst upland Nagas in India's Northeast, this article formulates both a historical critique against dominant categorisations of the region's social landscape and posits alternative ways of 'seeing' local patterns of kinship, identity and belonging. Drawing on ethno-historical perspectives from the Chang and Chakhesang Nagas, I illustrate the problematic cultural transitivity of the idea and idiom of 'tribe' which conceals the social formations that existed--and occasionally persist--before, beneath, betwixt and between categories of 'tribe'. This realisation brings us to a dilemma which, I think, ought to be at the heart of the anthropology of Nagas and of India's Northeast more widely--namely, how to account for the ethnographic observation that social organisation--both past and present--is based on interpersonal, village and clan networks which cut across tribal and ethnic groups with clearly permeable boundaries and yet most people maintain a view of the whole society as made up of partitioned, culturally coherent and historically immutable entities.

T1  - Sexual and Gender Minority Health Curricula and Institutional Support Services at U.S. Schools of Public Health
AN  - 1914570420
AB  - Limited research has examined the ways in which public health training programs equip students to address health disparities affecting the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community and other sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations. This study outlines the availability of public health curricula on SGM health topics, and the prevalence of LGBT and SGM-inclusive institutional support services across CEPH-accredited U.S. schools of public health. Content analysis of all course offerings related to gender and sexuality revealed a limited focus on sexual and gender minority health: just 4.7% of courses contained keywords indicating that LGBT or SGM health topics were covered. Similar analysis of institutional support services available at U.S. schools of public health found that only 25% of schools had LGBT student organizations, and just 19% had an office of diversity that specifically advertised LGBT or SGM-inclusive programming or services on the institution's Web site. Finally, only two of 52 schools offered an educational certificate centered on LGBT health. These findings illustrate a significant need for enhanced curricular content and institutional support services that equip public health students to address SGM health disparities. Improvement in this area may encourage future health care professionals to work to reduce these disparities, to improve SGM persons' experiences in health care settings, and to generate further research in this area.

T1  - Racial bias is associated with ingroup death rate for Blacks and Whites: Insights from Project Implicit
AN  - 1843008660
AB  - Rationale Research suggests that, among Whites, racial bias predicts negative ingroup health outcomes. However, little is known about whether racial bias predicts ingroup health outcomes among minority populations. Objective The aim of the current research was to understand whether racial bias predicts negative ingroup health outcomes for Blacks. Method We compiled racial bias responses from 250,665 Blacks and 1,391,632 Whites to generate county-level estimates of Blacks' and Whites' implicit and explicit biases towards each other. We then examined the degree to which these biases predicted ingroup death rate from circulatory-related diseases. Results In counties where Blacks harbored more implicit bias towards Whites, Blacks died at a higher rate. Additionally, consistent with previous research, in counties where Whites harbored more explicit bias towards Blacks, Whites died at a higher rate. These links between racial bias and ingroup death rate were independent of county-level socio-demographic characteristics, and racial biases from the outgroup in the same county. Conclusion Findings indicate that racial bias is related to negative ingroup health outcomes for both Blacks and Whites, though this relationship is driven by implicit bias for Blacks, and explicit bias for Whites.

T1  - Unionization and Income Growth of Racial Minority Immigrants in Canada: A Longitudinal Study: IMR
AN  - 1821571531
AB  - This study examines the effect of unionization on the labor market integration of newly arrived immigrants in Canada. We find that non-white recent immigrants gain access to unionized jobs at a slower rate than do white recent immigrants. The effect of unionization on earnings is somewhat lower for non-white recent immigrants than for white recent immigrants. These findings are based on growth curve modeling of longitudinal data from the Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID). Therefore, unionization does not contribute to reducing the earnings gap of non-white recent immigrants relative to white immigrants and the native-born.

T1  - Strangers no more. Debunking major theoretical assumptions
AN  - 1818405576
AB  - Alba and Foner's volume is an important contribution to the transatlantic dialog. In the paper I especially focus on the presented labour market outcomes in the first generation and the accomplishments of the second generation in education. What do these outcomes tell us about integration and assimilation patterns across countries? Alba and Foner's overall conclusion is that neither the theory of national integration models nor the theory of settler versus non-settler societies can explain the differences or similarities in outcomes across the six assessed countries. These theories, according to Alba and Foner, are debunked when empirically tested. I try to formulate what alternative explanations can be formulated based on the empirical data. Differences in historical institutional arrangements in education and the labour market can more accurately predict outcomes. Also differences in the dynamics between the mainstream population and immigrant groups in North America versus Western Europe are important.

T1  - Racial Identity Contestation: Mapping and Measuring Racial Boundaries
AN  - 1901158420
AB  - Survey based research typically uses a single measure of racial self-classification to study racial inequality and to make group based comparisons. Race, however, is multidimensional; experienced not only in accord with how one self-identifies, but also in relation to how one is perceived racially by others. For example, an individual can self-identify racially as Black, but be perceived by most others as non-Black. We refer to this experience as racial identity contestation. We briefly review the growing set of literature on related topics, detail the divergent approaches to measuring racial identity contestation with survey data, and compare descriptive estimates of racial identity contestation across methodological approaches. Moreover, we seek to cull others into considering the analytic utility of racial identity contestation for research on racial boundaries. We argue that a focus on racial identity contestation can be leveraged as an analytical tool to better understand the topography of ongoing racial projects by mapping social definitions of who is and is not typically perceived as a member of a particular racial group.

T1  - South Tyrol: the importance of boundaries for immigrant integration
AN  - 1792708401
AB  - Using South Tyrol as a case study, this article analyses how boundaries between groups and their institutionalisation through power-sharing arrangements affect the politics of immigrant integration. Through a longitudinal qualitative analysis of party manifestos, the article focuses on the period between 1993 and 2013 to evaluate the immigration and integration discourses of political parties, claiming to represent the German and Ladin minorities. It is argued that these parties have deliberately framed immigration as a challenge to the strength of their respective cultures and languages, as well as the array of institutions that support the separate but equal coexistence of South Tyrol's linguistic groups. The consequence of this tendency to 'think in groups' is that the main political parties of the German and Ladin minorities are shoring up group boundaries and advancing an assimilationist model of immigrant integration.

T1  - The closing of open minds: Need for closure moderates the impact of uncertainty salience on outgroup discrimination
AN  - 1796452016
AB  - In three studies, we examined how dispositional need for cognitive closure (NCC) moderates the impact of various types of uncertainty salience (personal and supraliminal in studies 1 and 2; economic and subliminal in Study 3) on implicit attitudes (studies 1 and 3) and explicit discriminatory intentions (Study 2) towards outgroup members. Across all three studies, we found that uncertainty increased discrimination against outgroups among low-NCC individuals but not among high-NCC individuals. High-NCC individuals tended to be more discriminatory irrespective of uncertainty salience. These results suggest that uncertainty salience leads individuals with a low dispositional need for closure to act like those with high need for closure. The implications of the findings for theories about how uncertainty influences social attitudes and intergroup behaviour are discussed.

T1  - Globalization, Contact, and Religious Identity: A Cross-National Analysis of Interreligious Favorability*
AN  - 1788350067
AB  - Objectives 
This article examines cross-national variation in interreligious favorability across the globe. We develop and test several hypotheses linking globalization to attitudes toward the religious other through mechanisms of religious belonging and contact. 
Methods 
Utilizing cross-national data in 20 countries from the Pew Global Attitudes Surveys (2011), we run a series of multilevel and logistic regression estimations to test our hypotheses about global contact, religious identity, and interreligious favorability. 
Results 
We find that global contact has a positive effect on interreligious favorability, whereas holding religious identity increases negative sentiments toward religious outgroups. We also find that increased levels of globalization inhibit the negative impact of religious belonging and threat perceptions on favorable views of the religious other. 
Conclusion 
Although globalization increases the salience of religion as an exclusive identity category at the expense of decreased interreligious favorability, individuals become more conducive to interreligious tolerance thanks to frequent social contact at higher levels of globalization.

T1  - Exploring the Relations Between Religious Orientation and Racial Identity Attitudes in African College Students: A Preliminary Analysis
AN  - 1780916577
AB  - As the Black African college student population increases across U.S. college campuses, helping professionals are encouraged to more clearly understand the unique identity developmental needs of these students in order to fortify their academic endeavors and contribute to their success. Both religion and race are powerful forces that shape identity, providing an overall sense of purpose, a feeling of connection with others, and a sense of community. Yet, both of these aspects of identity are rarely studied in Black African college student populations. This study examined the relations between religious orientation and racial identity attitudes in 49 Black African college students, whose diverse racial, ethnic, and religious experiences have been understudied. The results from multiple regression analyses indicated that religious orientation was significantly related to racial identity status. Specifically, intrinsic religious orientation was positively related to preencounter (i.e., pro-White, anti-Black beliefs about one's own racial group) racial identity attitudes, quest religious orientation was positively related to immersion-emersion (i.e., anti-White, pro-Black attitudes about one's own racial-cultural group) racial identity attitudes, and the relations between intrinsic religious orientation and internalization (i.e., internalized positive self-acceptance) racial identity attitudes approached significance. Recommendations for future research and implications for diversity in higher education are discussed. [web URL: http://jbs.sagepub.com/content/47/4/313.abstract]

T1  - Four Language Laws of Ukraine
AN  - 1855326229
AB  - Following the Soviet Union's dissolution, Ukrainian nation building was aided by the system of institutions inherited from the USSR, but made difficult by the Russian community in Ukraine which became a minority overnight. This presence has been felt primarily in Ukrainian-Russian language struggles. Some researchers and specialists have repeatedly pointed out that the question of languages is heavily politicised in Ukraine. The fact that it is not clearly settled can lead to the emergence of language ideologies as well as to conflicts of ethnic groups and languages. It is no coincidence that in Article 6, the Law on National Security regards the settling of the language issue as a priority among the country's national interests. Through the comparative analysis of four linguistic rights documents, this article shows how between 1989 and 2014, the Ukrainian political elite attempted to maintain social equilibrium through introducing legislation aimed to regulate language use.

T1  - The Turning Point of Tolerance: Ethnic Attitudes in a Global Perspective
AN  - 1855321096
AB  - Is diversity associated with ethnic aversion? To address this issue we employ a theoretical perspective to explain global patterns in individual ethnic attitudes. We suggest that there is a turning point of tolerance, and this could be why earlier studies differ in their conclusions. In short, we argue that up until a certain point more intergroup contact will lead to increased tolerance. However, when this threshold is reached, any further diversity will lead to less tolerance. This study applies data from all five waves of the World Values Survey, combined with the updated ethnolinguistical fractionalisation index and relevant controls. Our models reveal a threshold effect in non-Western societies, and that ethnically polarised societies are most tolerant. This finding supports the argument that conflicts taking place along ethnic lines are not caused primarily by ethnic hatred, indicating that ethnicity might be used as an instrument to create violent conflict.

T1  - Life strategies of Russia's Germans
AN  - 1790473510
AB  - The article summarizes results of a survey "Life strategies of 18-35 year old ethnic Germans residing in Russia based on their social and ethnic self-identification". Survey was held in multi-national regions of Russia with a complex ethnic composition, sizable territory and rather large area populated by the target ethnic group in a decentralized manner. Some social volunteers from Germany took part in the research activities. The survey involved analysis of migration map of young Germans living in Russia, whether they intent to emigrate from Russia and how their multi-angle ethnic identity was formed. On top, the research addresses the topic of the social status of German people moving from Russia to Germany, adaptation problems they experience and manners of getting employed. Authors use various qualitative and quantitative methods to study job strategies and career aspirations of young Germans born in Russia. Sociological interview is the main method to understand and classify national and ethnic identities of the young Germans arriving from Russia as well as to identify the role of ethnic background in the development of their cultural framework and linguistic skills.

T1  - Language as mechanism of systemic foundation: Tungus-speaking groups in the Far East
AN  - 1784138842
AB  - This article explores S. M. Shirokogoroff's critical approach to the study of language as a part of culture and a means of scientific classifications of mankind into a certain number of linguistic categories. The purpose of this article is to highlight a peculiar but rather underestimated contribution of Shirokogoroff to sociolinguistics, as his ideas were often stranded in critical relation to much that was dominant in social and linguistic thought in the first part of the twentieth century. Three dimensions of his work are mainly the focus of this article: the Ural-Altaic hypothesis, linguistic classifications, and the creation of standard languages in Soviet Russia. Finally, it discusses the applicability of Shirokogoroff's critique to the contemporary Russian nationalities' policy towards indigenous minorities.

T1  - Support for far right ideology and anti-migrant attitudes among youth in Europe: A comparative analysis
AN  - 1728660721; 201535816
AB  - The last decade has seen a notable increase in support for far right parties and an alarming rise of right-wing extremism across Europe. Drawing on a new comparative youth survey in 14 European countries, this article provides deeper insight into young people's support for nationalist and far right ideology: negative attitudes towards minorities, xenophobia, welfare chauvinism and exclusionism in relation to migrants. We first map the support for far right ideology among youth in Europe, and then use multilevel regression analysis (16,935 individuals nested in 30 locations) to investigate which individual or contextual factors are associated with a higher propensity among young people towards getting involved in far right movements.

T1  - [Mis]Placing Race in Biomedical Clinical Context: Racial Categories, Medical Research, and the Reproduction of Health Disparities
AN  - 1735658593; 201536915
AB  - Notions of racial categories as biologically significant remain persistently salient to oppressive hegemonic ideas about race, despite scientific evidence to the contrary. Biomedical and epidemiological researchers are both professionally socialized and institutionally mandated to utilize racial categories in their research design, implementation, and interpretation processes, under the premise that doing so can facilitate the development of measures to combat racial disparities in health outcomes and care. However, when aggregate data intended to illustrate racial disparities are inappropriately extrapolated to the individualized context of biomedical clinical practice, essentialist notions of racial difference are reified. This paper integrates interdisciplinary perspectives from the fields of sociology, medicine, public health, epidemiology, evolutionary biology, and biological anthropology to explore the ideological, historical, and structural contexts through which the conflation of racial categories as indicators of group-level inequities in health outcomes and care experiences with essentialized notions of biological differences between racial groups may inform disparate care at the level of individual patient encounter in biomedical clinical practice.

T1  - Toward a New Macro-Segregation? Decomposing Segregation within and between Metropolitan Cities and Suburbs
AN  - 1728662535; 201534160
AB  - This article documents a new macro-segregation, where the locus of racial differentiation resides increasingly in socio-spatial processes at the community or place level. The goal is to broaden the spatial lens for studying segregation, using decennial Census data on 222 metropolitan areas. Unlike previous neighborhood studies of racial change, we decompose metropolitan segregation into its within- and between-place components from 1990 to 2010. This is accomplished with the Theil index (H). Our decomposition of H reveals large post-1990 declines in metropolitan segregation. But, significantly, macro-segregation -- the between-place component -- has increased since 1990, offsetting declines in the within-place component. The macro component of segregation is also most pronounced and increasing most rapidly among blacks, accounting for roughly one-half of all metro segregation in the most segregated metropolitan areas of the United States. Macro-segregation is least evident among Asians, which suggests other members of these communities (i.e., middle-class or affluent ethnoburbs) have less resistance to Asians relocating there. These results on emerging patterns of macro-segregation are confirmed in fixed-effects models that control for unobserved heterogeneity across metropolitan areas. Unlike most previous studies focused on the uneven distribution of racial and ethnic groups across metropolitan neighborhoods, we show that racial residential segregation is increasingly shaped by the cities and suburban communities in which neighborhoods are embedded.

T1  - Opposing Paths to Ideology: Group-Based Relative Deprivation Predicts Conservatism Through Warmth Toward Ingroup and Outgroup Members
AN  - 1700673432; 201525988
AB  - Group-based relative deprivation (GRD) is a critical predictor of support for social change. Because resistance to change and acceptance of inequality are core features of a conservative ideology, we predicted that GRD would negatively correlate with conservatism. Moreover, given the central role affect plays in bridging the association between experiences with inequality and group-based responses, we expected that this hypothesized relationship would be mediated by intergroup emotions. We tested these hypotheses in a large national sample of Maori (N = 685)-the indigenous peoples of New Zealand. As predicted, GRD was indirectly associated with conservatism through participants' warmth toward the majority outgroup (i.e., New Zealand Europeans) and the minority ingroup (i.e., Maori): whereas GRD was negatively correlated with warmth toward outgroup members, GRD was positively correlated with warmth toward the ingroup. In turn, warmth toward the (a) outgroup and (b) ingroup was positively and negatively associated with conservatism, respectively. Similar results were obtained when replacing conservatism with participants' (a) satisfaction with the government and (b) support for New Zealand's main center-right political party. Our findings demonstrate the complex relationship between GRD and political beliefs, while also highlighting the crucial role of emotions in connecting GRD with group-based attitudes.

T1  - Reflexive Ethnicities: Crisis, Diversity and Re-Composition
AN  - 1786264692
AB  - This paper presents an analysis of how people reflexively relate to their ethnicity in the context of cultural and political crisis after the 7/7 bombings in London in 2005. Introducing a differentiated conception of reflexivity following Archer and Lash, the paper shows how cognitive, hermeneutic and aesthetic reflexivity (Lash) are expressed autonomously, communicatively and in a meta-reflexive manner (Archer) variably across and within ethnicities. Differentiated reflexive expressions of ethnicity are rooted in the politics and histories of ethnicities in relation to dominant discourses of whiteness and Britishness. The data is from a qualitative interview study of how different ethnic groups in West Yorkshire were affected by the 7/7 London bombings, with people of African-Caribbean, Black- African, Bangladeshi, Indian Pakistani and White backgrounds. The increased reflexivity of ethnic identity is seen to be rooted in the political crises generated by Britain's role in and response to, the war on terror, but also biographical experiences of contextual continuities, discontinuities and incongruities of migration.

T1  - Ukrainian Ethnicity and Language Interactions in Saskatchewan
AN  - 1749279255
AB  - This paper explores the reported ethnic self-identity of Saskatchewan residents with Ukrainian ancestry, the role of the Ukrainian language in  this identity, and the correlation between the factors of ethnic identity, Ukrainian language proficiency, age, gender, and generation. The results show that most participants (Saskatchewan residents with Ukrainian ancestry) identify themselves as “Ukrainian Canadians,” about a quarter of respondents identify themselves as “Ukrainian,” and about 15% as “Canadian.” The results confirm the importance of language in the construction of ethnicity. Most individuals with self-identified “Ukrainian” and “Ukrainian Canadian” ethnicities had Ukrainian as their sole mother tongue in childhood, whereas individuals who self-identify as “Canadian” did not. The use and knowledge of Ukrainian, as well as the level of comfort with the language, are the highest in the “Ukrainian” ethnic group, followed by the “Ukrainian Canadian” group, and are the lowest in the “Canadian” and “Other” groups. The study shows that the immigrant generation, gender, and experience with bilingual schools are also contributing social factors in perceived ethnic self-identity. The results suggest that the opportunities to take Ukrainian language courses in Saskatchewan could be improved. The study helps to establish the components of Ukrainian Canadian ethnicity and explore its diversity and complexity, particularly in relationship to the maintenance of the Ukrainian language.

T1  - Reflecting on Heterosexual and Male Privilege: Interventions to Raise Awareness
AN  - 1667950798; 201513026
AB  - Gender-focused college courses seek to increase understanding of the systematic advantages associated with dominant group membership. These courses attempt to reduce prejudice and raise awareness of male and heterosexual privilege. Inclusion of privilege content within gender-focused courses has increased, but research to test interventions to increase privilege awareness and reduce prejudice remains sparse. The current studies provide experimental information about awareness of heterosexual privilege (Study 1) and male privilege (Study 2) and specific interventions for use in education, professional development, and community settings. Study 1 found the video intervention was effective in increasing heterosexual privilege awareness and internal motivation to respond without prejudice. Study 2 found that male privilege awareness was significantly increased and modern sexism was reduced by the video intervention. Findings provide information for applied practices such as pedagogical strategies when designing diversity courses and training workshops. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Why Is There No Income Gap between the Hui Muslim Minority and the Han Majority in Rural Ningxia, China?
AN  - 1667949215; 201509516
AB  - Using a household sample survey for 2006, this article shows that the Hui population in the rural part of Ningxia Autonomous Region in China is disadvantaged compared to the Han majority as regards length of education and household per capita wealth. Yet, there is no gap in average disposable incomes between the two ethnic groups and poverty rates are very similar. This paradox is owing to members of Hui households earning more off-farm income than members of Han households. In particular, young Hui males living in poor villages have a remarkably high likelihood of migrating, thereby bringing back income to their households. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Visualizing minimal ingroup and outgroup faces: Implications for impressions, attitudes, and behavior
AN  - 1551001013; 201428848
AB  - More than 40 years of research have shown that people favor members of their ingroup in their impressions, attitudes, and behaviors. Here, we propose that people also form different mental images of minimal ingroup and outgroup members, and we test the hypothesis that differences in these mental images contribute to the well-established biases that arise from minimal group categorization. In Study 1, participants were assigned to 1 of 2 groups using a classic minimal group paradigm. Next, a reverse correlation image classification procedure was used to create visual renderings of ingroup and outgroup face representations. Subsequently, a 2nd sample naive to the face generation stage rated these faces on a series of trait dimensions. The results indicated that the ingroup face was significantly more likely than the outgroup face to elicit favorable impressions (e.g., trusting, caring, intelligent, attractive). Extending this finding, Study 2 revealed that ingroup face representations elicited more favorable implicitly measured attitudes than did outgroup representations, and Study 3 showed that ingroup faces were trusted more than outgroup faces during an economic game. Finally, Study 4 demonstrated that facial physiognomy associated with trustworthiness more closely resembled the facial structure of the average ingroup than outgroup face representation. Together, these studies suggest that minimal group distinctions can elicit different mental representations, and that this visual bias is sufficient to elicit ingroup favoritism in impressions, attitudes and behaviors.

T1  - Out-group trust and conflict understandings: The perspective of Turks and Kurds in Turkey
AN  - 1559007779; 201432078
AB  - Conflict reconciliation is difficult in the absence of out-group trust. The current study is concerned with the prolonged Turkish-Kurdish conflict in Turkey and examines out-group trust among both ethnic Kurds and ethnic Turks, in relation to perceptions and interpretations of the conflict (i.e. conflict frames, attributions of responsibility, and justified in-group violence), and to their ethnic and national identification. The results indicate that, across groups, participants had lower out-group trust when they agreed more that the conflict was between ethnic Turks and Kurds, when they blamed the other ethnic group more, and when they considered the in-group violence more justified. In addition, for the Kurds, higher national identification, stronger endorsement of the terrorism frame, higher responsibility attribution to the PKK and lower attributed responsibility to foreign powers were associated with higher trust of the Turks. In contrast, for the Turks, higher national identification and lower attributed responsibility to foreign powers were associated with lower trust of the Kurds. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Reviving agency: taking time and making space for rethinking diversity and inclusion
AN  - 1542002170; 201426881
AB  - The path of social inclusion has proven difficult for minority groups in the European context. In this article, we focus on the inclusion of refugees, particularly in the labor market, and show how the difficulties they faced were related to dominant discourses on migration. Uncovering the hegemonic assumptions within these discourses is crucial in order to enable a rethinking of diversity issues and inclusion. We addressed this through an intervention research, which was part of an empowerment project for refugees. The research included and connected refugees engaged in searching for work to Dutch professionals engaged with diversity issues. Through social intervention, this research aimed to create empowerment through critical reflection on the ways that the power of dominant discourses works in the practice of everyday life. By contrasting the discursive positioning of participants with different backgrounds, the research created alternative spaces for reflection. This, in turn, led to the production of alternative narratives and allowed participants to claim agency in the face of the dominant discourses. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Paths into and out of poverty among immigrants in Sweden
AN  - 1520339946; 201413356
AB  - In this article I analyse longitudinal patterns of relative poverty among the foreign-born in Sweden, with data drawn from the register-based LINDA dataset. The descriptive statistics suggest that immigrants stay in poverty longer than poor natives do, just as they more often fall back into poverty. Poverty transitions are more frequently associated with employment transition among immigrants than among natives, while other trigger events are more prevalent among natives who experience poverty transition. Conditional transition rates of all the events associated with poverty exits and entries are more favourable for natives. The multivariate analysis shows that poverty is stickier among immigrants even after controlling for the observable characteristics, but the degree of disadvantage relative to natives varies greatly by immigrant group. Longer duration of stay and living with a Swedish-born adult are both beneficial in the context of poverty dynamics.

T1  - The History of Toddy Drinking and Its Effects on Indian Labourers in Colonial Malaya, 1900-1957
AN  - 1767328624; 201606027
AB  - At present, studies on the history of Indians in colonial Malaya have been described as one-dimensional, with the discussion mainly focusing on their arrival as immigrant groups and their involvement in the plantation sector. Other aspects of Indian history in colonial Malaya were not given proper emphasis, especially on matters considered taboo, such as those arising from toddy consumption. Even though it was acknowledged as a form of social ill, its history is rarely discussed. The introduction and supply of toddy in almost all estates at the time led to consequences that affected the quality of life of the estate labour community. This study, realising the situation, draws attention to the history of the development of toddy drinking and its effects among the Indian estate labourers in Malaya from 1900 to 1957. This study also highlights the reactions that existed on the issue of toddy and British action. In summary, this study seeks to prove that the over indulgence of toddy among Indian labourers developed at a rapid pace in Malaya, and not in India. The key information behind this situation is the growth of toddy shops in every plantation with Indian settlers, as well as British interests that wished to maintain a profitable industry, such as toddy.

T1  - Amartya Sen's Identity Pluralism Applied to Will Kymlicka's Liberal Multiculturalism
AN  - 1718068002; 201530791
AB  - Multicultural theory pays surprisingly little attention to the plurality of identity. In addition, there is still dissatisfaction with Will Kymlicka's distinction between polyethnic groups and national minorities and the rights they deserve, as well as continued criticism of liberal multiculturalism more broadly. I revisit this distinction based on Amartya Sen's recent effort to introduce the notion of identity pluralism into liberal debates. In Identity and Violence: The Illusion of Destiny (W.W. Norton and Company, New York, 2006), Sen stresses the importance of maintaining political stability through individuals' plural identities mainly in relation to religious divides and global conflict. Sen's theory is criticised for being too abstract, but I interpret these abstract ideas to criticise Kymlicka's distinction between polyethnic groups and national minorities and strengthen liberal multiculturalism. I argue that the notion of identity pluralism implies that a state must promote multicultural 'participation rights' for all minority identities, rather than 'accommodation rights' for polyethnic groups and 'self-government rights' for national minorities as Kymlicka contends. Consequently, regions like Quebec, Flanders and Catalonia would not merit the level of autonomy they currently enjoy, and Scotland should not be granted independence from the United Kingdom.

T1  - LEGITIMACY AND THE CONTINGENT DIFFUSION OF WORLD CULTURE: DIVERSITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN SOCIAL SCIENCE TEXTBOOKS, DIVERGENT CROSS-NATIONAL PATTERNS (1970-2008)
AN  - 1718064566; 201530676
AB  - Over the 20th century the celebration of both human rights and the rights of diverse minorities have become central features of an emerging world culture. Using multilevel modeling I empirically test whether nation-state legitimacy, measured on security, political, and cultural dimensions, influences emphases on diversity and human rights in national curricula. The data consist of 501 high school history, civics, and social studies textbooks from 67 countries published between 1970-2008. I find that discussions of human rights are on the rise in all countries, particularly in less legitimate ones. In contrast, discussions of the rights of diverse groups are lower in less legitimate countries. These findings provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between globalization and education; the spread of world culture is mediated by both the nature of the element being diffused, in this case diversity or human rights, and nation-state legitimacy.

T1  - IMPACT OF USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN MATHEMATICS LESSONS ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND ATTITUDES
AN  - 1551001755; 201428807
AB  - Technology use in classrooms in today's world is believed to have a positive impact on students' success and their attitudes towards lessons. In this study, the authors have investigated students' attitudes towards technology use in class and whether the use of technology improved their academic achievement. A quasiexperimental research design was used and they assigned 3 groups as experimental groups (n = 41) and 2 as control groups (n = 41). Mathematics was selected as the subject to be studied. All groups completed a pretest and a posttest. For the experimental groups, lessons were designed using several technological tools, whereas lessons for control groups were taught using traditional teaching methods. At the end of the study, the experimental groups completed a scale to investigate the preferences and attitudes of the students in regard to technology-based instruction. Results showed that, students had a positive attitude towards technology use. The implications for curriculum designers and teachers are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Are Student Protests in Arab States Caused by Economic and Political Grievances? Empirical Evidence from the 2006-07 Arab Barometer
AN  - 1531931776; 201424894
AB  - We investigate the nature of protests by students (age 18 and older) in Algeria, Jordan, Morocco, and Yemen by using subsamples of students from nationally representative and acclaimed public opinion data (the 2006-07 Arab Barometer). We find between 22.1% (Jordan) and 54.7% (Yemen) participated in either the signing of petitions, or marching in street protests, or both between the years 2003-07. To explain student protest participation, we draw from the political economy literature to test four grievance-based hypotheses that link protest to student perceptions on the performance of the economy, personal family socioeconomic status, political exclusion, and preference for democracy. Ordered probit regression analyses indicate that students protest for different reasons in the four countries. We find statistical evidence that student protests are associated with grievances about the economy (Algeria and Morocco) and lack of democracy (Algeria only). Joint hypothesis tests reveal that the four grievances jointly matter in Algeria, Morocco, and Yemen but not Jordan. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Guarding Our Borders with Gardasil: Immigrant Women and Physical Autonomy
AN  - 1520336455; 201419678
AB  - The invisibility of immigrant women's health care and justice needs, which are directly related to the triple oppression they face and intersectional identities they hold, is highlighted by the silence surrounding a requirement that they be immunized against cervical cancer with the controversial vaccination, Gardasil. Such a requirement was the unintended consequence of a statutory mandate colliding with an agency recommendation, and it disproportionately burdened women and girls emigrating from Mexico. A quiet and far-reaching coalition used unconventional means to get the policy reversed and opened new ways for scholars to understand potential responses to agency-level injustices for groups marginalized by dominant discourses of public health and immigration.

T1  - 'We are Human Beings, and have a Past': The 'Adjustment' of Migrants and the Australian Assimilation Policies of the 1950s
AN  - 1512219683; 201408780
AB  - This article argues that the assimilation policy adopted by the Australian government during the 1950s was based on a denial of a migrant's past. The assumption that the migrant would readily merge into Australian cultural life ignored the ways in which past stories and memories shape the self. Through an analysis of the Good Neighbour Councils I explore the nature of assimilation that was based on a neglect of collective war memories of immigrant groups. This perspective is distinguished from that adopted by several theorists of the day such as W.D. Borrie and Jean Martin whose studies were less crude and one-dimensional. The experiences of Greek migrants are examined to consider how Greek war stories could not often find expression or recognition in the assimilationist climate of the post-war period.

T1  - 'Here are the Gypsies!' The importance of self-representations and how to question prominent images of Gypsy minorities
AN  - 1551000659; 201429124
AB  - Gypsy, Roma or traveller minorities remain a group that is still homogenized as the 'other'1. The European imagination continues to be entrenched in the spectacle of their difference -- images of weddings, musicians, funerals and fights are fascinating and are thus prioritized. But what would happen if the cameras were given to these people themselves? What if they became the image-makers? This article examines how ethnic studies might contribute to breaking the mould of the exoticized Gypsy through self-representations. The study here formed part of an ethnographic project among primary school pupils in Hungary. Using the photo elicitation method, children were given disposable cameras producing 451 photographs that then formed the basis of interviews. The results reveal very few indicators that could be described as significantly or distinctively divided into 'Gypsy' or 'non-Gypsy' identifications, questioning the status of difference in discourses around such minorities.

T1  - Beyond community: An analysis of social capital and the social networks of Brazilian migrants in Amsterdam
AN  - 1504424023; 201405526
AB  - This article scrutinizes the social networks and the social capital invested within these, of a relatively new and understudied immigrant group in the North European context. The study shows how the social networks of Brazilian immigrants in Amsterdam are segmented along strong dividing lines, especially surrounding legal status. This segmentation has different outcomes for migrants, and within these segments, variation also exists. By analysing in-depth interviews with 30 Brazilian immigrants in Amsterdam, the study finds that a Brazilian community does not exist, and that assistance, non-assistance and a commercialization of social relations all take place at the same time among the social networks of Brazilians in Amsterdam. The analysis also uncovers some of the mechanisms related to these processes and hence adds relevant insights to the literature that studies the contexts in which immigrant social networks provide for social mobility and the contexts in which such networks do not.

T1  - In Ireland 'Latin Americans are kind of cool': Evaluating a national context of reception with a transnational lens
AN  - 1494749282; 201402089
AB  - In this article, I analyze how government policies and social reception shaped Latin Americans' patterns of incorporation and identity formation in Ireland, a new immigrant destination country in Europe where Latin American migrants lack both historical presence and (neo)colonial linkages, in the early 2000s. I show that Latin Americans in Ireland perceived a weaker form of racialization, not only than several other immigrant, refugee and racial groups there, but also than Latin Americans going to the USA, Spain, and (for Brazilians) Portugal. I then argue that these results illustrate how many Latin American migrants are now embedded within a transnational social field that connects flows of people and ideas across several different receiving countries -- both traditional and new -- which in turn shapes their relative evaluations of individual national receiving 'contexts of reception'. I conclude by examining the implications of these results for immigration and Latino Studies scholarship. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Immigrant perceptions of ethnic and racial discrimination: patterns and singularities in a municipality in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area
AN  - 1463010277; 201345837
AB  - In Portugal, studies on discrimination against immigrants have focused almost exclusively either on the indigenous population, or on the foreign population. The former have tended to deploy quantitative and extended methodologies, while the latter studies have opted predominantly for qualitative or intensive methodologies, focusing on particular groups. There are few studies in which the immigrant population is extensively surveyed, covering its diverse origins, life trajectories, and social position in the host society. In this analysis we examine the main factors that shape the perceptions of ethnic and racial discrimination among immigrant groups living in the Oeiras municipality in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. This analysis is based on a quantitative analysis of a survey of 422 immigrants, of whom approximately half reported having been discriminated against since their arrival in Portugal. The study is focused on three main explanations related to predictive variables: sociographic, acculturation/cultural proximity, and opportunities for contact with the autochthonous population. A multivariate logistic regression demonstrates that there is a statistically significant relationship between perceived discrimination and some sociographic variables including cultural proximity, especially for Brazilians.

T1  - The antecedents and consequences of racial/ethnic discrimination during adolescence: Does the source of discrimination matter?
AN  - 1494749629; 201401990
AB  - In the current study, we examined the precursors and consequences of discrimination for 876 Latino, African American, and Asian American adolescents (Mage = 16.9 years, SD = 0.43). The race/ethnic characteristics of schools and neighborhoods influenced adolescents' perceptions of the race/ethnic climates of these contexts. In turn, adolescents who viewed climates more negatively were more likely to perceive discriminatory treatment by school personnel, peers, and societal institutions. Discrimination from these 3 sources exerted differential influence on developmental outcomes: Greater discrimination from school personnel was associated with poorer academic performance, greater discrimination from peers was associated with more psychological maladjustment, and greater societal discrimination was associated with heightened racial awareness. Relations were consistent across race/ethnic groups and gender. Implications for intervening to reduce racial discrimination and other social stigmas are discussed.

T1  - Sexual Orientation Microaggressions and the Experience of Sexual Minorities
AN  - 1463015040; 201345853
AB  - This qualitative study sought to confirm and expand on previous research on sexual orientation microaggressions-subtle discrimination in the form of verbal, behavioral, and environmental slights and indignities as defined by Sue (2010). The study had two primary research questions: Does the data from the sample validate Sue's (2010) typology of sexual orientation microaggressions? Beyond Sue's (2010) typology, are other themes/types of sexual orientation microaggressions present in the data? Using a focus group methodology, data was collected from a sample of self-identified non-heterosexual college students (N = 12). Data analysis confirmed five previously identified themes from Sue's (2010) typology (Endorsement of Heteronormative Culture, Sinfulness, Homophobia, Heterosexist Language/Terminology, and Oversexualization) and demonstrated two new themes (Undersexualization and Microaggressions as Humor). The implications of sexual orientation microaggressions, along with limitations and future research directions, are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Positive or negative ethnic encounters in urban neighbourhoods? A photo experiment on the net impact of ethnicity and neighbourhood context on attitudes towards minority and majority residents
AN  - 1463013089; 201345800
AB  - Using data from a new factorial survey experiment, we study the mechanisms that drive negative interethnic attitudes in urban neighbourhood encounters. Specifically, we examine the extent to which the general impression made by a resident depends on the ethnicity of that resident and on the aspects of the neighbourhood environment. Majority and minority respondents in the Netherlands judged pictures and descriptions of fictitious neighbourhood residents, in which the ethnicity of the resident varied independently of other resident characteristics (i.e., work status, religion and problem behaviour) and the neighbourhood environment (i.e., physical disorder and ethnic and socioeconomic composition). We show that outcomes depend largely on the ethnicity of the respondent who experiences the encounters. For majority respondents, we find a main net effect of resident ethnicity: native Dutch are less positive about Surinamese residents. Furthermore, we find some support for the normative fit hypothesis that states that minority respondents are less positively evaluated in stereotype-consistent neighbourhood environments: native Dutch are less positive about Moroccan residents encountered in low-status neighbourhoods.

T1  - 'May we bring harmony'? Thatcher's legacy on 'race'
AN  - 1448995264; 201342799
AB  - The legacy of Margaret Thatcher, one of the most controversial prime ministers of the twentieth century, can be found today in the way that nativism has become part of national discourse. She was responsible for ushering in, following the 'riots' of 1981 and the Scarman report, policies based on funding the religious and cultural 'needs' of different ethnic groups -- which finally broke down black politics and also paved the way for cultural separatism, now deemed problematic. And it was on her watch that the New Right, who espoused a cultural as opposed to a biological racism, working from academia, through Conservative think-tanks to a multitude of newspapers, gained ground in a battle against cultural pluralism and anti-racism. It was this changing of the terms of debate on race that has allowed current Tory politicians and 'opinion-formers' to take the UK backwards towards monoculturalism and assimilation.

T1  - Discrimination between the rich and the poor under contrasting conditions of wealth stratification
AN  - 1433108663
AB  - Using minimal group procedures, 2 studies investigated money allocations made by rich/poor group members in wealth stratifications based on group chance, group merit, and individual merit. Study 1 participants were assigned to rich or poor groups based on a coin toss (group-chance) or on performance of each group on a test (group-merit). Study 2 participants completed a test ostensibly distinguishing between high/low effortful individuals. High-effort individuals were assigned to the rich group, low-effort individuals were assigned to the poor group (individual-merit). After personally receiving play money, participants distributed their money to the rich and the poor. Results show that wealth based on group chance, group merit, and individual merit yielded contrasting patterns of parity and discriminatory behaviors.

T1  - The Ta'arof Tournament: cultural performances of ethno-national identity at a diasporic summer camp
AN  - 1417525471; 201331990
AB  - Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork, interviews and audio recordings at a US summer camp by and for Iranian-heritaged youth, this paper analyses the construction of ethno-national identity during the 'Ta'arof Tournament', a popular camp activity that literally makes sport of the Iranian custom of self-effacement, politeness and hospitality. A repertoire of six ta'arof strategies is identified: (a) reliance on pre-existing, commonly used ta'arof phrases, (b) 'code-switching' between English and Persian, (c) body gestures, (d) novel, hyperbolic 'ta'arof-style' phrases, (e) exaggerated 'Iranian' accents and (f) subversive and humorous re-enactments of life in immigrant households. Camp participants embrace, renew and transform the quintessentially 'Iranian' custom of ta'arof while self-consciously performing for one another. Despite scholarship that relies on 'cultural trauma' and 'stigma' to explain identity 'loss' among immigrant groups, these findings reveal that the ironic, tender cultural performance of 'rituals' like ta'arof serve as powerful source material for group affinity and belonging in diaspora. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1512220223; 201409942
AB  - Through in-depth interviews with Chinese working-class immigrant women, this study highlights the meanings of their Chinatown community and adjustment to U.S. life. By adopting a phenomenological approach, three themes based on the trope of the American Dream emerged that illustrated these women's experiences with compounded immobilities, structural injustice, and racial antagonisms. Nonetheless, the interviews evidence resilience in the theme of a "wobbly bed" with implications for national immigration policies and intercultural communication models.

T1  - Multiculturalism in America, Australia and India
AN  - 1494300681; 201402128
AB  - Originally associated with the Left as academic reform and curriculum change, multiculturalism subsequently came to be accepted as study of the philosophy, literature and art of cultures. It got the status of official policy at all levels in the US and other democratic countries. It has been successful in the three democracies, America, Australia and India. India, as the most ancient of the three multicultural societies, has several cultures merging over the centuries, new cultures evolving, and several others co-existing today. There is a Hindu majority despite foreign incursions, Hinduism being the most tolerant religion that does not resort to conversions. America and Australia have Christian majority. The multiple ethnic groups in America and Australia are allowed to practise their individual religions. The occasional ethnic conflicts notwithstanding, the three multicultural societies are advancing as modern nations, interacting with each other.

T1  - Some Factors Shaping the Expansion of Hutterite Colonies in Alberta Since the Repeal of the Communal Property Act in 1973
AN  - 1494299729; 201402026
AB  - The Hutterites are a religious sect, an ethnic group, and a communal brotherhood. Since their arrival in North America in 1874, they have resisted assimilation and held onto their language, their schools and socialization processes, their clothing and their lifestyle. Two clan groups of Hutterites relocated to Alberta in 1918. During and after World War Two, the freedom of these Hutterites to buy land on which to establish new colonies was curtailed by legislation. It was not until 1973 that the incoming Lougheed government repealed the Communal Property Act. This paper describes Hutterite expansion during the past thirty-five years and examines the changing context in which their locational decisions have been made. First, the attitudes of the main "actors" -- the government, the Hutterites and the people of Alberta -- are evaluated, and then some of the issues that have remained contentious are examined.

T1  - Francophone Minority Communities and Immigrant Integration in Canada: Rethinking the Normative Foundations
AN  - 1494298471; 201402057
AB  - This paper addresses one particular feature of Canada's accommodation of diversity-the existence of French-language communities outside of Quebec and New Brunswick-to show how there continues to be conceptual difficulties in reconciling Canada's many diversities. More specifically, we are concerned with conceptual ambiguities associated with the place of these minority communities in Canada's constitutive political sociology, and difficulties in promoting a coherent set of policies for their flourishing. Moreover, this paper will not simply rehash arguments about their formal and conceptual status. We are interested in illuminating a recent initiative that seeks to direct immigrants to these communities in the hope of maintaining their overall percentage of the Canadian population. This is a development that has received little attention to date from the perspective of the scholarship of multiculturalism and minority rights, and political theory more generally. We argue that the strategy to target Francophone minority communities as 'sites' of integration represents a false promise for both these communities and immigrants. This article will show that the federal framework of 'multiculturalism within a bilingual framework' obscures the realities confronting Francophone minority communities and thus their capacity to integrate newcomers, on both empirical and normative grounds.

T1  - Translating to Communicate with Linguistic Minorities: State Obligations under International Law
AN  - 1448992879; 201342905
AB  - In the on-going debate about language rights, the role of translation remains somewhat of a blind spot. And yet, because there are very few truly monolingual societies in the world, any language policy implies a translation policy. Translation policies will vary from place to place, and they are often the result of ad hoc choices by policy makers at the local level. Even so, by looking at international law, we can find a sort of lowest common denominator for what is to be expected of translation policies. Sources of international law that can have an effect in shaping domestic policies include treaties/conventions and the judicial decisions of international tribunals. In Europe, in particular, a number of regional treaties from the Council of Europe weigh on translation as an instrument to guarantee the rights of minority speakers. The European Union -- with its own treaties, regulations and directives -- also helps set minimum standards for domestic translation policies. We will see that in Europe translation is usually cast as a means to secure other rights. Unfortunately, international law seems to set a rather low bar for this, with the most explicit protections afforded in the judicial realm but with relatively little elsewhere.

T1  - Gauging the implications of the Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting
AN  - 1315600378; 201307714
AB  - Although the recent shooting incident at the Wisconsin Sikh temple (gurudwara) has received country-wide sympathy from both American leaders and the people, the incident sparked debates on how to control hate crimes which seem to be taking its toll on the Sikh community in the US, especially after 9/11 terrorist attacks. Jacobs and Potter (1997) are of the opinion that 'the term "hate crime"... actually refers to criminal behaviour motivated, not by hate, but by prejudice, [and]... is meant to distinguish criminal conduct motivated by prejudices from criminal conduct motivated by lust, jealousy, greed, politics, and so forth.' According to them, 'unlike theft, burglary, or assault, hate crime emphasizes the offender's attitudes, values, and character.' In that sense, the Wisconsin shooting poses the question of whether it was a case of 'hate crime' against the Sikhs or of 'mistaken' identity of this minority community for Muslims, which need to be examined in the context of how to preserve the core American values of ensuring the safety of its citizens -- both the mainstream population as well as the minority communities.

T1  - University Education as a Compensation Strategy Among Second-Generation Immigrants
AN  - 1283643133; 201303482
AB  - The aim of this study is to determine whether immigrants and their children use a compensation strategy that involves achieving higher than expected education, given their parents' level of education and income. The study uses data for all individuals in Sweden who finished elementary school from 1990 to 1992. Parents' level of education and income is in general positively associated with higher odds of having university education. However, some immigrant groups show the reverse pattern of the impact of parents' income. The results support a compensation strategy developed in groups and families with low level of integration in the labor market. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Grounded' politics: Manifesting Muslim identity as a political factor and localized identity in Copenhagen
AN  - 1448996364; 201342935
AB  - A prominent strand within current migration research argues that, to understand the participation of immigrants in their host societies, we must focus on their incorporation into the cities in which they settle. This article narrows the perspective further by focusing on the role that immigrants play within one particular neighbourhood: Norrebro in the Danish capital, Copenhagen. The article introduces the concept of grounded politics to analyse how groups of Muslim immigrants in Norrebro use the space, relationships and history of the neighbourhood for identity political statements. The article further describes how national political debates over the Muslim presence in Denmark affect identity political manifestations within Norrebro. By using Duncan Bell's concept of mythscape (Bell, 2003), the article shows how some political actors idealize Norrebro's past to contest the present ethnic and religious diversity of the neighbourhood and, further, to frame what they see as the deterioration of genuine Danish identity.

T1  - Relationship closeness and control as determinants of pleasant amae
AN  - 1283639488; 201303185
AB  - Japanese often find it pleasant when someone engages in amae, defined as an inappropriate request with the expectation of acceptance. Using a random sampling survey, we examined why Japanese adults feel good when a friend or an acquaintance engages in amae and when they, themselves, engage in amae. In both situations, positive attitude toward amae predicted more positive emotions. Relationship closeness and feeling of control mediated this association, and perceiving enough resources to grant the request did so only in the friend/acquaintance amae situation. Despite its inappropriateness, amae could be an effective way to seek help and express closeness with others. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - How does Conflict in Migrants' Country of Origin Affect Remittance-Sending? Financial Priorities and Transnational Obligations Among Somalis and Pakistanis in Norway
AN  - 1221414289; 201243993
AB  - This article examines how conflict in the country of origin interacts with other factors in shaping migrants' remittance-sending practices. Our data come from a survey of 10 immigrant groups in Norway and semi-structured interviews with Somali and Pakistani remittance-senders and receivers. First, we conduct an in-depth comparison to explore the differences in how Somali and Pakistani migrants decide about remittance-sending. Second, we use survey data on all 10 migrant groups to evaluate whether the differences that are not explained by socioeconomic characteristics, may partly reflect whether or not there is ongoing conflict in the country of origin. In our analyses we differentiate between (1) the effect of migrants' capacity to remit and their prioritizing of local and transnational expenditures, and (2) the impact of state collapse and absence of human security on migrants' and refugees' desire to remit. We find that ongoing conflict in the country of origin exerts an upward pressure on remittance-sending. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - European organizations and minority rights in Europe: On transforming the securitization dynamic
AN  - 1438553947; 201340218
AB  - Minority rights conditionality has been seen by scholars as a key part of the EU enlargement process. While the focus on minority rights has largely been discussed in terms of democracy and even human rights, this article argues that conditionality was a result of the securitization of minorities rather than part of an agenda to protect or empower. In this article, we look at the methods of desecuritization as factors of 'narratives, norms and nannies'. In response to Paul Roe's conclusions about the impossibility of desecuritizing societal security, we examine whether the EU, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe have the ability to change the societal dynamics among ethnic groups in such a way as to make the desecuritization of societal security more likely. Overall, we illustrate how a focus on 'deconstructivist' and 'constructivist' approaches to societal security has failed to make European organizations important transformative actors in interethnic relations.

T1  - Racism and Social Capital: The Implications for Social and Physical Well-Being
AN  - 1125223745; 201240361
AB  - Racism can be manifest at the cultural, institutional and individual levels, and can exert effects at the intrapersonal level if targeted individuals internalize attitudes toward their own racial/ethnic groups. The general aim of this article is to examine the ways in which all levels of racism undermine the development of peer relations, one component of social capital; and consequently affect the health and well-being of targeted individuals. The evidence suggests that cultural racism inculcates attitudes that may foster race-related social distancing; institutional racism isolates individuals from the opportunities to develop the skills needed to develop cross race-relations and promotes engagement with peers who exhibit antisocial behavior; interpersonal racism may erode the quality of routine interpersonal exchanges and engender anxiety about interacting with cross-race peers; and internalized racism may undermine the benefits of cross-race peer interactions. To the degree that racism affects the ability to form, maintain and benefit from peer relationships, it can contribute to racial disparities in economic, social and health-related outcomes and undermine the types of social cohesion that promote national unity.

T1  - Ethnic Residential Clusters in Nima, Ghana
AN  - 1221407435; 201243965
AB  - The global debate on ethnic residential segregation has focused more on the developed world, and little is known about similar patterns and processes in African cities. This is in spite of the fact that many African cities are now ranked among the world's most rapidly growing and least regulated urban areas. Indeed, the dynamics of ethnic residential segregation have scarcely been studied in African cities. The little literature available has looked at ethnic segregation between the neighbourhoods of major cities. This paper goes beyond current literature by examining the pattern and processes of ethnic clustering within a multi-ethnic community. Our goal in this paper is to answer the question as to whether within a multi-ethnic urban neighbourhood the major ethnic groups are residentially clustered, isolated or dispersed. The focus is on Nima, a major slum community of Accra, Ghana. The findings of the study show that even though Nima is a multi-ethnic community, some level of ethnic clustering can be discerned. These patterns are linked to the history of settlement formation, religious affiliation and ethnic or place of origin of earlier house owners. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'The Image of Scotland which We Cherish in Our Hearts': Burns Anniversary Celebrations in Colonial Otago
AN  - 1023030114; 201223801
AB  - Scottish migrants fostered a range of cultural activities in the new worlds in which they settled, thereby identifying themselves as a distinct ethnic group. Celebrations of Scotland's national bard, Robert Burns, were the one recurring theme within all sites of settlement. The iconic figure of Burns is, in fact, central to the formulation, expression and commemoration of a Scottish cultural identity around the world. The present article explores the function of Burns celebrations in colonial Otago, the Scottish heartland of New Zealand. The celebrations were a key part of the Scots' associational culture in Otago, serving as an important social occasion within the Scottish community bounds and in wider Otago society. Moreover, the celebrations were effective sites of memory, employing familiar memory narratives and practices; these framed events and provided the initial common denominator that bound Scots and non-Scots together. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Diversity Is in the Eye of the Beholder: How Concern for the In-Group Affects Perceptions of Racial Diversity
AN  - 925713861; 201204234
AB  - The reported studies suggest that concern for the in-group motivates Asian Americans and African Americans to define diversity specifically, that is, as entailing both minorities' numerical and hierarchical representation, while motivating White Americans to define diversity broadly, that is, as entailing either minorities' high numerical and/or hierarchical representation in an organization. Studies 2-4 directly assess if a concern for the in-group affects conceptions of diversity by measuring Black and White participants' racial identity centrality, an individual difference measure of the extent to which individuals define themselves according to race. These studies suggest that the tendency to conceive diversity in ways protective of the in-group is especially pronounced among individuals who identify strongly with their racial in-group.

T1  - (In)Visibility in Lesbian and Gay Student Organizing: The Case of Gay Student Services
AN  - 1266144100; 201300484
AB  - Drawing on newspaper, movement correspondence, and interview data, I examine the (in)visibility of a lesbian and gay student group, Gay Student Services (GSS), in a hostile university campus in Texas from the mid-1970s through the 1980s. GSS formed to create a safe space for sexual minorities at Texas A&M University (TAMU) and asked university officials to recognize the group officially. TAMU's resistance to their request forced GSS to file a lawsuit to achieve recognition. Using interviews with past members and archival data, such as newspapers and movement correspondence, I examine how GSS utilized (in)visibility to navigate the hostile environment. By controlling their (in)visibility, GSS members protected the organization from scrutiny and protect members' safety. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Immigrant China
AN  - 1023025721; 201223946
AB  - This article tackles a new phenomenon that will have profound consequences for the future of the international migration order: international migration to the People's Republic of China. For decades, China has had large numbers of foreign students, expatriates, returned overseas Chinese, and ethnic Chinese refugees. However, in the past few years, immigration to China has become much more diverse and numerous. Chinese students and scholars abroad return to China in ever greater numbers. Traders and labor migrants from all over the world are attracted by China's trading opportunities, political stability, and prosperity. Middle-class Koreans, Taiwanese, and Southeast Asians are looking for cheaper living costs and better jobs. European, North American, and Australian university graduates travel to China for employment or to start a business. This article asks to what extent government policy making and the formation of immigrant groups and ethnic relations are informed by unique features of China's late socialist society and government, or alternatively, to what extent they follow patterns similar to established developed immigrant countries in Asia, Europe, and North America.

T1  - Joseph Kasa-Vubu, ABAKO, and Performances of Kongo Nationalism in the Independence of Congo
AN  - 1018342124; 201212839
AB  - When most people think about the Belgian Congo and its path to independence on June 30, 1960, the figure that most frequently comes to mind is that of Patrice Lumumba and his strategy of uniting people across different ethnic groups. While Lumumba's contributions have been well documented and recognized, this essay argues that the Kongo ethnic association-turned-political party, ABAKO (Association des BaKongo), and its leader Joseph Kasa-Vubu, were the driving force behind the independence movement in colonial Belgian Congo. ABAKO, however, used a completely different approach that successfully privileged ethnic nationalism, demonstrating that ideas of ethnic identity were often more important than a burgeoning national identity. Through the application of a performative analysis to three key events-the ABAKO countermanifesto of 1956; the Leopoldville rebellion of January, 1959; and the civil disobedience campaign advocating for an autonomous Kongo state in mid-1959-the author shows that members of ABAKO and its leadership effectively used performances of ethnic and territorial nationalism to greatly impact and lead the movement for Congolese independence.

T1  - Does diversity damage corporate value? Measuring stock price reactions to a diversity award
AN  - 1037875401; 201231034
AB  - Corporate decision-makers have increasingly adopted an approach to firm governance that places share value above other concerns, including meeting the needs of employees. Decision-makers' concerns about shareholder interests may potentially impede internal commitments to implementing diversity-friendly practices and policies. This study analyses how recognition for a company's diversity efforts impacts corporate share price. We rely on data of share price fluctuation following the receipt of Fortune Magazine's 'Best Companies for Minorities' Award. We find that companies recognized for their diversity efforts are penalized with a significant decline in share price, though this negative effect is mediated by the ethnic composition of the company's workforce.

T1  - Age-at-Arrival's Effects on Asian Immigrants' Socioeconomic Outcomes in Canada and the U.S.
AN  - 1030867435; 201227788
AB  - Age-at-arrival is a key predictor of many immigrant outcomes, but discussion continues over how to best measure and study its effects. This research replicates and extends a pioneering study by Myers, Gao, and Emeka [International Migration Review (2009) 43:205-229] on age-at-arrival effects among Mexican immigrants in the U.S. to see if similar results hold for other immigrant groups and in other countries. We examine data from the 2000 U.S. census and 2006 American Community Survey, and 1991, 2001, and 2006 Canadian censuses to assess several measures of age-at-arrival effects on Asian immigrants' socioeconomic outcomes. We confirm several of Myers et al.'s key findings, including the absence of clear breakpoints in age-at-arrival effects for all outcomes and the superiority of continuous measures of age-at-arrival. Additional analysis reveals different age-at-arrival effects by gender and Asian ethnicity. We suggest guidelines, supplementing those offered by Myers et al., for measuring and studying age-at-arrival's effects on immigrant outcomes. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 919904052; 201201594
AB  - Data from the New Immigrant Survey are used to study wealth differentials among U.S. legal permanent residents. This study is unique in its ability to account for wealth held in the U.S. and that held abroad and yields several key findings. First, relative to immigrants from Western Europe, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand (who have median wealth similar to native born non-Hispanic whites), other immigrant groups have lower levels of total wealth even after accounting for permanent income and life course characteristics. Second, time in the U.S. is positively associated with the wealth of married immigrants, yet this relationship is not statistically significant for single immigrants. Third, differences in the means of measured characteristics between Western European immigrants and those from most other origin regions account for more than 75 percent of observed wealth disparities. However, for immigrants from Asia and from the Indian subcontinent, much of the wealth differential remains unexplained by these factors. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - The Impact of Downsizing on the Social Capital Resources and Career Prospects of African-American Survivors
AN  - 1364699923; 201323519
AB  - This study examines African-American survivors' perceptions of how downsizing impacted their access to social capital resources and its effect on their careers. Layoffs can negatively affect the composition of the survivors' social ties at work and their access to career-related social capital resources. Using interview data, I find that most respondents lost contacts who offered social capital resources, which they perceived as detrimental to their career advancement. They also did not discuss having immediate access to additional sources of social capital resources. The implications of layoffs for the advancement of historically disadvantaged groups and organizations' ability to maintain a diverse workforce are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'It ain't where you're from, it's where you're born': re-theorizing diaspora and homeland in postcolonial Malaysia
AN  - 1030864404; 201227755
AB  - The concept of diaspora enjoys a significant currency in contemporary cultural theory. Its descriptive paradigm associates it with the shared experience of displacement, a sense of common origins, and a material or symbolic attachment to the 'original' homeland. This traditional framework overlooks diaspora as a narrative of national desire which enables contestation and disruption of dominant hierarchies and ideologies of nation from within the territorial, political, and cultural boundaries of the nation. It is this neglected aspect of diaspora as a narrative of national identification that is addressed in this paper, which examines the significance of contemporary diaspora cultural politics and formations vis-a-vis the exclusionary hegemonies and workings of the nation-state. In this sense, it seeks to re-orientate diaspora as a conceptual process that brings to the fore the 'routed' dimensions in the national affiliations and longings of marginalized minority communities. Focusing on the postcolonial nation-state of Malaysia and its literary productions, the paper's point of anchorage and discussion, to paraphrase Paul Gilroy, is 'where you're born', rather than 'where you're from'. This shift from a descriptive to a processual approach to diaspora enables more inclusive and emancipatory ways of reading both diaspora and homeland. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Prosocial behavior in diverse workgroups: How relational identity orientation shapes cooperation and helping
AN  - 1910226734
AB  - Members from diverse workgroups face the challenge to work effectively together. Benefits associated with diversity may be overshadowed by lack of cohesion and subgroup forming, which can withdraw team members from working together cooperatively or helping each other out when necessary. In three studies, we showed that an individual's focus on relationships (relational identity orientation; Brewer & Gardner, 1996), promotes prosocial behavior towards workgroup members from a different social group. Study 1 showed that high-trait relationally oriented individuals are more willing to cooperate with an outgroup member compared to low-trait relationally oriented individuals. Study 2 showed that priming a relational orientation leads to a higher willingness to help outgroup members compared to priming a personal or collective orientation. In Study 3, we replicated the findings of both studies and additionally tested two person-by-situation interaction models. It appeared that both trait relational identity orientation and identity primes appeared to independently predict cooperation tendencies with fellow workgroup members.

T1  - Forbidden Fruit: Inattention to Attractive Alternatives Provokes Implicit Relationship Reactance
AN  - 919903937; 201201510
AB  - Being inattentive to attractive relationship alternatives can enhance relationship well-being. The current investigation, however, demonstrates that implicitly preventing people from attending to desirable relationship alternatives may undermine, rather than bolster, the strength of that person's romantic relationship. Consistent with the notion of "forbidden fruit," we found that subtly limiting people's attention to attractive alternatives reduced relationship satisfaction and commitment and increased positive attitudes toward infidelity (Experiment 1), increased memory for attractive relationship alternatives (Experiment 2), and increased attention to attractive alternatives (Experiment 3). Findings suggest that although attention to attractive alternatives can harm one's relationship, situations that implicitly limit one's attention to alternatives can, rather ironically, increase the temptation of alternatives and undermine relationship well-being.

T1  - The defining moment: children's conceptualization of race and experiences with racial discrimination
AN  - 870433169; 201114262
AB  - This paper examines whether children of marginalized racial/ethnic groups have an awareness of race at earlier ages than youth from non-marginalized groups, documents their experiences with racial discrimination and utilizes a modified racism-related stress model to explore the relationship between perceived racial discrimination and self-esteem. Data were collected for non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white and Hispanic children aged 7-12 using face-to-face interviews (n=175). The concept of race was measured by assessing whether children could define race, if not a standard definition was provided. Racial discrimination was measured using the Williams Every-day-Discrimination Scale, self-esteem was measured using the Rosenberg Scale and ethnic identity was assessed using the Multi-group Ethnic Identity Measure. Non-Hispanic black children were able to define race more accurately, but overall Hispanic children encountered more racial discrimination, with frequent reports of ethnic slurs. Additionally, after accounting for ethnic identity, perceived racial discrimination remained a salient stressor that contributed to low self-esteem. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Shifting the Balance in Environmental Governance: Ethnicity, Environmental Citizenship and Discourses of Responsibility
AN  - 925713885; 201204099
AB  - Abstract: This paper focuses on the notion of environmental citizenship in examining how black and minority ethnic groups (BME) in Britain talk about environmental "rights" alongside environmental responsibilities. This broader discursive context leads us to engage with two interpretations of sustainability promoting different policy and planning agendas-the environmental sustainability and just sustainability policy agendas-in understanding the multiple spaces of identity, power and agency in which BME communities respond to environmental issues in institutional and daily life. We conducted ten semi-structured interviews with community key informants and ten focus groups with African-Caribbean or Indian communities. We identified four environmental responsibility discourses in the participants' talk, that were variously defined by issues of trust, social equity, off-loading of responsibility and government intervention and that served to shift environmental responsibility away from the individual onto "institutional others". We conclude by suggesting policy implications for the environmental and sustainability policy and planning community. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - CONSEQUENCES OF BLACK EXCEPTIONALISM? Interracial Unions with Blacks, Depressive Symptoms, and Relationship Satisfaction
AN  - 907926541; 201124707
AB  - Using data from Wave 4 (2008) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=7,466), we examine potential consequences of black exceptionalism in the context of interracial relationships among nonblack respondents. While increasing racial diversity and climbing rates of interracial unions have fostered the notion that racial boundaries within the United States are fading, our results add to the accumulating evidence that racial/ethnic boundaries persist in U.S. society. Results suggest that among non-Black respondents there is more stigma and disapproval attached to relationships with Blacks than there are to relationships with members of other racial/ethnic groups. Specifically, our results indicate that nonblack individuals with black partners have significantly more depressive symptoms and less relationship satisfaction than their counterparts with nonblack partners, regardless of respondent race and whether the nonblack partner is the same versus a different race from the respondent. Further, the relationship between partner race and depressive symptoms is partially and significantly mediated by relationship satisfaction. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Similarities and Differences in the Pursuit of Intimacy among Sexual Minority and Heterosexual Individuals: A Personal Projects Analysis
AN  - 896185195; 201120137
AB  - Negative attitudes and discriminatory policies pertaining to same-sex relationships create social and structural inequalities, privileging heterosexuals' abilities to achieve intimacy while impeding the intimacy-related pursuits of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals. This study examined the pursuit of intimacy in the form of intimacy-related personal projects among a sample of 431 LGB and heterosexual individuals. LGBs and heterosexuals did not differ in how meaningful they rated their intimacy projects. LGBs perceived more devaluation and barriers to achieving their intimacy projects than heterosexuals. These differences were more pronounced at the macrosocial level (e.g., laws and policies). No significant sexual orientation differences were observed regarding participants' job-related projects, highlighting the domain specificity of project devaluation and barriers. Results suggest that the pursuit of intimacy is highly meaningful for both LGBs and heterosexuals. Nonetheless, LGBs experience minority stressors specific to their relational pursuits from both interpersonal and macrosocial sources, including discriminatory laws and policies. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Tracing the roots of racial attitudes in historical events and individual biographies has been a long-standing goal of race relations scholars. Recent years have seen a new development in racial attitude research: Local community context has entered the spotlight as a potential influence on racial views. The race composition of the locality has been the most common focus; evidence from earlier decades suggests that white Americans are more likely to hold anti-black attitudes if they live in areas where the African-American population is relatively large. However, an influential 2000 article argued that the socioeconomic composition of the white community is a more powerful influence on white attitudes: In low-socioeconomic status (SES) locales, "stress-inducing" deprivations and hardships in whites' own lives purportedly lead them to disparage blacks. The study reported here reassesses this "scapegoating" claim, using data from the 1998 to 2002 General Social Surveys linked to 2000 census information about communities. Across many dimensions of racial attitudes, there is pronounced influence of both local racial proportions and college completion rates among white residents. However, the economic dimension of SES exerts negligible influence on white racial attitudes, suggesting that local processes other than scapegoating must be at work.

T1  - Interethnic relations in Northern Iraq: Brokerage, social capital and the potential for reconciliation
AN  - 881460755; 201116448
AB  - Ethnic relations in Iraq have been strained since the collapse of the Baath regime in 2003. Looking specifically at Kirkuk in northern Iraq, ethnic relations have been particularly uncooperative and violent. At the surface level, it is difficult to imagine interethnic reconciliation. The main conflict in the city, between Kurds and (settled) Arabs, goes back several decades. However, in this article it is argued that the situation is not necessary hopeless. Although ethnic groups in Kirkuk are largely separated by mutual distrust, they do not constitute entirely decoupled catnets. Despite residential segregation, there exists considerable room for social meetings across ethnic boundaries. Workplaces and, to some extent, voluntary organizations provide ethnically heterogeneous interaction spaces where interethnic brokerage may evolve. Many of these organizations are structurally constrained, making it likely that people will establish contacts with others sharing the same interaction space. In such settings, casual contacts have a potential to develop into true acquaintance contacts and, thus, into interethnic social capital.

T1  - Staff of the People? Assessing Progress in Descriptive Representation under the Obama Administration
AN  - 1125217188; 201240527
AB  - Over the past few decades, presidents have made some increasingly noticeable efforts to fill their administrations with a higher number of minorities. Though not yet fully representative of the general public, such advances in descriptive representation are a sign of progressive change occurring within the executive branch, with positive potential implications for the state of representative democracy and public policy. In this article, I survey the current state of descriptive representation under the Obama presidency and the extent to which the president's policy agenda has substantively addressed the needs of historically underrepresented groups. Descriptively, I find that President Barack Obama has been symbolically progressive in adopting an inclusive approach for staffing the upper echelons of his administration. However, concerning substantive policy outcomes, I find that although the Obama administration has made some major strides concerning women's issues, its record concerning the needs and expectations of the African American and Latino communities has been more mixed.

T1  - 'Ethnics' and 'Anglos' in the Labour Force: Advancing Australia Fair?
AN  - 1081863820; 201235209
AB  - Multiculturalism as ideology and policy has been criticised for over-focusing on cultural identities and differences and a lack of focus on the structural inequality of ethno-cultural groups. This paper focuses on the latter issue through a comparative analysis of the workforce integration of immigrants to Australia. Past research has shown that non-English-speaking-background (NESB) immigrants were worse off than both the Australia-born and English-speaking-background (ESB) immigrants in achieving a job status and income corresponding to their educational qualifications. The paper compares 2006 Census data on education level, type of job, length of residence and English proficiency for eight NESB groups, one ESB group (UK) and the Australia-born. The investigation focuses on how well different birthplace groups are able to translate their skills into appropriate jobs, when controlling for English proficiency and length of residence. The main finding confirms that NESB immigrants still have worse employment outcomes than the Australia-born and UK-born overall, but some NESB groups match the success of the Anglophone groups in vocational sector employment. Among the tertiary educated, the employment outcomes of the Australia-born are better than those of all immigrant groups, closely followed by the UK-born and two other European groups.

T1  - No necessary tradeoff: Context, life course, and social networks in the identity formation of second-generation Nigerians in the USA
AN  - 1018355919; 201212818
AB  - Based on 25 semi-structured interviews, this article examines the racial, ethnic and national identities of second-generation Nigerian immigrants from the San Francisco Bay Area. I elaborate on the segmented-assimilation literature that considers economic circumstances to be a key determinant in identity formation. I show that participants form highly fluid identities throughout the life cycle, pinpointing factors that often get overlooked or de-emphasized in the second-generation incorporation literature such as youth co-ethnic community access, the college integrative experience and transnational social connections, particularly in adulthood. This article extends the black immigration literature that contends that ethnic identity is primarily used as a means of distancing from 'downwardly mobile' African-Americans. My findings highlight that respondents embrace a black racial identity that is neither oppositional nor associated with a downward trajectory, lending empirical support for the 'minority cultures of mobility' thesis that the minority middle classes share a culture of upward mobility.

T1  - Segregation, mistrust and minorities
AN  - 862595896; 201109736
AB  - Generalized trust is a value that leads to many positive outcomes for a society. It is faith in people you don't know who are likely to be different from yourself. Yet, several people, most notably Robert Putnam, now argue that trust is lower when we are surrounded by people who are different from ourselves. I challenge this view and argue that residential segregation rather than diversity leads to lower levels of trust. Integrated and diverse neighborhoods will lead to higher levels of trust, but mainly if people also have diverse social networks. I examine the theoretical and measurement differences between segregation and diversity and summarize results on how integrated neighborhoods with diverse social networks increase trust in the US and the UK.

T1  - Group Entitativity and Similarity: Their Differing Patterns in Perceptions of Groups
AN  - 856403407; 201106766
AB  - Three studies were conducted to investigate the relation between perceptions of group entitativity and group similarity. The first two studies tested whether entitativity and similarity would be perceived differently in participants' ingroups and outgroups. Across several different group types, we found that, in comparison to outgroups, ingroups were perceived to be relatively more entitative than outgroups, whereas outgroup members were perceived to be highly similar in comparison to ingroup members. The results of Study 3 showed that manipulation of group entitativity influenced perceptions of group entitativity but not of group similarity, whereas manipulation of similarity influenced perceptions of group similarity but not of group entitativity. The results of these studies provide support for the contention that entitativity and similarity are distinct (though related) concepts that function differently in group perception.

T1  - DISCRIMINATION-RELATED STRESS, BLOOD PRESSURE AND EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS ANTIBODIES AMONG LATIN AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS IN OREGON, US
AN  - 754038378; 201049756
AB  - Perceived discrimination has been linked to poor health outcomes among ethnic and racial minorities in the United States, though the relationship of discrimination-related stress to immigrant health is not well understood. This article reports findings from a preliminary study that examined blood pressure and Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels in relation to self-reported indicators of stress, acculturation and social support among 79 adult immigrant Latino farm workers in Oregon, US. Findings show that increases in discrimination-related stress predicted elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) and Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels among male participants. Though female participants reported similar levels of discrimination stress, this perceived stress was not reflected in biological measures. Among women, greater English language engagement was linked to higher SBP, and more years in the US was associated with higher diastolic blood pressure. Study results suggest that male and female immigrants' physiological responses to stress may be influenced in distinctive ways by processes of adjustment to life in the US. If replicated, the finding that discrimination stress predicts elevated SBP may have clinical and public health implications given that elevated SBP is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

T1  - Immigrants' Life Satisfaction in Europe: Between Assimilation and Discrimination
AN  - 743058983; 201031790
AB  - Using data from the three rounds of the European Social Survey, this article investigates the disparities in life satisfaction measures between the first- and second-generation immigrants, on the one hand, and the natives, on the other hand, in 13 European countries. Two major theoretical hypotheses explaining the lower level of immigrants' subjective well-being are tested: the straight line assimilation and the effect of discrimination. The main finding is that immigrants' relative dissatisfaction does not diminish with time and across generations, which refutes the predictions of the assimilation paradigm. However, when ethnic groups are compared, the discrimination some of them perceive in the host society seems to be a more consistent explanation for their lower life satisfaction level. The effect of discrimination is measured with an attempt to correct for the endogeneity bias that it may lead to by using simultaneous regressions with instrumental variables.

T1  - Birds of a feather flock together -- and fall ill? Migrant homophily and health in Sweden
AN  - 743045413; 201026640
AB  - Although studies show that health inequities between ethnic groups exist, few have expressed interest in the origins of these disparities. As homophily (the phenomenon that people principally form relationships with those who are similar to them) influences people's norms and interactions, it might be an important property of migrants' networks, and have implications on their health. The aim of this study is to examine health inequities between natives and immigrants in Sweden and the health consequences arising from participation in homogenous migrant networks. Using total population registers and representative survey data initial analyses show that migrants experience poorer health than native Swedes. The findings further suggest that homophily is a prominent feature of migrant social networks and that migrants in networks with a high proportion of other migrants experience poorer health than those who include a high proportion of natives in their networks. However, unhealthy behaviour and disadvantaged social conditions may account for a considerable share of their excess risk. Hence, network closure may reinforce and maintain norms leading to negative behaviour and social conditions in such networks. Adapted from the source document.
