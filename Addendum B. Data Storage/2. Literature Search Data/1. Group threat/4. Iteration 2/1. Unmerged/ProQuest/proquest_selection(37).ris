T1  - <i>Possible</i> Citizens: Migration Enforcement as the Performance of Citizenship in the United Arab Emirates: IMR
AN  - 2685962047
AB  - While most boundary-making studies examine native-born citizens’ opposition to immigration, this article explains why immigrants develop anti-immigrant attitudes. Under what conditions do previous generations of immigrants develop solidarity with newcomers? When might immigrants, instead, police national boundaries and oppose further immigration or naturalization? I argue that under uncertain citizenship status, long-term immigrants are unlikely to develop solidarity with newcomers, despite common experience with exclusionary citizenship policies. Drawing on interviews with naturalization applicants in the United Arab Emirates, this article analyses how policies that unevenly distribute rights and protections to non-citizens structure relationships between immigrant groups. Moving beyond citizen/non-citizen binaries, it calls attention to hierarchies among non-citizens, examining how long-term immigrants with partial and conditional rights police national boundaries to navigate exclusionary policies. When states restrict citizenship, making it a scarce good, immigrants may respond to uncertainty by competing and, thus, limiting access to that good for newcomers. When naturalization is arduous, applicants face pressures to continually perform citizenship to prove that they deserve inclusion. Naturalization applicants lacked citizenship, but they immigrated to the UAE before the establishment of its guest-worker program and claimed Emirati identity by differentiating themselves from “migrant workers.” I show how migration enforcement and boundary-policing factored into their perceptions and performances of what it meant to be a “good” Emirati citizen. Ethnic hierarchies and the timing of migration created distinctions between immigrants eligible for naturalization and those who were not. The mere possibility of inclusion in the citizenry may generate hierarchies between immigrants, precluding solidarity, and encouraging boundary-policing.

T1  - Does Respect Foster Tolerance? (Re)analyzing and Synthesizing Data From a Large Research Project Using Meta-Analytic Techniques
AN  - 2666836775
AB  - Our own prior research has demonstrated that respect for disapproved others predicts and might foster tolerance toward them. This means that without giving up their disapproval of others’ way of life, people can tolerate others when they respect them as equals (outgroup respect–tolerance hypothesis). Still, there was considerable variation in the study features. Moreover, the studies are part of a larger research project that affords many additional tests of our hypothesis. To achieve integration along with a more robust understanding of the relation between respect and tolerance, we (re)analyzed all existing data from this project, and we synthesized the results with the help of meta-analytic techniques. The average standardized regression coefficient, which describes the relationship between respect and tolerance, was 0.25 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.16, 0.34]). In addition to this overall confirmation of our hypothesis, the size of this coefficient varied with a number of variables. It was larger for numerical majorities than for minorities, smaller for high-status than for low-status groups, and larger for religious than for life-style groups. These findings should inspire further theory development and spur growth in the social-psychological literature on tolerance.

T1  - The affective model of far‐right vote in Europe: Anger, political trust, and immigration
AN  - 2667100546
AB  - ObjectiveThis study demonstrates that voting for the far right has a central affective dimension within the domain of immigration, the effect of which relies on the level of trust one has toward political institutions and equally colors one's estimation of threat.MethodsWe use representative data from two studies across three countries (Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) at two time points (2015 and 2019).ResultsWe first show that anger, rather than fear, constitutes the emotional mechanism underpinning the relationship between anti‐immigration attitudes and support for the far right. Second, anger is associated more strongly with far‐right voting among those with lower levels of political trust. Third, anger affects how individuals seek out and process information about immigration, resulting in the overestimation of the perceived threat.ConclusionThese findings shed light on a key puzzle of electoral behavior: Why do some citizens with anti‐immigrant attitudes opt for radical politics, whereas others do not.

T1  - Law and the construction of Jewish difference
AN  - 2531322310
AB  - Despite the significance of the figure of ‘the Jew’ as Other in the Western imagination and the persistence of prejudice against Jews, there have been few studies of contemporary Jews as subjects of prejudice in liberal secular law and legal discourse. This article draws attention to continuing Jewish vulnerability and argues that a focus on colonial encounters and phenotype in understanding processes of legal exclusion based on religion and race cannot fully account for the persistence of anti‐Jewish prejudice and its resonance in law and legal discourse. Through an analysis of contemporary case law from three different countries, I show how narratives of Christian superiority, veiled behind commitments to secular neutrality, and racializing discourse resonate in legal encounters with Jewishness. I highlight parallels with other minority groups, in particular Muslims, and consider the usefulness of antisemitism as an analytical lens to capture the ambivalent dynamics of Jewish inclusion and exclusion.

T1  - Real Talk About Fake News: Identity Language and Disconnected Networks of the US Public’s “Fake News” Discourse on Twitter
AN  - 2429457246
AB  - This article studies “fake news” beyond the consumption and dissemination of misinformation and disinformation. We uncover how the term “fake news” serves as a discursive device for ordinary citizens to consolidate group identity in everyday political utterances on Twitter. Using computational linguistic and network analyses, we demonstrate that over the period of 2016–2018, there is an uptrend in the use of identity language in US Twitter users’ discussions about “fake news,” manifested by the increased frequency of group pronouns in combination with issues and sentiments that boost one’s ingroup and derogate the outgroup. Furthermore, as opposed to the conventional wisdom that “fake news” is a right-wing term, we uncover two disconnected retweet networks surrounding liberal and conservative opinion leaders. Like-minded individuals selectively amplify ingroup messages to claim the power to define falsehood and make group-serving blame attributions. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings and offer new directions for future research on “fake news,” misinformation, and disinformation.

TT  - La discriminación, el estrés laboral y el bienestar psicológico en personas trabajadoras LGTBI en España
AN  - 2478115072
AB  - Discrimination and prejudice against LGBTI people in Spain are much lower than they used to be; however, negative attitudes towards them may still persist. The purpose of this study was to analyze whether LGBTI individuals perceive the existence of prejudice or discrimination due to their sexual orientation in the workplace. To assess these perceptions in relative terms, we compared them with those of heterosexual individuals. We also analyzed whether perceived discrimination was associated with work stress, the presence of common mental disorders, and depression. Results revealed that LGBTI employees reported experiencing greater discrimination in the workplace because of their sexualorientation, which in turn led to a greater incidence of work stress, mental disorders, and depression. Our findings confirm that job discrimination against LGBTI people is still present, along with some of its harmful consequences, and highlight the need for interventions to reduce prejudice against LGBTI persons in the workplace.Alternate abstract:
A pesar de que la discriminación y el prejuicio hacia el colectivo LGTBI en España hayan disminuido, es posible que aún pervivan actitudes negativas hacia estas personas. En la presente investigación analizamos si las personas LGTBI perciben la existencia de prejuicio o discriminación hacia ellas en el ámbito laboral debido a su orientación sexual. Para analizar en términos relativos dichas percepciones, las comparamos con las que tienen las personas de orientación heterosexual. Después se examinó si la percepción de discriminación está relacionada con el estrés laboral, la presencia de trastornos mentales y la depresión. Los resultados mostraron que las personas LGTBI experimentaban mayor discriminación en su trabajo en virtud de su orientación sexual, produciéndoles mayor estrés laboral, trastornos mentales y depresión. Estos resultados confirman la pervivencia de discriminación hacia las personas LGTBI en el ámbito laboral y algunas de sus perniciosas consecuencias y muestran la necesidad de intervenciones para la reducción del prejuicio hacia los trabajadores LGTBI.

T1  - Effects of belief versus experiential discrimination on race-based linked fate
AN  - 2571083521
AB  - Since Michael Dawson first put forward the theory that being targets of racial discrimination increases perceptions of linked fate amongst African Americans, applications of his theory to non-Black and contemporary African Americans have arrived at mixed findings. These inconsistencies may be attributed to different conceptualizations of discrimination and a partiality for personal experiences rather than beliefs about discrimination. Using the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-election Survey, we test the argument both beliefs and experiences with discrimination can affect racial attitudes by comparing how the relationship between beliefs/experiential discrimination and race-based linked fate differs across Black, Latino, Asian, and White Americans. The findings suggest even if non-Whites do not personally experience discrimination, they have beliefs about discrimination towards their racial group, and these beliefs are equally important predictors of their sense of race-based linked fate.

T1  - Authoritarian Personality and Gender Differences in Gun Control Attitudes
AN  - 2266702839
AB  - This article investigates the gender gap in gun control attitudes, in which women are more likely to support gun control than men. Women are less likely than men to own a gun and to see owning guns as a means of self-protection. Using the 2012 American National Election Study Data, this article tests authoritarianism, which includes the desire for security and a disposition toward higher levels of perceived threat, as an explanation for the gap. The results indicate that authoritarian women are more likely than authoritarian men to support gun control. In fact, authoritarianism appears to have the opposite effect on men and women's gun control attitudes. Authoritarianism is associated with higher levels of support for gun control among women and lower levels of support among men.

T1  - Tracking Ignorance: Examining Changes in Immigrant Population Innumeracy in the United States from 2005 to 2013
AN  - 2300097911
AB  - Citizens' tendency to overestimate the size of immigrant populations has been the subject of several studies over the past three decades. While we have learned a great deal about the extent, causes, and potential consequences of this population innumeracy, our understanding remains static. The current letter offers the first longitudinal consideration of immigrant population size misperceptions with an analysis across a nine-year span in the U.S. This study considers: 1) whether misperceptions have changed over time; 2) how these changes compare to the growth of the actual foreign-born population size; and 3) whether these changes are related to demographic and ideological factors. Results indicate that misperceptions have grown rapidly in the U.S, far outpacing the modest, actual increases across the period. Pooled cross-sectional analyses indicate that demographic factors do not explain the growth in misperceptions. However, the overestimates of politically conservative Americans have grown increasingly extreme over time.

T1  - Contact theory in the workplace: The case of Jewish–Arab contact in Israel
AN  - 2187744612
AB  - Contact theory is a fundamental theory in social psychology, suggesting that contact between antagonistic groups can reduce prejudice and stereotypes. The current study applies former studies in evaluating a specific case of the connection between contact and attitudes toward minorities in work contexts. A survey was conducted using 873 Israeli Jews in order to assess their attitudes toward the Arab population in Israel and Arabs' work characteristics. The results indicated that the connection between intergroup contact and attitudes is complex. On the one hand, workplace contact between Israeli Jews and Arabs was significantly correlated with the willingness to meet Arabs in and outside the workplace and to perceive Arabs in a less threatening way. However, contact during work was not significantly correlated with the participants' general attitude toward the Arab population. In addition, contact during work was not found to be significantly correlated with the participants' perceptions about Arabs' personality traits or work characteristics. The results of this study also suggest that attitudes toward Arabs' work characteristics have a strong connection to other dimensions of attitudes toward Arabs, even more than the impact of contact during work.

T1  - Japanese Attitudes Toward China and the United States: A Sociological Analysis
AN  - 2275917657
AB  - As China and the United States have a great impact on Japan, Japanese attitudes toward China and the United States have been the focus of debate. This study uses nationally representative longitudinal data from Japan to investigate how the economic and political threats are relevant to Japanese attitudes toward China and the United States. Empirical analyses find that: first, socioeconomic status (SES) is significantly associated with individuals' attitudes toward the United States but not China. Second, individuals' perceptions of Japan's economic situation influence their attitudes toward China and the United States; that is, an optimistic assessment of Japan's economy increases the Japanese people's positive attitudes toward both China and the United States. Finally, the political threats have contrasting effects on Japanese attitudes toward China and the United States. Concerns over political threats increase Japan's favorable attitudes toward the United States while deteriorating the positive attitudes toward China.

T1  - Political Culture in the Islamic World: The Socioeconomic Roots of the Islamic Leviathan
AN  - 2140079295
AB  - In this paper, the author explores how development affects public opinions on an Islamic Leviathan as an appropriate political system in the Middle East. He asks the following: In the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa), what influences political attitudes toward the Islamic Leviathan? To answer this question, he looks at the influence of seven independent variables on attitudes toward the Islamic Leviathan as a state system. The seven variables are (1) society’s overall development, (2) the socioeconomic class of respondents, (3) society’s corruption, (4) religiosity, (5) education, (6) gender, and (7) age. The author finds the observations needed to assess his theory in the Carnegie Middle East Governance and Islam Dataset 1988-2014 (CMEGID), which includes 15,194 relevant observations throughout the MENA region. His findings show that societies’ overall development has the most influence over Arab attitudes toward the Islamic Leviathan as an appropriate state system.

T1  - Support for Beauty-Status Exchange Remains Illusory
AN  - 1941597048
AB  - In my article, "Beauty and Status: The Illusion of Exchange in Partner Selection?" (McClintock 2014), I used descriptive statistics, three forms of regression, and six measures of socioeconomic status to examine the "trophy wife" stereotype that women "exchange" their beauty for men's status. According to the stereotype, such women would partner with comparatively less-attractive men who are comparatively high in socioeconomic status. I found little support for beauty-status exchange, and this limited support lacked robustness. Gullickson critiques my analysis on two grounds, arguing against the difference-based regression models, and proposing a new specification of interaction effects in the log-linear models. However, the difference models conceptualize exchange as defined in the relevant literature, and Gullickson's modified difference models only replicate my conventional regression models, providing no new evidence for or against beauty-status exchange. Likewise, Gullickson's proposed log-linear specifications are not only non-hierarchical, they also fail to improve model fit or to support exchange when using alternative measures of status. Indeed, Gullickson focuses on the only measure of status that yields any support for beauty-status exchange. Altogether, Gullickson's case for beauty-status exchange overlooks the preponderance of contrary evidence and prioritizes statistical significance, attainable only under narrow model specifications, over robustness and model fit.

T1  - The Culture of Cities: Measuring Perceived Cosmopolitanism
AN  - 1922247434
AB  - Cities like New York and San Francisco have a different feel than cities like Newark and Columbus. But can these differences be captured quantitatively? We argue these places vary along the dimension of cosmopolitanism, that is, the extent to which they offer economic opportunities and emphasize diversity, creativity, and egalitarianism. We present a Cosmopolitan City Scale (CCS) designed to assess perceived cosmopolitanism. The CCS has high internal reliability and correlates with objective indicators of cosmopolitanism such as intergenerational mobility and number of patents generated (Study 1). Consistent with the notion that people with an independent orientation migrate to cosmopolitan places, independence was associated with preference for cosmopolitan cities as measured by our scale (Study 2). High openness to experience, high extraversion, liberalism, high socioeconomic status, and single marital status were also related to greater preference for cosmopolitan cities. We believe the CCS provides a new tool for understanding how cities differ and helps clarify factors that drive migration preferences. We also discuss implications of cosmopolitanism for cultural processes such as acculturation and intergroup relations.

T1  - The Coptic diaspora and the status of the Coptic minority in Egypt
AN  - 1884516402
AB  - This paper examines the political activity of the Coptic diaspora in the United States in support of the Coptic minority in Egypt. Analysing its strategy reveals that for years it has focused on lobbying the United States and international bodies, in order to raise international awareness of the Coptic minority status. By using this strategy, it has framed the struggle for Copts' rights in a manner that contradicts the Egyptian unity narrative, and the strategic choices of those they are struggling for. This paper shows that understanding the limitations of this strategy alongside a change in the structure of opportunities in Egypt has led to a change in the pattern of activity of the diaspora activists. Alongside lobbying for international involvement, they have developed additional strategies, including strengthening their influence in the homeland and even direct action vis-à-vis the Egyptian authorities. This paper, which emphasises the pattern of action of diaspora activists that represent minorities, directs attention to the structure of opportunities in the homeland, the variety of relationships between the diaspora and the homeland, and their effect on the ability of the diaspora activists to become a significant force in shaping the life of the minority.

T1  - More than Just Insults: Rethinking Sociology's Contribution to Scholarship on Racial Microaggressions
AN  - 1888628530
AB  - Our goal with this special issue is to expand currently untapped ideas about racial microaggressions from a sociological point of view. As noted, research on this issue comes largely out of psychiatry, psychology, and education--disciplines that tend to place less emphasis on structural and institutional causes of racism. There is a need for more sociologically guided research to examine how subtle, covert, and non-apparent forms of racism affect minorities physiologically, psychologically, and emotionally--and how these micronooses can best be understood in a larger context of structural racism. Examination of racial microaggressions from a sociological point of view promises additional insight to help understand the complexities of contemporary race and racism in America and abroad.

T1  - "Race Tests": Racial Boundary Maintenance in White Evangelical Churches
AN  - 1888628505
AB  - How and why do nominally open organizations remain racially segregated in the post-civil rights era? What role do interpersonal interactions play in the perpetuation of segregation? Using ethnographic data gathered from seven, majority white, evangelical churches across four states, we find that social actors (i.e., clergy and congregants) play a central role in continuing racial segregation by executing "race tests" on people of color who attempt to gain entry to these spaces. Race tests are performances by white individuals and groups, in the presence of incoming people of color. They utilize racial microaggressions, playing on persistent racist stereotypes and/or histories of racial violence, to preclude or precondition people of color's participation in predominantly white social spaces. White actors in white social spaces initiate utility-based race tests to determine whether people of color are willing to serve the interests of whites in the space, or execute exclusionary race tests to coerce people of color into leaving the space. We provide examples of both types of race tests and discuss the role of such microaggressions and the racialized emotions at play in the reproduction of segregation in historically white social spaces like white evangelical churches.

T1  - Neighbours Helping Neighbours in Multi-ethnic Context
AN  - 1874317543
AB  - A key topic in population and urban studies is neighbourhood social relations. The topic has significant implications for the larger debate about friendship patterns in contemporary North American society. Ties among neighbours provide social support, foster social relations, and facilitate social capital. Our study explores how the exchange of favours among neighbours, a key component in developing and maintaining social relations among neighbours, is related to co-ethnic proportion, length of time in the neighbourhood, and family life cycle. Our discussion differentiates between relations within groups and overall relations in the neighbourhood. We merged the 2008 Canadian General Social Survey with 2006 Canadian census tract data to explore these issues. The findings present an optimistic view of a diversified society. Most members of the groups included in the analysis experience favour exchange with neighbours. Although co-ethnic proportion and duration in the neighbourhood do not relate to favour exchange in neighbourhoods for minorities and immigrants, these factors are significant for local-born population. In addition, as minorities and immigrants marry, their family needs may encourage them to develop social relations with neighbours. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - Mogong and chieftaincy in western Guangxi and Southeast Asia
AN  - 1855702339
AB  - This article is devoted to establishing, by means of textual and comparative evidence, a link between the religious practitioners called mogong (Zh. bouxmo) and chiefly houses. The mogong are male priests who recite texts in the 'local' language, in this case Zhuang or Bouyei. They are also found among other Tai peoples, including the Dai in Yunnan, the Tày and Nùng in Vietnam, and also among other ethnic groups in mainland Southeast Asia. Theirs is a very ancient tradition, dating back possibly 2000 years. Most of the studies on mogong in the PRC have treated the mogong either as an instance of 'primitive religion' or as 'folk beliefs', and some scholars have declared that the mogong had no connection with politics or government. My argument, based on new evidence from a survey of Zhuang vernacular texts, is that the Zhuang mogong only became village-level vernacular priests after the disbandment of the native chieftaincies, starting in the early eighteenth century, and that before that they were attached directly to chiefly lineages, as they still were in Yunnan and in Southeast Asia until the 1940s. The mogong were responsible for the most important triennial sacrifices to the guardian spirits of the domain.

TT  - Attitudes envers 'l'étranger': négociations face à la différence au Royaume-Uni et en Pologne; Las actitudes hacia el 'desconocido': la negociación de encuentros con lo diferente en el Reino Unido y Polonia
AN  - 1848148756
AB  - Due to recent intensification in international mobility in Europe, its citizens are exposed to a much wider range of lifestyles and competing attitudes towards difference. Individuals are, therefore, increasingly likely to encounter 'strangers' and are, therefore, required to negotiate discontinuities and contradictions between the values that are transmitted through different sites. In response, the article explores the concept of the 'stranger' through original data collected in the UK and Poland. The article highlights that the construction of who is a stranger depends on national historical contexts, core values and related visions of the society. The UK and Poland have very different histories and experiences with social diversity, impacting on the ways in which individuals negotiate strange encounters. In both countries, the 'stranger' is often seen in a negative way and in relation to the minority groups that are perceived to be visibly different, distinct or 'unknown' in contemporary times. In Poland, this is now largely articulated through sexual prejudice (homophobia), whilst in the UK, attitudes towards the 'stranger' are largely conveyed through religious prejudice (Islamophobia). As such, the article offers a means of understanding how encounters with difference 'produce' strangers in different contexts.

T1  - Theory in Highly Cited Studies of Sexual Minority Parent Families: Variations and Implications
AN  - 1904237981
AB  - This article includes a systematic review and citation analysis of the literature regarding sexual minority parent families, particularly attending to what theories have been used, and how. We consider the importance of theoretical frameworks for future research and implications for policy, practice, and law related to sexual minority parent families. Our review targets 30 highly cited studies located through Google Scholar (as an interdisciplinary search engine) and published within a specific timeframe (2005-2010). We highlight the dominant theoretical models employed across disciplines studying sexual minority parent families. Although the majority of studies reviewed referred to theoretical models or perspectives, explicit theoretical grounding was frequently lacking. Instead, the empirical work reviewed appeared to have a predominantly applied focus in addressing public debates on sexual minority parent families. We provide recommendations for how theory might be more fully integrated into the social science literature on sexual minority parents and their children.

T1  - "Grow the Beard, Wear the Costume": Resisting Weight and Sexual Orientation Stigmas in the Bear Subculture
AN  - 1831272479
AB  - Being gay and being overweight are two stigmatized statuses in the United States. A range of work has considered the experience of being stigmatized and the consequences of stereotypes for overweight individuals and sexual minorities, but less research has examined the intersection of these two stigmas among larger gay men or collective efforts to resist such stigma. This study qualitatively examines a subculture of gay men, the bears, to test theoretical models of stigma resistance. The analysis demonstrates the transferability of stigma resistance among multiple stigmatized attributes and the use of multiple strategies to resist one stigma. At the same time, it shows how subcultural dynamics both aid and undermine the resistance toward stigma, and the risk of reinforcing stigma's effect through criticizing others who embody a stereotype. The results also demonstrate how resistance strategies are both empowering and psychologically taxing for stigmatized individuals.

T1  - Turning points and transitions in the migratory trajectories of skilled Romanian immigrants in Spain
AN  - 1828221900
AB  - The academic interest on skilled migration patterns has increased at the same time as the flows of skilled migrants around the world. Despite this tendency, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding the migratory projects of particular ethnic communities or in specific receiving contexts. The current paper examines the migratory experiences of Romanian professionals and the extent to which the incorporation into the Spanish labor market represents a turning point or a transition in their overall life trajectory. Based on a qualitative design, the paper highlights how some profiles are more sensitive to sending and receiving contexts (structural elements), display strategies through mobilization of universities or social networks and shape disrupted trajectories. Others, respond to globalized dynamics, mobilize corporations and finally develop smooth labor transitions. The main elements explaining these patterns are tackled and explained in three profiles of professionals: those who arrive to Spain thanks to the transfer by a multinational company; those who complement their tertiary education with Master degree in Spain and finally, those who correspond to the economic migrant profile.

T1  - 'The rez accent knows no borders': Native American ethnic identity expressed through English prosody
AN  - 1845978467
AB  - In many Native American and Canadian First Nations communities, indigenous languages are important for the linguistic construction of ethnic identity. But because many younger speakers have limited access to their heritage languages, English may have an even more important role in identity construction than Native languages do. Prior literature shows distinctive local English features in particular tribes. Our study builds on this knowledge but takes a wider perspective: We hypothesize that certain features are shared across much larger distances, particularly prosody. Native cultural insiders (the first two co-authors) had a central role in this project. Our recordings of seventy-five speakers in three deliberately diverse locations (Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, North/South Dakota; Northwest Territories, Canada; and diverse tribes represented at Dartmouth College) show that speakers are heteroglossically performing prosodic features to index Native ethnic identity. They have taken a 'foreign' language (English) and enregistered these prosodic features, creatively producing and reproducing a shared ethnic identity across great distances. (Native Americans, prosody, ethnicity, ethnic identity, English, dialects)*

T1  - Riba-Based Mortgages in Dar al-Harb: An Issue of Modernist Application of Fiqh al-Aqalliyat for Muslim Minorities
AN  - 1827433539
AB  - The growing presence of Muslims in the occident living as minorities in majority non-Muslim countries comes with inherent religious challenges. How can occidental Muslims live faithfully in cultures that cause perceivable "hardship" without compromising their religio-legal obligations? Is fiqh al-aqalliyat the answer to this problem, if at all there is a problem? As a sample of the so-called "hardship", this paper looks at the issue of occidental Muslims taking out riba (interest or usury) based loans in order to buy a house, to test the theory of whether or not a new legal doctrine is required to facilitate Muslim needs facing exceptional circumstances. Is it a clash between classical and contemporary scholarship or an inevitable pre-modern evolution of Islamic jurisprudence? This article argues that juristic opinions, whether classical or contemporary do not justify any actions, because their opinions are first and foremost non-binding and secondly a result of their endeavor to come to an edict. The paper highlights a misapplication of juristic maxims and opinions, driven by zeal to provide an edict to justify the needs of some. It concludes that no added value is made to Islamic law by heterodox jurisprudence.

AB  - Based on a qualitative study, this article explores post-migration mobility practices developed by Somali women and men who have settled in Europe. It focuses on the 'politics of mobility', considering cross-border mobility an unequally distributed resource through which people access different forms of capital, and thus an element of social differentiation. The article reveals that respondents invest resources in places other than those where they acquired them, benefiting from a favourable symbolic exchange rate between the different places. Furthermore, while a significant part of the economic, social and cultural capital of these migrants is acquired within ethnically diversified contexts, it is mostly reinvested in networks and places where their Somali ethnicity becomes an asset-either in ethnically homogeneous networks or in activities that address Somali people's needs. Cross-border mobility, transnationality and ethnicity become core resources that enable these migrants to mobilise their capital where it can be valued most highly and to access advantageous social positions, thus fostering upward social mobility. The article argues that these strategies are less the result of an identity-based ethnic preference than a compensatory mechanism implemented by people who have few prospects of having their assets valued within the wider networks in their country of residence.

T1  - South Asian immigration to Spain: Socio-demographic profile and territorial distribution, 2000-2014
AN  - 1907273084
AB  - The South Asian group, which includes people from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, is one of the oldest and least known immigrant groups in Spain. Because of its relatively small size (131,230 in 2014) very limited research work has been done about this community. Existing studies mainly focus on their economic participation while their socio-demographic characteristics remain unexplored. In this paper, we examine the evolution and demographic profile of their flow and stock during 2000-2014, their socio-economic characteristics and territorial distribution. The recent huge flow of young males has made this group more masculine and younger. Their low education level and lack of professional skills result in occupational segregation in a few sectors, which is contributing to their residential concentration in the big metropolitan areas of Spain. The economic crisis in Spain has halted further growth, but the continuation of family reunification process is consolidating their settlement in Spain.

T1  - Diaspora activism in a non-traditional country of destination: the case of Filipinos in the Netherlands
AN  - 1765125800
AB  - Diasporas have played important roles in democratization in their homelands. But how does diaspora mobilization occur when the country of settlement has a small and isolated ethnic community, the host and homeland governments have weak relations, and the conflict is invisible in the geographies of power? Using case study research, I analyse how solidarity groups in the Netherlands facilitated the emergence and growth of diaspora mobilization for democracy in the Philippines during the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. My findings show that in cases where exiles and migrants lack pre-existing economic, political and social ties in the host society, solidarity groups can affect the political opportunity structure in the host country, permitting the promotion of certain claims and demands in the public sphere. Furthermore, diaspora mobilization can develop within the formal organizations or associational networks of solidarity groups.

T1  - Concealing Concealment: The Mediating Role of Internalized Heterosexism in Psychological Distress Among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Older Adults
AN  - 1773059753
AB  - Recent population-based studies indicate that sexual minorities aged 50 and older experience significantly higher rates of psychological distress than their heterosexual age-peers. The minority stress model has been useful in explaining disparately high rates of psychological distress among younger sexual minorities. The purpose of this study is to test a hypothesized structural relationship between two minority stressors-internalized heterosexism and concealment of sexual orientation-and consequent psychological distress among a sample of 2,349 lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults aged 50 to 95 years old. Structural equation modeling indicates that concealment has a nonsignificant direct effect on psychological distress but a significant indirect effect that is mediated through internalized heterosexism; the effect of concealment is itself concealed. This may explain divergent results regarding the role of concealment in psychological distress in other studies, and the implications will be discussed.

T1  - OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities on the Use of Languages in Relations with the Public Administration, and on the Supervision and Enforcement of Linguistic Requirements
AN  - 1855326201
AB  - Linguistic rights and their implications for societal cohesion and state stability, have been recognized as a core component in the conflict prevention work of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe High Commissioner on National Minorities (OSCE HCNM). Linguistic and associated rights proved a challenge in many OSCE Participating States, and the HCNM repeatedly advised the relevant authorities on how to secure a fair balance between the promotion of the state language and the protection of linguistic minority rights. This article overviews the advice which the successive HCNMs have throughout the years put forward on two key areas touching upon the linguistic rights of national minorities - namely, the use of languages in relations with the public administration, and the supervision and enforcement of linguistic requirements - and analyses how this advice aligns with the recommendations put forward by other international actors and institutions working on minority rights and minority issues.

T1  - Befriending the enemy: Outgroup friendship longitudinally predicts intergroup attitudes in a coexistence program for Israelis and Palestinians: GPIR
AN  - 1752001292
AB  - One of the largest Middle East coexistence programs annually brings together Israeli and Palestinian teenagers for a 3-week camp in the United States. For 3 years, we longitudinally tracked how this intervention affected Israelis' and Palestinians' relationships with, and attitudes toward, each other. Specifically, we measured participants' outgroup attitudes immediately before and after camp, and, for 2 years, 9 months following "reentry" to their home countries. In all 3 years, participants' attitudes toward the outgroup improved from precamp to postcamp. Participants who formed an outgroup friendship during camp developed more positive feelings toward outgroup campers, which generalized to an increase in positivity toward all outgroup members. Although the positivity faded upon campers' reentry, there was significant residual positivity after reentry compared to precamp. Finally, positivity toward the outgroup after reentry was also predicted by outgroup friendships. Future contact interventions may profit from encouraging individuals to make and maintain outgroup friendships. [web URL: http://gpi.sagepub.com/content/19/1/72.abstract]

T1  - Bridging and Bonding Ethnic Ties in Voluntary Organisations: A Multilevel 'Schools of Democracy' Model
AN  - 1784151611
AB  - Scholars of political disaffection have recently argued that ethnically bridging and bonding non-profit associations may have diverging effects on members' likelihood of political engagement. However, both theoretical and empirical assessments of such effects remain inconclusive by predicting different scenarios. In this article, I contribute to this literature by relying on a novel design, which does not focus on individuals (as in previous research), but instead samples ethnically homogeneous and heterogeneous organisations and their participants. This allows partitioning variance in political engagement at these two levels of analysis, and admits a more direct test of the link between ethnic composition of an organisation and political engagement. This sampling strategy also allows controlling for the effects of previously ignored organisational characteristics, which may enhance political engagement. A multilevel analysis suggests existing studies tend to overestimate the importance of an ethnically heterogeneous organisational context. Findings suggest that both types of voluntary organisations attract politically engaged individuals (self-selection). Moreover, other organisational characteristics-such as providing political information or receiving (local) government grants-have a stronger effect on members' political engagement than an organisation's ethnic composition.

T1  - Gender, Migration, and Religion: MENA Muslim Migrants in Australia from a Socio-demographic Perspective
AN  - 1752271488
AB  - Focusing on the issue of gender and Muslim minority communities in the West, this paper presents a typical pattern in order to examine the main dimensions and determinants associated with religion and gender identity upon migration. It also explains the existence and the extent of association between the socialization experience of women in their society of origin and their integration process in the receiving society. The examination focuses particularly on the intersection of gender, migration, and religion: the status of Muslim female immigrants residing in the West whose origin is from the Middle East and North Africa region in the East. The indicators used, the context of the study, the method of analysis, and the particular focus group of this study provide the opportunity to deal appropriately with the above key objective in this study.

T1  - Impossible Burdens: White Institutions, Emotional Labor, and Micro-Resistance
AN  - 1777916363
AB  - This article explores the connections between white institutional spaces, emotional labor, and resistance by illuminating the shared experiences of people of color in elite law schools and the commercial aviation industry. Based on in-depth qualitative data combined from two individual studies, we illustrate the processes by which white institutional spaces create a complex environment where people of color must navigate racial narratives, ideologies, and discourses, while simultaneously attempting to achieve institutional success to reap the material rewards of these elite institutional settings. In these distinct environments, people of color experience an unequal distribution of emotional labor as a result of negotiating both everyday racial micro-aggressions and dismissive dominant ideologies that deny the relevance of race and racism. As a result they must actively seek ways to engage in forms of resistance that promote counter narratives and protect themselves from denigration while minimizing the risk of severe consequence. Our data suggest that a more nuanced conceptualization of resistance and the context in which resistance occurs is needed in order to understand the everyday experiences of people of color.

T1  - United by Faith? Race/Ethnicity, Congregational Diversity, and Explanations of Racial Inequality
AN  - 1728662784; 201535557
AB  - This study examines the extent to which the racial composition of a congregation moderates explanations for Black/White inequality among White, Black, and Hispanic congregants. Using nationally representative data from General Social Surveys and National Congregations Studies, we find that religiously affiliated Blacks and Hispanics tend to hold different racial attitudes than religiously affiliated Whites, but these differences largely disappear inside multiracial congregations. Importantly, we find that attending a multiracial congregation is unassociated with Whites ' explanations for racial inequality, and Blacks who attend multiracial congregations are actually less likely to affirm structured explanations for Black/White inequality than Blacks in nonmultiracial congregations or Whites in multiracial congregations. We find little evidence that multiracial congregations promote progressive racial views among attendees of any race or ethnicity. Rather, our findings suggest that multiracial congregations (1) leave dominant White racial frames unchallenged, potentially influencing minority attendees to embrace such frames and/or (2) attract racial minorities who are more likely to embrace those frames in the first place.

T1  - CONTESTED TERRAIN
AN  - 1700674223; 201525154
AB  - Since 1969, the procurement powers of government have been used proactively to assist minority-owned businesses. Originating in the U.S. Small Business Administration, the practice of targeting procurement contracts to minority-owned business enterprises (MBEs) has expanded throughout government and corporate America. Compared to other minorities, Black-owned firms have been the most active participants. Preferential procurement has been controversial for decades, and its effectiveness for assisting bona fide MBEs has been repeatedly questioned. 'Front-company' abuses have received abundant media attention; allegations of reverse discrimination have inspired legal challenges; the judiciary has often thrown out procurement preferences targeted to minorities. Less attention has focused on understanding whether racially targeted procurement preferences have assisted minority-owned businesses. As the multi-billion dollar government and corporate procurement market opened up, employment in Black-owned firms operating in the impacted industries soared. Growing access to procurement opportunities encouraged firm creation and expansion. Government entities operating successful programs actively screened out front firms, eased bonding requirements, downsized and unbundled contracts, and paid MBE vendor invoices promptly. In the process, they effectively lowered key barriers limiting MBE participation in mainstream procurement markets. Well-designed and administered programs succeeded because they created a less discriminatory environment, thus allowing talented entrepreneurs to build large firms. Problems notwithstanding, preferential procurement programs have been highly successful, and this success is a reflection of declining barriers unleashing the creativity of new generations of Black entrepreneurs.

T1  - Using Celebrity News Stories to Effectively Reduce Racial/Ethnic Prejudice
AN  - 1662632272
AB  - This article argues that exposure to admirable media celebrities from racial/ethnic outgroups is an effective, proactive, and viable strategy for prejudice reduction and intergroup harmony. It uses mediated contact and exemplification theories to demonstrate that reading news stories about likable outgroup media personalities who serve as counter-stereotypic exemplars can subtly modify racial attitudes, which are malleable and context-sensitive. Specifically, results from a between-participants experiment (N = 88) show that exposure to news stories about counter-stereotypic African American media personalities as compared to stereotypical ones reduces stereotypical perceptions and symbolic racist beliefs of White Americans about African Americans. Furthermore, these favorable attitudes translate into an increased willingness to support affirmative action policies.

T1  - Land, history or modernization? Explaining ethnic fractionalization
AN  - 1680153455; 201513974
AB  - Ethnic fractionalization (EF) is frequently used as an explanatory tool in models of economic development, civil war and public goods provision. However, if EF is endogenous to political and economic change, its utility for further research diminishes. This turns out not to be the case. This paper provides the first comprehensive model of EF as a dependent variable. It contributes new data on the founding date of the largest ethnic group in each state. It builds political and international variables into the analysis alongside historical and geoclimatic parameters. It extends previous work by testing models of politically relevant EF. In addition, this research interprets model results in light of competing theories of nationalism and political change. Results show that cross-national variation in EF is largely exogenous to modern politico-economic change. However, the data are inconclusive with respect to competing geoclimatic, historical institutional and modernist theories of ethnogenesis. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Minority Representation and Order Maintenance Policing: Toward a Contingent View
AN  - 1667952472; 201509625
AB  - Objective This article's aim is to test the impact of black political and bureaucratic representation on the rate at which blacks are arrested for order maintenance violations in U.S. cities. Methods Using data from the Law Enforcement Management and Administration Survey, the Census Bureau, and the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, for all U.S. cities over 100,000 population, the article first documents the continuing influence of black elected officials in promoting black representation on police forces. After establishing the appropriateness of order maintenance policing as a follow-up focus, the article then tests hypotheses that link variation in the rate of black order maintenance arrests to black political and bureaucratic representation, contingent upon form of government. Results Black political representation does constrain black order maintenance arrests, while black representation on the police force does not. Conclusion Even with a more racially representative police force in place, black political representation is what matters in constraining controversial patterns of police practice.

T1  - Formal Rights and Informal Privileges for Same-Sex Couples: Evidence from a National Survey Experiment
AN  - 1650145317; 201504421
AB  - Attitudes toward gay rights have liberalized over the past few decades, but scholars know less about the extent to which individuals in the United States exhibit subtle forms of prejudice toward lesbians and gays. To help address this issue, we offer a conceptualization of formal rights and informal privileges. Using original data from a nationally representative survey experiment, we examine whether people distinguish between formal rights (e.g., partnership benefits) and informal privileges (e.g., public displays of affection) in their attitudes toward same-sex couples. Results show that heterosexuals are as willing to extend formal rights to same-sex couples as they are to unmarried heterosexual couples. However, they are less willing to grant informal privileges. Lesbians and gays are more willing to extend formal rights to same-sex couples, but they too are sometimes more supportive of informal privileges for heterosexual couples. We also find that heterosexuals' attitudes toward marriage more closely align with their attitudes toward informal privileges than formal rights, whereas lesbians and gays view marriage similarly to both formal rights and informal privileges. Our findings highlight the need to examine multiple dimensions of sexual prejudice to help understand how informal types of prejudice persist as minority groups receive formal rights.

AN  - 1667951324; 201509528
AB  - The relation between racism, identity and well-being has stimulated political debate as well as psychological analysis. Research is reported that explores the relation among young people of white (n=97) and minority (n=174) ethnicity. On first assessment, minority ethnic participants reported: (1) more frequent experiences of racism and discrimination than white participants; and (2) higher levels of ethnic identity and equivalent levels of national identity. Three years later, depressive symptomatology was highest among minority ethnic participants, and (for this group only) positively associated with racism and discrimination reported at first assessment, and negatively associated with national identity.

T1  - Indigenous Mobilisation and the Law of Consultation in Peru: A Boomerang Pattern?
AN  - 1735654862; 201536932
AB  - Prior to 2009, it was difficult to speak of a national level Indigenous movement in Peru with an impact on national politics. However, the situation changed after the tragic events known as the Baguazo. Little by little, diverse organisations representing different ethnic groups came together to push for a law of consultation, which was promulgated in 2011. Nevertheless, the process has been highly complex and is still ongoing. The aim of this article is to offer some interpretative clues in order to understand how the national level movement came about, as well as how it made an impact on national political processes. Referring to social movement theory and constructivist international relations theory, I analyse several important episodes between 2009 and 2013. I find that both the convergence and the impact of a national level Indigenous movement in Peru are embedded in complex bargaining processes in which issues of ethnicity and political opportunities at the national level have been affected by the leverage of global norms (specifically the International Labour Organisation's Covenant No. 169) by both international and national actors.

T1  - The Changing Character and Survival Strategies of the Chinese Community in India
AN  - 1738476855; 201538494
AB  - The Chinese community has been settled in India for more than two centuries. Its relationship to the host society and to the authorities, first British and then Indian, has gone through different stages with different forms. It is important to examine the lives, traditions and attitudes of the Chinese community to understand its development and its changing character. This study argues that it is misleading to present this community as one that has always been marginalised and discriminated against in India. It examines the applicability of concepts such as 'sojourning', 'corridors' and 'middleman minority' to the community and its different sub-groups, both in British India and in post-independence India.

T1  - Race and Mortality Revisited
AN  - 1680152118; 201514063
AB  - In an article in the January/February 2000 issue of Society titled Race and Mortality, I explained the statistical pattern, inherent in other than highly irregular risk distributions, whereby the rarer an outcome, the greater tends to be the relative (percentage) difference between the rates at which advantaged and disadvantaged groups experience the outcome and the smaller tends to be the relative difference between rates at which such groups avoid the outcome. By way of example with respect to the health and healthcare outcomes on which the article principally focused, as mortality declines, relative differences in mortality tend to increase while relative differences in survival tend to decrease; as healthcare generally improves, relative differences in receipt of appropriate care tend to decrease while relative differences in failing to receive such care tend to increase.

T1  - An Intersectional Analysis to Explaining a Lack of Physical Activity Among Middle Class Black Women
AN  - 1559005147; 201432006
AB  - In this essay, I make the case that the intersectionality framework is useful to explain the high level of obesity among Black women. I describe how the intersectionality framework reformulates the examination of racial and gender disparities in health by deconstructing traditional frames of Whiteness and maleness. Next, I discuss key barriers that operate as mechanisms to reduce Black women's level of physical activity. Then, I provide ways to potentially combat these barriers. In doing so, I argue that being physically active is a privilege rooted in how race, place, gender, and body image converge differently on Black women's propensity to be physically active than other raced and gendered groups. Middle class Black women are excluded from class-based privileges and experience a form of space invasion where their temporal space, geographic space, and bodily space are invaded. In this regard, this research agenda is not solely about physical activity but rather how the structural arrangements of communities contribute to healthy lifestyles.

T1  - Balancing stigma and status: racial and class identities among middle-class Haitian youth
AN  - 1559005734; 201431942
AB  - This article examines the identity formation of middle-class Haitian youth. Segmented assimilation theory predicts that the Haitian second generation will integrate into the black American underclass or maintain strong ethnic group identities. The black middle class, however, is an unexplored pathway of cultural assimilation. This paper uses the literature on the racial and class experiences of the black American middle class as a departure point for understanding the boundary work of middle-class Haitian youth. Based on qualitative interviews and a focus group, we uncover the mechanisms of identity formation for this invisible population. Racial, ethnic and class boundaries compel Haitian youths to create strategies of either empowerment or distancing. They negotiate between their middle-class status and ethnoracial exclusion in a racially segregated neighbourhood, an ethnically homogenous church and a mixed-race school setting. This study's findings extend our theoretical understandings of middle-class immigrants and their identity work. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Xinjiang in 2013: problems and prospects
AN  - 1551002669; 201429042
AB  - Several major disturbances in Xinjiang in China's northwest in 2013 have further exacerbated the already tense ethnic relations between the Han Chinese and the main minority in Xinjiang, the Uighurs, who are Turkic and Muslim. The Chinese state blames terrorism but most Western journalists remain sceptical. This article argues that terrorism is indeed a real threat, but the Chinese state tends to overreact to disturbances, exacerbating the problems. China's response has included befriending countries further west, including Turkey. The outlook is not good for ethnic harmony, but the region is likely to develop economically and the prospects for independence or quasi-independence from China are very poor.

T1  - Performing ethnic relations in Russia's North Caucasus: regional spectacles in Stavropol' krai
AN  - 1541997831; 201426875
AB  - Using materials gathered during fieldwork carried out in Russia in 2008 and 2009, this paper examines the 'Day of Stavropol' krai 2009' celebration and links it to debates on ethnic relations, identity and nationalism in post-Soviet Russia. It is argued that celebrations, festivals, parades and other 'spectacles' are significant, yet often overlooked, influences on ethnic relations. Although authorities at national and regional scale play a prominent role in governing ethnic relations, it is often the case that they revert to Soviet-era practices -- such as the 'folklorization' of ethnic groups -- and produce a narrative that proclaims the 'eternal harmony' of ethnic relations. Given widespread ethnic tensions that exist in Russia, such a representation of ethnic relations is far from the reality lived by people in everyday life. Thus, this paper explores how citizens' understandings of ethnic relations relates to that portrayed by state authorities. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ultranationalist Genocides: Failures of Global Justice in Nigeria and Pakistan
AN  - 1718068018; 201530787
AB  - International law entered a period of accelerated change in the decade after the genocide of the Ibo people in Nigeria. By 1979, jurists had drafted much-needed reforms to international law in the areas of prohibited methods of war, the rights of refugees, and the infliction of severe pain to punish dissent or to discriminate on racial or religious grounds. These reforms, if implemented in good faith, provide a basis for international criminal tribunals to punish the widespread killing and abuse of civilians in non-international armed conflicts. International courts analysed few such conflicts in the decades after the Genocide Convention entered into force, despite the aim of the convention to prevent genocide by public or private actors, in time of war or peace, and by targeting a group in whole or in part. This article analyses the Ibo genocide in terms of the techniques used by the Nigerian army to destroy the Ibo ethnic group in substantial part, including massacres of Ibo civilians, imposition of widespread and disease epidemics on the Ibos, and rape of Ibos as a matter of policy. It surveys the influence of the Biafran genocide on the evolution of international norms relating to war crimes, refugees, and torture. The international community multiplied norms in lieu of enforcing them, in this case as in others. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - War by Other Means: Cultural Policy and the Politics of Corporate Consociation in Bosnia and Herzegovina
AN  - 1512219360; 201408797
AB  - Civil war obliterates memories of past coexistence. Yet, memories can also be erased through peacetime denial of legitimacy and funding to institutions preserving artifacts and remains testifying to a past of cultural hybridity. This article examines the interplay between cultural policy and constitutional framework in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to explain the recent closure of Sarajevo's museums. It argues that the institutions' demise reflects a new state-building project founded on the separate development of mutually exclusive cultural and ethnic communities. Amnesia about past coexistence is instrumental to the political stability of BiH's corporate consociation but may hamper long-term conflict resolution. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "Everybody Writes": Readers and Editors and Their Interactions in the Polish-Language Press, 1922-1969
AN  - 1504421958; 201405486
AB  - In 1941, Antoni Wacyk, a reader of the Polish-language weekly Ameryka-Echo, wrote in his letter published in "Kacik dla Wszystkich" (Corner for everybody): "Take in your hand any issue of Ameryka-Echo, and you will see that the division into editors and subscribers does not exist here, that everybody writes. And what they write is beautiful. And it does not matter that it is sometimes grammatically incorrect." Wacyk belonged to the large and diasporic community of readers-writers in the "Corner," a section for letters from readers, which appeared in Ameryka-Echo between 1922 and 1969. The "Corner's" international reach, the longevity, vigor, and openness of its readers' discussions, the variety of topics, and diversity of readers and their interests created a unique public forum, where editors negotiated with readers the boundaries of their control over the section, and readers interacted among themselves without facilitation by the editors. The ethnic press has long been a focus of attention for historians and other social scientists. Recognized by historians as a rich source of information on the structure, developments, and issues in ethnic communities, with the views and opinions of its editors either shaping or reflecting positions of their immigrant audiences, the ethnic press returns time and again as a vital resource for historical research. Yet, we know very little about both the communities of readers and groups of editors, or about the nuances of the editorial process, which often involved readers as co-creators of the newspaper content, mainly through the publication of their letters.

T1  - National Identity and Group Narcissism as Predictors of Intergroup Attitudes Toward Undocumented Latino Immigrants in the United States
AN  - 1494748570; 201402193
AB  - The debate surrounding immigration reform to address undocumented Latino immigrants in the United States has been emotionally charged and polarizing. This study's goal was to better understand some of the psychological predictors of attitudes toward undocumented Latino immigrants in the United States, namely, collective identity as an American, group-level narcissism, and their interaction. A university sample (N = 223) completed an online survey measuring attitudes toward undocumented Latino immigrants. As anticipated, we found that, at mean and high (but not low) levels of group narcissism, national in-group identification was a significant predictor of attitudes toward undocumented Latino immigrants. The implications of these findings, limitations, and suggestions for future research are discussed in light of the current debate on undocumented immigration in the United States.

T1  - Does Having a Kin State Lessen the Likelihood of Minorities Engaging in Secessionist Mobilization? An Analysis of the Moderating Influence of Kin States
AN  - 1463011779; 201345845
AB  - Existing research has demonstrated that the ability of secessionist movements to mobilize is highly contingent on assistance from external actors, especially via transborder ethnic ties. The specific relationship between kin state and kin group is seen as particularly enhancing to opportunities for secessionism/irredentism. Yet, the analysis of data (1989-2011) does not support this claim. Relatively few groups with kin states have engaged in violent secessionism, and these examples are mostly restricted to successor states from Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. Thus, this article argues that there are a number of reasons why the relationship between kin state and group increasingly engenders moderation. These reasons are the following: the failure of irredentism as a policy and idea; the asymmetric and problematic relations between kin state and group; and the protective capacity and the provision of resources by the kin state. As such, while external help is vital for secessionist groups to successfully mobilize, kin states typically provide assistance that fosters restraint and peace among their kin.

T1  - Contemporary Fertility Patterns and First-Birth Timing Among Mexican-Origin Women
AN  - 1429629454; 201335674
AB  - This article examines first-birth timing among Mexican women in the United States over two birth cohorts. Currently, Mexican women are one of a small group that maintains above-replacement fertility in the United States, contributing to both Mexican population growth and overall national population growth. Yet, the fertility timing of Mexican women has undergone a significant transformation over the past 40 years. Using the 1988, 1995, and 2002 National Survey of Family Growth, this article employs first-birth probabilities and Cox proportional hazard models to show how Mexican fertility timing differs from that of other major racial and ethnic groups. The evidence suggests that the racial/ethnic, nativity, and educational diversity of the Mexican-origin population has led to the emergence of two distinct patterns of first-birth timing. The findings from this study point to the need to reconsider the role of Mexican fertility timing in important national discussions of women's reproductive health and immigration/population polices.

T1  - Mortality salience and uncertainty: Similar effects but different processes
AN  - 1429629368; 201335604
AB  - Three experimental studies investigated whether death-thoughts avoidance as a consequence of mortality salience and need for certainty as a consequence of uncertainty are two different motivational states. The results suggest that although death-thought avoidance and need for certainty are different constructs, they share a great deal of variance (anxiety plays a pivotal mediational role in both). However, whereas the impact of uncertainty on negative attitudes towards an out-group with different worldviews (Arabs) was mediated only by anxiety (measured retrospectively), the effect of mortality salience was mediated by both retrospective anxiety and death-thought accessibility. These findings imply that similar effects that have been obtained by these two manipulations are, at least partly, the result of different processes. . [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Bangladeshi Migrant Workers in Hong Kong: Adaptation Strategies in an Ethnically Distant Destination
AN  - 1364702608; 201323279
AB  - The paper attempts to explore the adaptation-related challenges that Bangladeshi migrant workers in Hong Kong face and the strategies they adopt to triumph over them. Data were collected through administering both closed and open-ended questionnaires to 56 migrant workers in Hong Kong during 2005-2006. The study revealed that most of the respondents stayed in Hong Kong legally but worked illegally because of the fact that although they could extend their stay permits, they were not grated work permits. This exclusive circumstance places them in a number of difficult situations. In attempting to adapt to Hong Kong society, they embrace a number of interesting and unique strategies to surmount challenges. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Marley Hypothesis: Denial of Racism Reflects Ignorance of History
AN  - 1448996614; 201342901
AB  - This study used a signal detection paradigm to explore the Marley hypothesis -- that group differences in perception of racism reflect dominant-group denial of and ignorance about the extent of past racism. White American students from a midwestern university and Black American students from two historically Black universities completed surveys about their historical knowledge and perception of racism. Relative to Black participants, White participants perceived less racism in both isolated incidents and systemic manifestations of racism. They also performed worse on a measure of historical knowledge (i.e., they did not discriminate historical fact from fiction), and this group difference in historical knowledge mediated the differences in perception of racism. Racial identity relevance moderated group differences in perception of systemic manifestations of racism (but not isolated incidents), such that group differences were stronger among participants who scored higher on a measure of racial identity relevance. The results help illuminate the importance of epistemologies of ignorance: cultural-psychological tools that afford denial of and inaction about injustice. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Compare and contrast: understanding Irish migration to Britain in a wider context
AN  - 1429623954; 201335831
AB  - This article explores the potential for comparative research across different migrant groups. Research on migration is often weakened by the marked tendency to use a single ethnic/national group as the unit of analysis. Analysing migration from the experiences of a particular ethnic group may exaggerate ethnic exceptionalism and understate the extent to which experiences are shared across different migrant groups. My recent experiences on a range of research projects with diverse migrants to London made me think about similarities with the Irish, but each in different ways. However, there is a dearth of comparative analysis in relation to the Irish experience in Britain. On the one hand, there are many studies of Irish migrants, but these tend to focus solely on the Irish or else examine the relationship between Irish migrants and the 'native' British population. There has been little work on how the Irish relate to other migrant groups within British society. On the other hand, studies of other migrant communities rarely refer to the Irish as a comparative group. The article explores the reasons for the dearth of comparative work involving Irish migrants in Britain. In so doing, it considers some of the benefits and challenges of going beyond the 'ethnic lens'. What would be gained but also lost by viewing Irish migration to Britain through a more comparative perspective? I explore how such comparative analysis might contribute, firstly, to a wider understanding of migration processes, experiences and inter-migrant relations, and, secondly, to a fuller appreciation of varied dimensions of migratory experiences in Britain. These issues are considered through a comparison of Polish and Irish migration to Britain. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The "Wages of Burman-ness:" Ethnicity and Burman Privilege in Contemporary Myanmar
AN  - 1347784875; 201318947
AB  - Ethnicity is one of the primary lenses through which scholars view conflict in Burma/Myanmar. In this paper I examine the dominance of the majority ethnic group in Myanmar, the Burmans, and the ways in which Burman-ness functions as a privileged identity. I draw from the theoretical framework of Whiteness and White privilege in critical race theory to argue that, although there are important analytical differences between race and ethnicity, we can conceptualise Burman-ness as a form of institutionalised dominance similar to Whiteness. I support this argument by documenting the ways in which Burmans are privileged in relation to non-Burmans, while still, in many cases, seeing themselves as equally subject to government repression. This analysis of Burman privilege (and blindness to that privilege) is particularly relevant given the fact that the political reforms implemented by Myanmar's new, partly civilian government since 2011 have opened new opportunities for (mostly Burman) activists while coinciding with increased military violence in some non-Burman border regions of the country.

T1  - Exclusion of HIV-positive people with disabilities in the media
AN  - 1541997148; 201426880
AB  - This current issue piece aims to address the harmful exclusion of people with disabilities in the Iranian media. In a case study, this author collected news related to statistics of HIV-positive people covered by popular news websites written in the Persian language between June 2011 and June 2012. Within the analysed electronic texts, no reference was made to the number of HIV-positive people with disabilities. Under the rubric of critical discourse analysis, one can argue that this lack of representation may also be linked to a more general level of discourse that constitutes the marginalization of people with disabilities. This damaging exclusion both legitimizes and reproduces the ideology that people with disabilities are social minorities who can be excluded to the benefit of powerful people. This current issue piece also discusses the potential negative consequences of excluding HIV-positive people with disabilities from the discourse of HIV/AIDS in the media. Ultimately, the conceivable reasons for the Iranian government failure or refusal to publish the statistics of HIV-positive people with disabilities will be provided. Studies from various countries could shed more light on the exclusion of HIV-positive people with disabilities in the media and the interplay between HIV/AIDS and disability issues.

T1  - Positive emotions and the social broadening effects of Barack Obama
AN  - 1622297820; 201438416
AB  - Past experiments have demonstrated that the cognitive broadening produced by positive emotions may extend to social contexts. Building on this evidence, we hypothesized that positive emotions triggered by thinking about Barack Obama may broaden and expand people's sense of self to include others. Results from an expressive-writing study demonstrated that African American college students prompted to write about Obama immediately prior to and after the 2008 presidential election used more plural self-references, fewer other-references, and more social references. Mediation analyses revealed that writing about Obama increased positive emotions, which in turn increased the likelihood that people thought in terms of more-inclusive superordinate categories (we and us rather than they and them). Implications of these findings for the role of positive emotions in perspective-taking and intergroup relations are considered. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'For Honor and Defence': Race and the Right to Bear Arms in Early Colonial Mexico
AN  - 1667951579; 201509049
AB  - The right to bear arms was one of the most exclusive sumptuary rights in early modern Iberia. The privilege of carrying weapons was transferred to Spanish America where it became a right reserved to Spaniards. This article examines over one hundred and fifty licenses to bear arms granted to non-Spaniards in New Spain during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. These licenses preserve the rhetoric of honor used by supplicants in order to justify the award. The varied content of these petitions provides a vivid illustration of how non-Spaniards sought to undercut the negative stereotypes imposed by society. By tracing the changing distribution of these licenses among various socio-racial groups, this article helps illustrate important changes in colonial racial attitudes and demographics. In particular, this study shows that over time men of African descent came to account for a larger percentage of recipients. These men demonstrate that the negative perception of African ancestry did not create an insurmountable barrier to individual advancement. Ultimately, these licenses highlight the personal pride and determination shown by these men as they sought to elevate their status in a highly stratified and discriminatory society.

T1  - 'Hunkering Down' in Multi-Ethnic Neighbourhoods? The Effects of Ethnic Diversity on Dimensions of Social Cohesion
AN  - 1283639540; 201303325
AB  - Putnam (2007) claims that in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods, residents of all ethnic groups tend to 'hunker down'. Solidarity and trust are lower, mutual help and cooperation rarer, and friends fewer. Various studies in the United States found a clear correlation between diversity and cohesion, and also for many different dimensions of social cohesion. Whether this finding also holds in other (European) settings is the subject of hot and unresolved debate. Specifically, this article addresses the question of whether living in an ethnically diverse setting has negative consequences for social cohesion in the Netherlands as well. Previous studies on the Netherlands remained inconclusive. We examine how this lack of consensus can be explained. To further the debate, this article pulls apart various contexts and various dimensions of social cohesion. This article examines the relationship between ethnic diversity (in socio-graphically defined neighbourhoods) and four dimensions of social cohesion (trust, informal help, voluntary work, and neighbourhood contacts) for the 50 largest cities in the Netherlands. We conclude that the Putnam hypothesis holds only to a limited extent in the Dutch context. The only aspect on which ethnic diversity has a negative effect is the degree of contact in the neighbourhood. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Model Blacks or "Ras the Exhorter": A Quantitative Content Analysis of Black Newspapers' Coverage of the First Wave of Afro-Caribbean Immigration to the United States
AN  - 1125220591; 201240517
AB  - This article examines the depiction of first-wave West Indian immigrants to the United States in Black print culture in the early 20th century. The authors conduct a series of content analyses of four newspapers that had wide circulation in the Black community between 1910 and 1940. Each content analysis serves as an empirical test one of four common hypotheses about ethnic differentiation between West Indians and African Americans: (a) the group consciousness hypothesis, (b) the racial nationalism hypothesis, (c) the radical politics hypothesis, and (d) the model minority hypothesis. The authors find very little empirical support for either the group consciousness hypothesis or the racial nationalism hypothesis and find only a modicum of support for the radical politics hypothesis. Finally, the authors find evidence confirming the model minority hypothesis. They also find that the Black press presented an accurate portrayal of the West Indian immigrants' socioeconomic advantages to native-born Blacks.

T1  - Age and the Cost of Being Uyghurs in Urumchi
AN  - 1125219288; 201240536
AB  - This article asks: is the cost of being Uyghurs higher for young Uyghurs than for old Uyghurs in Urumchi? I address this question with data from a survey of 2,947 people conducted in Urumchi in 2005. The cost of being Uyghurs refers to the extent of economic inequality in the earnings of Han Chinese and Uyghurs. I develop three hypotheses on the effect of age on earnings differentials between Han Chinese and Uyghurs. Data analyses show that although young Uyghurs are better educated and earn more than old Uyghurs, they are more likely than old Uyghurs to suffer from being Uyghurs in Urumchi. This finding has policy implications for the reduction of ethnic disparity in Xinjiang. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Citizenship, Co-ethnic Populations, and Employment Probabilities of Immigrants in Sweden
AN  - 1125224053; 201240353
AB  - Over the last decades, Sweden has liberalized its citizenship policy by reducing the required number of years of residency to 5 years for foreign citizens and only 2 years for Nordic citizens. Dual citizenship has been allowed since 2001. During the same period, immigration patterns by country of birth changed substantially, with an increasing number of immigrants arriving from non-western countries. Furthermore, immigrants were settling in larger cities as opposed to smaller towns as was the case before. Interestingly, the employment integration of immigrants has declined gradually, and in 2006, the employment rate for foreign-born individuals is substantially lower compared with the native-born. The aim of this paper is to explore the link between citizenship and employment probabilities for immigrants in Sweden, controlling for a range of demographic, human capital, and municipal characteristics such as city and co-ethnic population size. The information we employ for this analysis consists of register data on the whole population of Sweden held by Statistics Sweden for the year 2006. The basic register, STATIV, includes demographic, socio-economic, and immigrant specific information. In this paper, we used instrumental variable regression to examine the "clean" impact of citizenship acquisition and the size of the co-immigrant population on the probability of being employed. In contrast to Scott (2008), we find that citizenship acquisition has a positive impact for a number of immigrant groups. This is particularly the case for non-EU/non-North American immigrants. In terms of intake class, refugees appear to experience substantial gains from citizenship acquisition (this is not, however, the case for immigrants entering as family class). We find that the impact of the co-immigrant population is particularly important for immigrants from Asia and Africa. These are also the countries that have the lowest employment rate.

T1  - Bullying of Mexican Immigrant Students by Mexican American Students: An Examination of Intracultural Bullying
AN  - 1023027364; 201223916
AB  - This article reports on a study using qualitative methods to investigate intracultural bullying, specifically, bullying between Mexican American (MA) and Mexican immigrant (MI) high school students. Previous research has reported specific cultural conflicts and discrimination within ethnic groups due to differences in acculturation. The purpose of this study is to determine whether this phenomenon is reflected in bullying within a high school context. In-depth interviews are conducted with 6 students from each group (MA and MI) in Grades 9 through 12 at a predominantly Hispanic public school in the state of Washington. The data reveal that bullying does occur between the two groups, with Mexican American students consistently bullying Mexican immigrant students. Two major themes emerge from the data: language barrier and superiority. There are also four themes that arise from the Mexican American student participants that were not found among the Mexican immigrant student responses. These themes are bullying cycle, isolation, alienation, and school factors. Recommendations for practice are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Skin Tone, Racism, Locus of Control, Hostility, and Blood Pressure in Hispanic College Students
AN  - 1023026901; 201223981
AB  - There is some evidence that blood pressure is higher in persons with darker skin tone but the reasons for this remain unclear. When seen in minorities, the positive relationship between darkness of skin and blood pressure invites hypotheses about potential mediators of the relationship. We investigated the relationship in Hispanics of primarily Mexican descent and included measures of hostility, locus of control and perceived racial discrimination hypothesized to mediate higher blood pressure. Regression analysis revealed no relationship between darkness of skin and blood pressure but correlations between hypothesized mediators were significant and explicable. Cynical hostility and external locus of control were positively associated with perceived racial discrimination. We reasoned that the chronic experience of racial discrimination reinforces the perception of discrimination and feeds both external locus of control and cynical hostility despite no corresponding unfavorable effect on blood pressure.

T1  - Ethnic identification in response to perceived discrimination protects well-being and promotes activism: A longitudinal study of Latino college students
AN  - 1023026789; 201223676
AB  - Using structural equation modeling and cross-lagged analyses, this longitudinal study investigates ethnic identification, a group-based coping strategy, as a mediator of the influence of perceived discrimination on psychological well-being and willingness to engage in activism on behalf of one's ethnic group among Latino students in both their first and fourth years of college. We found cross-sectional evidence for the rejection-identification model (RIM) during both years of college. Further, multiple step bootstrapping analyses of the longitudinal data showed that the relationships between perceived discrimination during Year 1 and both well-being and activism during Year 4 were sequentially mediated by activism during Year 1 predicting ethnic identification during Year 4. These data extend the RIM by including activism as an additional outcome variable that has important implications for Latino students across time.

T1  - A Network Approach to the Study of the World Uyghur Congress' Global Outreach: A Methodological Note
AN  - 1492599367; 201400183
AB  - This methodological note is to introduce new social network analysis (SNA) data sets that can be used to visualize and analyze the global linkages of the World Uyghur Congress (WUC). The results show that first of all, the WUC and Rebiya Kadeer play central roles in mobilizing political activity around the globe. Second, human rights NGOs and other organizations from the Uyghur diaspora pervade the networks of the WUC, and are spearheading the coordination of events and the exchange of information. Third, the WUC is keen on connecting with government representatives and journalists. Fourth, a growing number of links exist between the WUC and news organizations. Such links are most obvious among news organizations situated within the same country, when a Uyghur-related event occurs. A quintessential example is observed in the SNA map, where Japanese press and media showed interest in reporting Uyghur news when WUC Secretary General Dolkun Isa visited Japan to promote the Uyghur issue in 2006. A case study of Uyghur linkages in Australia further demonstrates WUC influence over Uyghur activism in various corners of the world. The purpose of this paper is not only to provide the first visualization and empirical test in regard to WUC networks that China's government and various China observers have believed to exist. With this document, I also demonstrate how a network approach can provide alternate ways for researchers to conduct their respective studies on diasporic networks of Tibetans, Taiwanese, or Chinese.

T1  - Greek American Identities in the 21st Century: A Generational Approach
AN  - 1641424405; 201500227
AB  - For more than a century, researchers have attempted to interpret and understand the assimilation/acculturation process and identity of immigrant ethnic groups in the United States. During the early 1900s, the term melting pot came into general usage to describe the emergence of the new immigrant American. Based on both the metaphor and the sociological melting pot theory, it was assumed that immigrants like ingredients mixed in a pot, would eventually blend into one mainstream culture and lose their own distinctions over time. It was concluded that by the third generation, grandchildren of immigrants would have completely assimilated into the American society, leaving behind all traces of ethnicity. Subsequent studies supported this hypothesis by demonstrating that ethnic Americans become less ethnic over several generations. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Mobilizing Race, Class, And Gender Discourses In A Metropolitan Community Church
AN  - 1347781261; 201318921
AB  - Drawing on principles of intersectionality, I explore how members of a southeastern Metropolitan Community Church use race, class, and gender discourses to construct and signify moral identities as Christian sexual minorities. Based on fourteen months of fieldwork, I demonstrate how members mobilized discourses emphasizing the incorporation of racial diversity, the minimization of class distinctions, and the equalization of gender categories within the church to signify their own moral worth. Moreover, I show how members anchored these discourses in the authority of Biblical scripture, which allowed them to claim moral standing within the larger Christian tradition while minimizing the tension between their sexual and religious identity claims. In conclusion, I draw out two central implications of this work: (1) how race, class, and gender discourses may provide symbolic resources for integrating sexual and religious identities and locally constructing sexual and religious morality; and (2) the importance of intersectional analyses for assessing LGBT religious experience.

T1  - When High Group Status Becomes a Burden: Requesting Outgroup Help and Spying by Members of High and Low Status Groups
AN  - 1221407584; 201243947
AB  - The present paper investigates the strategic motives that guide the quest for outgroup resources. Resources can be retrieved through spying and requesting help. Whereas both methods are means of obtaining valued resources from the outgroup, spying secures the ingroup's public image, while requesting help potentially damages this image by displaying the ingroup as incompetent and dependent. Two experiments (N = 99 and N = 99) supported the prediction that, when social change is feasible, members of high status groups spy more on the lower status group than vice versa. No difference was found in either study in the amount of help requested from the outgroup. Results from the second study showed that the effect did not occur when status relations were legitimate and thus unlikely to change. These findings advance our understanding of intergroup helping by demonstrating that strategic motives fundamentally shape aspects of help-seeking between groups. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - From Avatar to Reality: Development, Environment and the Representation of Cameroonian Pygmies
AN  - 1125223879; 201240410
AB  - This article discusses the challenges facing indigenous peoples when external interventions are conducted in their territories. Using a discourse analysis approach, it shows how indigenous peoples are constructed by groups pursuing diverging interests. Focusing on the case of Cameroonian Pygmies, three discourses are studied: the conservationist, the development and the pro-indigenous peoples discourses. The result of the analysis shows how indigenous peoples are represented and which values and norms stand out in discourses. It highlights how the construction of one's own reality can advantage or disadvantage groups of peoples: Pygmies represent a threat to the environment for environmentalists, they are poor for development actors, and they are above all mistreated for those defending their rights. The underlying theme is the transition to "modernity", its inevitability or imposition, as well as the resistance and adaptation of indigenous peoples to external influences.

T1  - Territory, Ancestry and Descent: The Politics of Sickle Cell Disease
AN  - 1018354199; 201212831
AB  - Sociologists have long questioned the naturalness and stability of 'ethnic groups', suggesting that a concern with how they are socially constituted is more appropriate. However, the example of genetically based medical conditions appears to challenge this by suggesting that, in certain cases, ancestry, territorial affiliation and identity may be linked objectively by genetics. The article uses the example of sickle cell disease (SCD) to examine this claim. After reviewing the difficulties associated with notions of ethnicity, the article develops an account of how SCD came to be seen as an 'ethnic disease', and how it came to play a major role in the stabilization of particular forms of group identity. It concludes by emphasizing the need for a critical view of popular notions of territory and group identification. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright BSA Publications Ltd.]

T1  - Pakeha Women and Maori Protocol: The Politics of Criticising Other Cultures
AN  - 1023030702; 201223820
AB  - Feminists have fiercely debated whether it is wrong for outsiders to criticise gendered customs and practices identified with cultural minorities. This article explores the ethics of criticising other cultures by analysing the reaction to public criticism of Maori ceremonial protocol by two Pakeha women. It argues that the response to outsiders' criticism does not depend in a simple and direct way on whether insiders have resisted the criticised practice. There is a history of Maori women formulating critiques of the gender roles in Maori ceremonies, but the public response from Maori women to the Pakeha women's criticism was overwhelmingly negative. The outsiders' criticism was understood as an attack on the incorporation of Maori cultural expression into the public sector, rather than as a gesture of support or solidarity.

T1  - African-American Lesbian Identity Management and Identity Development in the Context of Family and Community
AN  - 902085265; 201122283
AB  - Don't Ask, Don't Tell is gaining attention in family studies literature as a cultural specific context to understand lesbian, gay, and bisexual visibility in African-American families and communities. This policy suggests that sexual minorities are accepted within African-American families and communities as long as they do not label themselves or acknowledge publicly that they engage in same-sex relationships. The narratives of two African-American lesbians (aged 26 and 27 years) are chronicled in the present study to reveal their lesbian identity development, lesbian identity management, and how they defined and navigated Don't Ask, Don't Tell. They encountered challenges and successes in a quest to find communities that would embrace and affirm their multiple marginalized identities. Their stories are offered as a point of entry to further inquiry concerning African-American lesbian visibility and identity proclamation within African-American families and communities.

T1  - Islamic Activism and Immigrant Integration: Turkish Organizations in Germany
AN  - 870433595; 201114331
AB  - This article compares the four largest Turkish Islamic organisations -- Diyanet, Milli Gorus, the Suleymanl(dotless i) and the Gulen communities -- in Germany in order to facilitate a clearer understanding of the role of Islamic organisations in Muslim immigrant integration. In Germany, where integration policies fall between the multiculturalist and assimilationist paradigms, Turkish Muslims constitute the largest ethnic community originating in Muslim majority countries. This study argues that it is not helpful to group all Islamic organisations together because they each have different fields of activity upon which they concentrate their resources. Each Islamic organisation should be analysed separately as this permits the categorisation of the activities and characteristics of Islamic organisations into those that promote or hinder integration.

T1  - Ali's Disappearance: The Tension of Moving and Dwelling in the Norwegian Welfare Society
AN  - 852898090; 201103220
AB  - In this article I address the tension--experienced by many young migrants--between pursuing individual goals and dreams for the future in Norwegian society, and fulfilling their responsibilities to family, kin and ethnic community. The discussion starts with the story of Ali, a young Somali boy who was sent abroad by his relatives in Norway to look after an aunt in Italy. The discussion centres around three issues. The first concerns the nomadic habitus and its relation to person, space and place; the second is about how space and self are constructed in the Norwegian welfare discourse of integration; and the third explores the overlapping expectations and interests implied in these different ways of structuring individuality and collectivity. The article concludes by emphasising the importance of considering both collective and individual motives, drives and responsibilities in analysing the lives of young migrants.

T1  - Introductory Study: Civil Society Actors and the International Protection Regime for Minorities
AN  - 896195928; 201120110
AB  - This article is a first step in a research project that studies the existence, identity and agency of civil society actors that engage directly with the international minority protection regime. It provides a preliminary description and typology of civil society actors focusing exclusively on minority protection and presents a dataset on these actors constructed from a wide range of sources, including the Yearbook of International Organizations. It also gives an insight into the agency and influence of civil society actors specialising in minority protection by looking at some of their strategies for norm entrepreneurship, also drawing from the findings of contributors to this special issue. By outlining a research agenda, this article identifies questions that explore the perspectives of civil society actors on the weaknesses and strengths of the current international minority protection regime with a view to identifying potential pathways for its improvement.

T1  - Attitudinal and sociostructural factors and their role in dialect change: Testing a model of subjective factors
AN  - 887499853; 201118951
AB  - The causation of language change is a problem with a high profile in sociolinguistics. This paper presents two contrasting models of language change: one that is based on sociopsychological factors (Kristiansen & Jorgensen, 2005) and one that rejects them (the Napoleon Principle, Brink & Lund, 1979). In a longitudinal study of individuals' changing pronunciation of the Danish aj-diphthong over 20 years, we test predictions following from the sociopsychologically oriented model. By the mid-1980s, female speakers used more aj-pronunciations that are associated with high socioeconomic status than did male speakers. However, in guise tests, females revealed a more positive attitude toward speech associated with low socioeconomic status. Our prediction that female speakers would change their speech patterns to include more aj-pronunciations associated with low socioeconomic status is supported by an analysis of the same female speakers' pronunciations as recorded in the mid-2000S.

T1  - Who Counts as a Muslim? Identity, Multiplicity and Politics
AN  - 1081861794; 201235228
AB  - My aim in this paper is to carve out a political understanding of the Muslim identity. The Muslim identity is shaped within a religious mold. Inseparable from this religious understanding is a political one that is valuable in its own right in order to secure any sustainable possibility of participating politically as Muslims within a democratic liberal democracy, such as the United States. Here I explore not the historical or theological formation of the Muslim identity, rather a metaphysical understanding of it, in order to mobilize politically while avoiding the traps of essentialism. I begin with a brief overview of the early understandings of the term 'identity politics' in the United States. Moving beyond interest-based movements I explore Maria Lugones' particular understanding of the self as multiplicitous. I then offer examples of the Muslim identity within the context of a social movement and individualist claims, in order to draw out the political aspects of the Muslim identity. In the final section I argue that the theological criteria that define 'who counts as a Muslim' is a crucial aspect of how many Muslims may understand their identity as Muslims. However, I claim that in order to avoid the traps of marginalization of Muslim minorities, one must understand oneself as a multiplicitous political agent and that, furthermore, such an understanding is not at odds with Islam or one's own understanding of their identity as Muslim.

T1  - Drawing Attention to A Public Deficit: Sociological Self-Reflections on Growing Up with ADD
AN  - 1037879272; 201230910
AB  - This article explores my own personal struggles with Attention Deficit Disorder as well as the larger implications of the disorder facing society as a whole through the lenses of both micro and macro sociological theories and concepts using a sociological imagination framework. It also works towards breaking down the common beliefs and misconceptions in society about what exactly having ADD entails, and how on a personal level one can work to combat these misconceptions. As a person with Attention Deficit Disorder taking the step of sharing her story in this paper, I believe it is important to work toward a paradigm shift in how the world views ADD, because for those who have ADD, the greatest barrier to the diagnosis is the public perception.

T1  - Can the American Dream Survive the New Multiethnic America? Evidence from Los Angeles
AN  - 1010633277; 201210492
AB  - Drawing from a survey conducted in Los Angeles, we examine perceptions of achievement and optimism about reaching the American dream among racial, ethnic, and nativity groups. We find blacks and Asian Americans less likely than whites to believe they have reached the American dream. Latinos stand out for their upbeat assessments, with naturalized citizens possessing a stronger sense of achievement and noncitizens generally optimistic that they will eventually fulfill the American dream. We discuss patterns of variation between the racial and ethnic groups as well as variation within each group. Notwithstanding interesting differences along lines of race, ethnicity, and nativity, we find no evidence that the nation's changing ethnic stew has diluted faith in the American dream.

T1  - Strangers on the Shore? Racialized Representation, Identity and In/visibilities of Whiteness at the English Seaside
AN  - 1010630393; 201210485
AB  - This article presents an alternative reading of the English seaside -- one that centralizes race, specifically the effects of whiteness and racialized notions of belonging and exclusion. It addresses three main issues. First, it provides a theoretical discussion of the racialized production of social space and place, and outlines the implications for minority ethnic groups at the seaside. Second, it offers an examination of the manner in which discourses of whiteness and (neo-)colonial fantasy are reproduced through amusements and other elements of seaside popular culture. Third, it demonstrates the centrality of the seaside to analysing dominant, racialized interpretations of English national identity and demotic responses to contemporary immigration. The article argues that the seaside is an enlightening site for understanding contemporary constructions, manifestations and repercussions of whiteness, and thus provides an important insight into the cultural and spatial politics of race in 21st-century Britain.

T1  - Are local health department expenditures related to racial disparities in mortality
AN  - 852898419; 201103247
AB  - This study estimated whether 1990-1997 changes in expenditures per capita of local health departments (LHDs) and percentage share of local public revenue allocated to LHDs were associated inversely with 1990-1997 changes in mortality rates for Black and White racial/ethnic groups in the US. Population was 883 local jurisdictions with 1990 and 1997 mortality rates for Black and White racial populations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder Compressed Mortality File and LHD expenditures from the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Using a time-trend ecologic design, changes in LHD expenditures per capita and percentage share of public revenue were not related to reductions in Black/White disparities in total, all-cause mortality rates. Increased LHD expenditures or percentage share were associated with reduced Black/White disparities for adults aged 15-44 and males. LHD expenditures or percentage share were related to absolute reductions in mortality for infants, Blacks, and White females but did not close Black-White mortality differences for these groups. Therefore, disparities in Black and White mortality rates for subgroups with the greatest mortality gaps may be more likely to be reduced by public investment in local health departments than disparities in Black and White total, all-cause mortality rates.

T1  - Understanding the Occurrence of Interracial Marriage in the United States Through Differential Assimilation
AN  - 835111551; 201100517
AB  - American society is undergoing unprecedented cultural changes in the 21st century. This social transformation began with the civil rights movement in the 1960s. As the United States becomes more diverse, both racially and ethnically, equal access to a variety of social institutions and organizations becomes more challenging. With respect to marriage, popular media continually report the blurring of boundaries between racial and ethnic groups. As a result, there has been a tremendous increase in interracial dating and marriage over the past several decades. There are considerable differences between the occurrence of interracial dating and interracial marriage. Data suggest that there is a much higher level of interracial dating in comparison to interracial marriage. This research effort focuses on trends in interracial marriages in the United States between 1980 and 2006. Information from the U.S. Census Bureau was used to analyze changes in the number and frequency of interracial marriages in American society over a 22-year time frame. Differential assimilation is employed for understanding interracial marriage trends and distinguishing important statistical differences between marriages with a Black1 spouse and those interracial marriages not involving a Black spouse. This exploration provides important empirical findings for assessing the progress of assimilation in America. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

AB  - With this issue we complete Volume 33 of Ethnic and Racial Studies. This has been another successful year in the development of this journal, as reflected in the quality of the regular articles that we have published and in the articles included in the five special issues we have produced in 2010. The impact of the journal on the wider scholarly communities has been reflected in the increased Impact Factor we have been awarded in the ISI Social Science Citation Index for 2009, published in 2010. It is also evident in the increased volume of high-quality submissions that we receive in the editorial office from an increasing range of countries and research groupings. During boeth 2009 and 2010 we have seen significant increases in the submission of both regular and special issue articles to the journal. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - When yielding pieces of the pie is not a piece of cake: Identity-based intergroup effects in negotiations
AN  - 822518948; 201068358
AB  - The present research intends to shed light on an identity-based intergroup effect in negotiations by demonstrating that the mere perception of the negotiation as an instance of intergroup interaction suffices to impair the negotiation process and to deteriorate its outcomes. It was predicted that negotiators' salient group identities increase their competitive perceptions, reduce their concession behavior, and consequently lead to inferior negotiation outcomes. Study 1 revealed that solo negotiators with salient group identities achieved lower joint outcomes than negotiators with salient individual identities. Study 2 systematically explored the underlying mechanisms of this identity-based intergroup effect by analyzing negotiators' concession-making behaviors over the course of the negotiation. The results of the second experiment replicate the findings of the first study and further show that the detrimental effect of an identity-based intergroup context will occur in distributive as well as integrative negotiations. The findings of the present research are discussed with respect to their contribution to future research on intergroup negotiation.

T1  - ARTICULATING A POLITICS OF (MULTIPLE) IDENTITIES
AN  - 852898619; 201103321
AB  - This work examines the strategies Black lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people use in Black environments to proclaim a gay identity that is simultaneous with a Black identity. It identifies three distinctive features of LGBT protest in Black communities. Black gay protest takes on a particular form when individuals are also trying to maintain solidarity with the racial group despite the threat of distancing that occurs as a result of their sexual minority status. Black sexual minorities who see their self-interests as linked to those of other Blacks use cultural references to connect their struggles to historical efforts for Black equality and draw from nationalist symbols and language to frame their political work. They believe that increasing their visibility in Black spaces will promote a greater understanding of gay sexuality as an identity status that can exist alongside, rather than in competition with, race. The findings of this research have implications for larger discussions of identity, protest, and gay sexuality in intraracial contexts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cyprus, ethnic conflict and conflicted heritage
AN  - 758122077; 201056906
AB  - This article examines the dominant heritage discourse in Cyprus concerning preservation and destruction, and its implications for ethno-cultural identity construction and promotion. By exploring two heritage sites (one north and one south of the Buffer Zone) it suggests that heritage practice is more complex than commonly presented. Specifically, it shows how ethnic conflict has not only been responsible for heritage destruction but also for the preservation of it as an unintended consequence of 'freezing' development. It also examines how ethnic groups and individuals may come to evaluate their 'own' heritage negatively, specifically as an inconvenient cultural load, in efforts to develop ideologically specific or socially 'progressive' identities.

T1  - Racial and Ethnic Differentials in Idleness, Highest-Risk Idleness, and Dropping Out of High School
AN  - 868013734; 201113871
AB  - This research investigates three different indicators of at-risk socio-demographic conditions including dropping out of high school, being idle, and being in highest-risk idleness among non-immigrant persons aged 19-24. Using data from the 2000 US Census, our results detail the differentials in these characteristics for 30 different racial/ethnic groups that are further broken down by gender. The findings indicate a wide range in the prevalence of these at-risk socio-demographic conditions. Groups that tend to be the most at-risk in terms of these indicators include African Americans, Cambodians, Laotians, Native Americans, other Hispanic whites, and white Mexicans. With the exception of the other Pacific Islander and Thai, young women have lower high school dropout rates than do young men. However, young women are substantially more likely than young men to be idle which we define as not being in school, the labor force, or the military. After defining highest-risk idleness as never-married persons without children who are idle, however, the rates are slightly lower for young women than for young men.

T1  - What Does "White" Mean? Interpreting The Choice Of "Race" By Mixed Race Young People In Britain
AN  - 754040352; 201049803
AB  - Despite the often cited idea that racial identities are socially constructed, and potentially fluid, much public policy is still based on surveys that elicit only one measure of racial identity. A number of U.S. studies have employed "best single race" questions on racial identification, in which multiracial respondents are asked to choose only one race to describe themselves. We extend some American studies by examining responses to a "best single race" survey question posed to a small sample of multiracial young people in Britain. In-depth interviews with British multiracial respondents are employed to investigate the extent to which a "best single race" (BSR) question captures someone's sense of attachment and belonging to a particular ethnic or racial group. In particular, we focus on how we should interpret East Asian/white respondents' choice of "white" as their BSR. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Strategic Assimilation or Creation of Symbolic Blackness: Middle-Class Blacks in Suburban Contexts
AN  - 754038379; 201049754
AB  - The black middle class has been the subject of a great deal of scholarly inquiry. Recently, scholars have directed their attention towards understanding how middle class blacks negotiate their racial identity. Some contend that blacks engage in strategic assimilation, working and sometimes living alongside members of the dominant group, while simultaneously maintaining social ties with members of their own racial group. To examine changes in the size and composition of the black middle class in various suburban contexts comparisons were made of selected demographic data from 1990 and 2000. The purpose of the study is to see if middle class blacks are engaging in strategic assimilation. The findings reveal that the size of the black middle class increased between 1990 and 2000 and that demographic differences exist between members of the black middle class based upon whether or not they reside inside or outside of the suburbs. The findings support the contention that middle class blacks are not engaging in strategic assimilation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'True stories from bare times on road': Developing empowerment, identity and social capital among urban minority ethnic young people in London, UK
AN  - 743066938; 201043206
AB  - This paper is based on evaluative research in an inner-London borough on a programme designed to raise self esteem and deter minority ethnic young people from involvement in crime and participation in gangs. The aim of the programme was to work with young people 'at risk' or involved with gangs, violent crime and who may use weapons and to divert them from this behaviour. Essentially, the paper explores the way in which minority ethnic young people can be equipped to develop social capital. The paper firstly applies a brief contextual understanding of urban minority ethnic young people's experiences of school and 'street life'; secondly, it will describe the background and aims of the programme; and thirdly it will discuss whether and how the programme contributed to developing trust; to notions of awareness and empowerment; self-esteem and identity; and how it impacted on their social and family relationships.

T1  - Immigrant Participation in the Transnational Era: Latin Americans' Experiences with Collective Organising in Toronto
AN  - 743065902; 201043386
AB  - This paper examines the challenges migrant groups that are new and internally diverse face to participate and build community in host societies today. Qualitative research findings on Latin American migrants' experiences in Toronto, Canada, reveal that the group's participation is the result of a complexity of social and spatial processes. The paper contributes to current debates on the study of immigrant integration in three ways: (1) by focusing on immigrants' collective forms of organising, (2) by responding to ongoing calls for a closer examination of intra-group diversity, and (3) by drawing on transnationalism research to avoid the use of essentialising categories in the study of immigrant groups that are internally diverse.

T1  - The specter haunting multiculturalism
AN  - 743065851; 201043199
AB  - I argue that the specter haunting multiculturalism is incommensurability. In many discussions of multiculturalism there is a 'picture' that holds us captive -- a picture of cultures, religious or ethnic groups that are self-contained and are radically incommensurable with each other. I explore and critique this concept of incommensurability. I trace the idea of incommensurability back to the discussion by Thomas Kuhn -- and especially to the ways in which his views were received. Drawing on Gadamer's understanding of hermeneutics, I argue that the very idea of radical incommensurability is incoherent. This does not entail an abstract universalism but rather sensitivity to the ways in which all languages and cultures are in principle open to the real possibility of enlarging one's vision and mutually understanding.
