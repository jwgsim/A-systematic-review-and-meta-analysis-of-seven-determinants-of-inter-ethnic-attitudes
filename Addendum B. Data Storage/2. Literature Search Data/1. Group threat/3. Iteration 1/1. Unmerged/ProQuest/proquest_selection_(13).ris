T1  - Cultural intelligence and social distance among undergraduate students in clinical professions: GPIR
AN  - 2638250844
AB  - Cultural competence, also known as cultural intelligence (CQ), is considered a necessary skill in the clinical professions and for resolving intergroup conflict, yet it has not been examined within the framework of the contact hypothesis. The aim of the present research is to extend CQ theory from management to the clinical professions and examine it in a context of intergroup conflict. The present study examined CQ and social distance among entering undergraduate majority (Jewish) and minority (Arab) students in clinical study domains, hypothesizing that CQ will be negatively associated with social distance towards outgroup members and that minority students will report higher CQ than majority students. First-year students (N = 180) from diverse demographic and study domains (social work, nursing, behavioral sciences) were surveyed. The results reveal a novel negative association between CQ and outgroup social distance, and higher CQ among minority-group students. The finding that students from minority backgrounds were more receptive to intercultural exchange at the outset of their training suggests that CQ theory could be used in training and evaluation criteria of students entering clinical professional training.

T1  - Hate begets hate: anti-refugee violence increases anti-refugee attitudes in Germany
AN  - 2549027398
AB  - How does ethnic violence affect the perpetrator group’s attitudes towards the victim group? Combining the security threat and ultimate attribution error, I expect that perpetrator group members react to security threats caused by ethnic violence to form negative attitudes towards the victim group. This study tests this hypothesis using the case of ethnic violence against refugees who came to Germany during the “migrant crisis” in 2015. Results show that a higher rate of anti-refugee violence in a German state is associated with more negative attitudes towards refugees among German natives. The effect of ethnic violence is more prominent among Germans with higher concerns for security, pinpointing the threat mechanisms. A series of additional tests, including instrumental variable strategy, Bayesian analysis, and robustness checks support the conclusion. The results of this study indicate that ethnic violence induces negative attitudes among the perpetrator group towards the victim group.

T1  - Patterns of exclusion of ethno-religious minorities: The ethno-religious hierarchy across European countries and social categories within these countries
AN  - 2559712929
AB  - In this contribution, we set out to rigorously test previous theoretical propositions that people tend to have consensual and cumulative rankings of exclusion of ethnic and religious outgroups, often referred to as 'ethnic hierarchies' constituting a shared and particular pattern of ranking different outgroups, preferably excluded from possible social interaction. Crucial questions are (1) to what extent are European natives' levels of exclusion of Muslim, Jewish and Gypsy minority groups consensually and, moreover, hierarchically ranked? (2) to what extent is this pattern of exclusion comparable across representative samples of European countries and (3) to what extent is it comparable across relevant social categories within these countries? We take advantage of high quality cross-national European data asking representative samples of respondents whether they would not allow particular ethno-religious groups into their country, analyzed with probabilistic scalogram analysis. We found convincingly strong empirical evidence for the consensual and cumulative ranking of exclusion of typical ethno-religious outgroups: most Europeans wish to allow no Gypsies to come into their country, followed by Muslims and finally Jews as the least excluded ethno-religious outgroup. This rank order of outgroups' exclusionism was found in 18 out of 20 different European countries. Notwithstanding differences in the level of exclusion across countries, citizens within these countries rank order these ethno-religious groups in a similar, comparable and cumulative way. Moreover, we presented evidence that this cumulative rank order is present within many different social categories within these countries. Our contribution may be one of the first to rigorously test heavily cited theoretical propositions on social and polemic representations.

T1  - Key events and challenges: a computational text analysis of the 115<sup>th</sup> house of representatives on Twitter
AN  - 2518072938
AB  - To determine to what extent politicians publicly discuss environmental issues in line with public opinion and economic characteristics of their constituents, we conducted a computational text analysis of the 115th House of Representatives’ tweets about environmental issues. In polarized U.S. environmental politics, many Republicans attack the authority of scientists and regulators but some signal a desire for bipartisan policy compromises. Analyzing district characteristics and environmental communication on Twitter reveals that nominally pro-environment Republicans representing more moderate constituents fail to oppose their partisan colleagues, particularly during the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. At the same time, very few openly attacked climate science; instead, House Republicans primarily focused attention on fossil fuels, the Environmental Protection Agency and the right of the federal government to regulate economic activity. The ‘Waters of the United States’ served as a rallying cry for opposition to environmental regulation in the 115th House of Representatives.

T1  - Felt Age Among Racial/Ethnic Minority Older Adults Attending a Senior Center
AN  - 2500886950
AB  - Research shows that felt age among older adults is a good proxy for their current and future physical and mental health. Using both quantitative and qualitative interview data, we examined correlates of and self-reported reasons for felt age among 102 low–socioeconomic status (SES), non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic older adults who were members of a senior activity center. Fewer activities of daily living (ADL)/instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments, more positive affect, and higher self-efficacy were associated with higher odds of feeling younger, while financial stress was associated with lower odds. The most common self-reported reasons for younger felt age were staying active, followed by good health, positive attitudes, exercise/dancing, independence, interpersonal/intimate relationships, faith/spirituality, volunteering, family, driving/traveling, and being of sound mind. Poor health, lack of energy, and limited ability to engage in activities were self-reported reasons for older felt age. Senior center programs that enable older adults to stay active and socially integrated may contribute to their well-being.

T1  - Identifying Asian American Attitudes Toward Immigration: Testing Theories of Acculturation, Group Consciousness, and Context Effects
AN  - 2537714116
AB  - In this study, I test a model of competing theoretical explanations of Asian American attitudes toward immigration by studying the effects of acculturation, group consciousness and political commonality with other groups, and contextual factors. Using the 2018 Civic Engagement and Political Participation of Asian American Survey, Asian Americans' policy preferences on Syrian refugees, Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals (DACA), the Muslim travel ban, and a border wall are examined. Multinomial logistic regression analyses reveal that acculturation explains positive attitudes toward immigration among Asian Americans whereas factors such as Asian identity, political commonality with other racial groups, and the perceived racial mix of neighborhoods have limited and mixed influence on Asian American immigration attitudes. As one of very few studies on immigrants' attitudes toward immigration policies, this study contributes to our better understanding of how the fastest-growing immigrant group like Asian Americans determine their attitudes toward policies that target immigrants.

T1  - Propagated Preferences? Political Elite Discourses and Europeans’ Openness toward Muslim Immigrants: IMR
AN  - 2466008212
AB  - Immigration is among the most vividly discussed topics in Europe’s national parliaments in recent years, often with a particular emphasis on the inflow of Muslims. This article examines the link between articulations of national political parties (political elite discourses) and natives’ attitudes toward immigrants in Europe. It provides a nuanced view of this relationship by (i) distinguishing more (inclusionary) from less (exclusionary) immigration-friendly political elites and (ii) isolating natives’ openness toward two specific groups: Muslim immigrants and ethnically similar immigrants. Combining the European Social Survey with party manifesto data and other sources, the analysis reveals that political elite discourses perform better in explaining natives’ attitudes compared to national demographic or economic aspects. Native Europeans’ attitudes toward Muslim immigrants are more hostile in countries where political elites are more exclusionary and more welcoming where political elites are more inclusionary. In contrast, Europeans’ views on ethnically similar immigrants seem largely unaffected by exclusionary political elites. These findings suggest that political elites can play an important role in fostering or impeding immigrant integration by shaping public opinion, particularly toward more marginalized immigrant groups.

T1  - Love knows no colour bar: Windrush, racism and <i>Flame in the Streets</i>
AN  - 2428991997
AB  - Released in the aftermath of the 1958 Notting Hill riots, Flame in the Streets [Baker, Roy. 1961. UK: The Rank Organisation.] remains a distinctive British film of the 1960s in its examination of the racial prejudices that defined African-Caribbean's antagonous relations with the wider British Society. In Baker's attempt to expose the passive racisms of Jacko Palmer by paralleling his family conflict between his wife and daughter with his industrial conflicts as a trade union representative defending the rights of a black co-worker despite the disquiet that his ethnicity has generated from the white workers, the film presents ethnic minority characters in a form that links the personal with the political, interweaving themes of both class and race. Through a historicization and contextualization, this article sets out to examine the ways in which twentieth century post-war immigration and subsequent race struggles influenced the socio-political character of Flame in The Streets.

T1  - Close to me: The importance of closeness versus superficiality in explaining the positive‐negative contact asymmetry
AN  - 2408791442
AB  - The evidence for differential effects of positive and negative intergroup contact on prejudice is mixed. We propose that the closeness of the relationships respondents have with contact partners can explain inconsistencies in previous findings. In three studies (total N = 953), we tested the associations between positive intimate, negative intimate, positive superficial, and negative superficial contact and attitudes toward different outgroups (immigrants and gay people). We hypothesized that: (H1) the effect of positive contact would be maximized in intimate interactions; (H2) the effect of negative contact would be maximized in superficial interactions; (H3) positive intimate and negative superficial contact would have similar power in predicting attitudes. Results always supported H1, and supported H2 and H3 only with immigrants. Findings held also when controlling for category salience and agreeableness, but not for social dominance orientation, which instead strengthened the effect of negative superficial contact. Overall, findings clarify the positive–negative contact asymmetry.

T1  - The Electoral Success of the Extreme Right: Is the Presence of a Minority Important?*
AN  - 2454692602
AB  - Anti-minority rhetoric as an almost universal feature of extreme-right parties is often analytically and empirically linked to their electoral success. This article tests the link between the presence of an outgroup and the vote for the extreme right in an attempt to explain the electoral success of the first openly anti-system extreme-right party to enter the Slovak parliament in 2016. A multilevel approach is used to analyse the connection between Roma presence in a municipality and extreme-right support while controlling for the individual characteristics of voters. Analysis using exit-poll data covering 161 municipalities and 20 128 voters reveals no relationship between the presence of Roma in a municipality and support for the extreme right. A partial exception seems to be observed for older voters and the university-educated, who are generally the least inclined to far-right support. Interaction effects suggest that, for these groups, Roma presence might be connected to a higher probability to cast a vote for the extreme right. However, a notably higher chance of voting for the extreme right was associated with young, male, manual labourers and people without university education.

T1  - Affective responses to non-sexual imagery depicting gay men and lesbian women
AN  - 2391197420
AB  - When examining negative attitudes and behaviors directed toward gay men and lesbian women (i.e., homonegativity), researchers tend to use measures that require participants to respond to belief statements. This methodology is problematic for two reasons: 1) it focuses on the social categories “gay men” and “lesbian women” and ignores the practices of relational intimacy engaged in by gay and lesbian persons (practices that, arguably, are at the crux of homonegativity); and 2) it overlooks the affective responses that sexual minorities evoke in heterosexual people. These issues were tackled in the current study. Specifically, heterosexual participants (N = 241) were asked to report their affective state using six basic emotions while viewing photos depicting male-male, female-female, and heterosexual couples. Findings demonstrated that participants, regardless of gender, reacted most negatively to images of female-female couples engaging in everyday intimacies. Theoretical explanations for these findings are explored.

T1  - Sources of variation in attitudes toward minority, majority and foreign language: A minority L1 perspective
AN  - 2476863142
AB  - Vojvodina, an autonomous province in northern Serbia, is a historically multilingual and multicultural area where multilingual education forms a cornerstone of linguistic, educational and social policy and practice: in addition to the majority language, five minority languages are also in official use and speakers of these languages may receive education in their L1. However, such a situation does not warrant positive attitudes toward the majority language. In fact, attitudes toward the majority population have been shown to be less positive among minority group members who receive their education in their L1 (Veres 2013). In addition to this, the effect of environment (compact vs. diffuse) has been shown to interact with attitudes. The paper examines the language attitudes of 423 Hungarian L1 grammar school pupils towards (1) their (minority) mother tongue (Hungarian), (2) Serbian as the majority language and (3) English as a foreign language, based on their value judgements and taking into account numerous variables which might prove to interact with their attitudes. The results of the research are expected to add to the study of language attitudes in a multilingual context, to help us understand better language situations in areas where bilingualism is promoted and to aid the implementation of coherent language policies.

T1  - National identification and support for discriminatory policies: The mediating role of beliefs about <i>laïcité</i> in France
AN  - 2253034273
AB  - In France, laïcité is a legal principle enforcing State secularism. However, research indicates that Modern (vs. traditional) beliefs about laïcité (ML) help legitimate prejudice against minorities. From Social Identity Theory, we hypothesized that ML should be positively linked with national identification, stereotyping, prejudice and support for discrimination. Accordingly, we demonstrate that ML independently predicts support for discriminatory policies (Study 1a, N = 241) and Maghrebi IAT scores (Study 1b, N = 242). ML mediates the link between national identification and Generalized Prejudice (Study 2a, N = 215; Study 2d, N = 114) as well as Support for Discriminatory Policies (Study 2b, N = 250). Experimental corroboration of this mediation was provided (Study 2c, N = 100). An exploratory study showed that priming ML led to more support for discrimination through national identification (Study 3, N = 89). These results reveal the important intergroup regulation feature of ML beliefs in France.

T1  - Re‐identifying residential mixing: Emergent identity dynamics between incomers and existing residents in a mixed neighbourhood in Northern Ireland
AN  - 2185683852
AB  - Research on residential diversification has neglected its impact on neighbourhood identity and overlooked the very different identity‐related experiences of new and existing residents. The present research examines how incoming and established group members relate to their changing neighbourhood in the increasingly desegregated city of Belfast, Northern Ireland. Thematic analysis of interviews with 24 residents (12 Protestant long‐term residents, 12 Catholic incomers) from an increasingly mixed neighbourhood identified asymmetrical concerns and experiences: Incomers reported undergoing an ‘identity transition’ between local communities, while long‐term residents faced an ‘identity merger’ within their neighbourhood. Where their identity concerns diverged, emergent intergroup perceptions of the residents were negative and divisive; where they accorded, positive intergroup perceptions and a shared neighbourhood identity evolved. From this, we propose a Social Identity Model of Residential Diversification (SIMRD) to encourage future research into how different identity concerns shape emergent intergroup dynamics between long‐term residents and incomers within diversifying neighbourhoods.

T1  - Stereotype threat as a psychological feature of work–life conflict: GPIR
AN  - 2174075955
AB  - Much remains unknown about the boundary conditions of stereotype threat and the factors that influence how it manifests in various domains. In particular, non-performance-related responses to stereotype threat have been relatively neglected, and little is known about stereotype threats in domains where group membership is less stable over the life course. Using both correlational and experimental methods, these studies use the work–life conflict domain to contribute to stereotype threat theory along these dimensions. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that stereotype threat based on caregiver status predicts increased use of coping strategies that involve sacrifices in work productivity, family caregiving, and personal well-being. Studies 1 through 3 suggest that formal flexibility accommodation policies (such as the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993) may not be an effective intervention in stereotype threat in the work–life conflict domain; providing informal social cues of support for employees with caregiving responsibilities, however, may be effective.

T1  - Disclosing Lesbian and Gay Male Sexual Orientation in Later Life: Attitudes of Younger and Older Generations in Eight Latin American Countries
AN  - 2266703691
AB  - The purpose of this research was to explore attitudes toward older lesbians and gay men disclosing their sexual preferences in eight Latin American countries. The sample consisted of 1,539 participants belonging to three age groups (18-29 years, 60-69 years, and 70 years and over). Their answers to two open-ended questions were content-analyzed, and binary logistic regressions were run on the extreme attitudinal categories. Results showed that although most attitudes were positive, a solid percentage of participants still expressed different kinds of derogatory attitudes. Men (as compared to women) and participants who were more religious and less educated tended to hold more negative attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. Both older samples were more prejudiced than the younger one, and attitudes also varied according to country. There was a general trend showing more positive attitudes toward older lesbians and gay men in those countries where sexual minorities' rights are better assured, which suggests that measures to protect sexual minorities and to make sexual diversity in older age visible could be advisable.

T1  - Theory of Prejudice and American Identity Threat Transfer for Latino and Asian Americans
AN  - 2050281185
AB  - Latinos and Asian Americans confront similar stereotypes as they are often presumed to be foreigners and subjected to American identity denial. Across six studies (total N = 992), we demonstrate that Latinos and Asians anticipate ingroup prejudice and specific types of subordination (e.g., American identity threat) in the face of outgroup threats that target one another (i.e., stigma transfer). The studies explore whether stigma transfer occurred primarily when shared Latino and Asian stereotype content was a salient component of the prejudice remark (e.g., foreigner stereotypes; Study 3), or when outgroup prejudice targeted a social group with shared stereotype content (Study 4), though neither appeared to substantively moderate stigma transfer. Minority group members who conceptualize prejudiced people as holding multiple biases (i.e., a monolithic prejudice theory) were more susceptible to stigma transfer suggesting that stereotype content is not necessary for stigma transfer because people assume that prejudice is not singular.

T1  - The evolution of violence within far-right mobilization: evidence from Russia
AN  - 2043766985
AB  - This article analyzes the temporal variation in far-right violence by examining it as a series of interrelated attacks that are embedded within and arising out of a broader cycle of far-right mobilization. It argues that the changing nature of far-right violence occurs as a trial-and-error process - what Sidney Tarrow terms "tactical innovation" - within a mobilizational cycle. As we demonstrate below, far-right mobilization is characterized by innovation, experimentation, and selection of specific types of attacks and particular targets that are deemed likely to garner public support and increase pressure on state officials. Consequently, over the course of the mobilizational cycle, far-right violence employed more organized forms of violence and increasingly targeted ethnic minorities and migrants. We find empirical support for this argument in the case of Russia, using event analysis of a ten-year span of mass violent attacks and an in-depth examination of selected riots.

T1  - Sexism and Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Parenting in a Sample of Heterosexuals and Sexual Minorities: the Mediation Effect of Sexual Stigma
AN  - 2023984942
AB  - The present study aimed to: (a) investigate the relationship between attitudes toward same-sex parenting and sexism both in heterosexuals and sexual minorities; (b) verify whether sexism predicted negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting via the mediating role of sexual stigma (sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and internalized sexual stigma [ISS] in lesbians and gay men [LG]). An Italian sample of 477 participants (65.6% heterosexual people and 34.4% LG people) was used to verify three hypotheses: (a) heterosexual men showed higher levels of sexism than heterosexual women and LG people; (b) heterosexual men reported more negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting than those of heterosexual women and LG people; and (c) sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and ISS in LG people mediated the relationship between sexism and attitudes toward same-sex parenting. Overall, men and heterosexual people showed stronger sexist tendencies and more negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting. Moreover, sexism affected attitudes toward same-sex parenting via sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and ISS in LG people. These results suggest that negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting reflect sociocultural inequalities based on the traditional gender belief system and points to the necessity of social policies to reduce prejudice toward sexual minority groups.

T1  - Closing ranks: Ingroup norm conformity as a subtle response to threatening climate change: GPIR
AN  - 2016165884
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that climate change threat increases group-based cognition and action tendencies. As ingroups can provide extended primary control, we expected climate change threat to increase conformity with ingroup norms and group protective behavior. In three studies (N = 404), we experimentally manipulated climate change threat (Studies 1–3) and group norm content (Studies 2 and 3). We found that participants under climate change threat more strongly derogated group members who acted against the group’s interests (Study 1). When a specific group norm was made salient, both manipulated (Study 3) and perceived climate change threat (Studies 2 and 3) increased ingroup norm conformity. Importantly, this effect occurred for norms of radical left-wing behavior. This suggests that climate change threat does not necessarily induce a conservative shift. Instead, it elicits group-based defenses whose expression depends on which ingroup and which of its norms are salient.

T1  - More Inclusive States, Less Poverty Among Immigrants? An Examination of Poverty, Citizenship Stratification, and State Immigrant Policies
AN  - 2010932406
AB  - Over the last 20 years, policymaking related to immigrant populations has increasingly been conducted at the state-level. State immigrant polices may influence immigrant poverty by determining immigrants’ level of access to social, economic, political, and health resources and by shaping the social environment. Further, these immigrant policies may shape the stratification between citizens and noncitizens, potentially contributing to distinct patterns of disparities in poverty by both citizenship and race/ethnicity. To assess the relationship between immigrant policy and socioeconomic stratification of immigrants across citizenship status and race/ethnicity in the U.S., we combined data from the 2014 American Community Survey and a measure of level of inclusion of state immigrant policies. We estimated fixed-effects logistic regressions to test the associations between poverty and the interaction of level of inclusiveness, citizenship, and race/ethnicity, controlling for state- and individual-level characteristics. Results showed that there are significant disparities in poverty by citizenship status and race/ethnicity. Asian/Pacific Islander (API) noncitizens experienced lower levels of poverty in states with higher levels of inclusion. Both Latino and API citizens experienced lower levels of poverty in states with higher versus lower levels of inclusion. Among Latinos, the gap in poverty rates between noncitizens and citizens is larger in more inclusive than less inclusive ones, suggesting that the potential positive impact of more inclusive environments does not necessarily translate to the most vulnerable Latino group. The level of inclusion was not associated with differences among Whites and Blacks. Findings suggest that states with more inclusive immigrant policies may foster environments that advance the economic well-being of API noncitizens, as well as API and Latino citizens.

T1  - Side-by-side: An evaluation of Connecticut's police and youth interaction model
AN  - 1962171356
AB  - This study evaluated a community-based intervention program designed to promote positive youth development and to create positive interactions between police and youth in a non-enforcement environment. A pre-post-design was used to compare the results of the program for participating youth and police officers, particularly changes in each group's attitudes toward the other. The results showed that participation in the program improved police officers' and youths' attitudes toward each other. For youth, the rate of change in attitudes was greatest for minority youth and for youth who had prior negative experience with the police. That is, youth who had negative prior experiences with police and began with negative attitudes toward police developed more positive attitudes toward police as a result of participating in the program. Furthermore, having opportunities for positive interactions between police and youth played an important role in decreasing negative perceptions of police for ethnic minority youth. This study suggests that community-based programs that involve police with youth can improve participants' attitude toward each other, which might impact future interactions.

T1  - When and why do some social cleavages become politically salient rather than others?
AN  - 1924047267
AB  - Building on Posner (Posner, Daniel N. 2005. Institutions and Ethnic Politics in Africa. New York: Cambridge University Press), this article describes a framework for organizing the information about a community's social cleavage structure so as to identify the incentives that individuals face to adopt particular social identities. The framework is parsimonious but powerful: it generates predictions about the social cleavages that will emerge as salient in politics, the lobbying we can expect to see regarding the social categories with which community members should identify, and the attempts that will be made to assimilate or engage in "identity entrepreneurship" to fashion entirely new social identities. The framework also clarifies why partition is unlikely to be a remedy for intractable ethnic conflicts.

T1  - A Psychological Firewall? Risk Perceptions and Public Support for Online Censorship in Russia*
AN  - 1933859144
AB  - Objective 
Authoritarian regimes commonly justify Internet censorship by framing the Internet as a threat to their citizens that must be tightly controlled for their own protection. This threat rhetoric underpins government censorship and creates a "psychological firewall" driving public support for a censored Internet. 
Methods 
Based on risk and decision-making scholarship, we evaluate how mass media and partisan regime support promulgate these threat perceptions, and in turn how they influence citizen attitudes about censorship. Employing Russia as a case study, we tested our hypotheses with a national survey (N = 1,600) conducted in May 2014. 
Results 
We found that reliance on Russian national TV news predicted greater Internet threat perceptions, and in turn these threat perceptions significantly increased support for online political censorship. 
Conclusion 
Approval of the Putin government further amplified the impact of these threat perceptions on support for censorship. Implications for understanding psychological foundations for support for censorship in authoritarian contexts are discussed.

T1  - Interacting with dehumanized others? Only if they are objectified: GPIR
AN  - 1928333187
AB  - Members of dehumanized groups are somehow accepted in a variety of menial roles. Three studies verified when and why people might approach members of animalistically and mechanistically dehumanized groups. In Studies 1 and 2, participants showed a greater intention to interact with (Study 1) and attributed higher ratings of success (Study 2) to members of an animalistically dehumanized group in a social context. On the contrary, participants expected that members of a mechanistically dehumanized group would be more successful and were preferred to interact with in a professional context. In Study 3, the psychological process underlying these preferences was investigated. Interestingly, results showed that the objectification of dehumanized group members led participants to interact with them. Taken together these studies show that people approach dehumanized others not because they are liked, but because they are objectified.

T1  - Testing Theories of Gun Policy Preferences Among Blacks, Latinos, and Whites in America*
AN  - 1910062402
AB  - Objective 
Research examining the factors shaping gun policy attitudes has focused on the general population or whites. Little is known about how self-interest, political values, or racial prejudice shape the gun policy preferences of minorities. We seek to assess the effect of self-interest, political values, and racial prejudice on the gun policy attitudes of whites, Latinos, and blacks. We also introduce a measure of prejudice difference in group violence--which has not been previously used in the literature on gun policy opinion. 
Methods 
We use data from a new survey (2015) and analyze whites, blacks, and Latinos separately. 
Results 
We find that many of the drivers of support for gun control found in the general population apply to minorities as well, but the substantive effects vary across groups. Similar to prior general population findings, we find that for all groups concern about crime is associated with more support for gun control, and that gun ownership, being the victim of a crime, and conservative political values are associated with less support. 
Conclusion 
In contrast, we find that racial prejudice is negatively correlated with support for gun control among whites and Latinos, while one type of racial prejudice--racial resentment--increases support for gun control among blacks.

T1  - Cross-Border Marriages in South Korea and the Challenges of Rising Multiculturalism
AN  - 1897632250
AB  - This study explores trends in international marriage migration, determinants of international marriage, and factors that affect employment and poverty status of marriage migrant females in Korea. The results suggest that the number of cross-border marriages increased rapidly in the early 2000s but has declined since the mid-2000s, perhaps because of the Korean government's strict regulations and of saturation in the demand for foreign wives. The analysis also indicated that rural males with a graduate degree have a similar probability to urban males with a high-school education. Employment opportunities vary substantially by the foreign wife's country of origin, implying that social policies for addressing the difficulties of multicultural families should be tailored toward specific ethnic groups. Those who participated in work training programmes were significantly more likely to be employed than non-participants, and the size of social support network significantly reduced the odds of living in poverty.

T1  - Interculturalism in Times of Crisis
AN  - 1876465452
AB  - This article locates the discussion of this Special Section within the wider analysis of Interculturalism and intercultural dialogue as a new way of framing dynamic inter-ethnic and broader community relations, and considering how perceived and real crisis affects both states' and societys' understandings of ethnicity, culture and diversity. Taking cases from Catalonia, Spain, the European Union, this Special Section's multi-level approach illustrates how intercultural dialogue can be developed at the sub-State, State, Region and international levels. By surveying the articles in the Special Section, this introduction critiques the Interculturalism framework and develops it. Crucially, drawing out insights from across these different types of groupings and from theorists offering a range of perspectives, this collection is able to offer new insights on Interculturalism, its relations with Multiculturalism, and forms of intercultural dialogue.

T1  - The appraisal gap: Why victim and transgressor groups disagree on the need for a collective apology
AN  - 1906665026
AB  - After an intergroup transgression, victims often advocate for a collective apology that the transgressor group is reluctant to provide. We argue that this is partly caused by a discrepancy in the extent to which victim and perpetrator group members appraise transgressions through an intergroup lens. In three experiments, participants read about individuals assaulting members of a racial out-group. Consistent with predictions, victim group members were more likely than transgressors and third parties to see the events as typical of the transgressor group, more likely to appraise the events as intergroup in nature, and through these processes were more desiring of a collective apology. Transgressors' reluctance to issue a collective apology was not a sign of harm minimization. Indeed, they were more likely than victims to seek an interpersonal apology and less forgiving of the individual transgressors. Cognitive and motivational mechanisms were proposed, although evidence for the latter was limited.

T1  - Examining Discrimination, Ethnic-Racial Identity Status, and Youth Public Regard Among Black, Latino, and White Adolescents
AN  - 1871509773
AB  - How positively adolescents believe others feel about their ethnic-racial group (i.e., public regard) is an important part of their ethnic-racial identity (ERI), which is likely informed by contextual and individual factors. Using cluster analyses to generate ERI statuses among Black, Latino, and White adolescents (n = 1,378), we found that associations between peer versus adult discrimination and public regard varied across ERI status and ethnic-racial group. However, among all adolescents, an achieved ERI (i.e., having explored ethnicity-race and having a clear sense about its personal meaning) buffered the negative association between adult discrimination and public regard, but not between peer discrimination and public regard. Implications for understanding the interplay between contextual and individual factors for public regard are discussed.

T1  - "Asianness" under Construction: The Contours and Negotiation of Panethnic Identity/Culture among Interethnically Married Asian Americans
AN  - 1862124401
AB  - Based on life-history interviews of interethnically married U.S.-raised Asians, this article examines the meaning and dynamics of Asian American interethnic marriages, and what they reveal about the complex incorporative process of this "in-between" racial minority group into the U.S.. In particular, this article explores the connection between Asian American interethnic marriage and pan-Asian consciousness/identity, both in terms of how panethnicity shapes romantic/marital desires of individuals and how pan-Asian culture and identity is invented and negotiated in the process of family-making. My findings indicate that while strong pan-Asian consciousness/identity underlies the connection among intermarried couples, these unions are not simply a defensive effort to "preserve" Asian-ethnic identity and cultur against a society that still racializes Asian Americans, but a tentative and often unpremeditated effort to navigate a path toward integration into the society through an ethnically based, albeit hybrid and reconstructed identity and culture, that helps the respondents retain the integrity of "Asianness."

AN  - 1857963163
AB  - This study evaluated the effects of ethnicity, sexual attitudes, and sexual victimization history on women's judgments of sexual victimization risk in a set of dating and social scenarios. An ethnically diverse sample of undergraduate women (n = 408) were asked to rate how risky the situations were in terms of having an unwanted sexual experience. American Indian women rated the situations as more risky than did non-Hispanic White or Hispanic women. In addition, participants with more positive attitudes toward a range of sexual experiences rated the situations as less risky than did women with less positive attitudes. Possible implications are discussed.

AB  - The myth of a uniformly 'Chinese' population of China must be addressed by the study of ethnic minorities, but also by questioning the nature of the Han majority, also frequently presumed to be homogeneous. Religious cultural and linguistic differences are among the most significant determinants and the parallel case of Taiwan, not under the control of the Chinese Communist Party, is also important.

T1  - DACA and the Surge in Unaccompanied Minors at the US-Mexico Border
AN  - 1802690533
AB  - Apprehensions of unaccompanied minors from Central American countries have been on the rise since 2008, but news reports particularly caught up with the increase after 2012. Some politicians posited that the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) contributed to the surge by creating the expectation that children would be allowed to stay in the country. Immigration advocates, however, believe that the two are not related. Using data on apprehensions of unaccompanied minors by border patrol sector, nationality and year, we find that DACA did not significantly impact those apprehensions. Rather, the 2008 Williams Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, along with violence in the originating countries and economic conditions in both the countries of origin and the United States, emerge as some of the key determinants of the recent surge in unaccompanied minors apprehended along the southwest US-Mexico border.

T1  - Adult mortality among the descendants of immigrants in England and Wales: does a migrant mortality advantage persist beyond the first generation?
AN  - 1793307388
AB  - Little is known about mortality among descendants of immigrants in western host countries because many descendants have not yet reached the ages of high mortality. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether the migrant mortality advantage recently observed among immigrants in England and Wales persists, converges to levels of the White England and Wales-born population or reverses among their descendants. Survival analysis is used to study mortality among over 500,000 individuals in a large, longitudinal dataset (Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study). A recent update to this data provides a longer time series with an older sample of descendants to study. The analysis finds that, as a combined group, the descendants of immigrants have higher mortality than immigrants and White England and Wales-born. After adjusting for socioeconomic characteristics, mortality among descendants attenuates to the mortality level among the White England and Wales-born but remains high relative to immigrants. Analysis by ethnic minority group suggests there are important differences in mortality among descendants, particularly in the persistent high mortality among the descendants of Black Caribbeans. However, the age structure among descendants is still young and the estimates for ethnic minority sub-groups may not be robust. We await the further ageing of descendants to confirm or challenge these interesting sub-group findings by ethnicity.

T1  - Help that hurts? Perceptions of intergroup assistance
AN  - 1799875760
AB  - The current research, guided theoretically by the Intergroup Helping as Status Relations Model, explored how high and low status groups (Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs) perceive offers of help from the high to the low status group. Ninety-three Arab and Jewish participants were asked to imagine and evaluate offers of help from Jews to Arabs in Israel. Consistent with the hypothesis that members of high and low status groups would have different perspectives and goals in their relations, Israeli Arabs viewed help by Israeli Jews more as a way to reinforce existing hierarchy and as a way of asserting the higher groups' domination. Recognizing the different orientations of members of high and low status groups to potentially conciliatory actions, such as helping behavior, can enhance understanding of the dynamics of intergroup relations and conflict and reveal factors that might fuel intergroup misunderstandings and tensions, which can represent a critical step to improving intergroup relations.

T1  - Ethnic discrimination in hiring decisions: a meta-analysis of correspondence tests 1990-2015
AN  - 1784417984
AB  - For almost 50 years field experiments have been used to study ethnic and racial discrimination in hiring decisions, consistently reporting high rates of discrimination against minority applicants - including immigrants - irrespective of time, location, or minority groups tested. While Peter A. Riach and Judith Rich [2002. "Field Experiments of Discrimination in the Market Place." The Economic Journal 112 (483): F480-F518] and Judith Rich [2014. "What Do Field Experiments of Discrimination in Markets Tell Us? A Meta Analysis of Studies Conducted since 2000." In Discussion Paper Series. Bonn: IZA] provide systematic reviews of existing field experiments, no study has undertaken a meta-analysis to examine the findings in the studies reported. In this article, we present a meta-analysis of 738 correspondence tests in 43 separate studies conducted in OECD countries between 1990 and 2015. In addition to summarising research findings, we focus on groups of specific tests to ascertain the robustness of findings, emphasising differences across countries, gender, and economic contexts. Moreover we examine patterns of discrimination, by drawing on the fact that the groups considered in correspondence tests and the contexts of testing vary to some extent. We focus on first- and second-generation immigrants, differences between specific minority groups, the implementation of EU directives, and the length of job application packs.

T1  - Ethno-Class Distinctions and Reality (TV)
AN  - 1773421221
AB  - This article offers a cultural-sociological analysis of interpretations by viewers from different classes on the most popular reality show in Israel, namely, Big Brother. The findings of this study show dramatic differences in viewing practices according to class and ethnic distinctions of the viewers. Viewers from the upper socioeconomic class primarily addressed the way in which the subjects from the low socioeconomic class and marked ethnic groups appear in their eyes: that is, the processes affiliated with Othering. These ethno-class distinctions were translated into unique viewing practices: the identification of what are called, "cult moments" or "grotesque moments." These moments are depicted as ridiculing the "exaggerated" behavior of members of the low socioeconomic class and specific ethnic groups. Viewers from the low socioeconomic class offer more imminent (and less distant) perspectives on the Big Brother program. They relate to a broad spectrum of content that was broadcast in the program, identify with the participants from their group, criticize the judgments and the cultural hierarchies of marked group members, and describe how political anger accompanies their viewing of the reality program. The discussion section suggests the connection of these subjective interpretations and widespread cultural scenarios about class and ethnic identities.

T1  - Some general issues of a system analysis of ethnic problems
AN  - 1784139196
AB  - The article claims that the two established traditions of discussion of ethnic issues, both the Russian Theory of ethnos and the Western concepts of ethnicity, were not able to offer convincing scholarship results. The major reason for the existence of the current state of affairs is related to the constraints imposed by the disciplinary (ethnographic and anthropologic) approaches toward the development of the ethnic theories. To eliminate the identified deficiencies, it is suggested to use the ideas of the system paradigm, which defines the ethnic group as a complex formation able to reproduce itself (autopoiesis) by means of self-reference that is based on self-observation. In this context, a high theoretical potential is demonstrated by the Theory of Ethnos of Sergei Shirokogoroff, who in the 1920s-1930s suggested to use an interdisciplinary approach toward understanding of the issue of an ethnic diversity of humankind. Synthesis of these disciplines was implemented on the basis of ideas, which preempted a number of provisions of a system paradigm, such as ethnos as a process, which involves ethnic groups, and Psychomental Complex it is important to add as a foundation for cultural adaptation and preservation of ethnic groups. These findings demonstrate a necessity to use Shirokogoroff's theory to address the existing ethnic challenges with consideration of ethnic policies of different states.

T1  - Romanian Roma: An Institutional Ethnography of Labour Market Exclusion
AN  - 1778777970
AB  - Roma individuals are struggling to access the formal labour market in Romania. Previous research occupied with this issue has traditionally been dominated by quantitative studies of socio-economic indicators that cling to the characteristics of the ethnic group. The study presented here, however, uses institutional ethnography as a method of social inquiry to demonstrate that this issue needs to be studied from a bottom-up perspective. The article illustrates that there are factors connected to how the system of occupational integration operates that must be taken into consideration in order to explain the difficulties Roma individuals face when trying to enter the labour market in Romania. We argue that these structural barriers create and reinforce processes of minoritising that increase marginalization and discrimination and thereby hinder work inclusion for Roma individuals.

T1  - Broadening the mind: Beneficial effects of sojourn experiences and contact with visiting international students on prospective teachers' motivation to avoid prejudiced behavior
AN  - 1761734788
AB  - Opportunities for intergroup contact are particularly important for prospective teachers because they bear responsibility for an ethnically diverse student population. Using data from a sample of 330 students inscribed in Austrian university colleges of teacher education, we investigated the long-term effects of international student exchange on prospective teachers' motivation to avoid prejudiced behavior (MAPB). Both sojourning and domestic students' friendships with visiting international students (VIS) were evaluated as potential instances of naturally occurring intergroup contact that can affect students' MAPB. Sojourning students had an increased MAPB even nine months after returning to their home country. No effect was found for domestic students' friendships with VIS. Possibly, the quality of these friendships was insufficient to result in long-term prejudice reduction. Implications of these results are discussed, and the need to advance interventions that are appropriate to improve domestic students' contact with VIS is ascertained.

T1  - Socio-cultural Adaptation of Second-generation Afghans in Iran
AN  - 1755986756
AB  - The long-term settlement of Afghan immigrants in Iran, along with their high fertility, has produced an important shift in the composition of their population with the emergence of a "second generation". This article aims to examine how second-generation Afghans have adapted to the host society and to what extent their adaptation patterns have correlated with demographic and contextual factors. The data is drawn from the 2010 Afghans Adaptation Survey which covered 520 second-generation Afghans. 
Results revealed that second-generation Afghans have a variety of adaptation patterns. Integration is the most prevalent pattern of adaptation and acculturation (which is observed among 35.8 per cent of respondents) followed by separation (33.3%), assimilation (17.1%) and marginalization (13.8%). Our multivariate analysis showed that such socio-demographic factors as gender, education, ethnicity, perceived discrimination, family context, neighbourhood characteristics, length and city of residence are associated with their adaptation patterns. 
Policy Implications 
Successful implementation of policies and durable solutions for Afghans in Iran rests on the diversity of the adaptation patterns of their second-generation. 
Restriction on employment opportunities has led to downward assimilation and marginalization of some of the Afghans in Iran. Improvement in labour laws would promote the integration of Afghans in the society. 
Afghan females have relatively better access to a gender-equitable environment in Iran than they do in Afghanistan, and are less willing to return to their homeland. The Government of Afghanistan should improve service and security provisions for women to ensure their voluntary repatriation.

T1  - At which geographic scale does ethnic diversity affect intra-neighborhood social capital?
AN  - 1732943327
AB  - The claim that ethnic diversity within the living environment would hamper bonding and bridging social capital has been studied extensively, producing highly inconsistent findings. We studied whether ethnic diversity effects depend on the geographic scale at which ethnic diversity is measured. We examined ethnic diversity effects on intra- and inter-ethnic contacts in the neighborhood, respectively on opposition to ethnic in- and out-group neighbors. Hypotheses were derived from Blau's meeting opportunities thesis and contact theory, ethnic competition theory, and constrict theory. Using information about 2545 Dutch respondents with their locality defined as egohoods and administrative units, we found that ethnic diversity effects vary with the geographic scale. Ethnic diversity of smaller localities is positively associated with bridging social capital. At larger scales, the findings are mixed: ethnic diversity is positively related to inter-ethnic contacts and opposition to out-group neighbors. Ethnic diversity of smaller localities is negatively related to bonding social capital. In contrast to often-made claims that diversity within the local context would matter most, estimates of diversity effects are not always stronger when diversity measures are aggregated to smaller geographic areas.

T1  - The intersection of race, class, and ethnicity in agrarian inequalities, identities, and the social resistance of peasants in Colombia
AN  - 1732092943
AB  - The purpose of this study is to add to our understanding of the effects of agrarian transformations on peasants' identities and economic empowerment in a context of ethnically based expansion of land rights and agribusiness. By focusing on recently granted rural land rights and the expansion of palm oil plantations in Colombia, the effects of the intersection of race, class, and ethnicity on the inequalities, identities, and social resistance of peasants are examined. Other data were derived from qualitative research (interviews) to analyze the specific case of the lower Atrato region of Colombia, where Law 70 provided territorial rights to Afro-descendants. The results found that inequalities, identities, and social resistance are linked to agrarian transformations. The peasants conceptually conflated the social class and racial demands in their struggles before the enactment of multicultural policies; after multiculturalism, social class and race became intertwined with the concept of ethnicity, which facilitated resistance to primitive accumulation. The results suggest that multicultural policies produce challenges related to the identification of beneficiaries of land rights, although the divisive effects are offset by solidarity practices among racial groups.

T1  - Religion and Negative Attitudes towards Homosexuals
AN  - 1824574993
AB  - Public opinion research has repeatedly shown that religious persons report more prejudice against homosexuality when compared to their non-religious counterparts. This article contributes to a better understanding of this relationship by studying attitudes of youth in two of the three largest cities of Flanders (N : 1907). The ethnic and religious heterogeneous population of these cities allows us to empirically disentangle the relevance of both religious involvement (strong versus weak) and the specific religious conviction with respect to negative attitudes towards homosexuals. This offers us a more detailed view on the exact nature of the relationship between religiosity and the latter attitudes among youth than what has been achieved so far. For both Christian and Muslim believers, we found more negative attitudes towards homosexuality, even after controlling for authoritarianism and a more traditional view on gender roles. Although boys appeared, in general, more negative towards homosexuality than girls, the gender gap amongst young Muslims was twice as large when compared to non-Muslims.

In Myanmar's transition to democracy, each ethnic nationality plays a different role. The Bama/Myanma group is largely represented by the military, the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), and the main opposition party, the National League for Democracy (NLD). Though others do join the Bama/Myanma-led parties, most ethnic minorities either form or join other ethnic-based political parties. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Translocal assemblages and the circulation of the concept of 'indigenous peoples' in Laos
AN  - 1752995632; 201600158
AB  - Laos has long been recognized as a country with a high level of ethnic diversity. At present, the government of Laos recognizes 49 ethnic groups and over 160 sub-groups. Over the last couple of decades the modern concept of 'indigenous peoples' has been introduced in Laos, albeit unevenly, partially, and in a quite limited way. The three broadly defined groups that have played important roles in variously promoting the concept of indigenous peoples (xon phao pheun meuang) in Laos are non-governmental organizations (NGOs), multilateral banks (the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank), and United Nations organizations. In this article I employ the analytic of translocal assemblages to examine the ways that the concept of indigeneity is circulating in Laos, and drawing on international and local influences. I briefly examine two issues frequently linked to the indigenous politics: communal land titling and bilingual education, and assess the extent to which new indigenous identities are being adopted in Laos. I present an example of how a Hmong group in the USA with links to Laos is constructing translocal assemblages through an indigenous peoples framework in order to resist the government in Laos. Unlike some other countries in Southeast Asia, which have increasingly embraced the concept, the government of Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) has not, preferring instead to acknowledge ethnic diversity, but within a framework that recognizes all ethnic groups as equal.

T1  - Re-assessing self-interest theory: Can intergroup contact constrain self-interested reactions?
AN  - 1790891026
AB  - This article expands previous research on self-interested reactions and intergroup contact by showing that (1) intergroup contact constrains the impact of personal economic vulnerability on perceived out-group threat, (2) personal economic vulnerability has no influence on perceived out-group threat when contact is most intense, and (3) the ability of intergroup contact to reduce perceived out-group threat is strongest among the most economically vulnerable. These findings were generated by a fixed-effects regression of 21 countries and almost 34,000 respondents sampled in the European Social Survey (2002-2003). More generally, our findings suggest that self-interested reactions can be overpowered by the cognitive and affective components of intergroup contact. The concluding section expands on the theoretical implications of the results.

T1  - Why partisan warriors don't listen: the gendered dynamics of intergroup anxiety and partisan conflict
AN  - 2571040627
AB  - Talking and listening to political opponents is central to the proper functioning of deliberative democracy. But the social identity dynamics of partisan intergroup conflict make party identifiers in the US – Democrats and Republicans alike – less likely to engage in these activities. We argue that those group dynamics are gendered such that men are more sensitive than women to intergroup conflict and competition. Consequently, men are more likely to experience “intergroup anxiety” at the prospect of political interaction with partisan opponents. Using survey data from the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study and experimental data, we found that men with higher intergroup anxiety were more likely than women to avoid cross-party political discussion, not listen when they did engage in such conversations, and reject information from outparty leaders. These results highlight the critical role that partisan social identities play in everyday democratic citizenship, but also emphasize the important and neglected gender aspect of mass interparty dynamics in the USA.

T1  - 'We have no quarrel with you': Effects of group status on characterizations of 'conflict' with an outgroup
AN  - 1700676237; 201525034
AB  - In three studies, we examined the effect of intergroup status on group members' tendencies to characterize the ingroup's relationship with an outgroup as conflictual following outgroup action. Findings from all three studies supported the prediction that the intergroup relationship would be characterized as less conflictual when the ingroup had relatively high rather than low status. Consistent with the hypothesis that the effect of status reflects strategic concerns, it was moderated by the perceived relevance of the outgroup's action to intergroup status relations (study 1), it was sensitive to audience (study 2), and it was partially mediated by status management concerns (study 3). The role of strategic, status-related factors in intergroup relations is discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

It examines different approaches to define indigenous peoples in international law, and explores how those definitions may relate to Chinese ethnic groups. In particular, the article looks at possibilities for Chinese minorities to claim indigenous status, based on the standards of 'the priority of settlement' and 'distinctiveness arising from historical continuity and attachment to a specific land'. It argues that the uncertainty of the definition, the complexity of the ethnic situation, and the reluctance of the Chinese Government make the application of indigenous rights in China unclear at the present. The Chinese minority/indigenous argument, to a certain extent, depends on the elaboration of international norms on indigenous rights, as well as the clarification of Chinese terms in relation to ethnic minorities.

T1  - Hate groups targeting unauthorized immigrants: discourses, narratives and subjectivation practices on their websites
AN  - 1722763439
AB  - The narratives and images on websites of US hate groups that oppose undocumented immigrants represent and reproduce discourses that contribute to the subject formation of group members, who feel ethically obliged to counter unauthorized immigration. Left alone by the government, which is seen as unreliable and uncaring of patriotic values, they position themselves as heroic saviours of the nation. We argue that these hate groups' 'games of truth' develop in response to the perception that irregular immigration threatens specific social orders and values, for instance about citizenship, national identity and otherness. This article helps to understand the ways in which anti-immigrant narratives serve the functions of countering these threats and of asserting the group members' ethical obligation as a form of care of the self. In other words, from a Foucaultian viewpoint, we interpret the problematizations of 'illegal' immigration as discursive practices for the subject formation of hate group members.

T1  - Racially Charged Legislation and Latino Health Disparities: The Case of Arizona's S.B. 1070
AN  - 1667952143; 201509411
AB  - Researchers have established that minority groups tend to suffer worse health outcomes compared to their white counterparts, though the specific mechanisms at play are still under investigation. The passing of Arizona's 2010 'Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act,' commonly referred to as 'S.B. 1070,' provides a unique opportunity to examine the effects of an increasingly racially charged milieu on Latino health. Using the Arizona sample of the 2009-2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we find that the changing social setting around S.B. 1070 is related to poorer Latino self-reported health, but only for those whose primary language is Spanish. Furthermore, serving as control groups, we find no such relationship in other U.S.-Mexico border states that had no analogous legislation (Texas, New Mexico, and California). We expand on stress process theory and group position theory to explain this increase in Arizona's negative health reporting, despite traditional social and economic protective factors.

T1  - Forced marriage: an analysis of legislation and political measures in Europe
AN  - 1680152142; 201516683
AB  - Forced marriage is of current international concern in Europe. As many cases involve a transnational component linked to migration, it is increasingly receiving attention at the government level. The serious consequences for women, including sexual violence, and the physical and psychological health risks associated with it, seem to receive little consideration. Recent years have seen a rise in initiatives and measures taken by policy makers throughout Europe. As the focus is placed on criminalization and stringent immigration policies, ethnic minority population groups bear the greatest burden. It is argued that specific criminal laws make it more difficult for victims to come forward, while offering very little or no protection in return. The widespread 21-year age rule in immigration law has been denounced by scholars, institutes and magistrates alike for infringing on the fundamental human right to family life guaranteed by article 8 ECHR. The discourse on forced marriage appears to have reached a crossroads. European governments are faced with the challenge to create policies that protect and support victims, while simultaneously cracking down on perpetrators and safeguarding their borders from abuses in obtaining visas. There is a very pressing need to work more closely with those at risk, involving service provisions to directly support them, instead of a one-side top-down policy framework through which minority communities feel targeted and stigmatized.

T1  - State-initiated development and the Reang ethnic minority in Tripura (North East India)
AN  - 1660023597; 201505773
AB  - This paper explores the wider implications of state-led development on the Reang ethnic minority in the North East Indian state of Tripura, and in doing so presents a critical view on such development endeavours. Basing itself on the study of the relationship between the state and the ethnic minorities, this research argues the following: - first, most state-led development programmes are formulated on a preconceived notion of 'backwardness' in the ethnic minorities. Second, state-led development projects create internal fissures and ruptures within ethnic minorities on issues of what constitutes development. Third, often, state-led development programmes create an image of oneself as inherently 'backward', whereby the conditioning of the mind plays an important role in extending the desire of the members of an ethnic minority to achieve this 'imagined modernity'.

T1  - EFFECTS OF HIV/AIDS PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS ON ATTITUDE AND BEHAVIOR: INTERPLAY OF PERCEIVED THREAT AND SELF-EFFICACY
AN  - 1542032527
AB  - We examined how perceived threat affected attitude and behavior toward condom use with main and nonmain partners, among at-risk young adults with varying levels of self-efficacy. Participants were 170 heterosexually active, single students at a northeastern university in the United States. Exposure to HIV/AIDS public service announcements was found to increase perceived susceptibility, which facilitated a positive attitude toward condom use with main partners but not with nonmain partners. High self-efficacy promoted a positive attitude toward condom use with main partners, and condom use with main and nonmain partners. The interaction effects revealed that high, compared to low, self-efficacy motivated more condom use with main and nonmain partners when perceived susceptibility was lower.

T1  - Self-representation and ethnic minority rights in China
AN  - 1551002553; 201429095
AB  - Proposals to reform along liberal lines China's system of discrete minority rights, such as ethnic regional autonomy and preferential policies, seek to 'depoliticize' minorities by treating them as cultural groups whose members have individual, but not collective, rights. Beyond the binary of only individual rights or no change, a third option is to expand minority rights, including through their self-representation. Not self-determination, which is inapplicable to minorities, self-representation can be based on structures that allow minority people to take up their histories and cultures, ethnic disparities, and their position in China's political leadership. Organizations of self-representation need not be counterposed to the state and can address non-elite concerns in ways that promote minority participation in China's governance and minority integration, not assimilation.

AN  - 1531932418; 201423289
AB  - The aim of this special issue is to map the extent of generational change among Britain's ethnic minority population and to understand some of the underlying processes involved. Is there greater integration across generations, or has the 'new second generation' in Britain remained isolated from the mainstream, perhaps as a result of the prejudice and discrimination from the white British that they have encountered or because of desires to maintain ethnic values and resist western practices? We also ask whether processes of generational change have proceeded at the same pace and direction in different domains -- notably cultural, social, structural and political -- and whether it has proceeded at the same pace among different minorities.

T1  - Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Leisure-time Physical Activity in California: Patterns and Mechanisms
AN  - 1494750582; 201402075
AB  - Evidence has shown that racial/ethnic minorities in the United States are less likely than whites to engage in leisure-time physical activity (LTPA); yet few studies to date have included Asian subgroups in the analyses and mechanisms underlying these disparities are not well known. This study uses data from the 2007 California Health Interview Survey (N = 37,164) to examine racial/ethnic disparities in self-reported adherence to LTPA recommendations and to explore the mediating roles of socioeconomic status (SES), acculturation, and neighborhood perceptions. Nine racial/ethnic groups were included: non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexicans, and six largest Asian subgroups. Results confirm that racial/ethnic minorities are, in general, less likely than whites to meet LTPA recommendations, whereas heterogeneity is also evident across Asian subgroups. No significant disparity is revealed for the Japanese and Filipinos but whites are advantaged compared to all other Asian groups. Educational attainment, percent of lifetime spent in the United States and access to park, playground, or open space are significantly associated with meeting LTPA recommendations. SES and acculturation play differential roles in explaining group disparities for blacks, Mexicans, and some Asian subgroups. Perceived neighborhood environment does not mediate LTPA disparities by race/ethnicity. Net of these mediators, the advantages of whites in meeting LTPA recommendations persist for blacks, Mexicans, the Chinese, and Koreans. Future research should theorize and operationalize additional multilevel pathways linking race/ethnicity and LTPA while assessing measurement errors in the existing constructs.

T1  - Feeling in with the outgroup: Outgroup acceptance and the internalization of the motivation to respond without prejudice
AN  - 1494749616; 201401901
AB  - Over 10 years of research has illustrated the benefits of internal motivation to respond without prejudice (IMS) for prejudice regulation and high-quality intergroup contact (see Plant & Devine, 1998). Yet, it is unclear how this motivation develops. The current work tested one route through which feelings of acceptance from outgroup members facilitate the development of IMS. Longitudinally, feeling accepted by outgroup members predicted increases in IMS across a 15-week period (Study 1). Experimental manipulations of outgroup acceptance also increased IMS toward racial outgroups (Studies 2 and 3). Furthermore, IMS mediated the relationship between outgroup acceptance and participants' increased willingness to pay money to increase opportunities for interracial contact (Study 2). Tests of mediation also demonstrated that feelings of acceptance mediated the effect of outgroup acceptance on internal motivation (Study 3). In addition, this pattern of responses held for members of both high- and low-status racial groups. This research demonstrates one pathway through which the fulfillment of fundamental needs influences motivated intergroup processes. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - THE IMPACT OF CRIMINAL VIOLENCE ON REGIME LEGITIMACY IN LATIN AMERICA
AN  - 1491065269
AB  - What is the impact of exposure to criminal violence on support for political institutions in Latin America? The increase in criminal violence in the region since the return to democratic rule makes this a timely question. Several scholars have demonstrated the impact of a series of variables (political performance, economic performance, interpersonal trust, perception of corruption) on citizens' support for political institutions (system support). The goal of this study is to assess the impact of two additional variables (victimization and perception of violence) that have been neglected in the literature. I test the impact of exposure to violence on system support by using survey data from the 2004 edition of the Latin American Public Opinion Project. My findings demonstrate that both victimization and high perception of violence have a negative impact on system support in Latin America. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effects of ethnic enclosure of neighborhoods, workplace, and industrial sectors on earnings
AN  - 1463015053; 201345789
AB  - In this study, we extend prior work on how ethnic boundaries in specific contexts affect the earnings of racial and ethnic groups by simultaneously exploring how levels of ethnic enclosure, measured by co-ethnic concentration, of neighborhoods, workplaces, and industrial sectors, and their 'moderating' effects on the earnings of six major recent racial and ethnic immigrant groups in the eight largest Canadian cities. The consideration of ethnic boundaries in multiple contexts portrays a more realistic picture of the effect of ethnic boundaries on earnings. The study helps us to understand how ethnic enclosure in various contexts affects the economic attainments of groups with higher proportions of immigrants. The study is based on 2006 Canadian census data. The findings show that most members of the six included racial/ethnic minority groups live and work in environments with high levels of ethnic enclosure. Besides, in general, the earnings of employees are negatively related to co-ethnic concentration in neighborhood and workplace, while the relationship with industrial co-ethnic concentration is not consistent. The earnings of employers are negatively related to co-ethnic concentration in the workplace only. The moderating effects of various co-ethnic contexts on earnings are mostly positive for both employers and employees, although they are more likely to be significant among employees. In addition, the findings show variations among the six groups. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Alcohol-related problems and self-help groups: the situational construction of self-image
AN  - 1443261095
AB  - The construction of self-image constitutes a process that accompanies the individual throughout the entire duration of their personal existence and is considerably influenced by the contexts in which the individual lives and grows. The existence of a stigma related to a form of behaviour, for example, in the case in question here, alcohol-related problems, emerges as a central element in the definition of self-image, both from the point of view of public opinion and private feelings. The aim of this study is to analyze whether and, if so, how the self-image of a person with alcohol-related problems changes, both in the public and private sphere, when they join the self-help group of the Club for Alcoholics in Treatment, i.e. when they begin to form part of a context that "labels" the condition the individual and their family unit find themselves in a different way.

T1  - The Effect of Interracial Contact on Whites' Perceptions of Victimization Risk and Black Criminality
AN  - 1417523736; 201334710
AB  - Objectives. This article examines two questions. First, does interracial contact increase or decrease Whites' perceptions of Blacks' criminality? Second, does it affect Whites' perceived victimization risk, and, if so, is the effect mediated by the perceived criminality of Blacks as compared to the perceived criminality of different racial and ethnic groups? Methods. Multivariate regression analyses of data from a national public opinion poll that included measures of perceived victimization risk and the criminality of Whites and Latinos. Results. Interracial contact increases Whites' perceptions of the criminality of all racial and ethnic groups, not just Blacks. It also increases Whites' perceived risk of victimization, an effect that partially arises by increasing their perception of Whites and Latinos, and not just Blacks, as criminal. Conclusions. Although the identified effects may be due to Whites' stereotypes about Blacks, they are equally consistent with the notion that interracial contact may educate Whites about crime. Unfortunately, the present study could not investigate this possibility. Future research ideally will address this limitation, use additional measures of contact, and assess other explanations for any identified effects.

T1  - Great expectations: students' educational attitudes upon the transition to post-secondary vocational education
AN  - 1438551435; 201341225
AB  - In this study, we examine students' educational attitudes upon the transition to Dutch senior vocational education (SVE), a transition associated with high dropout rates in the first year. Prior studies have identified differences in educational attitudes between sociodemographic groups. However, the mechanisms underlying those differences remain topic of debate: some studies point at differences in the school orientation and support in students' social communities outside school, others focus on differences in educational experiences between sociodemographic groups. Multilevel sequential regression analyses on a diverse sample of 1438 students in urban SVE schools reveal that students have very positive educational attitudes upon their transition to SVE. Ethnic minority students express particularly positive attitudes. School-related encouragement and support at home plays an important role in students' attitudes, but the attitudes of students from lower educated or ethnic minority communities are less related to this support. Prior school experiences play an essential, but occasionally counterproductive, role in students' attitudes upon transition, depicting the transition as a fresh new start for some, and an unwelcome threshold for others.

T1  - Presumed fair: Ironic effects of organizational diversity structures
AN  - 1347785115; 201318781
AB  - This research tests the hypothesis that the presence (vs. absence) of organizational diversity structures causes high-status group members (Whites, men) to perceive organizations with diversity structures as procedurally fairer environments for underrepresented groups (racial minorities, women), even when it is clear that underrepresented groups have been unfairly disadvantaged within these organizations. Furthermore, this illusory sense of fairness derived from the mere presence of diversity structures causes high-status group members to legitimize the status quo by becoming less sensitive to discrimination targeted at underrepresented groups and reacting more harshly toward underrepresented group members who claim discrimination. Six experiments support these hypotheses in designs using 4 types of diversity structures (diversity policies, diversity training, diversity awards, idiosyncratically generated diversity structures from participants' own organizations) among 2 high-status groups in tests involving several types of discrimination (discriminatory promotion practices, adverse impact in hiring, wage discrimination). Implications of these experiments for organizational diversity and employment discrimination law are discussed. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - "Crime against Humanity" or "Crime against Jews"? Acknowledgment in Construals of the Holocaust and Its Importance for Intergroup Relations
AN  - 1347783741; 201322445
AB  - This article examines the consequences of different representations of the Holocaust for intergroup relations, focusing on the role of acknowledgment of different groups' fate that is inherent in these construals. Holocaust representations have become increasingly universal. Research on recategorization suggests prosocial outcomes of such superordinate representations. However, among minority groups, acknowledging both superordinate and subgroup identities may be crucial in order to prevent backlash. An experimental study among Jewish and non-Jewish participants (N = 163) was conducted to test these ideas. As hypothesized, prosocial responses to outgroup victims of collective violence and acknowledgment of their suffering increased among Jewish participants when both a superordinate categorization of the Holocaust and subgroup (Jewish) fate were presented, compared to when only one of these categorizations were used. Conversely, different categorizations did not affect outcomes among the control group. Practical implications for intergroup relations and memorialization in the aftermath of genocide are discussed.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Rice Allocation via a Modified Dictator Game in Rural Cameroon
AN  - 1946110068
AB  - Economic games in field settings have been subject to criticism concerning their ecological validity. We use social identity theory and the intergroup contact hypothesis as a framework to illustrate how economic games can be applied to field settings with higher ecological validity. A quasi-experiment in two rural Cameroonian villages studied participants' allocation of rice to co-inhabitants of their village. The villages are characterized by different degrees of contact between the ethnic groups and the sexes. Our results indicate that women who are segregated from each other disadvantage other women more than men or women who experience higher amounts of contact. These findings are interesting from a theoretical and methodological perspective since we utilized a nonmonetary stake in naturalistic intergroup settings.

T1  - The depiction of Polish migrants in the United Kingdom by the British press after Poland's accession to the European Union
AN  - 1347784097; 201322193
AB  - Purpose -- A negative framing of immigrants to stir populist sentiment is a widespread tactic repeatedly deployed by the British press. Following the accession of ten new and predominantly Eastern European member-states to the European Union in 2004, this gambit was again utilised to provocatively portray migrant workers newly arriving in the United Kingdom as an external economic threat. The aim of this paper was to uncover the recurrent ways in which Polish migrants were emotively framed by the top daily British newspapers during this period of EU enlargement. Design/methodology/approach -- A bespoke collection of newspaper articles was assembled and examined using a corpus-based discourse analysis. The analysis was subsequently triangulated with relevant responses to a series of public opinion surveys. Findings -- Results show that the British press conformed to classic media representations of migrants when referring to Poles in particular, by depicting them as an external economic threat "flooding" the country; in addition a novel stereotype of the "Polish plumber" was used to present them arriving to take the jobs of native manual labourers. Originality/value -- The study adds to the understanding of media attitudes towards new migrants in the UK, and demonstrates the utility of triangulated corpus-based discourse analysis for those who seek to highlight systematic characterisations of migrants in the popular press.

T1  - Intergroup bias and perceived similarity: Effects of successes and failures on support for in- and outgroup political leaders
AN  - 1347783992; 201318346
AB  - Drawing on the social identity theory of leadership and optimal distinctiveness theory, this research examined differences in perceived attitude similarity to in- and outgroup leaders among Liberals and Conservatives before and after the 2008 U.S. presidential election. We predicted Liberals and Conservatives alike would perceive their ingroup leaders (Obama or McCain) to be attitudinally similar to themselves before the election. After the election, however, Conservatives were expected to distance themselves from McCain and to accentuate similarity to Obama. Using a longitudinal design, analysis of American National Election Survey (N = 742) data showed that Liberals and Conservatives viewed themselves to be similar to their respective ingroup leader and dissimilar to the outgroup leader. Consistent with expectations, Conservatives significantly accentuated perceived similarity with Obama following his electoral victory, and significantly distanced themselves from McCain following his loss. Liberals' similarity with either candidate did not change from pre- to postelection. Implications for social identity in inter- and intragroup leadership contexts are discussed.

T1  - Navigating the school system in Sweden, Belgium, Austria and Germany: School segregation and second generation school trajectories
AN  - 1448996095; 201342791
AB  - In this article we describe and explain how children of immigrants navigate their educational careers. Sequence analyses followed by optimal matching is used to cluster individual educational trajectories in four European countries, which differ in national educational systems, ranging from comprehensive to highly differentiated (Sweden, Belgium, Austria and Germany). Samples are young adults of the Turkish and Moroccan second-generation and the majority group (aged 18-35) in seven cities in the selected countries (N=4022). We examine how perceived segregation and friendship networks affect the routes that students take through the educational system, i.e. school trajectories. Across school systems, having majority group friends increases the chances of following academic trajectories that end with university attendance. The effects of perceived school segregation are mixed. More comprehensive school systems protect against negative effects of segregation for second-generation students.

T1  - Job Authority and Perceptions of Job Security: The Nexus by Race Among Men
AN  - 1266146595; 201300497
AB  - A benefit of attaining job authority is heightened perceptions of job security, though no research has examined whether (a) this benefit operates equally across racial groups; and (b) if it does not operate equally across racial groups, why not? Analyzing a combined 2004 and 2006 General Social Survey sample of men, we find-among those who have attained an "upper command" level of job authority-that workplace-based marginality (discriminatory allocation and evaluation practices) rather than dispositions (e.g., fatalism, mistrust) learned outside of the workplace account for lower levels of perceived security among African Americans and Latinos, relative to Whites. Additional sectoral analyses indicate that this pattern is especially pronounced in the private, but not public sector. Discussed are the implications of the findings for understanding racial inequality at privileged levels of the American workplace.

T1  - The importance of group identity processes in involvement in social movement organizations: the case of Attac France and Germany
AN  - 1173140564
AB  - This research evaluates the relative and absolute importance of group identity processes in an individual's decision to become and remain active in a social movement organization (SMO). Mainly through interview research with the members of Attac Germany and France, I discover that the presence of a comfortable and communicative group atmosphere is a necessary, but insufficient, condition for movement activity. Individuals are primarily involved in SMOs because they want to change policy and public opinion or to give meaning to their lives. However, this does not imply that the activists devalue communal bonds and a welcoming group atmosphere. Rather, they take both as a prerequisite for engagement. Yet, rifts and atmospheric disruptions can be a sufficient cause for which people leave an organization. In particular, those members who seek policy change are quick to desert a group once it is shattered by internal disharmony. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Individual differences in ideological attitudes and prejudice: Evidence from peer-report data
AN  - 1347782696; 201318697
AB  - Our knowledge on the personality basis of ideological attitudes and prejudice, while based on a substantial body of research, suffers from a potentially serious methodological limitation: an overreliance on the method of self-reports. Across 2 studies (Ns = 193, 424), we examined associations between the Big Five personality dimensions, Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA), Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), and generalized prejudice, using both self-report and peer-report data stemming from 1 (Study 1) or 2 (Study 2) peer rater/s. Correlational and regression analyses as well as structural equation modeling showed that (a) the associations between personality dimensions, ideological attitudes, and prejudice were largely similar to previous research for both data sources; (b) RWA and prejudice showed a similar level of self-peer agreement to personality dimensions; (c) most of the known associations between personality, ideological attitudes, and prejudice were replicated also when measured by independent methods; (d) peer reports had some incremental validity in predicting ideological attitudes and prejudice; and (e) there was evidence that Openness to Experience and Agreeableness predicted prejudice directly and not only indirectly via RWA and SDO, respectively. Implications for the status of RWA, SDO, and prejudice as individual-difference constructs and for their bases in personality dimensions are discussed.

T1  - 'Hunkering Down' in Multi-Ethnic Neighbourhoods? The Effects of Ethnic Diversity on Dimensions of Social Cohesion
AN  - 1283639540; 201303325
AB  - Putnam (2007) claims that in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods, residents of all ethnic groups tend to 'hunker down'. Solidarity and trust are lower, mutual help and cooperation rarer, and friends fewer. Various studies in the United States found a clear correlation between diversity and cohesion, and also for many different dimensions of social cohesion. Whether this finding also holds in other (European) settings is the subject of hot and unresolved debate. Specifically, this article addresses the question of whether living in an ethnically diverse setting has negative consequences for social cohesion in the Netherlands as well. Previous studies on the Netherlands remained inconclusive. We examine how this lack of consensus can be explained. To further the debate, this article pulls apart various contexts and various dimensions of social cohesion. This article examines the relationship between ethnic diversity (in socio-graphically defined neighbourhoods) and four dimensions of social cohesion (trust, informal help, voluntary work, and neighbourhood contacts) for the 50 largest cities in the Netherlands. We conclude that the Putnam hypothesis holds only to a limited extent in the Dutch context. The only aspect on which ethnic diversity has a negative effect is the degree of contact in the neighbourhood. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Emotions in context: Anger causes ethnic bias but not gender bias in men but not women
AN  - 1221406626; 201243930
AB  - Emotions influence information processing because they are assumed to carry valuable information. We predict that induced anger will increase ethnic but not gender intergroup bias because anger is related to conflicts for resources, and ethnic groups typically compete for resources, whereas gender groups typically engage in relations of positive interdependence. Furthermore, we also predict that this increased ethnic intergroup bias should only be observed among men because men show more group-based reactions to intergroup conflict than women do. Two studies, with 65 and 120 participants, respectively, indeed show that anger induction increases ethnic but not gender intergroup bias and only for men. Intergroup bias was measured with an implicit measure. In Study 2, we additionally predict (and find) that fear induction does not change ethnic or gender intergroup bias because intergroup bias is a psychological preparation for collective action and fear is not associated with taking action against out-groups. We conclude that the effect of anger depends on its specific informational potential in a particular intergroup context. These results highlight that gender groups differ on a crucial point from ethnic groups and call for more attention to the effect of people's gender in intergroup relations research.

T1  - Battling with Memleket in London: The Kurdish Diaspora's Engagement with Turkey
AN  - 1347781764; 201318711
AB  - Since the late 1980s there has been a significant migration of Kurds from Turkey to various countries in Western Europe. Even though Kurds from Turkey make up a significant proportion of London's ethnic minority population, they constitute an 'invisible' diasporic community, both in terms of the current debates surrounding ethnicity and the Muslim minority in the UK, and in diaspora studies. This article examines how the Kurdish diaspora interacts with, and relates to, their country of origin. It highlights their resistance to, and struggle with, Turkey (as defined by their displacement and suppression of cultural and linguistic rights) as well as the close and, at times, intimate ties Kurds continue to maintain with Turks and Turkey. Whilst the first is conceptualised as 'battling with Turkey', the latter is conceptualised within the framework of 'memleket' (homeland) ties. The article explores how the Kurdish diaspora encodes its orientation towards, as well as its resistance to, Turkey; in so doing, it brings visibility to this largely ignored and understudied, yet politically very active, diasporic formation in London.

T1  - Latinos' Perceptions of Interethnic Couples
AN  - 1023026942; 201223847
AB  - Numerous survey findings indicate that the majority of White Americans are accepting of interracial romantic relationships. However, relatively few studies have looked at how different American ethnic minority groups view such relationships. The current research examined Latinos' evaluations of intraethnic and interethnic couples. Latino participants (N = 207) read information about either a Latina-Latino, Latina-White, or Latina-Black romantic couple. The results indicate that the Latina-Black couple was evaluated less positively than the Latina-White couple on relationship quality and less positively than the other two couples on perceptions of social support. Latino men were especially likely to express negative emotions toward the Latina-Black couple compared with Latina women. The results are discussed in the context of intergroup relationships.

T1  - Threat, Prejudice, and Stereotyping in the Context of Japanese, North Korean, and South Korean Intergroup Relations
AN  - 1417525187; 201331750
AB  - Integrated threat theory, realistic conflict theory, and group justification (based on social identity theory) were evaluated in the international context of Japanese prejudice toward North Korea and South Korea. Military threat emerged as an important addition to the four threats outlined by integrated threat theory. Three perceived North Korean threats (realistic [domestic] threat; intergroup anxiety; military threat) predicted prejudice toward North Korea. North Korean prejudice predicted negative stereotypes, supporting group-justification theory. Perceived North Korean realistic [domestic] threat predicted prejudice toward South Korea. Prejudice toward South Korea predicted negative stereotypes of North Korea, suggesting a mechanism by which prejudice generalizes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Residential Segregation and Interethnic Contact in the Netherlands
AN  - 1018343046; 201212826
AB  - Dutch policy-makers perceive high shares of ethnic minorities in neighbourhoods as a problem; it might generate fewer opportunities for minorities to have contact with the native Dutch population and thereby hinder integration. The question, however, is whether the ethnic composition of neighbourhoods influences interethnic contact. In this paper, the focus is on the leisure contact of people from ethnic minorities aged 15 to 65 with native Dutch people. Binary logistic multilevel analysis shows that contact with native Dutch people is mainly explained by individual characteristics. In addition, living in one of the four largest cities-cities with high shares of minorities at the city level-leads to less contact with native Dutch people. The ethnic composition of the neighbourhood has no effect on contact, therefore segregation at the neighbourhood level does not necessarily hinder integration. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Sibling relationships in Dutch and immigrant families
AN  - 1037879162; 201231247
AB  - This study examines differences in sibling relationships among native Dutch and immigrant groups in the Netherlands. It uses a large national dataset to compare adult sibling relationships among Moroccan, Turkish, Caribbean and native Dutch groups, focusing on the varying importance of gender composition and age structure for the sibling relationship in the ethnic minority groups and the native Dutch families. Results show that, on average, ethnic minorities in the Netherlands have more involved sibling relationships in adulthood, with more contact, more emotional support, practical support (except Turks and Antilleans), a higher relationship quality, but also more conflict (among the Turks and Antilleans) compared to the Dutch. Gender constellation and hierarchical position were not of equal influence in all groups, although no clear patterns emerged. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Diversity and the Imagined Community: Immigrant Diversity and Conceptions of National Identity
AN  - 1037880439; 201231260
AB  - As immigrant diversity increases across most developed democracies, there is an increasing concern that perceived threats to mainstream interests (both cultural and economic) will produce an ethnocentric response. This study approaches the question using survey measures that explicitly tap respondents' normative conception of membership in the national community. Based on cross-sectional and over-time analysis of the ISSP's "National Identity Module," it shows that more immigrant-exclusive definitions of the national ingroup are linked to both contextual and individual measures of cultural threat. Perceived economic threat at the individual level is also powerfully linked to this outcome, but contextual measures of economic prosperity are not. This finding lends weight to the argument that increasing levels of immigrant diversity are a threat to an inclusive sense of national identity that includes both natives and immigrants.

T1  - The Hillary Clinton effect: When the same role model inspires or fails to inspire improved performance under stereotype threat
AN  - 1910239628
AB  - If successful role models undo stereotype threat effects by providing reassurance that group members can "take care of themselves," then the same real-world role model might inspire those who think she deserved success, but fail to inspire those who think she did not. In a pilot study, some women participants listed Hillary Clinton high among women who deserved their success; others listed her high among women who did not deserve their success. The former participants, but not the latter, claimed her success came from internal and stable causes and would inspire them in difficult situations. In the main study, women rated how much Hillary Clinton deserved her success. One month later, they were placed under mathematics stereotype threat, read a factual biography of Hillary Clinton, and took a GRE-Q test. Those who had earlier claimed Clinton deserved her success scored as well as a test-only control group; those who had earlier claimed she did not deserve her success scored as poorly as a threat-only control group. The results are seen as contributing to theories of role models, stereotype threat, and attribution.

T1  - Examining the Long-Term Racial Disparities in Health and Economic Conditions Among Hurricane Katrina Survivors: Policy Implications for Gulf Coast Recovery
AN  - 964198502; 201207512
AB  - This study examines disparities in the long-term health, emotional well-being, and economic consequences of the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes. Researchers analyzed the responses of 216 Black and 508 White Hurricane Katrina survivors who participated in the ABC News Hurricane Katrina Anniversary Poll in 2006. Self-reported data of the long-term negative impact of the hurricane on personal health, emotional well-being, and finances were regressed on race, income, and measures of loss, injury, family mortality, anxiety, and confidence in the government. Descriptive analyses, stepwise logistic regression, and analyses of variance revealed that Black hurricane survivors more frequently reported hurricane-related problems with personal health, emotional well-being, and finances. In addition, Blacks were more likely than Whites to report the loss of friends, relatives, and personal property. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Boundaries of ethnic identity in Central Asia: titular and Russian perceptions of ethnic commonalities in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan
AN  - 870433160; 201114264
AB  - Using data from nationally representative public opinion surveys done in 2005 in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, the authors focus on the titular groups as well as the Russians in both countries and provide assessments of their perceived ethnic commonalities with one another and with various other ethnic groups, including Uzbeks and Jews in each country. The results indicate that there are hierarchies of intergroup differentiations that help to delineate the boundaries of ethnic identities in both countries. Multivariate analyses show the systematic effects of regional variables in shaping these ethnic boundaries. The basic topographies of the boundaries are consistent with the effects of social identification processes and the relative power and social standings of the different target ethnic groups across the regions. Our results lend clear support to the ethnic boundaries paradigm by underscoring that ethnic boundaries can be independent of objective commonalities and can vary according to contexts.

T1  - Not Quite Color Blind: Ethnic and Gender Differences in Attitudes toward Older People among College Students
AN  - 1364699852; 201326861
AB  - Attitudes toward older people can influence how they are treated and their cognitive and physical health. The populations of the United States and many other countries have become more ethnically diverse, and are aging. Yet little research examines how ethnic diversity affects attitudes toward older people. Our study addresses this research gap. Using the Aging Semantic Differential, 592 university students expressed their attitudes toward older African-American, Hispanic, and White women and men. Repeated measures analysis of variance examined attitude differences by participant ethnicity and gender, and by the ethnicity and gender of evaluated individuals. Both African-American and White students had more positive attitudes toward older women and men of their own ethnic group. Participants had more positive attitudes toward older women than they did toward older men. Findings suggest in-group favoritism, and the usefulness of training those in service industries and public service to treat older individuals equitably. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Bridging Identities
AN  - 856403711; 201106865
AB  - In this article the authors examine the development of identity theories over recent years, in which investigators directly addressed the overlap areas and distinctions between the behavioral sciences. First, the article analyzes the psychological theories of Hogg, et al. from the mid 1990s; and then studies sociological theories from Stets and Burke at the beginning of the 21st century. Next, the authors discuss self-categorization, depersonalization, and other cognitive processes, and theories re identity; beginning with Erik Erikson in the 1950s, and highlighting various approaches over time related to social identity theory (SIT), among others. From this standpoint the authors delve into 3 specific theoretical areas, such as the motivational bases of identity, integration of the different bases of identity, and multiplicity of identity, in order to the bridging factors and vantage points.

T1  - Explaining Anti-Kurdish Beliefs in Turkey: Group Competition, Identity, and Globalization
AN  - 818802458; 201071779
AB  - Objective. In the wake of Turkey's EU candidacy and the U.S.-led war in Iraq, Turkey's Kurdish question has drawn international attention. Due to previous data limitations, ours is the first article to analyze what explains anti-Kurdish beliefs in Turkey using nationally representative survey data. Methods. descriptive analyses and partial proportional odds models of the Pew Global Attitudes Survey (2002), we examine the extent and sources of these beliefs. Results. We find high levels of anti-Kurdish beliefs in Turkey, but little evidence of group competition-material interests shaping these beliefs; rather, nationalism, secularism, and, somewhat surprisingly, favorable evaluations of globalization better explain anti-Kurdish beliefs. Conclusion. social-dominance orientation and authoritarianism may be factors working in the background, anti-Kurdish beliefs are better explained by the peculiar case of modernization in Turkey and these anti-Kurdish beliefs may be different from negative beliefs about other minorities.

T1  - Relative deprivation and intergroup competition
AN  - 822519071; 201068352
AB  - Two experiments utilized a new experimental paradigm-the Intergroup Prisoner's Dilemma- Maximizing Difference (IPD-MD) game-to study how relative deprivation at the group level affects intergroup competition. The IPD-MD game enables group members to make a costly contribution to either a within-group pool that benefits fellow ingroup members, or a between-group pool, which, in addition, harms outgroup members. We found that when group members were put in a disadvantaged position, either by previous actions of the outgroup (Experiment 1) or by random misfortune (Experiment 2), they contributed substantially more to the competitive between-group pool. This destructive behavior both minimized inequality between the groups and reduced collective efficiency. Our results underscore the conditions that lead group members to care about relative (rather than absolute) group outcomes and highlight the need to differentiate between the motivation to get ahead and the motivation not to fall behind: the latter, it appears, is what motivates individual participation in destructive intergroup competition.

T1  - Exploring the Ethnic Dimension of Internal Migration in Great Britain using Migration Effectiveness and Spatial Connectivity
AN  - 818802931; 201072611
AB  - Using data from the 2001 Census Special Migration Statistics, this paper explores ethnic variations in the propensity to migrate, the effectiveness of net migration in redistributing ethnic populations, and the connectivity between places that results from ethnic migration. London has by far the largest concentration of ethnic minority populations in Great Britain and plays a key role in the national internal migration system. By decomposing the net migration balances of boroughs into those within and across London's outer metropolitan boundary, the paper reveals different spatial processes of decentralisation and dispersal as well as centralisation when comparing ethnic groups.

T1  - Asian American television activity: Is it related to outgroup vitality
AN  - 818801924; 201072799
AB  - Applying a uses and gratifications and social identity gratifications approach, the present study explores Asian American television viewing. Specifically, Asian Americans report on the quantity of television they watch, what shows they watch, why they watch, and whether their uses are related to their perceptions of Caucasian vitality. The data reveal that using television for entertainment and to escape/relieve boredom were the most important television uses for this group of Asian Americans. At the same time, these two uses were significant predictors of how vital Asian Americans perceived Caucasians. Although selecting and avoiding television for ethnic identity gratifications were not important relative to other gratifications, television selection for identity gratifications was important to Asian Americans who highly identify with their ethnic group.

T1  - Ethnicity Differences in the Completion Rates of Upper Secondary Education: How Do the Effects of Gender and Social Background Variables Interplay?
AN  - 822521847; 201072612
AB  - This article compares completion rates in Norwegian upper secondary education among ethnic minority groups and the ethnic majority. We examine differences by nationality background among the immigrant groups, and between first- and second-generation immigrants, and how the effects of social origin vary between ethnic majority and minority, and between boys and girls. The findings indicate that parents' education level is of less significance for students with a non-Western background than for the ethnic majority. The ethnic majority students benefit more from having parents with high education, but the immigrants seem to lose less from having low-educated parents. There are large gender differences in favour of girls. Among students with a non-Western background, the education level of the mother is of particular significance for girls, as well as the mother and father having employment. Among the minority groups, students with Bosnian, Vietnamese and Sri Lankan background are doing particularly well. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Respect for persons in the intergroup context: Self--other overlap and intergroup emotions as mediators of the impact of respect on action tendencies
AN  - 743053513; 201031477
AB  - Two studies examined self--other overlap and intergroup emotions as mediators of the effects of respect for persons on action tendencies towards outgroup members. In contexts of both mild (Study 1) and more severe (Study 2) intergroup conflict, respect for persons predicted action tendencies towards outgroup members: those who value the intrinsic worth of others (high respect for persons) expressed less negative and more positive action tendencies towards outgroup members than did those with low respect for persons. These effects were obtained while controlling for Social Dominance Orientation and Agreeableness (Study 1). Further, the effects of respect for persons on action tendencies were shown to be partially mediated by self--other overlap and intergroup emotions. The findings support previous work in suggesting that respect for persons is an important predictor in intergroup contexts, and they highlight potential mechanisms through which respect might operate.

T1  - Concerns about appearing prejudiced: Implications for anxiety during daily interracial interactions
AN  - 743047783; 201031481
AB  - We investigated the relationship between Whites' and ethnic minorities' concerns about appearing prejudiced and anxiety during daily interracial interactions. College roommate pairs completed an individual difference measure of concerns about appearing prejudiced at the beginning of the semester. Then they completed measures of anxiety and perceptions of their roommates' anxiety-related behaviors for 15 days. Results indicated that among interracial roommate pairs, Whites' and ethnic minorities' concerns about appearing prejudiced were related to their self-reported anxiety on a daily basis; but this was not the case among same-race roommate pairs. In addition, among interracial roommate pairs, roommates who were concerned about appearing prejudiced began to 'leak' their anxiety towards the end of the diary period, as indicated by their out-group roommate who perceived their anxious behaviors as increasing across time, and who consequently liked them less. The implications of these findings for intergroup relations are discussed in this article. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Inter-ethnic friendships in post-war Bosnia-Herzegovina: Sociodemographic and place influences
AN  - 743066165; 201027270
AB  - International concerns about the continued ethnicization of Bosnian social and political life are both validated and challenged by the December 2005 public opinion study. Ordinary Bosnians are willing to consider cross-ethnic friendships and cooperation. The gap between ethnic elites and entrepreneurs and their constituents is evident still in Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH). The optimistic note of this study is sounded by the fact that half of respondents in BiH want more friends from different nationalities. The differences between the three ethnic groups are not dramatic. However, 41 percent of respondents stated that all or most of their friends were from their own nationality. Analysis of the responses by geographic location and by explanations related to modernization, ethnic competition and war experiences, indicated that all proved useful in understanding the distributions. The geographic distributions indicated the primacy of the urban--rural factor for questions on current friendship networks and preferences for friends in other ethnic groups.

T1  - Understanding Bias toward Latinos: Discrimination, Dimensions of Difference, and Experience of Exclusion
AN  - 60362625; 201017449
AB  - White-Black relations have historically been the defining form of intergroup relations in the study of prejudice and discrimination. The present article suggests that there are limitations to applying this model to understanding bias toward other groups and proposes that a comprehensive view of the dynamics of the Anglos' bias toward Latinos requires consideration of the distinctive elements of this form of intergroup relations. In four empirical studies, we experimentally document discrimination against Latinos (Study 1), explore the potential dimensions that underlie bias against Latinos (Study 2), and examine the effect of a particular social identity cue, accentedness, on perceptions of acceptance and belongingness of Latinos and members of other groups (Studies 3 and 4). These studies consider general processes of prejudice and identify how particular facets of bias against Latinos can shape their experiences and, taken together, illustrate how understanding bias against Latinos can reciprocally inform contemporary theories of prejudice.

T1  - Inter-ethnic friendships in post-war Bosnia-Herzegovina: Sociodemographic and place influences
AN  - 1928317232
AB  - International concerns about the continued ethnicization of Bosnian social and political life are both validated and challenged by the December 2005 public opinion study. Ordinary Bosnians are willing to consider cross-ethnic friendships and cooperation. The gap between ethnic elites and entrepreneurs and their constituents is evident still in Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH). The optimistic note of this study is sounded by the fact that half of respondents in BiH want more friends from different nationalities. The differences between the three ethnic groups are not dramatic. However, 41 percent of respondents stated that all or most of their friends were from their own nationality. Analysis of the responses by geographic location and by explanations related to modernization, ethnic competition and war experiences, indicated that all proved useful in understanding the distributions. The geographic distributions indicated the primacy of the urban--rural factor for questions on current friendship networks and preferences for friends in other ethnic groups.

T1  - Moral identity and psychological distance: The case of adolescent parental socialization
AN  - 60355577; 201017489
AB  - A mediation model using a sample of 1059 adolescents (56% girls; M age = 16.02, SD = 1.37) tested relations between parenting, adolescent moral identity, and the formation of psychological distance towards others. In short, adolescent moral identity mediated relations between parenting and the ways in which adolescents oriented others in their psychological space. Specifically, adolescent-report parenting style dimensions (responsiveness, autonomy-granting, and demandingness) were positively related to the formation of both private and public moral identity dimensions (internalization and symbolization), which were in turn associated with a tendency to construct psychological distance towards others (negatively with social dominance orientation and positively with the circle of moral regard). Therefore, one way parents may be able to influence how adolescents relate to their peers is by fostering a sense of moral identity in their children through authoritative parenting.
