T1  - The Different Faces of Social Tolerance: Conceptualizing and Measuring Respect and Coexistence Tolerance
AN  - 2594368934
AB  - In the theoretical literature on tolerance a distinction is proposed between coexistence and respect tolerance. In three studies with four national samples of Dutch majority members, we demonstrate that these two forms of tolerance can be distinguished empirically in relation to different immigrant target groups. The findings of all studies further show that the more principled respect tolerance was negatively associated with prejudice towards immigrants, and positively associated with the acceptance of concrete minority practices, above and beyond prejudice. However, the positive association between respect tolerance and acceptance of practices was weaker for people who were more strongly concerned about the continuity of their national cultural identity. Overall, the more pragmatic coexistence tolerance was found to have no independent association with prejudicial feelings and with the acceptance of minority practices. The findings indicate that stimulating respect tolerance might be particularly helpful for improving intergroup relations in culturally diverse societies.

T1  - Affective Polarization in Political and Nonpolitical Settings
AN  - 2631533288
AB  - We seek to understand the extent to which affective polarization is driven by in-group love or out-group hate and whether it varies across context. The answer may, in turn, allow us to evaluate how well the fundamental premises of social identity theory mesh with different manifestations of affective polarization. Using an experiment to analyze partisans’ trust judgments, we find that the amount of affective polarization and the dominant mechanism underlying it varies by context—whether political or nonpolitical. We find that affective polarization is nearly twice as strong in political settings as in nonpolitical settings. In addition, although affective polarization reflects a blend of both in-party love and out-party hate in both contexts, we find that in-party love is the more dominant source of polarization in nonpolitical settings while out-party hate is the more dominant source in political settings. The latter finding causes us to question how well-suited social identity theory is for understanding polarization in the political sphere.

Naudojant Europos socialinio tyrimo 1-7 bangų ir Ekonominio bendradarbiavimo ir plėtros organizacijos rodiklius, straipsnyje pritaikoma daugiapakopio modelio metodologija. Ši metodologija leidžia įvertinti asmenines (vertybines, socioekonomines ir demografines) bei kontekstines (bendrojo vidaus produkto, nedarbo lygio, nelygybės) priežastis, nulemiančias neigiamą požiūrį į imigrantus. Tyrimo rezultatai rodo, kad Europos Sąjungoje asmeninės vertybės yra susijusios su požiūriu į imigrantus.Alternate abstract:This paper aims to analyse the connection between values individuals hold and perception whether immigration is bad or good for economy in the European Union. It applies the multilevel modelling approach on the European Social Survey rounds 1-7 and a set of the OECD economic measures. The method allows for an examination of personal (values, socioecomic and demographic) and contextual (GDP, inequality and unemployment rates) drivers of anti-immigrant tendencies. The results show that individual values are connected to how people perceive immigrants in the EU.

T1  - The multifaceted relationship between individual religiosity and attitudes toward immigration in contemporary Italy
AN  - 2579221342
AB  - When analyzing the relationship between individual religiosity and attitudes toward immigration, empirical research often leads to contrasting findings. By focusing on contemporary Italy, our contribution aims to provide evidence of two opposite effects that religiosity can exert on attitudes toward immigration. On the one hand, belonging to a religious community is expected to reinforce a social identity, leading to negative attitudes toward outgroups. On the other hand, religious commitment implies adhering to religious teachings which promote altruistic values, such as the acceptance of others. Since the two hypotheses pertain to different dimensions of religiosity, we propose to use a typology combining affiliation and church attendance, so that the two hypotheses can be tested as complementary. The first evidence we provide to support the hypotheses analyzes parallel survey data coming from the European Social Survey (ESS), the European Values Study (EVS), and the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). In particular, we point out that non-religious and highly religious people show more positive attitudes toward immigration than affiliated individuals with low religious commitment. Moreover, data from the 2018 ISSP module “Religion IV”, which includes more specific measures of religious identity and commitment, lend further support to our expectations.

T1  - Opposing Immigrants in Europe: The Interplay Between Religiosity, Values, and Threat
AN  - 2574660933
AB  - Previous research located two opposite findings and frequently used threat perceptions and value‐support to explain the relationship between religiosity and attitudes toward immigrants: Religious individuals have negative attitudes toward immigrants because they support conservative values and feel threatened by unfamiliar groups. Second, they are open toward immigrants because they integrate prosocial and altruistic teachings of religion into their daily lives. Both lines have been confirmed repeatedly, which is puzzling. I argue that we need to consider all three factors (religiosity, value‐support, threat perceptions) simultaneously and explore their mutual interactions. In this study, I test this line of argumentation empirically with data from the European Social Survey (Round 7). The analyses reveal that religiosity has the weakest direct effect on attitudes toward immigrants. Threat perceptions, on the other hand, have the strongest direct effects, followed by value‐support. However, religiosity affects the attitudes toward immigrants indirectly via threat perceptions. These findings highlight that religiosity, value‐support, and threat perceptions are closely linked and need simultaneous consideration to make reliable claims about their effects.

T1  - Seeing and treating the out-group like family: Transference effects in an ethnic context: GPIR
AN  - 2513520124
AB  - Transference effects occur when our impressions are guided by our mental representations of significant others. For instance, if a target resembles an individual’s significant other, then that person’s feelings toward their significant other will be transferred onto the target. The present research examines whether transference effects emerge even when the target belongs to an ethnic out-group. In two experiments, participants received descriptions of in-group and out-group targets who partly resembled their own (or another’s) positive significant other. The findings showed that resemblance to one’s own significant other improves attitudes and behavior toward both in-group and ethnic out-group targets, as found across 2 nations and 3 different ethnic out-groups. The present research hence provides evidence of robust transference effects across ethnic group boundaries.

T1  - Profiles of Multi-cultural Identity Integration in a Conflictual Context
AN  - 2476845373
AB  - This study addressed the phenomenon of multiple social identities in a conflictual context. It examined the case of Palestinian-Christians living in Israel, a nation imbued with ethno-religious conflict, a complex combination of three distinct collective identities: national (Palestinian- Arab), ethno-religious (Christian), and civic (Israeli). The current study proposed a conceptual and methodological expansion of the "Bicultural Identity Integration" (BII) model (Benet- Martinez & Haritatos, 2005) as a way to assess different levels of integration between three types of identities (national, ethno-religious, and civic) in a sample of 383 Palestinian Christians with Israeli citizenship. Results revealed that the three integrations of BII (Arab-Christian, Arab-Israeli, Christian-Israeli) are positively predicted by favorable intergroup contact with Jews and Muslims and negatively by discrimination by these groups. Further, Latent Profile Analyses revealed four distinct identity profiles: two ("Pro-Arab" and "Pro-Israel") were highly conflictual and characterized by both discrimination and negative intergroup contact, and two ("Ambivalent" and "Peaceful") were characterized by less conflict across pairs of identities. These findings are discussed in terms of their theoretical contribution to the study of multiple social and collective identities in contexts of conflict, and their practical implications for the groups under study.

T1  - Bifurcating American identity: partisanship, sexual orientation, and the 2016 presidential election
AN  - 2571096017
AB  - Although scholars of American nationalism debate whether its essence is civic, ethnic, or a civic–ethnic blend, the tendency is to presume it is a single, indissoluble phenomenon. Questioning that assumption, this article collects and analyzes statements from 2016 U.S. presidential candidates to understand how they situated Lesbians, Gays, and Bisexual (LGB) Americans within the nation’s parameters. Events during the 2016 presidential election – particularly, the Obergefell decision striking down same-sex marriage bans, Kimberly Davis’ defiance of a federal court order to issue same-sex marriage licenses, and the Pulse nightclub massacre – provided a unique opportunity for the candidates to articulate their ideas on U.S. national identity and even rank the relative belonging of different ethnic, racial, and sexual communities. Rather than gravitate toward a common understanding, candidate pronouncements on non-heterosexuals’ place in the nation gravitated toward two distinct and bifurcated understandings of American authenticity and the conditions under which sexual minorities could be welcomed. This finding aligns with historical public opinion about LGB Americans and with analyses of increasing partisanship. Contrary to the expectations in the nationalism literature, we see a growing trend toward the continued polarization of increasingly incompatible visions of U.S. national identity.

AB  - Teubner talks about anti-Semitic violence and mass demonstrations against racial and ethnic minorities. If the most recent attack came as no surprise to the Jews of Chemnitz, the connection between anti-immigration militancy and anti-Semitism is not exactly linear, even if it has historical antecedents. Indeed, xenophobia and anti-Semitism share a long, ugly history in Germany. Europe is again experiencing a threat from the east, even if it has been exaggerated by certain European populists, and in the US anti-Islamic and anti-immigration sentiments increasingly serve as masks for anti-Semitism.

T1  - Racial Attitudes and Health Care Policy Opinion: An Anglx–Latinx Contrast
AN  - 2138652661
AB  - Recent studies confirm that Anglxs’ racial attitudes can shape their opinions about the Affordable Care Act (ACA), particularly when this federal health care policy is linked to Barack Obama. Strong linkages made between Obama and the ACA cue Anglxs to apply their racialized feelings toward Obama to their health policy preferences. This is consistent with a growing body of research demonstrating that “racial priming” can have a powerful impact on Anglxs’ political opinions. Yet few studies have explored racialized policy opinion among minorities, and fewer still have explored racial priming among Latinxs. In this paper, we compare the effect of racial priming on the health policy preferences of Latinxs and Anglxs. Using survey evidence from the 2012 American National Election Study, we find important Anglx–Latinx differences in racialized policy preferences. However, we also find that racial priming has an effect on U.S.-born Latinxs that closely resembles its effect on Anglxs. Results suggest that increasing ethnic diversity in the United States will not necessarily produce increasingly liberal politics as many believe. American politics in the coming decades will depend largely on the ways in which Latinxs’ racial sympathies and resentments are mobilized.

T1  - Truth Bias and Partisan Bias in Political Deception Detection
AN  - 2084681764
AB  - This study tests the effects of political partisanship on voters’ perception and detection of deception. Based on social identity theory, in-group members should consider their politician’s message truthful while the opposing out-group would consider the message deceptive. Truth-default theory predicts that a salient in-group would be susceptible to deception from their in-group politician. In an experiment, partisan voters in the United States (N = 618) watched a news interview in which a politician was labeled Democratic or Republican. The politician either answered all the questions or deceptively evaded a question. Results indicated that the truth bias largely prevailed. Voters were more likely to be accurate in their detection when the politician answered and did not dodge. Truth-default theory appears robust in a political setting, as truth bias holds (as opposed to deception bias). Accuracy in detection also depends on group affiliation. In-groups are accurate when their politician answers, and inaccurate when he dodges. Out-groups are more accurate than in-groups when a politician dodges, but still exhibit truth bias.

T1  - Seeing Discrimination: Does Acknowledging Structural Determinants of Inequality Impact Support for the Use of Force by Police among Whites?
AN  - 2256513565
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of racial beliefs held by Whites on their attitudes toward the use of force by the police. While the use of an index assessing racial attitudes is common, we take a more nuanced approach examining impacts of different types of explanations for racial inequality: individualist, structural and mixed-group types. Findings demonstrate that support for the use offorce is racialized. Respondents who espouse a "pure" individualistic explanation for racial inequality express greater support, while those with "pure" structuralist explanations express less support. Surprisingly, respondents who acknowledged both types ofexplanations maintained similar attitudes as "pure" individualists. These findings are discussed with regards to their broader theoretical implications.

T1  - Being different at work: How gender dissimilarity relates to social inclusion and absenteeism: GPIR
AN  - 1978441021
AB  - We investigated how and when gender dissimilarity relates to two highly important individual work outcomes: social inclusion and absenteeism. We collected survey data among 397 employees from a university of applied sciences and combined these with data from the organization's personnel administration. Our results indicate that dissimilarity was negatively related to perceived work group inclusion. In addition, this negative effect was stronger when the group was perceived to have a negative diversity climate. Finally, there was a conditional indirect effect of gender dissimilarity on absenteeism through inclusion. That is, being different from other group members in terms of gender was associated with higher absenteeism through lower levels of perceived inclusion, but only when the group was perceived to have a negative diversity climate. Together, the present research demonstrates that sometimes being different is associated with more absences and underlines the importance of establishing a positive climate for gender diversity.

T1  - Is Blindness Contagious? Examining Racial Attitudes among People of Color with Close Interracial Relationships
AN  - 1934858291
AB  - Are people of color with close relationships with whites more likely to embrace colorblind racial ideologies (CBRI)? Using restricted data from waves 1 and 2 of the Portraits of American Life Study (N = 2,713), collected in 2006 and 2012, we test whether black, Latina/o, and Asian respondents are more likely to express colorblind racial attitudes if they have an intimate partner or close friends who are white. We use ordinal logit models to examine seven CBRI attitudinal items, controlling for the respondent's socioeconomic characteristics, immigrant generation, national origin, gender, age, characteristics of the city, and region. Although black, Latina/o, and Asian respondents are less likely to express CBRI than whites are, respondents of color with close relationships with whites are more likely to minimize certain types of racism, even after controlling for other characteristics of the individual. We discuss the implications of these findings, considering the patterns of antiblack and anti-immigrant attitudes among groups of color and placing them in the context of the more negative attitudes often expressed by whites. We also describe how other demographic patterns in these attitudes could shape future trends in attitudes and suggest possible interventions.

T1  - The Bibimbap Migration Theory? Challenges of Korea's Multicultural Mix and Social Integration Development
AN  - 1924202822
AB  - Migration was never a brand new phenomenon in South Korea, but its migration pattern has been redirected, migrant size has been amplified, and migrant ethnicity has been diversified in recent years. Korea is undergoing dramatic changes in its demographic composition with an increasing presence of foreigners since the 1990s. Traditionally known for its cultural uniqueness and ethnic homogeneousness, the ongoing inflow of foreigners has presented new challenges, as to who the Koreans are and how the modern Korean society should be defined. Some Koreans even raise concern over migration inflow as a threat to its nationhood purity. This research examines the shifting trend of immigration in Korea with a focus on the new social development of multiculturalism, while assessing the level of social integration and multicultural discourses of the public. In addition to those widely discussed marriage immigrants and foreign labor workers in the existing literature, the recent surge of professional expats, foreign teachers, and international students is becoming evident in Korea's multicultural mix. Moreover, there is still a lack of literature on foreign migrants in Korea, including the US military service personnel, the foreign professional sports players, non-North Korean international refugees, and the latest, permanent residency immigrants through property investment in Korea. Despite the noted increasing inflow of a variety of immigrant residents, who are constantly shaping the new faces of Korea, the acceptance of ethnic diversity and cultural integration has yet to secure its solid place in the Korean society for multiculturalism to be truly embraced and flourished.

T1  - Racial attitude (dis)similarity and liking in same-race minority interactions: GPIR
AN  - 1928333122
AB  - Two studies investigate the relationship between racial attitude (dis)similarity and interpersonal liking for racial minorities and Whites in same-race and cross-race pairs. In nationally representative and local samples, minorities report personally caring about racial issues more than Whites do (Pilot Study), which we theorize makes racial attitude divergence with ingroup members especially disruptive. Both established friendships (Study 1) and face-to-face interactions among strangers (Study 2) provided evidence for the dissimilarity-repulsion hypothesis in same-race interactions for minorities but not Whites. For minorities, disagreeing with a minority partner or friend about racial attitudes decreased their positivity toward that person. Because minorities typically report caring about race more than Whites, same-race friendships involving shared racial attitudes may be particularly critical sources of social support for them, particularly in predominately White contexts. Understanding challenges that arise in same-race interactions, not just cross-race interactions, can help create environments in which same-race minority friendships flourish.

T1  - Are the ethnically tolerant free of discrimination, prejudice and political intolerance?
AN  - 1929389479
AB  - We hypothesized that the ethnically tolerant (i.e., people who are anti-ethnocentric and score very low on a measure of ethnocentrism) would perceive people with extremely incompatible values and beliefs as out-groups and would engage in discrimination, prejudice and political intolerance against them. Experiments among Australian citizens in Studies 1 (N = 224) and 2 (N = 283) showed that the ethnically tolerant perceived supporters of a message in favour of mandatory detention of asylum seekers as out-groups and consequently exhibited discrimination, prejudice and political intolerance against them. Study 3 with 265 U.S. citizens showed that, controlling for liberalism, ethnic tolerance led to prejudice against out-groups. This was replicated with 522 UK citizens in Study 4, which also showed that social identity, and not moral conviction, mediated the link between ethnic tolerance and prejudice. The findings suggest that the ethnically tolerant can be discriminatory, prejudiced and politically intolerant against fellow humans.

T1  - Taking it to the Street: Reclaiming Australia in the Top End
AN  - 1923055496
AB  - Since Cronulla, racism and the resurgence of White ethno-nationalism is again contesting the diversity of Australian national imaginaries. This paper argues, however, that encounters with Aboriginality and connection to Country provide fresh perspectives that affirm difference. The paper focuses on Broome and Darwin, two urban centres in northern Australia with a visible Aboriginal population that have been the focus of little contemporary research on intercultural relations compared to southern cities. Such an optics from the Top End is necessary, given its unique histories of Aboriginal and ethnic minority contact that predate White settlement, as well as the ongoing resistance to dehumanising, interventionist and racially discriminatory practices and policies. This paper places affirmative 'events of commoning' at the core of emancipatory politics. Such a politics is informed by the theoretical conceptualisation of commoning as a relational process of 'being-in-common' that unfolds in cooperative practices and collective action. We focus on two events - a protest event in Broome as response to the closure of remote Aboriginal communities and a 'celebration walk' through the streets of Darwin during NAIDOC week. These 'noisy' and 'quiet' struggles reclaim the street and provide the possibility to think about how a common world can be recomposed through embodied potentiality.

T1  - Assessing the public willingness to contribute income to mitigate the effects of climate change: A comparison of Adelaide and Lisbon
AN  - 1910845348
AB  - While the scientific rationale for climate change mitigation has never been stronger, the Australian public is still hesitant about personally contributing to its costs. This public reticence is often explained as resulting from cost-benefit calculations and a human propensity to prioritize present over future goods. In this article we argue that these assumptions have limited bearing on people's willingness to contribute. Our research supports this by demonstrating that the people of Lisbon, Portugal, are more willing to contribute than those of Adelaide, despite Portugal's poorer economic conditions. Furthermore, willingness to contribute in both Lisbon and Adelaide does not diminish when the effects of climate change are deemed to be further away. Drawing on these results, we seek to begin the discussion of how social and cultural factors shape public attitudes towards climate change, and thus further build upon the research looking sociologically at people's willingness to act.

T1  - "Whoever decides for you without you, s/he is against you!": immigrant activism and the role of the Left in political racialization
AN  - 1877540839
AB  - Much of the migration literature neglects the questions of why and how "native" allies obstruct activism by immigrants and ethnic minorities. Left-wing organizations in particular are often assumed to be supportive of inclusion, and little research exists on the ways they have prevented the migrant population from having a voice in the political arena and from taking part in society as equals. Drawing on the critical theory literature, I introduce the concept of political racialization. This concept refers to mechanisms whereby political actors, in order to legitimize their work on immigration, have partially included immigrants in the political sphere, but in a relationship of "ethnic" or "racial" subordination. Through the analysis of 57 in-depth interviews with immigrant activists, I show how political racialization works within the Italian Left and how it contributes to marginalize the migrant population. I further explain how immigrant activists have challenged political racialization through their activism.

T1  - Changing Identities: A Case Study of Western Muslim Converts Whose Conversion Revised Their Relationship to Their National Identity
AN  - 1892718795
AB  - Few studies explore the impact conversion to Islam has on a Western individual's social identity configuration. This article focuses on six Western Muslim converts-three from Montreal, two from Berlin, and one from Copenhagen-who experienced difficulties relating to their national identities prior to conversion, exploring how it developed afterwards. A qualitative interview guide was adapted in a semi-structured format to the demands of each individual, and interviews were analyzed applying thematic content analysis. The participants reveal how they revised their social identity configuration upon conversion, ultimately reversing their antagonistic relationship to their national identity. Their narratives relate how political realities are embedded in the perception and development of the Western Muslim identity, necessitating a revaluation of their national identity as a form of social critique. Our results demonstrate how socio-political experiences of discrimination and race are all significantly implicated in the process of conversion and Muslim identity development.

T1  - The Impact of Adolescents' Classroom and Neighborhood Ethnic Diversity on Same- and Cross-Ethnic Friendships Within Classrooms
AN  - 1871510067
AB  - This study examines how classroom and neighborhood ethnic diversity affect adolescents' tendency to form same- versus cross-ethnic friendships when they enter middle school. Hypotheses are derived from exposure, conflict, and constrict theory. Hypotheses are tested among 911 middle school students (43 classrooms, nine schools) in the Netherlands. Multilevel (p2) social network analyses show that students were more likely to engage in same-ethnic rather than cross-ethnic friendships. In line with conflict theory, greater classroom and neighborhood diversity were related to stronger tendencies to choose same-ethnic rather than cross-ethnic friends, among both ethnic majority and minority students. Diversity did not hamper reciprocity, as students in more ethnically diverse classrooms were even more likely to reciprocate friendships.

T1  - The Unravelling of Identities and Belonging: Criminal Gang Involvement of Youth from Immigrant Families
AN  - 1865257114
AB  - Grounded in the experiences of 30 gang-involved respondents in Calgary, this Canadian study examined criminal gang involvement of youth from immigrant families. Our analysis showed that gang-involved youth had experienced multiple, severe and prolonged personal and interpersonal challenges in all facets of their lives and that gradual disintegration of their relationships with family, school and community had resulted in the unravelling of self-concept, ethnic identity, sense of belonging and sense of citizenship and progressively propelled them towards membership in high-risk social cliques and criminal gangs. Our findings brought attention to the need for coordinated, comprehensive support for youth from immigrant families through family-based, school-based and community-based programs.

T1  - Family and Schooling Experiences in Racial/Ethnic Academic Achievement Gaps: A Cumulative Perspective
AN  - 1862124599
AB  - The gap in academic skills between white and historically disadvantaged racial/ethnic minority children exists at school entry and grows over time. Research over the last two decades has identified the important role of schools in perpetuating these disparities and the limited role of family experiences. Much of this research, however, has relied on strategies that consider only snapshots of children's experiences and has assumed that family and schooling experiences have the same benefit for everyone. For this study, we examine racial/ethnic differences in children's achievement through a cumulative framework that focuses on differences in the overall amounts of accumulated experiences and whether these experiences have similar benefits for all children. Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K), we find that cumulative experiences explain a moderate portion of the gap in reading and math gains between white and historically disadvantaged minority children. In addition, there is evidence that family and schooling experiences matter differently by race/ethnicity. [web URL: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0731121416629989]

T1  - Backlash
AN  - 1851015856
AB  - Research suggests that members of advantaged groups who feel dehumanized by other groups respond aggressively. But little is known about how meta-dehumanization affects disadvantaged minority group members, historically the primary targets of dehumanization. We examine this important question in the context of the 2016 U.S. Republican Primaries, which have witnessed the widespread derogation and dehumanization of Mexican immigrants and Muslims. Two initial studies document that Americans blatantly dehumanize Mexican immigrants and Muslims; this dehumanization uniquely predicts support for aggressive policies proposed by Republican nominees, and dehumanization is highly associated with supporting Republican candidates (especially Donald Trump). Two further studies show that, in this climate, Latinos and Muslims in the United States feel heavily dehumanized, which predicts hostile responses including support for violent versus non-violent collective action and unwillingness to assist counterterrorism efforts. Our results extend theorizing on dehumanization, and suggest that it may have cyclical and self-fulfilling consequences.

T1  - Being a freshie is (not) cool: stigma, capital and disgust in British Pakistani stereotypes of new subcontinental migrants
AN  - 1843960150
AB  - Intra-ethnic discrimination, in the form of stereotyping of recent migrants by settled ethnic minorities, has been interpreted as internalized racism, displacing stigma and negotiation of local hierarchies of belonging. Stereotypes of 'Fresh off the Boat' migrants construct cultural boundaries and assertions of belonging, offering clues to processes of identity-making where ethnicity is complicated by ongoing migration. In British Pakistani portrayals of 'freshies', this assertion of difference coexists with familial ties and a high incidence of transnational marriage. Analysis of the figure of the 'freshie' in internet comedy videos, combined with qualitative research material, provides insight into dynamics of cultural and social capital, immigration and sexuality through manifestations of difference, similarity and disgust. Together these not only reveal the weakness of recent migrants' positions in structures of socio-economic and symbolic power, but the blurring of social categories, and the continuing importance of transnational kinship in negotiations of identity amongst British Pakistanis.

T1  - Identity construction through English language learning in intra-national migration: a study on Uyghur students in China
AN  - 1840854475
AB  - This study explores how a group of Uyghur minority students construct their identities in and through English language learning experiences as they move from Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region to study in a prestigious East coastal university in China. The research findings show that the processes of English language learning enable the ethnic minority students to develop multiple yet powerful identities, that is, a situated elite identity constructed as opposed to other Uyghur members and a positive heritage identity negotiated within the academic community, and allow them to imagine multilingual and multicultural memberships for themselves. The favourable identities thus forged are found to facilitate their adaptation to the host community. However, these minority elites are confronted with a series of problems in learning English compared to their Han counterparts, which hinder their socialisation into the society and upward social mobility. Finally, implications for policy-makers, the host institution, and ethnic students are discussed.

T1  - "Living in Our Own World": Parental Influence on the Identity Development of Second-Generation Ethiopian and Eritrean Youth During Their Formative Years
AN  - 1830616470
AB  - This study explored the process of identity formation of second-generation Ethiopian and Eritrean youth in Toronto, Canada. Analysis of 20 in-depth interviews presented pathways of acculturation whereby first-generation parents parlay their adaptive process onto their children, influencing the self-identity trajectories and repertoires of the children in their formative years. Findings suggest that parental, social, and cultural forces are an inseparable and critical component of the development of identity. Participants' identity formation in their formative years was one of high-level cultural identity with their parents' culture of origin.

T1  - Racialized classroom practices in a diverse Amsterdam primary school: the silencing, disparagement, and discipline of students of color
AN  - 1811371214
AB  - In both Europe and the US, racial and ethnic minority students experience discrimination at the hands of teachers that negatively impacts academic achievement. In the US, scholars have documented how a predominantly white teaching force racializes students of color through discipline and low expectations, which impact educational attainment. But in Europe, the denial of race's existence hinders research regarding structural explanations for minority educational inequality and often explains low educational attainment as a function of cultural differences. Examining classroom practices in a diverse Amsterdam primary school, this article documents racializing mechanisms that found minority students disproportionately disparaged, disciplined, and silenced. In addition, many were students under-recommended to higher level secondary school tracks. These findings reveal that Dutch schools are not racially meritocratic institutions and are relevant for scholars in the Netherlands and all other nations with educational institutions dominated by colorblind ideologies, white norms, and large immigrant populations.

T1  - It's not all black and white: A propensity score matched, multilevel examination of racial drug sentencing disparities
AN  - 1823550849
AB  - This study aims to alleviate some of the mixed findings throughout the literature on racial disparities in sentencing outcomes by utilizing propensity score matching and multilevel modeling to assess racial drug sentencing disparities in state courts from 2000-2012. The findings illustrate the effect of race on sentencing varies significantly across states, and aggregate factors impact this relationship. Specifically, although differential offending, minority population, and arrests do not alleviate disparities, they are moderators that explain variance across states. Finally, aggregate socioeconomic factors such as poverty and education are also significant moderators that indicate the importance of structural disadvantage in sentencing outcomes.

T1  - Friends or Foes: The Impact of Political Ideology and Immigrant Friends on Anti-Immigrant Sentiment
AN  - 1868554422
AB  - In recent years, an increase in anti-immigrant sentiment has been witnessed in the United States, particularly from politically conservative groups. According to intergroup contact theory, increased contact between in-group and out-group members, especially cross-group friendships, has been found to reduce intergroup prejudice. This study analyzed nationally representative U.S.-based data (n = 1,000) from the Transatlantic Trends Survey, 2013 to examine if having immigrant friends interacted with political ideology, such that having immigrant friends weakened the association between conservative ideology and anti-immigrant sentiment. Findings revealed that immigrant friends and political ideology each had a significant but opposite main effect on anti-immigrant sentiment, but that having immigrant friends did not moderate or buffer the effects of political ideology on anti-immigrant sentiment. Thus, aligning with a conservative political ideology is associated with anti-immigrant sentiment irrespective of having immigrant friends. Strategies to increase intergroup contact and promote cross-group friendships are made and directions for future research are offered.

T1  - The significance of race/ethnicity in adolescent violence: A decade of review, 2005-2015
AN  - 1814123937
AB  - As the United States enters a demographic landscape where racial and ethnic minorities will represent more than half of the adolescent population, this current state-of-the art review highlights pertinent research that focuses on race/ethnicity for interpersonal adolescent violence published between 2005 and 2015. A systematic and exhaustive search of several academic databases such as Criminal Justice Abstracts, Web of Knowledge, and EBSCO Host was conducted. Google Scholar searches were conducted to locate articles that are "in press." This state-of-the-art review discusses the complexities in the relationship between race, ethnicity, and interpersonal adolescent violence, as well as the theoretical and policy implications. These studies are relevant because they elucidate existing criminological theories and inform policies and programs aimed at curtailing adolescent violence.

T1  - Positive Time: Balanced Time Perspective and Positive Orientation
AN  - 1811905117
AB  - The aim of the research presented in this article is to investigate the relationship between positive orientation and time perspective as outlined by Zimbardo and Boyd (J Pers Soc Psychol 77:1271-1288, 1999 ) and extended by an additional form of concentration on the present. The Polish version of the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory was used. A third type of present time perspective, namely active concentration on the present, was measured by the Carpe Diem Scale. One hundred and eighty five Polish people (non-students) participated in a survey to which a canonical-correlation analysis and a cluster analysis were applied. Positive orientation was correlated with a balanced temporal profile comprising a strong positive past orientation, moderate concentration on the future, poor fatalistic time perspective, poor concentration on the negative past and moderate active concentration on the present. Whereas a positive orientation is based on a general positive attitude towards life and self, a balanced time perspective reflects a general positive attitude towards time, in which an active concentration on the present plays an important role.

T1  - Partisan Participation and Ethnic Autonomy: The Case of the Mapuche Organisation Admapu, in Chile
AN  - 1807486428
AB  - This article examines the formation of Admapu - an organisation representing a broad sector of Mapuche society that resisted the actions of the Chilean dictatorship during the 1980s. In political memory, the period of agrarian reform marks a time of hope and strong participation, but here we show how an autonomy project developed within Admapu conflicted with those making political alliances with the Chilean Left. We examine the internal dynamics within Admapu, and argue that at the end of the decade the organisation divided into factions that cemented a rupture with the political system and brought about the formation of contemporary resistance movements.

T1  - Adaptation, rationality, and advancement: ethnic Albanian organized crime in New York City
AN  - 1800073108
AB  - The objective of this research is to understand the expansion and advancement of ethnic Albanian organized crime groups in New York City. Many European law enforcement agencies have depicted Albanian organized crime groups as dangerous due to their ability to overcome obstacles, their propensity to use violence, and also because they have progressed from simple service providers to working within the highest echelons of international organized crime. This research examines whether Albanian organized crime groups in New York City have developed more stable structures through the strategic acquisition of information. The article tries to answer: Do Albanian organized crime groups in New York have a long-term strategy for advancement? Are they more risk-seeking and irrational than other organized crime offenders, or are they more risk-averse and rational? Are they malleable learning organizations? This study takes both a thematic and chronological approach, and examines the process of change across four key areas (structure of the criminal organizations; criminal activities; violence; and infiltration and corruption) and over three time periods (1975-1991; 1992-2002; 2003-2014). The conclusions are based on content analysis of court files and official government documents as well as interviews with law enforcement officials and Albanian organized crime offenders, inside and outside of U.S. Federal Prisons.

T1  - Rising Mercury, Rising Hostility
AN  - 1796341147
AB  - Recent social scientific research has examined connections between public opinion and weather conditions. This article contributes to this literature by analyzing the relationship between high temperature and survey response. Because hot temperatures are associated with aggression, irritation, and negativity, such conditions should lead to the expression of aggression, irritation, and negativity in survey response. This relationship is tested in a likely realm: feelings about policies relating to racial minorities. Data are drawn from the National Climatic Data Center and the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. Logistic regressions demonstrate that even after controlling for demographic and geographic factors, average daily temperatures above 74°F are associated with preferences for a stricter immigration policy as well as against permissive affirmative action policies. Acknowledging the role of this contextual variable reduces nonrandom error in estimates of public opinion on these issues.

T1  - Organization-based self-esteem in work teams: GPIR
AN  - 1786223332
AB  - It is now known that organization-based self-esteem (OBSE) correlates consistently with employee attributes that are important to the success of organizations, such as in-role and extra-role job performance, job satisfaction, organization commitment, and turnover intentions (see Bowling, Eschelman, Wang, Kirkendall, & Alarcon, 2010; Pierce & Gardner, 2004). The three major categories of OBSE antecedents (organization systems, messages from significant others, and experiences of success) have also been well studied, with one major exception. We do not know if, or how the experience of working in a group (team) environment affects employees' OBSE level, and how OBSE might affect attitudes towards and the effectiveness of that group environment. This study develops hypotheses about the genesis of OBSE in work groups, and its relationships with work group satisfaction and perceptions of group member effectiveness. In three different organizations we found that OBSE correlates with coworker and team satisfaction, as well as perceived team member effectiveness. Theoretical and managerial implications of the results are discussed. [web URL: http://gpi.sagepub.com/content/19/3/394.abstract]

T1  - Explaining Ethnic Differences: Can Ethnic Minority Strategies Reduce the Effects of Ethnic Penalties?
AN  - 1802763152
AB  - Some social scientists are sceptical of the explanatory power of ethnicity and seek to explain ethnic differences by references to non-ethnic factors such as discrimination. We challenge this scepticism by considering two theoretical objections: there is no such thing as ethnicity and ethnic categories are unable to explain social processes; and by showing how ethnic strategies affect outcomes that cannot be captured in standard ethnic penalty analyses, we offer a new way to examine ethnic penalties in unemployment. We calculate a set of net ethnic penalties and then analyse longitudinal labour-force data to examine how strategies such as self-employment change ethnic penalties in unemployment amongst six different ethnic groups in Britain. The results show that self-employment reduces the ethnic penalty for Indians, Pakistanis-Bangladeshis and others, but not for Blacks, White-Others and White-British. This supports the argument that ethnicity can provide an explanation for some of the ethnic differentials in the labour market.

T1  - Policy Streams and Immigration to Russia: Competing and Complementary Interests at the Federal and Local Levels
AN  - 1774373470
AB  - This article uses Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework to explain forms of national- and region-level governance used in the Russian Federation to manage unprecedented levels of international immigration. First, we identify the ways that the Russian federal government has legislated and governed international migration from 1991 through 2010. We then compare the federal level to the case of the Krasnodar region, an ethnically diverse region in the North Caucasus. We find that that migration policy adoption in Russia at the federal level is relatively immune to economic trends or labour needs but more sensitive to foreign and domestic political objectives. At the regional level, local socio-political and economic concerns predominate and political objectives are secondary. Finally, we argue that migration policy changes or adopted policy at the regional level may be explained by an interaction effect between changes in political leadership, federal level policy adoption, and regional level context.

AB  - This study explores diasporic Asian young people's engagement with the recent wave of Korean pop culture, also known as the Korean Wave, in Canada. Drawing on in-depth interviews conducted in Toronto and Vancouver, the study examines how transnational cultural flow is articulated with social media and ethnic sociality. In the study, while the transnational flow of Korean media content was largely reliant on social media, it was renegotiated by the users' subject positions as ethnic minorities and by their ethnic networks in the Canadian cities.

T1  - Social versus Spatial Mobility? Mongolia's Pastoralists in the Educational Development Discourse
AN  - 1778778534
AB  - When it comes to education for mobile pastoralists, Mongolia is an exceptional case. Until fifty years ago, herders comprised the majority of the Mongolian population. Although a satellite of the Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Republic was a state in which mobile pastoralism was not challenged, and herders were not constructed as social outcasts. Equally exceptional was the country's modernisation, witnessed in its decided alignment with equal opportunities. In Mongolia, it was not 'nomadism' that was associated with backwardness, but illiteracy. Policy-makers aimed to combine spatial with social mobility by building schools further and further out in the grasslands, employing locals as teachers, and fostering interplay between modern formal education and extensive animal husbandry. Yet after 1990, when development discourse pigeon-holed post-socialist Mongolia as a Third World country, the so-called shock therapy led to severe cuts in education. Herders were essentialised as 'nomads', which caused donor-driven policies of educational planning to construe pastoralists as challenges. Ironically, during the initial decade of Education for All, the younger generation had--for the first time in Mongolia's history--less educational opportunities than their parents. This article discusses narratives of inclusion and the political consequences of ascribed social identities.

T1  - Collective action from a distance: Distance shapes how people view victims of injustice and decreases willingness to engage in collective action: GPIR
AN  - 1752001314
AB  - The present research examines whether distance affects not only how people view victims of injustice, but also group members' willingness to engage in collective action. Across two experiments, examining both spatial (Experiment 1) and temporal (Experiment 2) distance, distant victims were seen as less familiar and more likely to be viewed at a relatively more superordinate level of identity (less in terms of subgroup identity) compared to near victims. In addition, participants were less willing to engage in collective action on behalf of distant victims, relative to near victims. Across studies, decreased collective action on behalf of distant victims, relative to near victims, was explained by the tendency to view victims in a more abstract way -- as less familiar (Experiment 2) and at a more superordinate level (Experiments 1 and 2). Across both studies, results also demonstrated that participants were less willing to engage in collective action on behalf of out-group targets, relative to in-group targets, which was explained by perceptions of familiarity (Experiment 2). Implications for collective action and more broadly social change are discussed. [web URL: http://gpi.sagepub.com/content/19/1/27.abstract]

T1  - Self-expansion motivation improves cross-group interactions and enhances self-growth: GPIR
AN  - 1752001233
AB  - Rather than seeing outgroup members as targets of fear, conflict, or even tolerance, the self-expansion model proposes that outgroup members might be seen as attractive opportunities for self-growth. The current study utilizes an experimental manipulation to raise (or lower) self-expansion motivation prior to a positive interaction with a stranger from a different ethnic group. The results show that priming high self-expansion motivation leads to higher quality interactions, greater interpersonal closeness, greater feelings of self-growth, and higher feelings of self-efficacy. In addition, these outcomes show patterns of mediation consistent with the predictions of self-expansion theory. These findings point to a potentially valuable tool for improving the quality of cross-group contact experiences. More broadly, they focus attention on the genuinely positive functions that relationships with outgroup members can have for the self. [web URL: http://gpi.sagepub.com/content/19/1/60.abstract]

T1  - Effects of Heterogeneity and Homophily on Cooperation
AN  - 1747611834
AB  - The article provides a micro-behavioral model and an experimental design to understand the effect of heterogeneity in social identities on cooperation while accounting for endogenous sorting. Social identity is induced exogenously using the minimal group paradigm. The experiment manipulates sorting with three treatments: having subjects interact with both in- and outgroup members, giving them the choice to interact either with ingroup or outgroup members, and isolating the groups from the outset. Cooperation is measured by the Prisoner's Dilemma Games at the dyadic level and by Public Goods Games at the tetradic level. The results show that heterogeneity hampers between-group cooperation at the dyadic level. In addition, endogenous sorting mitigates this negative effect of heterogeneity on cooperation. Heterogeneity hampers cooperation at the tetradic level most substantially if there is a commonly known negative history between groups. [web URL: http://spq.sagepub.com/content/78/4/324.abstract]

T1  - European Workers in Brazilian Coalmining, Rio Grande do Sul, 1850-1950
AN  - 1744618370
AB  - Coalmining in Brazil began in the mid-nineteenth century in the municipality of São Jerônimo, Rio Grande do Sul, the country's southernmost state. European workers were brought in and joined Brazilian workers, mostly local peasants with no experience in mining. This article discusses the role played by the immigrants in the making of a working class in the coalfields of southern Brazil. The research on which this article is based draws on numerous sources, including lawsuits and the application forms used to request professional licences. It focuses on ethnic and racial ambiguity, and on political strategies. The identity of the miners in the region is commonly represented as an amalgam of all ethnic groups, but this article shows that this self-propagated solidarity and cohesion among workers had its limits.

T1  - Multiculturalism on Its Head: Unexpected Boundaries and New Migration in Singapore
AN  - 1724872546
AB  - This study investigates how discourses of multiculturalism shape public debates surrounding new migration in Singapore. Singapore's immigration policies led to the influx of Chinese and Indian professionals, many of whom share race and class identities with local Singaporeans. However, Singaporeans of Chinese and Indian backgrounds rejected these presumed similarities, using discourses of multiculturalism to differentiate themselves from co-ethnic migrants. Based on a content analysis of news reports and online forums, this study shows how local actors portrayed new migrants as too prejudiced or bigoted to adapt to Singapore's multiracial society, thereby creating a paradoxical application of multicultural ideals. This example highlights how contemporary immigration is creating diverse forms of inclusion and exclusion within migrant-receiving nations, challenging models, and policies of multiculturalism based solely on ethnicity and race. This paper also demonstrates how individuals can utilize the discourse of multiculturalism in forwarding their own interests and concerns. Scholarly debates have often portrayed multiculturalism as an ideology or policy imposed by state institutions, where local actors are left to either resist or accommodate such ideas. In the Singapore context, individual Singaporeans transform discourses of multiculturalism, creating a counter-discourse that challenges state immigration policies.

T1  - Us and Them: Black-White Relations in the Wake of Hispanic Population Growth
AN  - 1728663114; 201534018
AB  - How will Hispanic population growth affect black-white relations in the United States? Research on intergroup relations operates within a two-group paradigm, furnishing few insights into multi-group contexts. This study is based on an original experiment that combines behavioral game and survey methods to evaluate the impact of perceived Hispanic growth on attitudes and behavior. Results reveal opposite reactions among blacks and whites. Whites in the baseline condition contribute comparable amounts to black and white recipients in a dictator game, whereas whites who first read about Hispanic growth contribute more to white recipients than to black ones. By contrast, blacks in the baseline condition contribute more to black recipients than to white ones, whereas blacks who first read about Hispanic growth contribute comparable amounts to black and white recipients. Patterns of identification mirror patterns of contributions: whites exposed to Hispanic growth identify relatively more strongly with their racial group than with their national group, whereas blacks exposed to Hispanic growth identify relatively more strongly with their national group than with their racial group. Together, these results suggest that people respond to the growth of a third group by prioritizing the most privileged identity to which they can plausibly lay claim and which also excludes the growing group.

T1  - Does Anti-Hispanic Bias Motivate Opposition to Non-English Languages?
AN  - 1728660554; 201535385
AB  - Contemporary political debates about language policy in the United States focus on three primary policy issues: bilingual education in public schools, English-only legislation, and the access of non-English speaking citizens to political rights. Using the 'Multi-Ethnic United States' module from the 2000 General Social Survey (GSS), this article tests multiple attitudinal, behavioral, demographic, and contextual hypotheses for how Anglos and African Americans view bilingual policy issues. We examine the role of linguistic contact, self-interest, group threat, and discriminatory views of Latinos, finding that the latter-as measured by the 'Three Ds' (Derogation, Disrespect, and Distance)-are the strongest predictors of attitudes toward bilingualism. Distance (social distance from Latinos) is consistently significant, disrespect (doubts about Latino contributions to the United States.) is mostly significant, and derogation (Latino stereotypes) is occasionally significant. Also, political ideology and knowledge of a non-English language play important roles in the formation of favorable bilingualism opinions. However, the self-interest and group threat variables were largely insignificant. Taken together, these findings indicate the importance of understanding how policy views may be structured by opinions about out-group individuals and cultures. Language can serve as a proxy for immigrants themselves, as negative attitudes toward Latinos are associated with negative attitudes toward bilingualism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - UK Polish Migrant Attitudes Toward Deceased Organ Donation: Findings from a Pilot Study
AN  - 1695351871
AB  - There is a critical shortage of transplantable organs in the UK. At present, there is no literature on Polish migrants' (the fastest growing community in the UK) attitudes toward organ donation. This is the first study to explore the views of the Polish community towards organ donation in the UK. There were 31 participants that took part in semi-structured interviews or small focus groups to discuss organ donation for approximately 1½-2 h. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using grounded theory methods to elicit thematic categories and sub-categories. Overall, participants had a positive attitude towards organ donation but demonstrated a lack of knowledge about the organ donation systems and processes in the UK and wanted to learn more about these issues. As little detailed data on ethnicity is collected on the NHS Organ Donor Register and on the active transplant waiting list, it is currently unclear as to how organ donation affects the Polish community living in the UK. However, the findings of the study highlight the Polish community could benefit from tailored education for a clearer understanding of organ donation processes and systems in the UK and registering as an organ donor.

T1  - AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009: A POLITICAL ANALYSIS OF ITS IMPACT ON BLACK AND LATINO UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE UNITED STATES
AN  - 1842827822
AB  - There exists an interesting intersection of political reality in the United States among blacks, Latinos, and whites. This political reality stems from behaviors within the American political economic system which manifest in inequity. This study examines the impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 on the Black and Latino unemployment. This study is based on the premise that Blacks and Latinos were negatively affected by the Great Recession and its economic phenomenon. A case study impact analysis approach is used to draw conclusions from the data gathered from government documents obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the United States as a whole and the cities of Atlanta, Georgia, and Los Angeles, California. The authors found that during the Great Recession Black and Latino rates of unemployment were as severe as national unemployment during the early years of the Great Depression, yet the Act was focused on macro-economic issues versus micro-economic employment rates found among Black and Latino communities.

T1  - My Friend is Gay, But… The Effects of Social Contact on Christian Evangelicals’ Beliefs About Gays and Lesbians
AN  - 1962749713
AB  - This paper examines the relationship between social contact with gays and lesbians and beliefs about homosexuality, and explicitly investigates whether this relationship is different for Christian evangelicals than for others. We find that although social contact with gays and lesbians is related to beliefs about homosexuality in ways predicted by social contact theory, those with a gay or lesbian friend hold more positive attitudes, this is not the case for Christian evangelicals. In fact, analyses reveal that the effect of social contact for Christian evangelicals is significantly less than the effect for non-evangelicals. Results suggest that social contact alone is not enough to positively change Christian evangelicals’ beliefs about gay and lesbian individuals. This research adds to our knowledge about social contact by providing empirical evidence that all subgroups of the population are not affected equally by social contact with minority groups—an important piece of information for theoretical developments and policy makers.

T1  - An essentialism perspective on intercultural processes
AN  - 1700676770; 201524942
AB  - Essentialist theories are the beliefs that there are immutable essences underlying observed differences between social groups (e.g. racial group, cultural group). This paper reviews the intergroup dynamics and intrapersonal processes associated with essentialism. It also explores the interplay between the two. By explicating the intricate relationship between these psychological processes, the current paper aims to advance our understanding of intergroup relations and identify their implications for the study of multiculturalism. We posit that although the commonly observed negative intergroup outcomes, such as prejudices and biases, can be the byproducts of basic cognitive processes associated with essentialist theories, the social power dynamics in a given society also play important roles in shaping the relationships between essentialism and intergroup outcomes. We then discuss the implications of this understanding to our increasingly multicultural world. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Evaluating the Impact of Immigration Policies on Health Status Among Undocumented Immigrants: A Systematic Review
AN  - 1683720772
AB  - Over the past two decades, new anti-immigration policies and laws have emerged to address the migration of undocumented immigrants. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to assess and understand how these immigration policies and laws may affect both access to health services and health outcomes among undocumented immigrants. Eight databases were used to conduct this review, which returned 325 papers that were assessed for validity based on specified inclusion criteria. Forty critically appraised articles were selected for analysis; thirty articles related to access to health services, and ten related to health outcomes. The articles showed a direct relationship between anti-immigration policies and their effects on access to health services. In addition, as a result of these policies, undocumented immigrants were impacted by mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Action items were presented, including the promotion of cultural diversity training and the development of innovative strategies to support safety-net health care facilities serving vulnerable populations.

T1  - National and regional proportion of immigrants and perceived threat of immigration: A three-level analysis in Western Europe
AN  - 1790890881
AB  - Immigration is of growing significance to the demographic makeup of Western Europe. A long-standing and highly disputed question is whether a larger number of immigrants are associated with more negative attitudes toward immigration or whether the reverse is true. Previous studies yielded contradictory results on various levels of analysis (national, regional, local). These inconsistencies may partly be linked to what is known as the 'modifiable areal unit problem' in spatial analysis. This article seeks to address this issue by analyzing the relationship between the percentage foreign-born and perceived group threat in 15 Western European countries on the national as well as on three differing regional levels (
 
  N
  = 70, 207, and 624 regions, respectively), together with survey data from the European Values Study's fourth wave. I expect threat effects to operate through national communication systems while contact and habituation to immigrants to work on the regional level. Consistent with theoretical expectations, the results show a positive correlation between the national proportion of immigrants and perceived threat, while the coefficients are negative on the regional level. More immigration might thus lead to a more negative evaluation of the presence of immigrants in European countries, but apparently not within the regions where most of the newcomers reside. Two recent examples illustrate this seemingly paradoxical relationship. As a methodological result, effect size and statistical significance vary with the delimitation of the regional units of analysis (
 
  Nomenclature des Unités Territoriales Statistiques
  (NUTS)-1, -2, or -3). This suggests that research in this field should pay more attention to how and why spatial units are defined.

T1  - Can we really reduce ethnic prejudice outside the lab? A meta-analysis of direct and indirect contact interventions
AN  - 1700674929; 201525026
AB  - The present meta-analysis tested the effectiveness of contact-based interventions for the reduction of ethnic prejudice. Up to now, a meta-analysis summarizing the results of real-world interventions that rest on the intergroup contact theory has been missing. We included evaluations of programs realizing direct (i.e.,face-to-face) and/or indirect (i.e.,extended or virtual) contact in real-world settings outside the lab. The interventions' effectiveness was tested shortly after their end (k=123 comparisons, N=11371 participants) and with a delay of at least 1 month (k=25, N=1650). Our data show that contact interventions improve ethnic attitudes. Importantly, changes persist over time. Furthermore, not only direct but also indirect contact interventions are successful. In addition, contact programs are effective even in the context of a serious societal conflict (e.g.,in the Middle East). Although changes are typically larger for ethnic majorities, there is an impact on minorities, too. Finally, contact interventions not only improve attitudes toward individuals involved in the program, their effects also generalize to outgroups as a whole. In sum, social psychology provides an intervention for prejudice reduction that can be successfully implemented in the practical field. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Contact Theory in a Small-Town Settler-Colonial Context: The Reproduction of Laissez-Faire Racism in Indigenous-White Canadian Relations
AN  - 1700675646; 201524700
AB  - This article builds on group position theory and the subcategorization model of intergroup contact by illustrating how, in a small-town settler-colonial context, contact tends to reproduce, rather than challenge, the inequitable racial structure. In Northwestern Ontario, Indigenous-settler relations are characterized by widespread intergroup marriage and friendship as well as pervasive prejudice and discrimination. Using 18 months of fieldwork and 160 interviews and surveys with First Nations, Metis, and non-Indigenous residents, I show that although contact is associated with less 'old-fashioned' prejudice (i.e., overt categorical hostility), it does not necessarily eliminate whites' superior sense of group position. Even white individuals who have close Indigenous friends or spouses often express laissez-faire racism. Three mutually reinforcing social processes -- subtyping, ideology-based homophily, and political avoidance norms -- interact to sustain whites' sense of group superiority and justifications for racial inequity. These processes are facilitated by historical and structural conditions, in this case colonization and small-town dynamics. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Patriotic Unity and Ethnic Diversity at Odds: The Example of Tatar Organisations in Moscow
AN  - 1708525424; 201528615
AB  - The Russian Federation's policy of promoting patriotism, in place since the early 2000s, raises the issue of how the country's non-Russian ethnic groups receive this policy. To answer this question, this essay studies the reception of Russian state-promoted patriotism in the 2000s among the Tatar community in Moscow. Looking at the activities of Tatar associations (especially the Regional Tatar National-Cultural Autonomy organisation), it shows the syntheses and compromises negotiated by activists between patriotism and ethno-cultural belonging in the capital. Paradoxically, their attempts at synthesis strengthen an essentialist representation of the Tatar community, leading ultimately, on the one hand, to criticism of state nationality policy, and on the other, to the discontent of Tatar independent activists who criticised the undemocratic rules and personal domination in the Regional Tatar National-Cultural Autonomy organisation supported by state authorities. These criticisms echo the tensions in the Russian political agenda at the beginning of the 2010s. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - MAPPING THE ROMA ETHNIC MINORITY
AN  - 1735657892; 201536887
AB  - The Roma ethnic minority is a community of overall deprivation. It lacks adequate space, municipal infrastructure, capital (social, cultural, financial, etc.), and tolerance by non-Roma. It also lacks the driving forces that could move the Roma from the margins of society and allow them to participate in the management of public good. One of the reasons is the fact that spatial planning providers only made it half way. They mapped the Roma settlements but failed to plan the social anchors which provide a settlement with satisfactory vitality. These anchors make up social, human and cultural capital, which are all important components of human resources development and thus a significant source of the development efficiency of the Roma community in Slovenia. The two pillars of development - human resources and development efficiency - should both aim at reducing the exclusion of the members of the Roma ethnic minority from the Slovene society. The paper presents the main findings of the research project entitled The Increase in Social and Cultural Capital in Areas with a Roma Population. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Patterns of minority and majority identification in a multicultural society
AN  - 1722763423
AB  - There has been increasing investigation of the national and ethnic identification of minority populations in Western societies and how far they raise questions about the success or failure of multicultural societies. Much of the political and academic discussion has, however, been premised on two assumptions. First, that ethnic minority and national identification are mutually exclusive, and, second, that national identification forms an overarching majority identity that represents consensus values. In this paper, using a large-scale nationally representative UK survey with a varied set of identity questions, and drawing on an extension of Berry's acculturation framework, we empirically test these two assumptions. We find that, among minorities, strong British national and minority identities often coincide and are not on an opposing axis. We also find that adherence to a British national identity shows cleavages within the white majority population. We further identify variation in these patterns by generation and political orientation.

T1  - The Impact of Ethnic Diversity on Participation in European Voluntary Organizations: Direct and Indirect Pathways
AN  - 1718064655; 201531184
AB  - In this study, we test whether Putnam's general claim of a negative effect of ethnic diversity holds for (active and passive) involvement in three types of voluntary organizations: leisure, interest, and activist organizations. Using data from the European Social Survey (wave 1), we applied multilevel analyses distinguishing individuals, regions, and countries. Only at the regional level, did we find that ethnic diversity reduced involvement in interest organizations. Yet, ethnic diversity induced passive involvement in activist organizations. Subsequently, we included mechanisms derived from conflict and contact theory to disentangle the indirect effects of ethnic diversity. Ethnic threat perceptions influenced participation in all voluntary associations negatively, while intergroup contact turned out to have positive influences. Our findings stress the necessity of distinguishing different types of voluntary organizations and modes of involvement and underline the importance of incorporating indirect effects of ethnic diversity.

T1  - Purpose in Life as a Resource for Increasing Comfort With Ethnic Diversity
AN  - 1708525508; 201528609
AB  - Emerging demographic trends signal that White Americans will soon relinquish their majority status. As Whites' acclimation to an increasingly diverse society is poised to figure prominently in their adjustment, identifying sources of greater comfort with diversity is important. Three studies (N = 519) revealed evidence that purpose in life bolsters comfort with ethnic diversity among White adults. Specifically, dispositional purpose was positively related to diversity attitudes and attenuated feelings of threat resulting from viewing demographic projections of greater diversity. In addition, when primed experimentally, purpose attenuated participants' preferences for living in an ethnically homogeneous-White city, relative to a more diverse city when shown maps displaying ethno-demographic information. These effects persisted after controlling for positive affect and perceived connections to ethnic out-groups, suggesting the robust influence of purpose. Potential benefits of situating purpose as a unique resource for navigating an increasingly diverse society are discussed.

T1  - A discourse of civilization/culture and nation/ethnicity from the perspective of inner Mongolia, China
AN  - 1660022572; 201505549
AB  - After tracking the Chinese historical trajectory on the discursive relationship between Chinese civilization and the northern nomadic group, this paper examines the official discursive construction of the 'civilization' and 'culture' of ethnic minorities in contemporary China. Through the analysis of the Grassland Culture Research Project (caoyuanwenhua yanjiu xiangmu), an official project conducted in China in recent decades in response to the emergence of nomadic civilization studies as a distinct academic field, this article aims to show the way in which the concepts of civilization and culture are utilized in order to correspond to the official discourse of nation state and ethnicity in China, and the process by which Mongolian culture is thereby transformed. Civilization as a larger body supposed to include cultures was/is entitled to Chinese nation (zhonghua minzu), and a culture (wenhua) of a certain ethnic minority could only be a part of the Chinese civilization in Chinese academia today. 'Grassland culture ' is defined as a culture that is static, ahistorical, and therefore has to be reframed within the larger system of Chinese civilization. The concept of 'grassland culture' seems to be based more on the particular territory, rather than on the types of culture that have created and are owned by different ethnic groups. Therefore, it might be concluded that the project emphasized the geo-body of the Chinese nation state in order to retain the culture within the territory of China. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Contact with immigrants in times of crisis: An exploration of the Catalan case
AN  - 1700674335; 201525297
AB  - Contact theory and threat group theory offer contradictory hypothesis regarding the effect of contact with immigrants. Does contact reduce or increases negative attitudes towards immigration? This article integrates both approaches and tests the effect of contact towards immigrants when different contexts are considered. We investigate the effect of the economic environment and the immigrant group size on modifying attitudes towards immigration in the context of Catalonia, which offers a complex environment where traditional hypotheses can be tested. Results show that close contact and family contact with immigrants reduce prejudices. However, mixed results are reported regarding the effect of the economic environment or the immigrant group size. Findings also show that Catalan identity is related to lower levels of negative attitudes towards immigrants, regardless of having experienced contact with foreigners. Results have implications on the impact of context when dealing with the impact of contact on attitudes towards immigration. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Asian Americans and the rainbow: the prospects and limits of coalitional politics
AN  - 2571041482
AB  - Asian Americans voted in record numbers for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, joining Latinos and African Americans in their strong support for the United States' first black president. Was Asian American participation in this cross-racial coalition confined to the Obama candidacy, or was it more fundamentally rooted in policy commitments and feelings of solidarity with other minority groups? This article addresses these questions by analyzing public opinion data from the National Asian American Survey, and drawing attention to the 2014 fight over affirmative action in California.

T1  - Contact and Compromise: Explaining Support for Conciliatory Measures in the Context of Violent Intergroup Conflict
AN  - 1692289725; 201524083
AB  - Objectives: Informed by intergroup contact theory, this study explores the relationships between intergroup contact, perceived out-group threat, and support for conciliatory solutions to the violent conflict between Israeli Jews and Palestinians in Israel and the Palestinian territories. Methods: Regression and structural equation models analyze public opinion data collected in Israel in 2011 and 2012. The analyses assess whether quantity and quality of Israeli Jews' contact with Israeli Arabs in day-to-day encounters are associated with their support for conciliatory policies. Results: The quality, but not the quantity, of contact is associated with lower levels of perceived Palestinian threat and, in turn, with increased support for compromise. Conclusion: The current study provides initial evidence that everyday interactions with Israeli Arabs, when they occur under optimal conditions, may have the potential to reduce Israeli Jews' perceptions of Palestinian threat and, in turn, increase their support for compromise.

T1  - Conceptualization of Sexual Orientation Identity Among Sexual Minorities: Patterns Across Sexual and Gender Identity
AN  - 1680153241; 201513941
AB  - This research analyzed how sexual minority individuals discussed identity when critiquing two sexual orientation scales. To better understand the diversity of sexual minority experience, analyses focused on the patterns of responses across sexual orientation identity (monosexual, plurisexual, and asexual) and gender identity (cisgender and transgender). Participants were self-identified sexual minorities who represented a range of gender identities. Using thematic analysis, four main themes were identified related to sexual orientation identity: (1) salience of identity, (2) social identity, (3) identity development and change, and (4) identity and the body. Discussion focuses on understanding the findings in the context of intersectionality theory and emphasizes the need to conceptually disaggregate sexual orientation and gender identity. The conceptualization of sexual orientation as centered on normative assumptions of monosexuality, verisexuality/nonasexuality, genderism, and cisgenderism is also explored.

T1  - Marital Assimilation between the Muslim Hui and the Han Majority in Contemporary Chinese Cities in the People's Republic of China
AN  - 1667951723; 201509673
AB  - This study discusses the marital assimilation of the ethnic Hui, the biggest Muslim minority group in China, with the Han majority in contemporary Chinese cities, using the 1% sample data of the 1990 Chinese Census. Unlike previous research which focus on demographical, social, and cultural characteristics of ethnic minority individuals on their marital choices, this study provides a community-level analysis scrutinizing local marriage market conditions on ethnic intermarriage rate in different geographical locations. Evidently, the Hui-Han intermarriage rate in different city units varies greatly, as high as over 80% while as low as less than 30%. Furthermore, the great variation in Hui-Han intermarriage rate has been found to be highly related to three aspects of local ethnically related structures, which are ethnic demographic compositions, ethnic stratification, and interethnic contact structure. This study adds to the understanding of the integration process of Muslim minorities in a host society of a different religion. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - INTERSECTIONALITY AND THE FOREIGN-BORN: EXPLAINING THE VARIATION IN THE IMMIGRATION ATTITUDES OF IMMIGRANTS *
AN  - 1751968728
AB  - This study uses an intersectionality approach to explain the variation in immigration attitudes of the foreign-born with data from the 2006 Pew Research Center's Immigration Survey. The results indicate that Black male immigrants with less than a high school degree are pro-immigrant compared to White male immigrants with a similar level of education. However, Latino male immigrants, who are typically White, are more likely to be positively affected by additional education, as are Black female immigrants, with respect to developing a pro-immigrant attitude. These differences only emerged in the interactive models. The intersectional framework offers a nuanced view of immigration attitudes and may be helpful to social organizations that work with native-born and foreign-born residents to build better intergroup relations.

T1  - Americans and Iraq, twelve years apart: Comparing support for the US wars in Iraq
AN  - 1660023813; 201506345
AB  - Significant differences exist in Americans' support for force between the 1991 Persian Gulf War and 2003 Iraq War, even when holding all demographic variables constant. Nearly every group decreased their support from 1991 to 2003, including men and women, Whites and racial minorities, people with high school degrees or higher, nearly all age categories, and Democrat and Independent affiliated individuals. When examining potential causes for decreased support in the 2003 Iraq War, the 'nature of the conflict' presents the strongest argument and evidence. The Persian Gulf War aimed to force the Iraqi army from Kuwait, while the Iraq War was aimed at changing the governmental regime of Iraq. The latter conflict was less socially acceptable than the former to Americans. These differences between the conflicts are the best explanation for the change in support, while other explanations, including the changing composition of the population and a less pro-military populace, are insufficient.

T1  - Immigrants' Ethnic Identification and Political Involvement in the Face of Discrimination: A Longitudinal Study of the German Case
AN  - 1531933759; 201423272
AB  - Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) 1993-2006 as well as longitudinal modelling techniques, the present paper contributes to the growing body of literature on ethnic identity and its effects on Immigrants' social integration by examining the role of various forms of labour Immigrants' ethnic sense of belonging and cognitive involvement in politics. Theoretically, the paper draws on interdisciplinary integration models, social psychological theories of social identity as well as theoretical frameworks that delineate the politicisation of collective identity and especially the role of dual identification. Applying 'hybrid' models that combine the virtues of both fixed and random effects models, the statistical analysis confirms that dual identification-immigrant's identification with both the ethnic in-group and the national community simultaneously-is positively related to labour Immigrants' political interest, conditional on the perception of discrimination on behalf of the ethnic origin. Secondly, the longitudinal analyses show some indication that the effect is more pronounced among Turkish immigrants as well as that the mechanisms behind the cognitive politicising process of ethnic identity types differ by ethnic group. In summary, the paper recognizes the value of a multiple-, instead of a one-sided inclusion in emotional terms for Immigrants' cognitive political involvement. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - EFFECTS OF HIV/AIDS PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS ON ATTITUDE AND BEHAVIOR: INTERPLAY OF PERCEIVED THREAT AND SELF-EFFICACY
AN  - 1567048441; 201435049
AB  - We examined how perceived threat affected attitude and behavior toward condom use with main and nonmain partners, among at-risk young adults with varying levels of self-efficacy. Participants were 170 heterosexually active, single students at a northeastern university in the United States. Exposure to HIV/AIDS public service announcements was found to increase perceived susceptibility, which facilitated a positive attitude toward condom use with main partners but not with nonmain partners. High self-efficacy promoted a positive attitude toward condom use with main partners, and condom use with main and nonmain partners. The interaction effects revealed that high, compared to low, self-efficacy motivated more condom use with main and nonmain partners when perceived susceptibility was lower.

T1  - Own Group Oppression, Other Group Oppression, and Perspective Taking
AN  - 1680154081; 201514106
AB  - This survey research examined the relationship of awareness of own versus awareness of other group oppression across sexism, racism, and homonegativity, by including perspective taking (PT) as a moderator. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that awareness of sexism (own group oppression) predicted awareness of racism (other group oppression) in a sample of 116 European American females (Study 1), whereas awareness of racism (own group oppression) did not predict awareness of homonegativity (other group oppression) in a sample of 113 U.S. racial minorities (Study 2). High PT, compared to low PT, did not predict a stronger relationship between awareness of own and awareness of other group oppression. Post-hoc speculation on the role of PT in intergroup relations and implications for research and counseling are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Too Many Immigrants? Examining Alternative Forms Of Immigrant Population Innumeracy
AN  - 1448995733; 201342846
AB  - The tendency to overestimate immigrant population sizes has garnered considerable scholarly attention for its potential link to anti-immigrant policy support. However, this existing innumeracy research has neglected other forms of ignorance, namely underestimation and nonresponse. Using the 2002 European Social Survey, the current study examines the full scope of innumeracy for the first time. Results indicate that underestimation and nonresponse occur commonly across twenty-one countries and that overestimation is far from ubiquitous. Nonresponders in particular are found to represent a distinct innumeracy form associated with low cognitive availability and high negative affect. Multilevel models indicate that underestimation associates with greater opposition to anti-immigrant policy, while overestimation and nonresponse associate with greater support. Much of these associations are explained by affective factors. However, significant under- and overestimation coefficients remain net of controls, suggesting that innumeracy may be more important than initially thought. Overall, the results highlight the multifaceted character of innumeracy. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The social geography of ethnic minorities in metropolitan Paris: a challenge to the French model of social cohesion?
AN  - 1448992881; 201342789
AB  - In order to address the specific social challenges of immigrants and ethnic minorities in the poorest urban neighbourhoods in Paris, new policies of social cohesion have been implemented over the past three decades that focus on place of residence rather than on ethnicity or national origin. The design of a social cohesion policy that deals with socio-geographic inequality rather than with ethnicized populations as such has been a subtle way of addressing the ethnic issue without directly calling into question the postulate of republican universalism. From this perspective, Audebert attempts to understand the role of place and social geography in the formalization of collective identities that have emerged in response to decades of public policies that have been unable to respond to the social, economic and political demands of ethnic minorities. He also attempts to analyse how the French state has relied on social geography as a way to address racial and ethnic issues without directly endowing them with an institutionalized dimension. His hypothesis is that the issue of social cohesion in contemporary France and the way it is dealt with by republican institutions is above all a matter of social geography. The French approach that gives prominence to the urban territorialization of social inequalities over the ethnic categorization approach remains firmly based on republican ideals. Nonetheless, such a policy is innovative in the French context, as it differs from the French traditional assimilationist model and takes into account social and cultural diversity in large metropolitan areas. Audebert's article provides a better understanding of the influence of this integration model on the construction of Otherness. It puts into relief the role of urban geography in the emergence of ethnicity and the design of innovative policy that addresses the issue of cultural diversity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Fading Majority Cultures: The Implications of Transnationalism and Demographic Changes for Immigrant Acculturation
AN  - 1347784150; 201318566
AB  - Processes of globalisation, migration, and increasing cultural diversity within nations have resulted in a growing need to understand intercultural relations in plural societies. Accordingly, this paper highlights the relations between immigrants and members of host societies and considers how social and demographic changes may affect acculturation and intercultural relations and shape future psychological theory and research in these areas. Based on a combination of empirical data and informed speculation, we discuss three significant changes. First is the growing importance of transnational relations due to a large degree of faster and cheaper forms of communication and traveling. A second important factor is changing demographics characterised by the growth of mega-cities and the increasing proportion of first and second generation of immigrants in contemporary immigration nations and -- consequently -- the diminishing size of native majority groups. Third is the greater acceptance of a global culture, which is shaped by globalisation and coloured by local multi-ethnic characteristics and creolisation processes in each country of settlement.

T1  - Racial Threat and White Opposition to Bilingual Education in Texas
AN  - 1417525056; 201331938
AB  - This study examines local contextual conditions that influence opposition to bilingual education among non-Hispanic Whites, net of individual-level characteristics. Data from the Texas Poll (N = 615) are used in conjunction with U.S. Census data to test five competing hypotheses using binomial and multinomial logistic regression models. Our results support a "racial threat" hypothesis, suggesting that increasing opposition to bilingual education among Whites corresponds to changes in the Hispanic population. We find opposition to bilingual education among non-Hispanic Whites to be most pronounced in areas with substantial growth in an already sizeable Hispanic population, and least pronounced in areas of high growth rates and historically low proportions of Hispanics. Importantly, our results highlight the relevance of the interaction between minority group size and minority growth rates in generating majority opposition to bilingual education programs in the United States.

T1  - Diagnosing Discrimination: Stress from Perceived Racism and the Mental and Physical Health Effects
AN  - 1347782597; 201318647
AB  - Differences in health between racial groups in the United States are significant and persistent. Many studies have documented these differences as a result of a variety of different social factors. An emerging emphasis is the impact of racism in its various forms on physical and mental health. Social stress theory conceptualizes racism as a social stresssor which can produce negative health consequences for racial minorities. This study uses binary logit and negative binomial regression models of four items from the 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to test social stress theory and examine the relationship between stress symptoms from perceived racism and overall health (N=32,585). The effect of race on the experience of emotional and physical stress symptoms from racism is substantial. Furthermore, experiencing both emotional and physical stress from perceived racist treatment is an important factor in predicting the number of poor mental and physical health days, indicating that the experience of stress from perceived racism is related to overall poorer health.

T1  - Cultural Division Among Diasporic Nigerians: A Systemic Dilemma
AN  - 1429629517; 201335749
AB  - In my childhood, it was quite noticeable that distinctions between Yoruba, Edo, Ibo, and Hausa were minimal. At independence in the early 1960's, Nigeria's population stood at fifty-six million, compared to about 152 million today. Between 1960 and 2008, Nigeria, a multi-ethnic and multireligious nation with considerable development potential, fell into the ethnic clashes over distribution of scarce resources among competitive interest groups. Nigeria cultural divisions are very complicated phenomena. This essay reviews the degree of normlessness, alienation, powerlessness and cultural estrangement among diasporic Nigerians and how social dynamics, such as differentiated ideology and social distance, have affected the participation of ethnic minorities within their Nigerian counterparts. In addition, to a great extent, the cultural division faced by the diasporic Nigerians gradually increased bias among ethnic groups often against their own group interest.

T1  - What Is and Is Not Ethnocentrism? A Conceptual Analysis and Political Implications
AN  - 1283642557; 201303257
AB  - Conceptual analysis has not been systematically implemented in psychology, and many concepts have often been defined in different and contradictory ways. This article focuses on a conceptual clarification of ethnocentrism. It points out the conceptual confusion surrounding the term, reviews numerous definitions and operationalizations, and attempts to clarify it. Ethnocentrism is reconceptualized as a strong sense of ethnic group self-centeredness, which involves intergroup expressions of ethnic group preference, superiority, purity, and exploitativeness, and intragroup expressions of ethnic group cohesion and devotion. It is conceptually and empirically distinguished from other concepts, such as outgroup negativity and mere ingroup positivity. The article presents a theoretical framework and related empirical analyses supporting the usefulness of reconceptualized ethnocentrism. It also details important and unique implications of reconceptualized ethnocentrism for political phenomena. It is expected that reliance on the clarified reconceptualization should enable researchers to systematically study ethnocentrism, its origins, and consequences. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - White Perceptions of Whether African Americans and Hispanics are Prone to Violence and Support for the Death Penalty
AN  - 1322718937; 201313586
AB  - Objective: To explore whether the impact of racial and ethnic pejorative stereotypes and prejudice on White support for the death penalty changes over time. Methods: The data were drawn from the 1990 and 2000 General Social Surveys. This trend analysis included a four-item racial-ethnic prejudice scale and two stereotype or "typification" measures that assessed the extent to which the respondents believed that African Americans and Hispanics were more prone to violence than Whites. Controls were introduced for standard demographic measures and for known covariates of punitiveness, such as conservative political ideology and religious beliefs and involvement. The dependent variable was whether the respondents favored the death penalty for persons convicted of murder. Results: The analyses revealed that racial and ethnic prejudice increases Whites' embrace of capital punishment in both periods of time. By contrast, the negative stereotypes that typify African Americans and Hispanics as prone to violence exerted a significant impact on support for the death penalty in 1990 but not in 2000. Conclusions: These findings suggest that Whites' views on minority group members' proneness to violence potentially shift over time and exert significant impacts on death penalty support depending on the broader social context that prevails at a given historical juncture. Racial-ethnic feelings of animus appear to be a stable, if not intractable source of punitiveness. Future research should continue to unpack the complex nature of Whites' racial and ethnic views and to explore how, in given sociopolitical contexts, they potentially serve to justify punitive policy agendas.

T1  - Cultural Responses to Changing Gender Patterns of Migration in Georgia
AN  - 1766833762
AB  - In this paper, we explore how individual women cope with the tensions between economic forces encouraging temporary labour migration and cultural norms tying "proper" women to their homes and families. Combining in-depth interviews with returned migrant women in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi with secondary migration data for the region, we illustrate the recent increases in Georgian women's participation in international labour migration. Deteriorating economic conditions in Georgia leave women with few local opportunities to financially support their families, while institutional changes have altered the accessibility and attractiveness of international destinations, leading to increasing motivations and opportunities for women's migration. Focusing on the contradictions between growing female migration and persistent adherence to cultural norms stigmatizing migration in Georgia, we explore the cognitive strategies migrant women employ in an attempt to balance internalized perceptions of acceptable gendered behaviour with their migration choices. Two key pathways of adaptation emerge: framing migration as a necessity rather than a choice and stressing the unique and individually exceptional nature of their own migration experience. We posit that these strategies may serve to limit the norm-challenging nature of women's migration in Georgia. Although migration is often described as an empowering experience for women, if women migrants work to present their migration in a way that fits within the bounds of traditional gender norms, these norms may be strengthened rather than challenged.

T1  - (Re)scaling identities: Embodied others and alternative spaces of identification
AN  - 1448996396; 201342868
AB  - This article draws attention to life as an 'internal stranger' in the city, the nation and other spatial formations. It explores the habitability of the different spatial formations and the possibilities of identification for ethnic minority groups. Drawing on research on citizens in Copenhagen of Pakistani origin, the study employs theoretical ideas of estrangement, identification and recognition in order to obtain a thorough understanding of the complexity and the contradictory character of their spatial identities and affiliations. A turning point in the double processes of estrangement and identification is ambivalence in affiliation to the Danish nation expressing the discrepancy between feeling Danish and not being recognized as a full member of the Danish imagined community. This emotional ambivalence gives rise to what we call jumping scale in identification and a search for alternative spaces of identity.

T1  - Who defines humanity? Psychological and cultural obstacles to omniculturalism
AN  - 1283638808; 201303114
AB  - In this article we discuss the social-psychological limitations of using omniculturalism as a tool to improve intercultural relations between majority and minority groups. The omnicultural imperative suggests that intercultural interactions be framed in terms of human commonalities. This strategy might face severe psychological and cultural obstacles. Due to automatic mechanisms of ingroup projection, such framing might have adverse effects: People tend to construe their concepts of "humanity" based on their impressions about their own group. Such projection has been shown to have detrimental effects on intergroup relations, especially between groups differing in status (such as minority-majority relations). Psychological and anthropological evidence is provided to argue that the lay concept of "humanity" is often used as a tool of ingroup favouritism and discrimination. An extension of the omnicultural imperative is proposed-based on the indefinable character of humanity (inspired by Jahoda's remarks on the definition of culture and Wittgenstein's concept of family resemblance) and humananimal similarities.

T1  - Intergroup Relations among the Ethiopian Youth: Effects of Ethnicity, Language, and Religious Background
AN  - 1221408905; 201244154
AB  - This study examines the level of intergroup relations among Ethiopian university students coming from ethnically and religiously diverse backgrounds. The article conceptualized intergroup contact in terms of students' cross-group friendship. It investigates the extent to which intergroup contact is affected by attitude towards other ethnic (IEA) and religious (IRA) groups, their perceived cross-ethnic cohesiveness (CEC), ethnic-orientation, and patriotism. Data were gathered based on a survey of 188 students drawn from one of Ethiopia's public higher education institutions. The findings reveal that the majority of the students showed favorable attitude towards other ethno-cultural and religious groups, and attitude towards other ethnic groups (IEA) is found to be independent of one's ethnic background. Nevertheless, while cross-ethnic friendship is negatively affected by language difficulties, failure to make friends from religious out-group is associated with strong conformity with the teachings of the respective religions. Finally, the article forwards policy recommendations for increased intercultural understanding and improved intergroup relations.

T1  - The Impact of Education on Intergroup Attitudes: A Multiracial Analysis
AN  - 1364702546; 201323251
AB  - How does education affect racial attitudes? Past studies focus almost exclusively on whites' attitudes toward blacks, neglecting important minority populations. This study extends previous research by analyzing the effects of education on beliefs about racial stereotypes, discrimination, and affirmative action policies among whites, Asians, Hispanics, and blacks. Results indicate that whites, Hispanics, and blacks with higher levels of education are more likely to reject negative stereotypes, but these effects are less consistent among Asians. And, although education has consistent positive effects on awareness of discrimination against minorities, a more advanced education is not associated with greater support for racial preferences among any respondent group. Education is, however, related to more favorable attitudes toward race-targeted job training. These results are partly consistent with a revised group conflict perspective positing that education unevenly promotes different elements of the dominant racial ideology among nonwhite minorities, depending on their position in the racial hierarchy. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Not all prejudices are experienced equally: Comparing experiences of racism and sexism in female minorities
AN  - 1023028898; 201223700
AB  - Research exploring the perspectives of stigmatized people has examined general processes related to experiencing prejudice. Past work, however, has invoked the assumption that prejudices against different group memberships are experienced in a similar manner. Across three studies we directly compare experiences of racism and sexism among female minorities and show, in contrast, that people respond to different forms of prejudice in distinct ways. In Study 1 we examined the attributions invoked by Asian women to explain prejudice and discovered that participants made stronger internal attributions to explain racism than sexism. In Study 2 we investigated emotional reactions to prejudice and found that Asian women report experiencing more depression following a race-based rejection than a gender-based rejection. In Study 3 we observed that Asian women reported perceiving more racism than sexism in their environments. Implications for advancing theories of prejudice experiences are discussed.

T1  - MAPPING THE ACTIVISM OF ETHNIC AND NATIONAL MINORITIES IN POLAND
AN  - 1081863734; 201235264
AB  - For more than 40 years, minorities in Poland were deprived of the opportunity to publicly voice their demands and explicitly address mounting concerns over ethnic problems. For several decades, the ethnic presence in the public arena was restricted to a folkloric and apolitical facade. This article demonstrates that the tide of change brought about by the momentous year of 1989 has opened novel opportunities for minority groups. The article's objectives are twofold. First, it examines the boundaries of the national discursive structure in the minority rights area in Poland demonstrating that it is deeply embedded in Poland's history. Second, it explores the identity of actors who contributed to the debate in the field of ethnic politics in Poland and reveals that ethnic groups and state representatives are the most active players in the game when the regulation of minorities' social and political position in contemporary Poland is at stake. The article shows that using minority language as an auxiliary one in contacts with public authorities and the issue of topographic double-naming are major sources of political contention. On the other hand, it reveals that minorities address these topics by pushing for more rights in the contentious area of the auxiliary function of ethnic languages. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Exploring the self-directed anger of the stigmatized: The interplay between perceived legitimacy and social identification
AN  - 1907333123
AB  - Does social identification protect or harm targets of discrimination? Two studies (N = 52, N = 94) tested the prediction that perceived legitimacy moderates the impact of social identification on negative responses to discrimination. Results confirm that when discrimination is perceived as illegitimate, identification is negatively related to self-directed anger (buffering effect) because identification provides a feeling of in-group support. However, when discrimination is perceived as legitimate, identification is positively related to self-directed anger (exacerbating effect) because the internalized social identity is perceived as legitimate target for the negative treatment. Legitimacy is measured and manipulated among different low-status groups. The legitimization and internalization of discrimination driven by self-directed anger are discussed.

T1  - The education of ethnic minorities in Beijing
AN  - 1037875770; 201231082
AB  - This article investigates the operations of minority schools, and the subsequent on-the-ground experiences of ethnic minorities in Beijing at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels. The article suggests that the 'inter-sectionality' of ethnic identities, particularly minority-majority, rich-poor and urban-rural, must be factored in when examining the varying differences between minorities who have graduated from Beijing's minority schools and non-Beijing ethnic minorities, who have enrolled in the capital city's universities. The article draws upon recent statistical data, interviews with minority actors and public stakeholders, and participant observation in the city's schools and universities.

T1  - Internet use and online social support among same sex attracted individuals of different ages
AN  - 907925389; 201124624
AB  - The current research addressed age differences in internet use among Same Sex Attracted (SSA) individuals. In general, online communities are found to be a source of social support, especially for minority group members. However, it is unclear whether younger and older SSA people differ in their use of these communities. The present research examined age differences in use of online communities, hypothesizing that young SSA people primarily use these for social interaction and support, whereas older SSA people use online communities to seek sexual contacts. Study 1 examined age differences in motives to start using these websites. Study 2 examined age differences in use of online profiles and online social support. Results of both studies confirmed our hypotheses. Younger compared to older SSA people are found to receive more online social support, whereas older SSA use the internet more for sexual purposes. Our findings provide first time evidence of the relation between sexual orientation, age and internet use. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Multicultural attitudes among adolescents: The role of ethnic diversity in the classroom
AN  - 1910239670
AB  - In this study predictors of multiculturalism at the individual and classroom level are tested in a multilevel model. Previous studies attempting to find predictors of multiculturalism focused only on the individual level, possibly risking an attribution error. Multiculturalism is presented in this study as a notion stressing equal opportunities and minimizing discrimination as well as the conviction that the access to other cultures enriches ones own life. Using a sample of 448 adolescents from junior vocational education it was found that more ethnic diversity at the classroom level is positively related to adolescents' support for multiculturalism. As such, this study supports the intergroup contact theory.

T1  - Daily Encounters Between Hans and Uyghurs in Xinjiang: Sinicization, Integration or Segregation?
AN  - 887499780; 201118086
AB  - In September 2009, the Information Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China claimed that Xinjiang benefits from respect and harmony between the ethnic groups. This rhetoric is faithfully propagated by national media: they uniformly praise the unity amongst the Han and Uyghurs through the common slogans of minzu tuanjie (ethnic unity) and hexie guanxi (harmonious relations). Going beyond the official documents and propaganda, my purpose is to explore the relations between these two ethnic groups. I will focus on the ideas, words and actions of Han and Uyghur young people living in Urumqi who are often under-represented in official sources, or other forms of written and scholarly discourse. While comparing their behaviour, I argue that ethnic disharmony between Hans and Uyghurs exists, but it is simplistic to blame only the Chinese government or one of the ethnic groups, and naive to ask what China can do to solve the problem. Instead, by exploring what the social agents in the young educated society in Xinjiang truly think of ethnic relations between them and the "other," this paper presents a comprehensive picture of the issue. My ethnographic research interprets how people remember, interpret and sometimes exaggerate their ethnic traditions and cultural practices in daily life in relation to the other ethnic group. The findings demonstrate how young people are determining the course of ethnic relations by constructing movable social barriers that result in segregation between them, raising doubts about the future possibilities for ethnic harmony.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Evaluations of Race-Based Exclusion in Urban Minority Children and Adolescents
AN  - 1037881780; 201233465
AB  - There is a dearth of published research on the role of intergroup contact on urban US ethnic minority children's and adolescents' evaluations of racial exclusion. The current investigation examined these issues in a sample of low-income minority 4th, 7th, and 10th grade (N = 129, 60% female) African American and Latino/a students attending predominately racial and ethnic minority US urban public schools. Using individual interviews, participants were presented with scenarios depicting three contexts of interracial peer exclusion (lunch at school, a sleepover party, and a school dance). Novel findings were that intergroup contact was significantly related to low-income urban ethnic minority youth's evaluations of the wrongfulness of race-based exclusion and their awareness of the use of stereotypes to justify racial exclusion. Further, significant interactions involving intergroup contact, context, age, and gender were also found. Findings illustrated the importance of intergroup contact for ethnic minority students and the complexity of ethnic minority children's and adolescents' judgments and decision-making about interracial peer exclusion.

T1  - Responding to group-based discrimination: The impact of social structure on willingness to engage in mentoring
AN  - 1910226762
AB  - In two studies we examined women's willingness to engage in mentoring as a function of the perceived pervasiveness of gender discrimination and the appraised legitimacy of discrimination. In line with predictions, and confirming predictions from social identity theory, we found that perceiving discrimination against women to be illegitimate enhanced willingness to engage in mentoring when discrimination was seen to be pervasive compared to rare. In contrast, when gender discrimination was appraised as more legitimate, pervasiveness of discrimination attributions did not influence willingness to engage in mentoring. Study 2 provided evidence that the interactive effect of pervasiveness and legitimacy is explained by the extent to which mentoring is conceived of as support for collective goals. The results bring to the fore the impact of perceptions of the social context on women's responses to career-development initiatives.

T1  - Prejudice: rethinking geographies of oppression
AN  - 758129750; 201059867
AB  - Despite equal opportunities legislation in many western societies, overt prejudice against minority groups is still evident. Yet, despite the persistence of equality issues, 'prejudice' is a term that is not widely employed in geography because of its association with a particular history of meaning within social psychology. In this paper I explore the concept of prejudice and its relationship to geographical research on discrimination and oppression. Then using original empirical research in three communities I examine how prejudice is justified and articulated by majority people. In doing so, I explore the complex intersectionalities of negative attitudes towards specific minority groups and the ways that specific mechanisms of sub-ordination can reinforce and support one another.

T1  - Group Devaluation and Group Identification
AN  - 758122044; 201056998
AB  - In three studies, we showed that increased in-group identification after (perceived or actual) group devaluation is an assertion of a (preexisting) positive social identity that counters the negative social identity implied in societal devaluation. Two studies with real-world groups used order manipulations to show that the (perceived or actual) devaluation of an in-group led individuals to increase their identification with this in-group. Group devaluation most strongly and consistently increased individuals' satisfaction, rather than solidarity, centrality, or the other components of Leach et al.'s (2008) measure of identification. A third study showed that giving Black Britons the opportunity to identify with this in-group immediately after evidence of its societal devaluation reduced feelings of vulnerability (but not rejection). Although there was consistent evidence of the (perceived or actual) group devaluation ^1 group identification link, the group identification ^1 (perceived) group devaluation link was much stronger. Implications for theory and research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Sport events and ethnic reconciliation: Attempting to create social change between Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim sportspeople in war-torn Sri Lanka
AN  - 754045510; 201054214
AB  - Reconciliation is about bringing disparate communities together and creating the communication necessary to reduce intergroup barriers, generate understanding, and connect with others to achieve a peaceful togetherness. This article investigates the role of sport events in contributing to reconciliation and inclusive social change between disparate communities in ethnically divided Sri Lanka. Following an interpretive mode of enquiry, findings suggest that if strategically designed, sport events allow the establishment of interpersonal friendships and the creation of inclusive social identities along national lines, organizational lines, common interests and imagined factors. Events can create 'momenta of togetherness' for members of disparate ethnic groups and as such may contribute to positive social change and a sense of imagiNation. While sport events provide a starting point, booster and catalyst for positive social change and development on a community level, they need to be integrated into a larger agenda of socio-political support to make a significant contribution to reconciliation and peace in divided societies.

T1  - Patterns of cross-orientation friendships in high schools
AN  - 743043227; 201029457
AB  - Previous studies indicate that school friendship networks of sexual minority students (students with non-heterosexual orientations) consist mostly of straight peers, but little is known about these straight friends. This paper examines what background characteristics predict straight students' chance of having sexual minority friends by analyzing friendship nomination data from two large high schools included in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Straight females are more likely than straight males to have cross-orientation friendships particularly with sexual minority males. Like friendships among straight students, cross-orientation friendships show a strong homophilous tendency-straight students choose sexual minority friends within their grade levels, racial groups, and academic aptitude levels. Beyond homophily, white race and high levels of academic aptitude and parent education increase straight students' chance of having sexual minority friends in some gender combinations, consistent with previous research showing the links between these backgrounds and positive attitudes toward sexual minorities.

T1  - Race and Ethnic Representations of Lawbreakers and Victims in Crime News: A National Study of Television Coverage
AN  - 216935952
AB  - Research on racial-ethnic portrayals in television crime news is limited and questions remain about the sources of representations and how these vary for perpetrators versus victims. We draw from power structure, market share, normal crimes, racial threat, and racial privileging perspectives to further this research. The reported race or ethnicity of violent crime perpetrators and victims are modeled as functions of: (1) situational characteristics of crime stories and (2) contextual characteristics of television market areas. The primary data are from a stratified random sample of television newscasts in 2002-2003 (Long et al. 2005). An important innovation of our work is the use of a national, more generalizeable, sample of local news stories than prior researchers who tended to focus on single market areas. Results indicate that both the context of the story itself and the social structural context within which news stories are reported are relevant to ethnic and racial portrayals in crime news. We find limited support for power structure, market share, normal crimes, and racial threat explanations of patterns of reporting. Racial privileging arguments receive more extensive support.
