T1  - REACTION TO THE BLACK CITY AS A CAUSE OF MODERN CONSERVATISM: A CASE STUDY OF POLITICAL CHANGE IN OHIO, 1932–2016.
AN  - 2647095507
AB  - Social scientists in a variety of fields have long relied on economic-structuralist theories to understand the ascendance and hegemony of the modern Conservative Movement in the United States. In the materialist theory of political change (MTPC), structural crisis in the 1970s destabilized Keynesian-managerialism, and paved the way for neoliberalism. Key weaknesses of this approach include its relatively aspatial scope—comparatively less attention to the spatial variation of neoliberalism’s popularity—and its demotion of other elements of the Conservative Movement into a veritable super-structure of secondary movements. This paper offers a “racial amendment” to the MTPC, and an application to electoral geographies in the state of Ohio since 1932. This amendment synthesizes group threat theory, critical historiography, and Du Boisian theories of Whiteness to suggest that the growing influence of suburban conservatism is not reducible simply to class interest.

T1  - The effect of perceived threat on human rights: A meta-analysis: GPIR
AN  - 2621963473
AB  - Individuals express support for civil liberties and human rights, but when threatened tend to restrict rights for both others and themselves. However, the question of whether or not rights are restricted to punish others or protect ourselves remains unclear. This meta-analysis integrates the findings of the effect of perceived threats on support for restrictions of civil liberties from 1997 to 2019. It includes 163 effect-size estimates from 46 different articles involving 91,716 participants. The presence of threat increased support for restrictions against outgroup members significantly more than ingroup members, providing a possible punitive explanation for support for restrictions of civil liberties. These findings contribute to the debate on rights and their relationship with deservingness, suggesting that we delineate those who deserve human rights and those who do not.

T1  - The Evolution and Implications of Perceptions of Barack Obama's Ideological Positioning
AN  - 2586716349
AB  - I examine perceptions of Barack Obama's ideological positioning from 2006 to 2016. White Americans perceived Barack Obama to be significantly more liberal than respondents from other racial groups, and whites scoring higher on measures of racial resentment saw Obama as more liberal than those scoring lower. Perceptions of Barack Obama's ideological positioning shifted leftward early in his presidency but shifted rightward after 2010. This rightward shift notwithstanding, Obama was perceived to be quite liberal from the start of his presidency, and perceptions of his ideological positioning were racialized from the beginning. There is some evidence that citizens' perceptions of Barack Obama's ideological positioning became more racialized between 2012 and 2014. Placements of Hillary Clinton were racialized in 2016, suggesting that the Obama presidency may have lasting effects on the ideological stereotyping of Democratic candidates. I discuss these findings in light of recent research on social sorting, affective polarization, and negative partisanship.

T1  - Measuring the impact of diversity attitudes and practices of people without migration background on inclusion and exclusion in ethnically diverse contexts. Introducing the diversity attitudes and practices impact scales
AN  - 2563068657
AB  - Assimilation and integration processes have been studied widely and for many years, mainly by looking at the attitudes and practices of people with migration background. This article focusses on the mirror group: the people without migration background. Based on a literature review we propose a new model, the Diversity Attitudes and Practices Impact (DAPI) scales, to assess the impact they have on inclusion and exclusion in ethnically diverse contexts. We test the model using new data on Rotterdam, a superdiverse majority minority city with a large share of voters for anti-immigrant parties. Though the attention, both in research and in the public debate, is focussed on the rise of anti-immigrant sentiments in Europe and the United States, the outcomes of our DAPI-scales model demonstrate that, counter to what is expected, the most probable trend in Rotterdam is towards more socio-economic inclusion and more openness to cultural diversity.

T1  - Public perception of forest crimes: The case of Ilgaz Province in Turkey
AN  - 2545289908
AB  - The protection and sustainable management of forests are widely accepted and considered a solution for mitigating climate change. Although there are many variables concerning economic, political, social, and legal aspects in terms of forest protection, the main target is always focused on human behavior. Legal instruments are one of the most effective methods in regulating human behavior. Since illegal activities are often the most destructive human behavior, this study aims to examine the public’s perception regarding forest crimes: illegal logging, illegal transportation/smuggling, open land expansion, squatting, and arson. It has been explained in previous studies that legal regulations alone do not sufficiently prevent forest crimes. Although forest villagers themselves benefit greatly from healthy forests, it was determined that occurrences of criminal activity in forests are directly correlated with low-income levels, lack of awareness of laws and sanctions, low penalties on crimes, and a low level of education. Those administrations responsible for the management of forests need to identify the socio-economic needs of these groups and communities through social analysis within the parameters of SFM.

T1  - ‘Peasants are peasants’: Prejudice against displaced villagers in newly-built urban neighbourhoods in China
AN  - 2526045791
AB  - This article explores contemporary prejudice against displaced villagers in urban China, drawing on a project on urban sprawl in Yinchuan where rural villages are absorbed into the urban area. The research demonstrates that media discourses about chaiqian baofahu and suzhi that stigmatise displaced villagers are being actively reproduced in everyday life in newly built urban neighbourhoods. Urbanites’ prejudice against displaced villagers can be viewed as, on the one hand, a result of the feelings of relative deprivation from unfavourable comparisons with displaced villagers, while on the other hand, a response to maintain a positive ingroup identity – in this case, an urban and ‘civilised’ way of life. The article then examines the effectiveness of contact as a means for reducing prejudice, and reveals that intergroup contact in urban neighbourhoods does not necessarily create mutual understanding and trust. The article highlights the structural causes of prejudice and concludes by arguing for social transformation to challenge and reduce prejudice.

T1  - Supporting the Message, Not the Messenger: The Correlates of Attitudes towards Black Lives Matter
AN  - 2503359053
AB  - Since the Black Lives Matter movement’s rise to prominence, there has been significant opposition from both media and political figures who believe that the movement is promoting a “war on cops.” Because there is no evidence to support this claim, the current study examines the basis for negative attitudes towards Black Lives Matter using a sample of over 500 undergraduate students from a large Midwestern university. The findings indicate that the strongest predictors of negative attitudes towards Black Lives Matter are being white and holding symbolically racist attitudes. Perceiving the police to be equivalent to soldiers in a war on crime, perceiving police misconduct to be less common, and holding a conservative crime ideology are also significant in the model.

T1  - Who should be admitted? Conjoint analysis of South Korean attitudes toward immigrants
AN  - 2496989102
AB  - South Korea is slowly but steadily becoming a country of immigrants. In 1998, there were barely 300,000 foreign residents in South Korea. As of 2018, there were more than 2.3 million. The immigrant population has yet to reach 5% of the total population, but it is predicted to rise significantly in the years to come. Despite the increase in newcomers, it is not well understood who native South Koreans prefer as immigrants and why. Are immigrant attitudes motivated by co-ethnic solidarity, or are they primarily based on economic and sociotropic concerns? To isolate attitudes on these crucial questions, this research uses a conjoint experiment that simultaneously tests the influence of seven immigrant attributes in generating support for admission. Our results show that broad sociotropic concerns largely drive attitudes towards immigrants in South Korea, but an immigrant’s origin also matters. Prospective newcomers from culturally similar and higher-status countries who can speak Korean and have clear plans to work are most preferred. The research findings will be relevant to the comparative study of immigration attitudes, as well as to researchers interested in the specifics of the South Korean case.

T1  - Collateral Subjects: The Normalization of Surveillance for Mexican Americans on the Border
AN  - 2451349069
AB  - The U.S.-Mexico border has been of particular interest to the Trump administration in its ongoing efforts to restrict immigration. Though unauthorized immigrants are the purported targets of measures to increase border enforcement, U.S.-born individuals of Mexican descent also bear the consequences of nativist policies. Based on 42 in-depth interviews, I focus on late-generation (third-plus) Mexican Americans to analyze individuals’ experiences with surveillance by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Nogales and Tucson, Arizona. In this study, I explore the effects of anti-immigrant policies on Mexican Americans by examining how surveillance operates in people’s everyday lives as well as how people respond to the presence of surveillance. I find that the pervasiveness of surveillance elicits a mixture of fear and desensitization from residents, as they simultaneously grow accustomed to surveillance while navigating an ever-changing political terrain. Finally, I explore responses to the authority of immigration officers, which vary from strategies of compliance to strategies of resistance. These varied approaches are complicated by the liminal status of Mexican Americans in the United States as both a racialized group and a community that benefits from some of the privileges of holding U.S. citizenship.

T1  - Support for democracy and liberal sexual mores among Muslims in Western Europe
AN  - 2406161809
AB  - There is an on-going debate whether a ‘clash of civilizations’ exists between Islam and the West, in particular in relation to support for democracy and endorsement of liberal sexual mores. This study aims to explain Muslim minorities’ support for democracy and their attitude towards these mores by making a comparison with majority members and by considering the level of religiosity and sense of national belonging. Using data from four European countries (Belgium, Germany, U.K., Switzerland), we found that Muslims compared to majority members were less supportive of democracy and of liberal sexual mores. Furthermore, these differences could be explained by Muslims’ higher level of religiosity and weaker national belonging (for liberal sexual mores). These findings demonstrate that the so-called ‘clash’ is more prominent in the case of liberal sexual mores than democracy and that not only religiosity but also the development of a sense of national belonging is important.

T1  - Restricting immigration to foster migrant integration? A comparative study across 22 European countries
AN  - 2430674374
AB  - Elaborating a popular assumption about the effects of immigration policies on the integration of migrants, we argue in this article that more restrictive immigration policies lead to the selection of immigrants with greater integration potential, and that this selection should foster migrant integration. To test this argument, we combine country-level data from the Immigration Policies in Comparison (IMPIC) database with individual-level data on economic, political and social integration from multiple rounds of the European Social Survey (ESS) across 22 European countries. We show that, first, more restrictive immigration policies do not increase the likelihood of more educated migrants to be admitted, but they do make it more likely for migrants from European OECD countries to be admitted, while making it less likely for migrants outside the OECD. Second, we find that immigration policies affect some forms of economic, political and social integration outcomes, but mostly for immigrants from non-OECD countries. We conclude that immigration policies do affect integration outcomes but that these effects are small and limited to specific integration outcomes and migrants from specific regions. Our study, therefore, relativises the underlying popular assumption that immigration restrictions foster migrant integration, bearing important implications for the currently salient debates on immigration policy-making.

T1  - Out-Group Animus and Punitiveness in Latin America
AN  - 2407537466
AB  - The social threat perspective anticipates that members of racial/ethnic out-groups might be perceived as socially, politically, or economically threatening; criminally inclined; and in need of social control via the criminal justice system. In light of this framework, the current study examines the influence of out-group animus on punitive sentiments in the rarely explored context of Latin America. Data from the 2012 AmericasBarometer survey collected in nine countries (N = 15,145) are analyzed, and the findings indicate that animus against foreigners, Blacks, and the Indigenous is positively associated with support for punitive measures. These results lend support for the social threat perspective and provide further evidence that this relationship might be a cultural universal in societies characterized by racial/ethnic conflict.

T1  - Economic outlook and the gender gap in attitudes about climate change
AN  - 2411431856
AB  - Polling consistently shows that the USA is significantly polarized on the issue of climate change. Economic outlook and gender are frequently identified as two sources of this variation, as Americans often view the climate change issue as a tradeoff between economic and environmental risk, and women tend to express more concern than men about this issue. Much of the existing literature links the two by focusing on the role of economic outlook and worldview differences between genders to explain this gender gap. In short, economic concern overrides environmental concern, and males are more sensitive to economic concern, even with appropriate socioeconomic controls. However, little research has empirically investigated this interplay between gender and economic outlook. Using a large sample survey, this study investigates the relationships between economic outlook, gender, and support for climate change mitigation strategies. Findings suggest that economic outlook has a significant effect, and that it moderates gender effects. We find large gender effects among those who feel most economically vulnerable, but these differences dissipate as economic outlook improves.

T1  - Class Attitudes, Political Knowledge, and Support for Redistribution in an Era of Inequality
AN  - 2381951164
AB  - ObjectiveWhy, despite positive feelings toward the poor and working classes, relative to the rich and big business, has American public support for redistribution failed to appreciably increase during an era of high, and rising, income inequality?MethodsI argue that this puzzling disconnect is due, in part, to a lack of general political knowledge. Using survey data from the 2012 American National Election Study, I test how political knowledge conditions the relationship between people's economic class group attitudes and their support for redistribution.ResultsPeople with low (high) levels of political knowledge weakly (strongly) connect their class attitudes with support for redistributive spending and progressive taxation. Data from four ANES panel studies show that this does not result from the less knowledgeable holding weak “nonattitudes” toward these class groups. Rather, consistent with Converse's classic work, I attribute this to less knowledgeable individuals lacking awareness about how redistributive policies benefit different social groups.ConclusionThese findings help us to better understand an important puzzle in American politics: why a mass public that purports to favor the poor and working classes over the economic elite has not turned more strongly in favor of redistribution during an era of historic inequality.

T1  - Race and Politics: Predicting Support for 2016 Presidential Primary Candidates among White Americans
AN  - 2350140737
AB  - Using a sample of up to 859 white Americans in the United States, we examine how racial resentment, perceptions of discrimination toward majority and minority populations, white identity salience, and American identity salience influence support for five candidates running for President in 2016. Using data from the American National Election Studies 2016 Pilot Study, we find that racial resentment influences support for both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates, and white identity salience increases support for Trump and Clinton. Although policy issues, including the economy, health care, immigration, and terrorism, also shape attitudes toward political candidates, the effects of racial resentment and white identity salience persist. We conclude by arguing that America continues to be shaped by a white racial frame which views minorities as inferior and that this view is perpetuated through support for candidates who support white supremacy.

T1  - A Study of Cultural Empathy and Attitude toward Diversity: The Case of Australian Church Attenders
AN  - 2477270660
AB  - Australia's context is one of increasing ethnic and religious diversity. Intercultural communication is an everyday reality, with cultural empathy fostering intercultural competence. Yet ideas about belonging to Australia are complex and contested. This study addresses a paradox within the context of Christian churches. Church attenders have a high sense of belonging to Australia, which has been found in other studies to be negatively related to empathy. Yet, individuals have opportunities for intercultural contact within church settings, which is associated with positive intercultural relations and reduced prejudice. This study examines data from 1,700 participants (aged 15 years and over) in the 2016 National Church Life Survey to test relationships between empathy, attitude to diversity, and belonging to Australia, taking into account congregational ethnic diversity, levels of bonding, and country of birth. Results provide some evidence that culturally diverse congregations provide opportunities to foster cultural empathy. There was also an interaction between country of birth and belonging. Belonging and attitude to diversity were not related amongst attenders born in non-English speaking countries, but were negatively related amongst those born in English-speaking countries, despite opportunity for regular contact with outgroup members. Future work would benefit from improved measures of ethnicity and further understanding of how belonging and identity operates for different groups of Australians. Implications for church leaders are that while intercultural proximity alone may not be sufficient to foster positive attitudes towards diversity, positive interactions among perceived peers with shared goals may be more effective.

T1  - The value of reproduction: multiple livelihoods, cultural labor, and immigrants in Iowa and North Carolina
AN  - 2316331910
AB  - In the US South and Midwest, early immigrant populations consisted primarily of young, Latinos recruited to work in low-wage jobs. After six or seven years, family members from Mexico and Central America began joining early arrivals, changing the character of immigrant interactions with host residents and institutions. While many natives viewed the single men as migrant workers, important for economic services, the arrival of women and children stimulated ambivalent reactions in North Carolina and Iowa rural communities. This suggests that native perceptions of immigrants can be traced, in part, to immigrants' roles in local economies, including their participation in multiple livelihoods and their deployment of cultural labor. The contradiction between anti-immigrant sentiments and the need for immigrant labour can be understood as a reaction to increasingly precarious economic conditions facing both natives and immigrants in the twenty-first century and the changing values of productive and reproductive economies.

T1  - Latinos' connections to immigrants: how knowing a deportee impacts Latino health
AN  - 2311910725
AB  - This manuscript examines how personally knowing a deportee and/or undocumented immigrant affects the mental health of Latina/o adults. Utilising a new survey sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Center for Health Policy at the University of New Mexico (n = 1493), we estimate a series of logistic regressions to understand how personal connections to immigrants are affecting the mental health of Latinos using stress process theory. Our modelling approach takes into consideration the sociopolitical, familial, cultural, and personal contexts that make up the Latina/o experience, which is widely overlooked in datasets that treat Latinos as a homogeneous ethnic group. Our findings suggest that knowing a deportee increases the odds of having to seek help for mental health problems. The significance of this work has tremendous implications for policy makers, health service providers, and researchers interested in reducing health disparities among minority populations especially under a new administration, which has adopted more punitive immigration policies and enforcement.

T1  - Political inequality in America: Who loses on spending policy? When is policy less biased?
AN  - 2571083365
AB  - Rapid growth in America’s economic inequality and endemic disadvantages among racial minorities have deepened fears about unequal political influence. From separate studies, it appears that the government responds more to the wealthy and to whites. But critical questions remain unanswered. What are relative contributions of race and class to government responsiveness? Why do these inequalities exist in the first place? And under what contexts are disparities in responsiveness reduced? To answer these questions, we assess the congruence between individual-level policy preferences and policy outcomes using the General Social Survey. We match individual spending preferences in 11 policy areas with actual federal spending to see whose preferences are realized. We find that race, more regularly than class, shapes government responsiveness. We also find that Democratic Party control eliminates most of the racial bias in responsiveness. Economic growth also narrows racial inequalities.

T1  - Ideology and Deliberation: An Analysis of Public Support for Deliberative Practices in Finland
AN  - 2430088618
AB  - The introduction of deliberative practices has been proposed as a method for revitalizing representative democracies suffering from decreasing political involvement and increasing fragmentation (Dryzek, 2000; Grönlund, Bächtiger, & Setälä, 2014; Parkinson & Mansbridge, 2012). Some scholars, however, question whether citizens are willing to engage in deliberative practices (Bartels, 2003; Hibbing & Theiss-Morse, 2002; Posner, 2004). A related concern is that deliberative practices may not appeal equally to all groups of citizens, and consequently jeopardize the principle of inclusion of all relevant arguments and experiences in deliberation (Young, 2000). Whether deliberative practices can help revitalize democracy partly depends on the extent to which support for these practices is related to ideological predispositions. Previous studies suggest that ideological predispositions systematically influence individual attitudes toward public involvement in political processes (Bengtsson & Mattila, 2009; Dalton & Welzel, 2014; Inglehart, 1997; Kriesi, 2010). If a corresponding pattern were to be found for deliberative practices, the result could be detrimental to the deliberative focus on inclusiveness. An ideological bias among supporters might translate into overrepresentation of certain ideological perspectives in deliberative events. Furthermore, if support for deliberative practices depends on strong ideological predispositions, the prospective participants in deliberation are likely to behave like activists—eager to pursue their established goals by any means necessary (Mackuen, Wolak, Keele, & Marcus, 2010, p. 440)—rather than deliberative citizens, who are considerate, balanced, open-minded, and willing to compromise (Levine & Nierras, 2007; MacKuen et al., 2010). If the composition of deliberative events is ideologically unrepresentative, it can also result in harmful group composition effects that affect the final outcome (Baek, Wojcieszak, & Delli Carpini, 2012; Barabas, 2004; Gastil, Black, & Moscovitz, 2008). It is therefore important to establish how ideological predispositions shape attitudes toward the use of deliberative practices in society. Based on these considerations, we aim to study how support for deliberative practices is linked to ideological predispositions on the traditional left–right dimension and the nationalist–cosmopolitan values dimension. Jacobs, Cook, & Delli Carpini (2009) and Neblo, Esterling, Kennedy, Lazer, & Sokhey (2010) constitute a couple of pioneering studies that examine the willingness to deliberate in the United States, and show that politically marginalized groups are willing to deliberate (Neblo et al. 2010), and that self-identified liberals are more likely to engage in deliberation than people who consider themselves to be more conservatives (Jacobs et al. 2009). However, these studies are not necessarily applicable outside the American context. Moreover, Jacobs et al. (2009) restrict their analysis to a one-dimensional conceptualization of ideology that fails to capture contemporary ideological richness. We use the Finnish National Election Study from 2015 (FNES2015) to demonstrate that individuals who are left-leaning and/or adhere to cosmopolitan values support deliberative practices. In line with the work of Zaller (1992), we also find that political awareness furthers the ability to formulate opinions that are consistent with ideological predispositions.

T1  - Chronicle of a death foretold: The Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand and the 2017 election
AN  - 1983661167
AB  - The Green Party entered the 2017 election campaign from a position of relative strength. As shown in Table 1 and described in O'Brien (2013), recent elections had seen the Green Party capitalise on public dissatisfaction with the Labour Party (the main opposition party). They were able to expand their vote to breakthrough as a 'medium' rather than minor party, consistently polling over 10% and as high as 13% since early 2015 (see Figure 1). In the face of Labour's ongoing difficulties and the lack of other competitors for progressive votes, they were able to present themselves as a credible third force, effectively challenging the governing National Party. This transition had been accompanied with a stable message that associated action on environmental issues with broader areas of social justice and economic performance, their 2014 manifesto being framed around three messages or strands: "Cleaner environment', 'Fairer society' and 'Smarter economy'. A critical turning point came at the Annual General Meeting and campaign launch in July 2017. Highlighting the need for social welfare reform, Green co-leader Metiria Turei revealed that she had committed minor social welfare fraud as a sole parent in the 1990s. Intended to highlight the difficulties associated with surviving in poverty, this initially appears to have had little negative effect on the Green Party. Two subsequent opinion polls showed Green support increasingly slightly in one and significantly in the other (from 11% to 15%), with support from Labour continuing to decline. This led one former Green MP to claim that the Party was now attracting Labour's core supporters and was on track to grow even further (RNZ National 2017).

T1  - Professors-in-Training or Precarious Workers? Identity, Coalition Building, and Social Movement Unionism in the 2015 University of Toronto Graduate Employee Strike
AN  - 1979383717
AB  - In this article, I argue that graduate employees took on the political identity of precarious workers who face job insecurity and income insecurity, drawing attention to the casualization of work in the academic labor market in Canada, and the cost of undertaking graduate studies in Canadian universities. Their argument appealed to media, faculty, undergraduate students, and supportive media, which was key to building solidarity and public support for graduate employees' struggle. Building on social movement unionism literature, I show how this identity moved the debate away from the bargaining table and into broader coalition building, suggesting a broader social movement unionism among academic workers.

T1  - Why the Poor Support Populism: The Politics of Sincerity in Metro Manila
AN  - 1982170556
AB  - Why do the poor respond to some populist appeals and not to others? Populist support is largely attributed to a leader's "populist style." Populist style is seen as consisting of tactics aimed at cultivating popular identification. This explanation, however, cannot tell us why the poor discriminate among leaders employing similar tactics. This article considers the question with respect to the Philippine populist Joseph Estrada. It finds that the poor support Estrada because they perceive him to be sincere, or someone who cares about them beyond electoral considerations. They see him as sincere because his political performance engages their expectations and has proven coherent over time. The collective nature of their belief in Estrada's sincerity helps account for its objectivity, durability, and diffusion. The empirical case presents an opportunity to develop a more sophisticated account of populist style and to show that it depends as much on the political savvy of supporters as on the skill of leaders.

T1  - How Terrorism Affects Attitudes toward Democracy: Tunisia in 2015
AN  - 1961749289
AB  - Tunisia is the only country that emerged from the Arab Spring as a democracy. However, Tunisian democracy is threatened by political divisions, economic problems, and the threat of terrorist attacks. We shed light on Tunisia's democratic prospects by examining (1) the degree to which major terrorist attacks in 2015 influenced Tunisian public opinion on democracy and (2) the extent to which preference for a democratic system affected opinions on the prospects for democracy in Tunisia. We use data from three waves of a nationwide survey conducted just before and just after Tunisia's first major terrorist attack, and just after the country's second major terrorist attack. We demonstrate that after the attacks the Tunisian public became less favourable toward democracy and less optimistic that Tunisia would soon be ready for it. Such scepticism was widespread, affecting people who preferred democracy as much as those who did not. We conclude that the prospects for Tunisian democracy are more precarious than is sometimes assumed. Alternate abstract:La Tunisie est le seul pays du Printemps arabe à poursuivre une transition démocratique. Cependant, cette démocratie est menacée par des divisions politiques, des problèmes économiques et la menace d'attentats terroristes. Nous faisons la lumière sur les perspectives de la démocratie en Tunisie en examinant dans quelle mesure (1) les principales attaques terroristes en 2015 ont influencé l'opinion publique tunisienne sur la démocratie et (2) la préférence pour un système démocratique a influencé les opinions sur les perspectives de démocratie en Tunisie. Notre examen sera basé sur les données de trois phases d'une enquête nationale menée juste avant et juste après la première attaque terroriste majeure de la Tunisie, et juste après la deuxième attaque terroriste majeure du pays. Nous démontrons qu'après les attaques, l'opinion publique en Tunisie est devenue moins favorable à la démocratie et moins optimiste que le pays soit bientôt prêt pour elle. Un tel scepticisme était répandu, touchant autant les personnes qui préféraient la démocratie que celles qui lui étaient hostiles. Nous concluons que les perspectives de la démocratie en Tunisie sont plus incertaines qu'on le suppose parfois.

T1  - Changing Islam, changing the world: contrasting visions within political Islam
AN  - 1924047513
AB  - How do political Islamists, movements and thinkers view political change? To what extent do they promote violence as a means of bringing about change? Are they themselves willing to change and adapt to modern political systems? There is a wide array of movements in the Muslim world that grapple with these questions and as a consequence, numerous answers and disagreements. This paper will focus on three cardinal and contested issues: Is violence a legitimate means to bring about change? Is it legitimate to adopt Western political institutions? How should Muslim movements and regimes coexist with ancient political entities such as tribes and ethnic groups? By comparing and contrasting the political outlooks of the Muslim Brothers and the Salafi-Jihadis, the article highlights the ideological gaps between moderate and militant political Islam.

AB  - This paper explores how undocumented migrants have struggled and dealt with the UK inner borders while living in London. Based on empirical findings collected in London and Minas Gerais, it shows how Brazilians tactically adapt themselves in temporary dwellings to escape from the harsh British immigration policies and the Home Office raids across London. This study particularly uses the concepts of inner borders, deportation and citizenship discussed by contemporary Border studies. Living in a multicultural city where identity controls are a social practice that permeates various daily activities, Brazilians have to constantly negotiate their existence through the inner borders of London without being denounced by their lack of visa.Alternate abstract:Este artigo explora como migrantes não documentados lidam com as fronteiras internas do Reino Unido enquanto vivem em Londres. Através de dados empíricos coletados em Londres e Minas Gerais, demonstramos como brasileiros taticamente adaptam suas vidas em moradias temporárias para escapar das políticas migratórias do Reino Unido e das blitzes migratórias do Home Office em domicílios. Este estudo vale-se, particularmente, dos conceitos de fronteiras internas, deportação e cidadania discutidos por estudos de fronteira contemporâneos. Almejando viver em uma cidade multicultural, onde os controles de identidade são uma prática social que permeia o cotidiano, migrantes não documentados têm de negociar constantemente sua existência através das fronteiras internas de Londres para não serem denunciados por seu status migratório irregular.

T1  - Human Rights: What the United States Might Learn from the Rest of the World and, Yes, from American Sociology
AN  - 1844786825
AB  - The U.S. Constitution includes civil and political rights--as individual rights--but does not include what is internationally understood to be "human rights," namely rights we enjoy as equals, including economic, social, and cultural rights, and protections for vulnerable persons, such as children, minorities, mothers, and refugees. The United States has not ratified any international (United Nations) or regional (Organization of American States) human rights treaty, is not a party to the Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court, and is no longer a member of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. It might be concluded that Americans do not know what human rights are. It is more complicated than that. While opinion polls show that Americans often endorse individual rights--e. g., the rights of women--they do not frame them as being interdependent or being within the purview of government. Can we conclude that human rights have no place in the United States? Not at all. This article concludes by showing that many U.S. institutions of higher learning have programs in human rights and that some academic associations, including the American Sociological Association, recognize human rights.

T1  - Preferences in the Early Stages of Mate Choice
AN  - 1819909168
AB  - Romantic partnership is often considered an optimal barometer of intergroup relations. To date, however, it has been challenging to distinguish the characteristics people prefer in a partner from the types of partners that are locally available. Online dating presents a new opportunity to address this puzzle. In this paper, I use behavioral data from a popular online dating site to answer three questions regarding preferences in the early stages of mate choice: First, to what extent do people prefer similarity versus status in a partner -- and do these preferences vary by gender? Second, what is the relative importance of different types of preferences -- and to what extent are apparent preferences for one characteristic merely a "by-product" of preferences for another characteristic with which the first is correlated? Third, do preferences vary at different moments of selection -- and if so, how? These analyses not only provide a nuanced portrait of how interpersonal dynamics shape broader social structures -- here, a network of romantic ties -- but they recommend a future approach to mate choice that prioritizes processes over outcomes and more deeply engages the literature on gender, social networks, and symbolic boundaries.

T1  - Trust among recent immigrants in Canada: levels, roots and implications for immigrant integration
AN  - 1792708390
AB  - Generalised trust promotes social interactions and may well be a crucial component of immigrant integration. Recent immigrants in particular are likely to be viewed by themselves and others as 'outsiders' who are unfamiliar with the expectations and norms that structure day-to-day social interactions in the host country. This study relies on a unique combination of three sources of data all derived from World Values Surveys to examine levels of trust, and its sources, among newcomers in one country with a large immigrant population, Canada. The evidence indicates that recent immigrants to Canada make a clear distinction between trust in other people in general, and trust in Canadians in particular: the former is grounded in pre-migration cultural influences, while the latter is grounded in immigrants' experiences in the new host country. Moreover, the evidence suggests trust in Canadians is a crucial component of immigrant integration.

T1  - Beyond Jews of the Orient: A New Interpretation of the Problematic Relationship between the Thai State and Its Ethnic Chinese Community
AN  - 1810364177
AB  - "Jews of the Orient," the infamous and highly polemical article penned by King Vajiravudh Rama VI of Siam and first published in one of the nation's leading newspapers in 1914 has long been employed as the fundamental evidence of the innate anti-Chinese nature of Siam's particular brand of royalist nationalism. The general line of the argument based on the interpretation of Vajiravudh's infamous articles is the king singled out the ethnic Chinese -- known to be the largest ethnic minority as well as the dominant force controlling the Siamese economy -- as the national other against which Thai nationalism was to be defined and developed. The situation of the ethnic Chinese was not unlike the unfortunate position the Jewish Diaspora found themselves in in Europe in the late nineteenth century to early twentieth century. This line of explanation, however, is not only outdated, but also incorrect in many ways. The proportion of the ethnic Chinese population in Siam is much greater than that of the Jews in Europe and, perhaps more important, the Chinese in Siam were much more closely related to the ruling class. As G. William Skinner had elaborated, even during Vajiravudh's reign, Chinese ancestry made up more than half of the Chakri royal bloodline. In other words, the Chinese were the ruling class in Siam. This article argues that, instead of discriminating against the Chinese, the Siamese ruling classes replaced their Chinese identity with a new Anglicized/Americanized identity, which appeared to be the more modern and influential style of the late nineteenth century to early twentieth century. The Chinese merchants and entrepreneurs who made up most of the Siamese middle class were allowed to keep their Chinese identity provided that they clearly, and oftentimes overtly, expressed their absolute and undivided loyalty toward the crown. The lower-/working-class Chinese either assimilated with the majority or faced persecution for sedition of all sorts-- from republicanism and Bolshevism in Vajiravudh's reign to communism during the Cold War years. In reality, the Thai state's relationship with the ethnic Chinese community was more a class issue than a matter of ethnicity and, perhaps more interesting, the state's policy toward the ethnic Chinese changed very little despite the transformation of the state from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy through the People's Party Revolution of 1932.

T1  - All the labor problems fit to print: the New York Times and the cultural production of the U.S 'labor problem', 1870-1932
AN  - 1778483710
AB  - The period that spanned the Gilded Age to the onset of the Great Depression saw the rise and relative decline of the US labor movement. The salient events of labor movements over these years undoubtedly shaped public perception about labor issues, and some scholars have been attempting to unpack the mechanisms through which depictions and characterizations of the 'labor problem' were produced in authoritative venues that could have shaped the future of the movement. This study goes beyond the standard practice of explaining news report volume to feature the political valance of the reports on the labor problem over a 63-year time period. The aforementioned period also saw significant changes in news reporting practices, with the rise of objective informational writing and the embrace of journalism as a profession. The change within journalism itself could potentially shape the depiction of the labor problem, yet such change has been overlooked by existing literature pertaining to the topic. This research makes a theoretical case for integrating social processes central to the labor movement and journalism from 1870 to 1932 and explains patterns in the cultural production of the labor problem in the New York Times by analyzing these two tracks of history in conjunction using both qualitative and quantitative data.

T1  - Retirement migration and transnationalism in northern Mexico
AN  - 1784150992
AB  - This article examines the phenomenon of transnationalism among retired immigrants living in border areas of northern Mexico. Using in-depth interviews conducted with US retirees residing in Baja California, Mexico, we seek to examine how transnational aging is constructed through different practices, relationships, networks and exchanges between both cultures and countries. We analyse several analytical dimensions of transnationalism including social, economic, cultural, identity and belonging conditions. In particular, networks and exchanges among these elderly migrants are most frequently constructed across social and family networks, economic transfers, access to healthcare, and culture. Additionally, we find that these maintained transnational practices in northern Mexico parallel those of international retired migrants living in other parts of the world. However, we argue that the proximity to the US border enables and encourages many types of connections of varying intensities. Finally, we discuss the implications for future research linking transnationalism with international retirement migration.

T1  - Effects of Workers' Remittances and its Volatility on Economic Growth in South Asia
AN  - 1774373161
AB  - This study investigates the effect of workers' remittances and its volatility on economic growth of five South Asian countries by employing long time series data from 1975 to 2009. Cointegration results confirm a significant positive long run relationship between remittances and economic growth in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, but a significant negative relationship in Pakistan. Conversely, the volatility of workers' remittances has a negative and significant effect on economic growth in Pakistan, Indian, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, but a negative but insignificant impact in Nepal. All sensitivity analyses confirm that the results are robust. A less volatile inflow of workers' remittances is growth-enhancing for all countries. It is suggested that policy makers should make policies to reduce the transaction cost to welcome remittances into the region. Furthermore, countries like Pakistan should make the policies to discourage voluntary unemployment. 
Policy Implications 
This study show the positive effect of remittances on economic growth in India, Bangladesh, Sri-Lanka and Nepal. These countries should create friendly policies to reduce the transaction cost to ensure the continuous inflows of workers' remittances. 
Results indicate a negative effect of remittances on economic growth in Pakistan. Remittances are considered an uninterrupted source of income, which may increase voluntary unemployment, leading to decreased economic growth. The government should make policies to discourage this voluntary unemployment. 
Policymakers should create effective systems to ensure this inflow comes through formal financial channels for better control.

T1  - Immigrants as victims: Examining the function of assimilation
AN  - 1768596877
AB  - Research on victimization suggests that low self-control substantially increases the risk of victimization. Previous research has investigated the effect of low-self-control among a variety of samples. Seldom examined is the immigrant population. Because immigrants have become an important component of the U.S. population and are fast increasing in number, it is important to study their victimization experience. Immigrants possess different backgrounds and cultures, and they may have different levels of self-control and victimization experiences. In addition, immigrants undergo an assimilation process that may influence the association between self-control and victimization. Our results show that the association between low self-control and victimization is robust and valid among immigrants. Assimilation has an independent effect on victimization but does not influence this association.

T1  - Macro-conditions and immigrants' happiness: Is moving to a wealthy country all that matters?
AN  - 1770928688
AB  - Migrants look for a better life. In what kind of country will they live happiest? Many migrants aspire to move to wealthy countries, but non-economic factors might be important as well in making a country livable for migrants. This issue is addressed here by examining the impact of macroeconomic conditions and non-economic macro-conditions (good governance and a pleasant social climate) on immigrants' happiness in twenty European nations. We find that immigrants' happiness depends both on economic and non-economic macro-conditions. The social climate is especially important, particularly in terms of a positive attitude in society towards migrants. Our findings imply that the choice of destination country matters for migrants' happiness and that the discrepancy between migration motives and migration outcomes may constrain immigrants from maximizing subjective gains via migration.

T1  - Stakeholder citizenship: the complexities of Polish migrants' citizenship attachments in the context of the Scottish independence referendum
AN  - 1784139870
AB  - This article focuses on the experiences of Scotland's largest foreign-born minority group, namely Poles, in the run-up to the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. We draw on 20 in-depth interviews to explore our participants' intentions and justifications for voting (or not) in the referendum. We found that our participants tended to emphasise the jus domicili principle when justifying their eligibility to vote in the referendum. However, our participants extended the jus domicili principle in their justifications to also include the intention to stay in Scotland as a central aspect of their continuing stake in (and right to vote in the referendum to determine) Scotland's future. Through exploring our participants' justifications for voting in the referendum, we were able to examine and better understand how migrants constitute their citizenship through articulating their substantive attachments (social, economic and relational or familial) in their adoptive country and in their country of origin.

T1  - Economic Integration of Pre-WWI Immigrants from the British Isles in the Canadian Labour Market
AN  - 1760244858
AB  - This article provides new evidence on the economic assimilation of immigrants from the British Isles in Canada during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Using data from the 1901 and 1911 censuses and a pseudo-cohort methodology, we estimate both entry and assimilation effects. We find a non-negligible decline in entry earnings among successive cohorts of British and Irish immigrants, previously overlooked in the literature. Our estimates also reveal that the economic performance for Irish and older British arrival cohorts was better than previously reported. Overall, slow economic assimilation and sparse occupational mobility of immigrants have been a long-standing issue in the Canadian labour market.

T1  - The relation between societal factors and different forms of prejudice: A cross-national approach on target-specific and generalized prejudice
AN  - 1764861373
AB  - The goal of this paper was to investigate the generalizability of prejudice across contexts by analyzing associations between different types of prejudice in a cross-national perspective and by investigating the relation between country-specific contextual factors and target-specific prejudices. Relying on the European Social Survey (2008), results indicated that prejudices were indeed positively associated, confirming the existence of a generalized prejudice component. Next to substantial cross-national differences in associational strength, also within country variance in target-specific associations was observed. This suggested that the motivations for prejudice largely vary according to the intergroup context. Two aspects of the intergroup context -- economic conditions and cultural values -- showed to be related to generalized and target-specific components of prejudice. Future research on prejudice and context should take an integrative approach that considers both the idea of generalized and specific prejudice simultaneously.

T1  - Black Churches and Mental Health Professionals: Can This Collaboration Work?
AN  - 1752271679
AB  - African Americans reportedly have a greater severity of untreated mental health disorders than any other known racial group. History purports that African Americans are more likely to rely on the elders of their churches and their own spiritual beliefs, rather than seek support from mental health professionals. Due to past and present experiences with institutionalized racism in America, Black church leadership and their members have been apprehensive to collaborate with mental health agencies. This article explores how clergy of Black churches and leaders in mental health agencies may collaborate to provide culturally sensitive services for African Americans.

T1  - Changing Industrial Relations and Labor Market Inequality in Post-Crisis Korea
AN  - 1841296159
AB  - Since the Asian economic crisis in the late 1990s, Korea has developing one of the most unequal labor markets among OECD countries. The proliferation of nonstandard employment and the precarious working conditions of nonstandard workers have contributed to the polarizing labor market. Some of the main reasons to explain this change are the declining labor unions and the extremely fragmented bargaining structure with which the results of collective agreements have affected unionized workers only. Labor unions, once powerful, have been declining constantly and significantly since the early 1990s and their presence has increasingly been skewed toward the large-firm sector. Accordingly, Korean society has formed a strong public perception that unions, staying comfortably in a wealthy firm boundary, have protected exclusively their own members who are in a better position in the labor market and ignored others who are the vast majority of wage earners. This paper examines this view, the so-called the insider-outsider divide, of labor unions. It pays attention to the roles that labor unions have played in the processes of restructuring the country's post-crisis labor market. Using a brief description of the overall characteristics of post-crisis employment systems and a small set of case studies on the role of the unions in the period of major restructuring, I attempt to examine if (and to what extent) unions exclude periphery workers and thus take part in creating labor market segmentation.

T1  - Manufacturing Naxi's original ecological culture in contemporary China
AN  - 1784139934
AB  - (ProQuest: ... denotes non-USASCII text omitted)
For over a decade, original ecological (yuanshengtai[...]) has contested ethnic (minzu) as an influential framework in representing minority folk culture in Chinese official and popular media. This article explores the ideological implications of such a shift in the context of state-minority relationships. By examining Han elites' invention of the neologism and Naxi elites' adaptations, I argue that YST transforms local ethnic categories into a transethnic, translocal, and transnational concept, and therefore allows both the nation state and the minority groups to promote their own versions of ethnic identities. Compared to the antagonistic model between state domination and minority resistance, YST reflects a shift from minority political self-determination to cultural self-representation in the drastically changing global environments.

T1  - Chinese Muslims in Canada: a demographic profile and a preliminary test of ethnic saliency
AN  - 1784138844
AB  - To date, there has been little to no literature examining Chinese Muslim immigrants to Western nations. Recognizing the dearth of such literature, this research presents what appears to be the first-ever descriptive statistical picture of Chinese Muslims migrating to and residing in Canada. By examining how this immigrant population compares to and fares against non-Muslim Chinese and non-Chinese Muslims in Canada with Canadian census data in 1991 and 2001, the research provides preliminary analysis on the saliency of originating Chinese Muslim ethnicity in immigration outcomes. The current findings suggest that with the intersection of cultural and religious identities, Chinese Muslim may experience a different assimilation process compared to non-Muslim Chinese and non-Chinese Muslims.

T1  - Explicit and Hidden Racial Bias in the Framing of Social Problems
AN  - 1777916345
AB  - Many contested issues in the American public and political spheres are rooted in fundamentally differing views of the scope, causes, and consequences of social problems. This is certainly true for two major interrelated social problems with racial implications: crime and labor market inequalities. In the era since the civil rights movement made the open expression of racial bias less socially acceptable, however, public and political discussions of social problems with racial implications are often framed in purportedly race-neutral ways (Bonilla-Silva 2010; Schuman et al. 1997). Drawing on group position (Blumer 1958) and collective action framing (Benford and Snow 2000) perspectives and employing the 2008-2009 ANES Panel Study, the present work suggests an enduring influence of racial bias on the ways people understand these major social problems. In contrast to earlier eras, however, much of the contemporary role of racial bias is hidden. The current work employs an implicit measure of racial bias that is resistant to a social desirability bias (Payne et al. 2005) to reveal a more complete picture of the influence of racial bias on the way people perceive social problems -- even among those who explicitly deny possessing such biases. Specifically, this work reveals roles for both explicit and implicit racial bias in the way non-Hispanic whites identify the severity of problems, attribute blame for problems, and are motivated to concern around particular issues.

T1  - Minority Representation and Political Efficacy in Public Meetings
AN  - 1708518461; 201528701
AB  - Objective: The objective of this article is to address a chief criticism of public meetings in democratic society, a lack of minority representation. Further, it explores the issue of political efficacy and the extent to which it may differ between minority and nonminority citizens. Methods: These issues are analyzed through logistic and multiple regression models applied to the results of a random-sample telephone survey administered across the United States (N = 601). Results: Results indicate that members of one minority group, African Americans, are more likely to attend public meetings than whites. Further, no statistically significant differences between whites and Hispanics or other-race individuals were found. African Americans also reported higher levels of political efficacy than whites, while no statistically significant difference was found between whites and Hispanics or other-race individuals for this measure. Conclusion: Thus, public meetings are not necessarily fraught with a lack of minority representation, nor do minorities necessarily suffer from lower levels of political efficacy than whites. Findings indicate a potential for minority representation in public meetings. Thus, rather than dismissing public meetings as legally required rituals, there is reason to improve the methods used to mobilize attendance and facilitate two-way communication between citizens and government.

T1  - Preferences Toward Neighbor Ethnicity and Affluence: Evidence from an Inherited Dual Ethnic Context in Post-Soviet Tartu, Estonia
AN  - 1700675518; 201525254
AB  - In the post-Soviet era, cities in Central and Eastern Europe inherited a rather undifferentiated sociospatial urban landscape that contrasts with the highly segregated cities in Western Europe and North America. In the Soviet era, ethnic segregation emerged as migrants were prioritized in public housing allocation. The dissolution of the Soviet Union, however, changed the economic and political position of those in-migrants. This study explores how inherited segregation patterns have evolved in the city of Tartu, Estonia. We use data from (1) 1998, 2008, and 2013 municipal surveys about stated preferences with regard to residential settings for the two main ethno-linguistic groups in Estonia (the Estonian majority and the mainly Russian-speaking minority population), and (2) the 2000 and 2011 national census that allows us to track changes in actual segregation patterns. We study two dimensions of preferences and segregation-ethnicity and neighbor affluence-and apply bivariate probit regression for the analysis of stated preferences. We detect a stronger preference among the majority population to live in its own language environment compared to minorities. Minority avoidance attitudes were strongest immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union and restoration of Estonia's statehood; by the end of the 2000s the preferences of the two groups toward neighbor ethnicity converged. Members of the majority population, however, prefer affluent environments more than minorities do. Despite converging preferences, the actual levels of segregation have increased in Tartu. This suggests that socioeconomic differences drive patterns of ethnic segregation even when preferences with regard to ethnicity have become more tolerant. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ndorobo Notions of Relationship with Other
AN  - 1788298734
AB  - Among the Maa-speaking Ndorobo people on the southern Mau escarpment in Kenya, basic assumptions concerning Other are foundational for how an individual interacts with all that is outside of Self. In the course of field research in the Ndorobo homeland, three categories of significant Other were distinguished in Ndorobo world view. In this article these three Ndorobo categories of Other will be discussed with particular attention given to how these categories govern notions of relationship between Ndorobo and their classifications of Other. Classificatory distinctions are made between relationships of an individual Ndorobo with: (1) community Other (community in-group), (2) earthly Other (ethnic out-groups), and (3) supernatural Other (spirit beings).

T1  - Relationship Between the Public's Belief in Recovery, Level of Mental Illness Stigma, and Previous Contact
AN  - 1680155091; 201514630
AB  - Disbelief exits that individuals who have a mental health condition are able to recover and fully function in life. This study analyzed 1,437 adults from the 2006 General Social Survey. Structural equation modeling (1) examined the relationship between respondents' level of prejudicial attitudes and social distance (i.e., stigma) toward individuals who have a mental health condition and their belief in the potential of recovery (2) tested whether previous contact with an individual who received treatment was a mediator. Findings indicated that the belief in recovery led to lower levels of social distance. Prejudicial attitudes were found to be a predictor of one's level of social distance. Previous contact was not a mediator however; males, minorities and those with less education were less likely to have had previous contact. Results indicated a need to emphasize the probability of recovering from a mental health condition when developing target-specific stigma reducing strategies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Off white: colour-blind ideology at the margins of whiteness
AN  - 1667950810; 201509653
AB  - This study examines the relationship between racial contestation and colour-blind ideology adherence. Using the first nationally representative study to ask respondents directly about personal racial identity and external racial ascription, I compare the racial conceptualizations of contested and non-contested whites. Contested whites are individuals who identify racially as white, but who are perceived by others as non-white. Contested whites find themselves at the margins of whiteness, betwixt and between categories of racial dominance and racial marginalization. One might hypothesize that because contested whites are socially perceived as non-white, that they would be more aware of racial marginalization in social life, and would therefore exhibit more progressive racial views. However, this study finds that the opposite is true. Results of ordinal logistic regression analyses suggest that individuals placed at the margins of whiteness may seek to legitimate group membership as white by expressing similar and sometimes even amplified notions of colourblindness than their non-contested white counterparts.

T1  - Testing the Relationship between Nationalism and Racism: Greek-Cypriot Students' National/Ethnic Identities and Attitudes to Ethnic Out-groups
AN  - 1667951946; 201509635
AB  - This article builds on a growing body of research that shows an intrinsic but complex relationship between the concepts and the ideologies of nationalism and racism. In doing so, it investigates how different, meaningful national and ethnic in-group identifications of a dominant national/ethnic group (Greek-Cypriots) within a given national context (Cyprus) influence their perceptions of different, meaningful ethnic and racial minority out-groups. Logistic regression analysis of quantitative survey data with secondary school children (N = 738) in Cyprus shows that the relationship between national/ethnic in-group identifications and out-group perceptions varies according to the social and political relationships between particular national/ethnic in- and out-groups. The findings show that future research on the relationship between nationalism and racism should consider the overlap between and context specific nature of national and ethnic in-group identification processes and the historical, political relationships between different in- and out-groups.

T1  - Ethnic Differences in the Attitudes and Practice of Consanguineous Marriage among Kurds and Turks in Uromiyeh District, Iran
AN  - 1667952376; 201511895
AB  - Despite the spread of modern familial values and norms and the rapid pace of modernization in Iran, kinship marriages remain a common practice among some ethnic groups, including Turk and Kurd. This study is informed by modernization and development idealism theories to examine factors associated with the practice and attitude of Kurdish and Turkish women to consanguineous marriage, utilizing data from a representative sample of 768 evermarried women residing in the district of Uromiyeh in Iran. The results indicated that consanguineous marriage was more prevalent among Kurds rather than Turks, and Kurdish rather than Turkish women held more positive orientations to consanguineous. Multivariate results showed that being a Kurd than a Turk was strongly associated with the likelihood of practicing kinship marriage and having positive attitudes to consanguineous marriage, while the levels of modernization and development idealism showed no or weak association. The results suggest that ethnic belonging can reinforce consanguineous marriage regardless of being modernized or holding modern development ideals. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Traits and Roles in Gender Stereotypes: A Comparison between Moroccan and Spanish Native Samples
AN  - 1535959661
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Social Roles of Men and Women in Spain: Emerging Issues and Implications for International Research              This study examines gender role attitudes and attitudes toward "man" and "woman" in two native samples from Spain and Morocco. The samples were made up of 400 participants, 200 in each country, containing the same number of men and women and selected with a similar procedure. We expected differences based on the independent variables of nationality, gender and educational level. The Spanish sample, female and student participants were predicted to present more egalitarian gender role attitudes and more positive attitudes toward "woman" than participants in the Moroccan sample, male and non-student participants. Overall MANOVAs were used to show the differences in gender role attitudes and attitudes toward "man" and "woman". Results confirmed the role of the nationality variable in the expected way. The Spanish sample showed a more egalitarian view and more favorable attitudes toward "woman" than the Moroccan one. Educational level and gender showed significant effects on the Moroccan sample but only partially. Moroccan student females and non-student males presented a more egalitarian view than non-student females and student males respectively.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ethnic identity on display: West Indian youth and the creation of ethnic boundaries in high school
AN  - 1559006027; 201432010
AB  - The black immigrant population in New York City has grown exponentially since 1990, such that West Indians now compose the majority of the black population in several neighbourhoods. This article examines how this ethnic density manifests among youth in high school, and how it has influenced ethnic identity formation among second-generation West Indians. My findings are based on twenty-four interviews and eight months of participant observation in two Brooklyn high schools from 2003 to 2004. The results show that in both schools, Caribbean island identities have become a 'cool' commodity within peer groups. Further, although it was important to express pride in one's island identity, these young people often blurred their national origin boundaries by drawing on Jamaican popular culture as way of projecting a unified 'West Indian identity'. The research also uncovers evidence of a de-stigmatization of Haitianness as a way to incorporate them as cultural insiders into the larger Caribbean collective. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnicity everywhere and nowhere: a critical approach towards parsing ethnic and non-ethnic processes
AN  - 1551001625; 201429040
AB  - This article has two parts. First, it presents Andreas Wimmer's framework for comparative ethnic boundary making as a way of disentangling ethnic and non-ethnic processes. Wimmer's framework helps avoid the persistent tendency among researchers to attribute ethnic causes to ethnic patterns of inequality. Second, it focuses on how these insights can be applied to the US case, a nation that arguably pays a lot of attention to ethnicity and where ethnic cultures are often seen as the driver of differences in educational success and mobility between ethnic groups. The article sheds light on how this understanding can be complicated through existing and further research along Wimmerian lines. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Patterns in Account-Giving among White Collar Criminals
AN  - 1520336638; 201411562
AB  - Using Swedish entrepreneurs' own explanations, this article searches for the possible regularities in the accounts offered by white collar offenders and for the underlying factors that produce these regularities, tracing in particular the impact of these offenders' attitudes toward regulation and taxation as well as their perceptions of the functioning of the market in which they operate. The results show that justifications are more common among offenders who have a clearly negative view on both factors. Excuses, on the other hand, are more frequently used by those who hold a positive attitude toward taxation and regulation. The results also show that offenders who offer excuses tend to share the same negative perception of the market as the 'justifiers.' This unanticipated finding suggests that the 'excusers' commit their offenses because they believe that the unlawful behaviors of the relevant others disturb the functioning of the market mechanism and thereby push them toward criminality.

T1  - Autonomous Selves in a Bureaucratised World: Challenges for Mardu and Wiradjuri
AN  - 1494751077; 201402083
AB  - Different histories and ecologies separate the Mardu of the Western Desert from the Wiradjuri of rural New South Wales, yet both evidence a desire for a social autonomy grounded in the value both place on personal autonomy. This claim flies in the face of assumptions that distinctive intra-Aboriginal values and practices collapse in the undermining of the cosmological framework of the Dreaming. The Wiradjuri, although they stayed in country, could not sustain their cosmological understandings in the face of huge transformations in the interests of pastoralism. Yet Wiradjuri historical experiences reproduced socio-economic conditions within which understandings of personhood and sociality could be maintained. They have lived within a dual economy: their allocative economy articulating with capitalism in ways that continued to inform Wiradjuri persons. These conditions have been severely constrained by welfare dependency and bureaucratic control-for Mardu as well as Wiradjuri. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - ATTITUDES TOWARDS MUSLIMS ARE MORE FAVORABLE ON A SURVEY THAN ON AN IMPLICIT RELATIONAL ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE (IRAP)
AN  - 1718067479; 201530636
AB  - Sugar ingestion bolsters cognitive resources, which should improve ability to inhibit expressing socially undesirable responses on explicit measures, including surveys. In this study, undergraduates drank regular or diet root-beer, then completed an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) followed by an Anti-Muslim Prejudice Scale (AMPS). The IRAP indicated neutral attitudes about Muslims and positive attitudes about Westerners. However, the AMPS indicated significant pro-Muslim attitudes. There was no significant effect of drink on the AMPS. However, participants who drank regular root-beer showed stronger anti-Muslim bias on the IRAP. Increased bias following sugar ingestion may reflect a discrepancy between implicit and explicit measures. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnicity, socioeconomic characteristics and knowledge, beliefs and attitudes about HIV among Yunnanese Chinese, Hmong, Lahu and Northern Thai in a north-western Thailand border district
AN  - 1700675390; 201525249
AB  - Data from ethnically diverse north-western Thailand with recent migrants from Myanmar (Burma) and China allow testing of hypotheses concerning between- and within-community differences in predominantly Yunnanese Chinese, Hmong and Lahu ethnic minority villages versus ethnic majority Thai villages. Topics include knowledge of HIV transmission, prevention and treatment, avoidance of people infected with HIV and constraints to use of health services. Respondents include women with one or more children under age five and their husbands/partners. Ethnicity is consistently associated with socioeconomic characteristics, knowledge of HIV transmission, prevention and treatment, avoidance of people living with HIV and AIDS, and constraints to use of services. Chinese community residents had the lowest levels of knowledge of HIV, especially with regard to mother-to-child transmission, the most intent to avoid contact with people living with HIV and AIDS, and the highest levels of constraints to using services, including ineligibility for government healthcare and limited Thai language ability. Associations of counselling with Thai language ability, and more knowledge and less avoidance of people living with HIV and AIDS, suggest that language-appropriate health education may help overcome disparities.

T1  - Citizenship Rights of Gypsies in Turkey: Roma and Dom Communities
AN  - 1448992485; 201342908
AB  - This article compares two different Gypsy communities, the Roma community in Edirne and the Dom community in Diyarbak(dotless i)r, in terms of their access to citizenship rights (civil, social, political and cultural). The main argument is that in Turkey the Roma community has more access to citizenship rights than the Dom community due to the fact that the Roma community lives with Turks, the ethnic majority in Turkey, whereas the Dom community lives with Kurds, who are the majority in Diyarbak(dotless i)r but a minority group in Turkey. Further, the Roma community has closer connections with state and transnational space. The article explains how for both communities ethnicity is a common barrier to benefiting from full citizenship rights and why the equality principle of citizenship is ruptured for both communities.

T1  - Heterosexuals' Attitudes Toward Transgender People: Findings from a National Probability Sample of U.S. Adults
AN  - 1357002397
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Intersections of LGBT, Racial/Ethnic Minority, and Gender Identities              Using data from a national probability sample of heterosexual U.S. adults (N=2,281), the present study describes the distribution and correlates of men's and women's attitudes toward transgender people. Feeling thermometer ratings of transgender people were strongly correlated with attitudes toward gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals, but were significantly less favorable. Attitudes toward transgender people were more negative among heterosexual men than women. Negative attitudes were associated with endorsement of a binary conception of gender; higher levels of psychological authoritarianism, political conservatism, and anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity; and lack of personal contact with sexual minorities. In regression analysis, sexual prejudice accounted for much of the variance in transgender attitudes, but respondent gender, educational level, authoritarianism, anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity remained significant predictors with sexual prejudice statistically controlled. Implications and directions for future research on attitudes toward transgender people are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 1520331108; 201413449
AB  - This article examines correlates of social trust and tolerance within a high-violence context. The authors study first the extent to which friendship ties that cross ethnic boundaries are associated with specific interaction spaces (neighborhoods, workplaces, civil society organizations, and political parties) and, second, the extent to which interethnic friendships are associated with trust and tolerance. Using individual-level data on interethnic contacts collected in 2006 in the two northern Iraqi cities of Erbil and Kirkuk, the authors show that people who spend time within ethnically heterogeneous interaction spaces are considerably more likely to have friendship ties that cross ethnic group boundaries and, in turn, also to express general social trust, interethnic trust, and tolerance toward outgroups.

T1  - THE RACIAL INCORPORATION OF LATINOS INTO THE U.S. MAINSTREAM
AN  - 1429637938; 201335753
AB  - For the last decade, scholars have pondered how the changing ethnoracial demographics of the United States would influence the country's racial, social, political, cultural, and economic landscape. Latinos are now the country's largest ethnoracial minority and the 2012 election provided an indication of just how significant this group will be for shaping the future of the United States. Scholars of race in particular have speculated how the ethnic and racial diversity of Latinos will change existing U.S. racial dynamics with some arguing that the historical Black/White binary will remain intact with Latinos falling on one or the other side of the binary. Yet, other scholars suggest that the Black/White binary will shift to a Black/non-Black binary in which Blacks will remain at the bottom of the U.S. ethnoracial hierarchy while Asian Americans and Latinos will be grouped with Whites. Going even further, another set of scholars argues that the size of the Latino population and its more fluid racial boundaries will trigger a Latin-Americanization of U.S. race relations such that Whites will remain at the top of the hierarchy, with Blacks and a few other lower-socioeconomic-status (SES) minority groups at the bottom while there will be an intermediate group between, "the Honorary Whites," that consists of mixed-race individuals and higher SES Asians and Latinos.

T1  - Xenophobia among Youngsters: The Effect of Inter-Ethnic Contact
AN  - 1417520513; 201331831
AB  - This study examines xenophobic attitudes of secondary school pupils in the Netherlands. This study builds upon a previous research in three ways. First, attitudes of pupils from both the ethnic majority and minority groups are examined. Second, the impact of positive as well as negative inter-ethnic contacts both within and outside the school environment is determined. Finally, hypotheses about inter-ethnic contacts are tested while simultaneously reckoning with alternative mechanisms that might explain xenophobic attitudes. Cross-classified multilevel regression analyses show that the level of xenophobia is lower when pupils evaluate their inter-ethnic contacts as positive, and higher when they perceive these contacts as negative. However, the impact of positive inter-ethnic contact in class disappears or even reverses when multiculturalism is more emphasized during lessons. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The attitudinal consequences of thought suppression: A focus on thinness thoughts
AN  - 1773421261
AB  - Four studies examined whether thought suppression could enhance attitude accessibility and whether behaviours that are consistent with the more accessible attitudes would follow. Thinness was examined as the attitude object. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that suppression of positive thoughts about thinness increased the accessibility of the positive attitudes associated with thinness. Experiments 3 and 4 showed that suppression of positive thinness thoughts also elicited more health-promoting behaviours. The implications of the findings for attitude accessibility and the practical consequences of thought suppression are discussed.

T1  - To pay or not to pay? Do extrinsic incentives alter the Kohler group motivation gain
AN  - 1364701233; 201323142
AB  - The Kohler effect is an increase in task motivation that occurs in performance groups when one is (a) less capable than one's fellow group members, and (b) one's efforts are particularly indispensable for group success. Recently, it has been shown that the Kohler effect can dramatically increase one's motivation to exercise. The present study examines the potential moderating effect of the provision of extrinsic incentives on such Kohler motivation gains. When participants were offered such an extrinsic incentive for persisting at an exercise task, a robust Kohler effect was observed-participants who thought they were the less capable member of a dyad working at a conjunctive-group exercise task persisted 26% longer than comparable individual exercisers. But an even stronger effect (a 43% improvement) was observed when no such incentive was on offer. Possible explanations and boundary conditions for this moderating effect are discussed.

T1  - Community Cohesion Policies and Meaningful Interactions: Ethnographic Reflections on Gender and Interethnic Relations in Northern England
AN  - 1417522131; 201331908
AB  - Since 2001, community cohesion has become central to discussions, policies and practices concerned with encouraging interaction between different ethnic groups in the UK. Discursively at least, it has signalled a shift from earlier race relations policies aimed at promoting multiculturalism. This paper examines policies of community cohesion alongside an exploration of interethnic and intercultural encounters within everyday spaces. Drawing upon two pieces of ethnographic research in the North of England, we draw attention to the ways in which 'mixing' is gendered and consider this in terms of the opportunities created for meaningful interactions.

T1  - Foreigners and Outsiders: Exclusionist Attitudes towards Labour Migrants in Israel
AN  - 1315601669; 201307677
AB  - This paper examines theoretical propositions regarding the social mechanisms that produce hostility and discriminatory attitudes towards out-group populations. Specifically, we compare the effect of perceptions of socio-economic and national threats, social contact and prejudice on social distance expressed towards labour migrants. To do so, we examine exclusionary views held by majority and minority groups (Jews and Arabs) towards non-Jewish labour migrants in Israel. Data analysis is based on a survey of the adult Israeli population based on a stratified sample of 1,342 respondents, conducted in Israel in 2007. Altogether, our results show that Israelis (both Jews and Arabs) are resistant to accepting and integrating foreigners into Israeli society. Among Jews, this is because the incorporation of non-Jews challenges the definition of Israel as a Jewish state and poses a threat to the homogeneity of the nation. Among Arabs, this is probably due to threat and competition over resources. The meanings of the findings are discussed within the unique ethno-national context of Israeli society and in light of sociological theories on ethnic exclusionism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Intergroup bias toward "Group X": Evidence of prejudice, dehumanization, avoidance, and discrimination against asexuals
AN  - 1283641062; 201303101
AB  - Although biases against homosexuals (and bisexuals) are well established, potential biases against a largely unrecognized sexual minority group, asexuals, has remained uninvestigated. In two studies (university student and community samples) we examined the extent to which those not desiring sexual activity are viewed negatively by heterosexuals. We provide the first empirical evidence of intergroup bias against asexuals (the so-called "Group X"), a social target evaluated more negatively, viewed as less human, and less valued as contact partners, relative to heterosexuals and other sexual minorities. Heterosexuals were also willing to discriminate against asexuals (matching discrimination against homosexuals). Potential confounds (e.g., bias against singles or unfamiliar groups) were ruled out as explanations. We suggest that the boundaries of theorizing about sexual minority prejudice be broadened to incorporate this new target group at this critical period, when interest in and recognition of asexuality is scientifically and culturally expanding.

T1  - When nasty breeds nice: Threats of violence amplify agreeableness at national, individual, and situational levels
AN  - 1347783381; 201318578
AB  - Humans have perennially faced threats of violence from other humans and have developed functional strategies for surviving those threats. Five studies examined the relation between threats of violence and agreeableness at the level of nations, individuals, and situations. People living in countries with higher military spending (Study 1) and those who chronically perceive threats from others (Study 2) were more agreeable. However, this threat-linked agreeableness was selective (Studies 3-5). Participants primed with threat were more agreeable and willing to help familiar others but were less agreeable and willing to help unfamiliar others. Additionally, people from large families, for whom affiliation may be a salient response to threat, were more likely than people from small families to shift in agreeableness. Returning to the national level, military spending was associated with increased trust in ingroup members but decreased trust in outgroups. Together, these findings demonstrate that agreeableness is selectively modulated by threats of violence. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - I, me, mine: Automatic attentional capture by self-related stimuli
AN  - 1315600242; 201307350
AB  - Drawing on decades of research suggesting an attentional advantage for self-related information, researchers generally assume that self-related stimuli automatically capture attention. However, a literature review reveals that this claim has not been systematically examined. We aimed to fill in this dearth of evidence. Following a feature-based account of automaticity, we set up four experiments in which participants were asked to respond to a target preceded by a cue, which was self-related or not. In Experiment 1, larger cuing effects (faster reaction times to valid versus invalid trials) were found with a participant's own name compared with someone else's name. In Experiment 2, we replicated these results with unconscious cues. Experiment 3 suggested that these effects are not likely driven by familiarity. In Experiment 4, participants experienced greater difficulties from having their attention being captured by their own compared with someone else's name. We conclude that attentional capture by self-related stimuli is automatic in the sense that it is unintentional, unconscious, and uncontrolled. Implications for self-regulation and intergroup relations are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Ambassadors of gender equality? How use of pair forms versus masculines as generics impacts perception of the speaker
AN  - 1315600232; 201307423
AB  - Although the use of gender fair language is strongly promoted in German-speaking countries, the impact of its use on the way speakers are perceived by others is still unknown. Results of two experimental studies showed that irrespective of their sex, speakers using pair forms rather than generic masculines were perceived more competent by both men and women. Also, they were seen as less sexist by male and female listeners with positive attitudes towards linguistic equality. Findings with respect to the attribution of warmth were more complex: they were not only impacted by language use, but also dependent on speaker's sex and listener's attitude towards linguistic equality. Results are discussed in the context of language and stereotypes. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - The Sexual and Racial Contradictions of Neoliberalism
AN  - 1373427021; 201328572
AB  - In this article, the authors define neoliberalism as the current stage of racial capital that emerged after the worldwide liberation movements of the mid-twentieth century. The approach highlighted in this article observes neoliberalism's relationship to sexuality as one characterized by the accumulation of various racial projects, an accumulation that produces the political and economic conditions for inciting and regulating racialized gender and sexual formations. That is, the authors understand neoliberalism to denote the extension of recognition, validation, and legitimacy in ways that depend upon the simultaneous extension of exacerbated dispersals of death and devaluation.

T1  - The Stigmatization and Resilience of a Female Indigenous Mexican Immigrant
AN  - 1125218651; 201240373
AB  - This case study examines the autobiographical writing and interviews of Lupe, an Indigenous Mexican immigrant, at multiple times in her life. The case study is contextualized within social, historical, psychological, and institutional spaces both in the United States and in Mexico. Consequently, Lupe's journey is an example of how stigmatization and discrimination are critical issues affecting the educational experiences of immigrant adolescents in American schools. The case study, however, is also evidence of an immigrant youth's perseverance, the factors that positively influenced her resilience process, and her ability to overcome the stigma placed on her throughout her education. Currently this college educated, Mexican, Indigenous women works as a teacher for a school with a predominantly low-income, Latina/o immigrant population.

T1  - America's Shifting Color Line? Reexamining Determinants of Latino Racial Self-Identification
AN  - 1221414189; 201244164
AB  - Objectives: Latinos are the nation's largest minority group and will double in size by 2050. Their size coupled with the fact that Latinos do not constitute a separate race raises questions about Latinos' incorporation into the U.S. racial hierarchy. This article explores patterns of Latino racial identity formation, examining the determinants of racial identity. Methods: Using the 2006 Latino National Survey, I estimate multinomial logit and ordered probit models of identification choices. Results: Latino racial identity is strongly associated with several factors, including socioeconomic status, measures of perceived discrimination and commonality, and measures of acculturation/assimilation. Most Latinos have a broader, more complex understanding of race. Furthermore, some Latinos do believe that they occupy a unique position in the racial hierarchy. Conclusions: The results suggest that the color line W. E. DuBois argued has long divided our nation may eventually shift. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Beauty, Ethnicity, and Age: Does Internalization of Mainstream Media Ideals Influence Attitudes Towards Older Adults?
AN  - 958727213
AB  - Mainstream North American media promotes the message that attaining a thin, youthful appearance is central to a woman's value and social role while appearing older is highly undesirable. However, appearance ideals and attitudes toward aging differ substantially across cultural and ethnic groups, which may influence the degree to which one internalizes media ideals and holds anti-aging attitudes. Consequently, this study examined the relationships between internalization of the youthful, thin-ideal appearance perpetuated by mainstream North American media and attitudes toward the elderly in a sample of 281 undergraduate females under the age of 30 attending a university in the Western United States. Specifically, European American (n=115), Asian American/Pacific Islander (n=74), Hispanic/Latina (n=52), and African American (n=42) women voluntarily completed self-report measures of internalization of media ideals and attitudes towards older adults. Attitudes towards the elderly were significantly more negative at higher levels of internalization of North American appearance ideals, independent of ethnicity. These data suggest that internalization of North American appearance ideals perpetuated by media are related to negative attitudes towards older adults. Future research should investigate the influence of negative attitudes about aging on behaviors toward older adults or one's own aging process.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - In perfect harmony: Synchronizing the self to activated social categories
AN  - 1347785859; 201318462
AB  - The self-concept is one of the main organizing constructs in the behavioral sciences because it influences how people interpret their environment, the choices they make, whether and how they initiate action, and the pursuit of specific goals. Because belonging to social groups and feeling interconnected is critical to human survival, the authors propose that people spontaneously change their working self-concept so that they are more similar to salient social categories. Specifically, 4 studies investigated whether activating a variety of social categories (i.e., jocks, hippies, the overweight, Blacks, and Asians) increased associations between the self and the target category. Whereas Studies 1 and 2 focused on associations between stereotypic traits and the self, Studies 3 and 4 examined self-perceptions and self-categorizations, respectively. The results provide consistent evidence that following social category priming, people synchronized the self to the activated category. Furthermore, the findings indicate that factors that influence category activation, such as social goals, and factors that induce a focus on the interconnectedness of the self, such as an interdependent vs. independent self-construal, can impact this process. The implications of changes to the working self-concept for intergroup relations are discussed. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - The Impact of Slavery on Racial Inequality in Poverty in the Contemporary U.S. South
AN  - 1347783319; 201318848
AB  - Despite Civil Rights legislation, racial inequality persists, especially in the context of poverty. This study advances the literature on racial inequality and the Southern legacy of slavery by examining slavery's relationship with inequality in poverty. I analyze county-level U.S. Census data using regression and spatial data analysis techniques. I find the 1860 slave concentration is related to contemporary black-white inequality in poverty, independent of contemporary demographic and economic conditions, racialized wealth disparities and racial threat. My research suggests the importance of slavery for shaping existing U.S. racial inequality patterns. Insights derived from this research, including the formulation of legacy as a place-based, continuous phenomenon that is distinct from racial threat, provide the basis for future research on legacy's mechanisms.

T1  - The Electoral Consequences of Skin Color: The "Hidden" Side of Race in Politics
AN  - 1315602296; 201307739
AB  - Despite the significant role that skin color plays in material well-being and social perceptions, scholars know little if anything about whether skin color and afrocentric features influence political cognition and behavior and specifically, if intraracial variation in addition to categorical difference affects the choices of voters. Do more phenotypically black minorities suffer an electoral penalty as they do in most aspects of life? This study investigates the impact of color and phenotypically black facial features on candidate evaluation, using a nationally representative survey experiment of over 2000 whites. Subjects were randomly assigned to campaign literature of two opposing candidates, in which the race, skin color and features, and issue stance of candidates was varied. I find that afrocentric phenotype is an important, albeit hidden, form of bias in racial attitudes and that the importance of race on candidate evaluation depends largely on skin color and afrocentric features. However, like other racial cues, color and black phenotype don't influence voters' evaluations uniformly but vary in magnitude and direction across the gender and partisan makeup of the electorate in theoretically explicable ways. Ultimately, I argue, scholars of race politics, implicit racial bias, and minority candidates are missing an important aspect of racial bias. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Minority Political Participation at the Local Level: The Roma
AN  - 1030866625; 201227704
AB  - This article aims to study the existing models of political representation of the Roma minority in Slovenia. The research analyses two existing models of political participation, namely, the political representation model employed in 2002 and the policy formation model introduced in 2007. As the state is limited in securing adequate representation of minority groups in an electoral democracy, conditions for minorities to have equal opportunity and to be effectively involved in public life must be created. This can be achieved with representation in advisory and decision-making institutions such as elected bodies and assemblies of national minority affairs; local and autonomous levels of administration; self-administration by a national minority in aspects concerning its identity, especially in circumstances where autonomy on a territorial basis does not apply; and decentralised or local forms of government. Based on surveys conducted in 2004 and 2008 we have tried to identify trends in the performance of the political representation model. The research work has made some interesting findings with regard to the relationship between the two models. It appears that the political representation model acts as a platform for positive change while the policy formation model is a source of conflict among Roma representatives.

T1  - Beyond Anti-Muslim Sentiment Opposing the Ground Zero Mosque as a Means to Pursuing a Stronger America
AN  - 1322723702; 201312345
AB  - Americans' opposition toward building an Islamic community center at Ground Zero has been attributed solely to a general anti-Muslim sentiment. We hypothesized that some Americans' negative reaction was also due to their motivation to symbolically pursue a positive U.S. group identity, which had suffered from a concurrent economic and political downturn. Indeed, when participants perceived that the United States was suffering from lowered international status, those who identified strongly with the country, as evidenced especially by a high respect or deference for group symbols, reported a stronger opposition to the "Ground Zero mosque" than participants who identified weakly with the country did. Furthermore, participants who identified strongly with the country also showed a greater preference for buildings that were symbolically congruent than for buildings that were symbolically incongruent with the significance of Ground Zero, and they represented Ground Zero with a larger symbolic size. These findings suggest that identifying group members' underlying motivations provides unusual insights for understanding intergroup conflict. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - An ethnic polarization index is a measure of the extent to which individuals in a population are distributed across different ethnic groups. The objective of this article is to develop some characterizations of the Reynal-Querol (RQ) index of ethnic polarization using alternative sets of independent axioms. A generalized form of RQ is also characterized. Some implications of the axioms are investigated as well. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Ethics of Immigration Policy
AN  - 1323839444
AB  - The Ethics of Immigration Policy

              
This article concerns the normative basis for immigration policy. In particular, I consider the implications of three fundamental liberal values, namely democracy, liberty and equality. First, I argue that democratic theory seriously questions the right to national self-determination when it comes to immigration. This is because potential immigrants may be coercively affected by immigration policy and, on a standard account of democratic legitimacy, this implies that potential immigrants should have democratic influence on such policies. In particular, I defend these claims against David Miller's defence of national self-determination. Second, I consider the importance of the right to freedom of movement and argue, again against Miller, that this right constitutes a weighty consideration in favour of allowing immigration in many cases. Third, I consider the importance of equality. In particular, I consider an argument for restrictive immigration policies, according to which immigration threatens to undermine social cohesion and so the basis for the welfare state. I challenge this argument in two respects. First, I point out that the empirical evidence for the claim that ethnic diversity undermines the welfare state is not as clear as some have assumed. Second, I point out that this argument for restrictive policies assumes that equality has domestic rather than global scope. Finally, I suggest that even if we are global egalitarians, we should aim for something less than (completely) open borders. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Racial diversity and change in metropolitan neighborhoods
AN  - 887501266; 201118112
AB  - This study investigates the changing racial diversity and structure of metropolitan neighborhoods. We consider three alternative perspectives about localized racial change: that neighborhoods are bifurcating along a white/nonwhite color line, fragmenting into homogeneous enclaves, or integrating white, black, Latino, and Asian residents into diverse residential environments. To assess hypotheses drawn from these perspectives, we develop a hybrid methodology (incorporating the entropy index and majority-rule criteria) that offers advantages over previous typological efforts. Our analysis of 1990-2000 census tract data for the 100 largest US metropolitan areas finds that most neighborhoods are becoming more diverse and that members of all groups have experienced increasing exposure to neighborhood diversity. However, white populations tend to diminish rapidly in the presence of multiple minority groups and there has been concomitant white growth in low-diversity neighborhoods. Latino population dynamics have emerged as a primary force driving neighborhood change in a multi-group context. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Social representations of the Holocaust and Jewish Israeli identity construction: insights from identity process theory
AN  - 896167475; 201120258
AB  - This study explores how a group of young Israeli Jews understood and defined their ethno-national identities, focusing upon the role of social representations of the Holocaust in the construction of Jewish Israeli identity. Eleven individuals were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule. Transcripts were subjected to interpretative phenomenological analysis. The analysis was informed by identity process theory and social representations theory. Three superordinate themes are reported, entitled: (i) 'perceptions of the Holocaust as a personal and shared loss'; (ii) 're-conceptualising the Holocaust and its impact upon intra-/intergroup relations'; and (iii) 'the Holocaust as a heuristic lens for understanding the Israeli-Arab conflict'. The data suggest that awareness of social representations of the Holocaust may enhance the belonging and continuity principles of identity, in particular. It is argued that the maintenance of national ingroup security constitutes a source of (group) continuity. Implications for psychological well-being are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Secondary transfer effects from imagined contact: Group similarity affects the generalization gradient
AN  - 875716804; 201115251
AB  - An experiment examined the effects of imagining contact with an illegal immigrant on attitudes towards illegal immigrants and subsequent effects of that attitude change on feelings about other groups (secondary transfer). Compared to a condition in which participants imagined negative contact with an illegal immigrant, participants who imagined positive contact reported more positive attitudes concerning illegal immigrants. Using bootstrapped mediation models, effects of positive imagined contact on attitudes towards illegal immigrants were shown to generalize to other groups that were independently ranked as similar to illegal immigrants, but not to dissimilar groups. This generalization gradient effect was relatively large. Implications for theory and practical applications to prejudice reduction are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - On the Meaning, Measurement, and Implications of Racial Resentment
AN  - 862595901; 201109602
AB  - A new racism, it is claimed, has become a dominant feature of contemporary American politics. According to the theory's originators, the new racism has largely replaced the old racism, which was based on the alleged biological inferiority of blacks. The new racism, referred to as "symbolic racism" or more recently, "racial resentment," by contrast, is defined as a conjunction of anti-black feelings and American moral traditionalism. According to its proponents, this new racism now structures and dominates the racial thinking of whites generally. Howard Schuman has suggested, however, that the index used to measure racial resentment may be fundamentally flawed because it may be conflated with the measurement of attitudes toward racial policies. The authors' analysis supports Schuman's suggestion. They conclude that racial resentment is not a valid measure of racism, which raises questions about the extent to which a new racism now dominates the thinking of white Americans.

T1  - Negativity and Outgroup Biases in Attitude Formation and Transfer
AN  - 919905251; 201201562
AB  - In an initial experiment, the behavior of one person had a stronger influence on implicit evaluations of another person from the same group when (a) the attitude was negative rather than positive and (b) the people were outgroup members rather than ingroup members. Explicitly, participants resisted these attitude transfer effects. In a second experiment, negative information formed less negative explicit attitudes when the target was Black than when the target was White, and participants were more vigilant not to transfer that negative attitude to a new Black person. Implicit attitudes, however, transferred to both Black and White targets. Positive information formed stronger positive explicit attitudes when the target was Black than when the target was White, and that evaluation transferred to another Black person both implicitly and explicitly. Even when deliberately resisting outgroup negativity in attitude formation and transfer, people appear unable to avoid it implicitly.

T1  - Race, Punishment, and the Michael Vick Experience
AN  - 902083244; 201122304
AB  - Objective: The relationship between race and crime has been contentious, focusing primarily on offending and incarceration patterns among minorities. There has been some limited work on public perceptions of criminal punishment, and findings show that while minorities believe in the role and rule of law, they simultaneously perceive the justice system as acting in a biased and/or unfair manner. Two limitations have stalled this literature. First, research has focused mainly on criminal punishments to the neglect of noncriminal punishments. Second, most studies have not examined whether race remains salient after considering other demographic variables or discrimination and legitimacy attitudes. Methods: Using data from 400 adults, we examine how race affects perceptions of criminal punishment and subsequent reinstatement into the National Football League in the case of Michael Vick, a star professional quarterback who pled guilty to charges of operating an illegal dog-fighting ring. Results: Findings show that whites are more likely to view Vick's punishment as too soft and that he should not be reinstated, while nonwhites had the opposite views. Race remained significant after controlling for other variables believed to be related to punishment perceptions. Conclusion: Attitudes toward both criminal punishment and NFL reinstatement vary across race such that there exists important divides in how individuals perceive the system meting out punishment and subsequently reintegrating offenders back into society. These results underscore that white and nonwhites perceive the law and its administration differently. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Direct Democracy and Minority Rights: Same-Sex Marriage Bans in the U.S. States
AN  - 902080282; 201122271
AB  - Objectives: A common critique of direct democracy posits that minority rights are endangered by citizen legislative institutions. By allowing citizens to directly create public policy, these institutions avoid the filtering mechanisms of representative democracy that provide a check on the power of the majority. Empirical research, however, has produced conflicting results that leave the question of direct democracy's effect on minority rights open to debate. This article seeks to empirically test this critique using a comparative, dynamic approach. Methods: I examine the diffusion of same-sex marriage bans in the United States using event-history analysis, comparing direct-democracy states to non-direct-democracy states. Results: The results show that direct-democracy states are significantly more likely than other states to adopt same-sex marriage bans. Conclusion: The findings support the majoritarian critique of direct democracy, suggesting that the rights of minority groups are at relatively higher risk under systems with direct democracy.

T1  - Sex, Lies, and Stereotypes: HIV Positive Black Women's Perspectives on HIV Stigma and the Need for Public Policy as HIV/AIDS Prevention Intervention
AN  - 887499955; 201118152
AB  - Despite startling rates of HIV among African American women -- it is the leading cause of death among women ages 25-34 years old -- HIV positive Black women's perspectives on prevention remain understudied. HIV Positive African American women's perspectives and stated concerns about effective HIV prevention, as informed by their lived experience and situated knowledge, were obtained in this study. Learning from these women, and giving attention to their lived experience and situated knowledge could help us improve and better understand HIV prevention challenges. Interview data was drawn on 30 HIV positive Black women in a Florida inner-city. The major finding suggests, that in addition to gender, race, and class oppression, stigma, stereotypes and ineffective public policies shape HIV prevention efforts. Another finding was relatively novel: Black women's strategies to subvert oppression can be dismantled by HIV/AIDS stigma, which alienate them from their symbiotic (sometimes life sustaining) "sista" circles; and the threat of being marginalized within a minority group can elicit a decision to forego HIV/AIDS prevention. Participants' experiences advocate for holistic social and structural prevention intervention (non-behavioral approaches) to HIV/AIDS. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Coming to terms with inequality and exploitation in an African state: researching disability in Sierra Leone
AN  - 835111639; 201100447
AB  - In this article, I describe how during my anthropological research in post-conflict Sierra Leone with a disabled community, I was confronted by experiences of inequality and exploitation. Many disabled people had previous disabling contact with other researchers, organisations and journalists. Others described difficulties surviving the disabling socio-economic conditions and were not viewed as 'development' partners, despite the fact that their images and stories had played a big role in the rebuilding and 'healing' of the Sierra Leonean nation state. I ask whether we as researchers and an international community are still not colluding with structures and institutions that exploit disabled people in post-conflict and post-disaster countries.

T1  - Seeing for the state: the role of social scientists in China's ethnic classification project
AN  - 818801600; 201072312
AB  - This article proposes a new understanding of the Ethnic Classification project (minzu shibie) undertaken in China's southwesternmost province of Yunnan in 1954 - a project in which social scientists and Communist Party cadres set out to determine which of the dozens, if not hundreds, of minority communities in the province would be officially recognized by the state. Specifically, this article argues that ethnologists and linguists played a far greater role in the Classification and early Chinese Communist governmentality than is typically assumed. The Chinese Communists did not teach themselves how to 'see like a state,' to use James Scott's formulation, at least not when it came to the fundamentally important problem of ethnic categorization. To the contrary, the history of the Classification project is one of an inexperienced Chinese state that was able to orient itself only by observing the world through the eyes of its social scientific advisors. The 'mentality' within early Chinese Communist Party (CCP) 'governmentality' was, in the case of the 1954 Ethnic Classification, in large part the mentality of the comparative social sciences.

T1  - Accumulating Disadvantage: The Growth in the Black--White Wage Gap Among Women
AN  - 754038710; 201049701
AB  - Between 1980 and 2002, the black--white wage gap among women tripled, climbing steadily despite improving economic conditions in the 1990s. Relative distribution analysis shows an increasingly dense accumulation of black women's wages in the lowest deciles of white women's wage distribution over time. Although the transition to an 'office economy' rewarded both black and white women with wage gains, white women reaped greater benefits. During the 1990s, black managers and professionals lost ground relative to white women, but also relative to other black women workers. Regardless of the economic climate, then, black women accumulated disadvantage, suffering most in the chilly economic climate of the 1980s, and benefiting least during the economic expansion of the 1990s.

T1  - Can perceptions of similarity reduce the ability to see the other's needs? The case of immigrant students' integration policy
AN  - 1417522638; 201332065
AB  - In this age of wide migration waves all over the world, when schools' populations become more diverse, educators often make policies regarding groups of immigrant students (from the same origin) with unique needs. Perceptions of homogeneity of the group, as well as perceptions of similarity between the decision maker and the group members are likely to have a major influence on these policies. Although research has shown that perceptions of great similarity between the decision maker and a target group enhance empathy and promote decisions in favor of the group; results of the current research, examining immigrant students' integration policy in schools, suggest that inaccurate high similarity perceptions (on a relevant domain) might decrease the ability to understand the targets' diverse needs and may lead to decisions that do not serve the group, or the decision maker's goals. Two studies were conducted to examine the effect of perceived homogeneity and similarity on immigrant integration policy in schools. In the first study, lay people recommended fewer programs for immigrants students when those where judged to be more similar to themselves and more homogenous. Similar results were obtained in the second study, examining school principals' reports of existing programs for immigrant students in their schools. Implications on policy making are discussed.

T1  - 'Reasonable accommodation' in Quebec: the limits of participation and dialogue
AN  - 754044619; 201053351
AB  - This article explores the Bouchard-Taylor Commission, a 2007-8 government consultation that was established in Quebec to study interculturalism, secularism and national identity, in response to what had become known as the 'reasonable accommodation debates' on the extent to which minority and immigrant cultural practices could be accommodated. The focus of this exploration is on two aspects of the Commission: the citizens' forums that were a part of its deliberative process; and the ways in which it responded to the idea of crisis. Through an analysis of aspects of the Commission's final report, the ways in which the Commission was structured and the media representations of the Commission, this article argues that, despite the spirit of equality and fairness to which the commissioners were committed and the praise it received from some members of immigrant and minority groups, the Commission ended up reinforcing the racialised hierarchies and exclusions that it wanted to redress.

T1  - What Do You Mean by "European"? Evidence of Spontaneous Ingroup Projection
AN  - 1928266841
AB  - The ingroup projection model posits that group members project ingroup features onto a superordinate category. The present research aimed at isolating the cognitive underpinnings of this process. If ingroup projection is a spontaneous cognitive process, a superordinate category prime should facilitate the processing of the ingroup prototype rather than the outgroup prototype. Three studies support this hypothesis by comparing subliminal semantic priming in two different populations, an intra- versus intergroup situation, and with an ingroup prototype manipulated by changing the intergroup context. Results indicated that the superordinate category prime facilitated the processing of ingroup rather than outgroup traits (Experiment 1) and that these traits depended on the particular content of the ingroup prototype made salient by different contexts (Experiments 2 and 3). The findings indicate that the cognitive representation of the superordinate category is based on ingroup traits and that this representation is context dependent.

T1  - When Inequality Matters: The Effect of Inequality Frames on Academic Engagement
AN  - 743059294; 201044766
AB  - Research indicates that, among women and ethnic minorities, perceived inequality reduces the association between self-esteem and academic outcomes. The present studies demonstrate that the perception of social inequality does not always induce subordinate-group disengagement. Rather, inequality framed as dominant-group advantage allows subordinate groups to remain engaged and causes dominant groups to disengage. Experiments 1-3 demonstrate that academic inequality framed in terms of ingroup disadvantage causes Black, Latino, and female students to disengage, but inequality framed in terms of White or male advantage does not. Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrate the same effect for Whites and men-inequality framed in terms of the ingroup (i.e., advantage) causes disengagement, but inequality framed as outgroup disadvantage does not.

T1  - Causes, Challenges and Prospects of Brain Drain: The Case of Eritrea
AN  - 743052364; 201031829
AB  - While there is little doubt that highly skilled workers in many Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are scarce, it is also true that many highly trained professionals have left LDCs to go and work in the developed world. The latter, known as the 'brain drain,' or simply human capital flight, is not at all a new phenomenon; it has only become more pronounced in recent years. This paper delves into the causes, challenges, and prospects of the phenomenon of the 'brain drain' in LDCs, by taking Eritrea as a case study. In so doing, it demonstrates that deteriorating economic conditions, lack of good governance and political instability are the root causes of the 'brain drain' in LDCs such as Eritrea. The paper also highlights the impact of the 'brain drain', and suggests some of the measures that may be put in place by governments of LDCs in order to redress the situation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Reassessing the Communist Takeover in Romania: Violence, Institutional Continuity, and Ethnic Conflict Management
AN  - 1928595768
AB  - This article analyzes the communist takeover in Romania as the successful outcome of a long-term policy aiming to make the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) a national force. Such an attempt deserves a new analytical explanation of the highly controversial notions of institutional continuity and of "nationalization" of its membership. While mainstream explanations still focus on factors of change motivated by external (Soviet) pressure and stress that violence, coercion, and intimidation have been main instruments used by the Communist Party to implement its goals, the author argues that a reevaluation of the real extent of popular support is needed. PCR became a national mass party immediately after the coup d'état of 23 August 1944. At that time a marginal political force, traditionally ruled by non-Romanian elements and devoted to the strictest internationalism, turned national without falling into discrimination against minority groups, with the exception of the Germans. In multiethnic Transylvania the ethnic power balance consciously created by PCR with Soviet assistance helped the party to strengthen its political legitimacy among different national and social groups. Unlike the Romanian historical parties and the Hungarian nationalists, the PCR and the Petru Groza--led coalition government behaved as a transnational body and pursued integrative policies. In the troubled context of postwar reconstruction, this call for cooperation and peaceful ethnic coexistence distinguished the PCR and its allies from the opposition parties and significantly contributed to make early communist rule more acceptable to large masses of Romanians and non-Romanians, as well.
