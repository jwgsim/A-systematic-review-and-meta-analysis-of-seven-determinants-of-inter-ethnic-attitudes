T1  - Rental discrimination, perceived threat and public attitudes towards immigration and refugees
AN  - 2647922071
AB  - There is still little research about the association of anti-immigrant attitudes with ethnic discrimination. In this study we investigate whether there is more rental discrimination against ethnic minorities in Belgian municipalities with more negative attitudes and higher perceived threats toward immigration and refugees. For this purpose, we merged unique data from correspondence tests with the aggregated attitudes in 44 municipalities. There was profound discrimination against candidates with Moroccan names by both private landlords and realtors. In contrast to theoretical expectations there was not more ethnic discrimination in municipalities with more negative attitudes or higher perceived threats. However, it appears that rental candidates – irrespective of their ethnic origin – are less likely to be invited in municipalities with higher threats and more negative attitudes.

T1  - A social virus: Intergroup dehumanization and unwillingness to aid amidst COVID-19 − Who are the main targets?
AN  - 2667854074
AB  - Previous studies have shown that external threats, such as financial crises and natural disasters, might fuel negative attitudes, emotions, and behaviors towards outgroup members. However, it is unclear what types of outgroups are likely to be targeted when an external threat is taking its toll. In this study, we examine two types of outgroups that might be at risk of becoming victims of intergroup hostility. The first is the "ultimate scapegoat" outgroup which has a long history of negative relations with the ingroup. The second is the "context-dependent" outgroup which is viewed as an outgroup only in certain contexts. We utilized the COVID-19 crisis and the highly diverse social makeup of Israeli society to explore the extent to which each type of outgroup would be targeted. Results from our study (N = 664), conducted during the first peak of COVID-19 in Israel, show that higher levels of exposure to COVID-19 predicted lower willingness to aid outgroups and that outgroup dehumanization mediated this association. However, this held true only when the target outgroup was a context-dependent outgroup. When the target group was the ultimate scapegoat, exposure to COVID-19 did not predict ingroup willingness to aid them. Our findings contribute to our theoretical and practical knowledge on how intergroup hostility proliferates during external threats and, as such, are valuable to scholars, practitioners, and policymakers working to reduce intergroup tensions during large-scale crises.

T1  - Verification of ingroup morality promotes willingness to participate in collective action for immigrants’ rights: GPIR
AN  - 2621963699
AB  - Three experiments tested whether verification of ingroup morality increases engagement in collective action in favor of immigrants’ rights. To that end, participants were exposed to (a) verifying, (b) negatively discrepant, (c) enhancing, or (d) no feedback about the morality of their group in general (Studies 1–2) or specifically in matters of corruption (Study 3). Results show that those who received verifying feedback of their group’s morality were more willing to engage in collective action than those who received negative or no feedback. These effects seemed to be mediated by increased anger over immigrants’ disadvantage and positive attitudes towards them. Critically, enhancing feedback exerted similar effects as verifying feedback, although the latter yielded more stable and consistent results across the studies. These results suggest that appeals to collective ingroup morality can be effective to promote immigrants’ rights, especially when members of the host society feel that others consider them as moral as they perceive themselves.

T1  - Does classroom diversity improve intergroup relations? Short- and long-term effects of classroom diversity for cross-ethnic friendships and anti-immigrant attitudes in adolescence: GPIR
AN  - 2609041784
AB  - This study examined short- and long-term effects of ethnic classroom diversity for intergroup relations in adolescence. Using a five-year panel of Swedish majority youth (MageT1 = 13.40, MageT5 = 17.30), we found only limited direct effects of classroom diversity on anti-immigrant attitudes. However, classroom diversity increased the likelihood of cross-ethnic friendships, which in turn was associated with lower levels of anti-immigrant attitudes. Moreover, we found that the effect of classroom diversity on friendships remained also after adolescents transitioned to new schools. The findings highlight the importance of longitudinal analyses and contribute to a deeper understanding of how intergroup relations develop during adolescence. It brings new insights related to the longevity of classroom effects and to cross-ethnic friendships’ ability to mediate the diversity–attitudes relationship.

T1  - The Different Faces of Social Tolerance: Conceptualizing and Measuring Respect and Coexistence Tolerance
AN  - 2594368934
AB  - In the theoretical literature on tolerance a distinction is proposed between coexistence and respect tolerance. In three studies with four national samples of Dutch majority members, we demonstrate that these two forms of tolerance can be distinguished empirically in relation to different immigrant target groups. The findings of all studies further show that the more principled respect tolerance was negatively associated with prejudice towards immigrants, and positively associated with the acceptance of concrete minority practices, above and beyond prejudice. However, the positive association between respect tolerance and acceptance of practices was weaker for people who were more strongly concerned about the continuity of their national cultural identity. Overall, the more pragmatic coexistence tolerance was found to have no independent association with prejudicial feelings and with the acceptance of minority practices. The findings indicate that stimulating respect tolerance might be particularly helpful for improving intergroup relations in culturally diverse societies.

T1  - What Predicts Attitudes toward Transgender and Nonbinary People? An Exploration of Gender, Authoritarianism, Social Dominance, and Gender Ideology
AN  - 2557917827
AB  - Transgender and nonbinary (TGNB) people face discrimination based on negative societal attitudes toward TGNB identities. Our study explored factors contributing to negative TGNB attitudes, including participants’ gender, age, religion, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and adherence to traditional gender ideologies. Our sample of 808 U.S. Mechanical Turk participants completed measures of RWA, SDO, traditional masculinity and femininity, and transgender attitudes and beliefs. Because TGNB people have diverse identities, we modified the transgender attitudes and beliefs scale to measure attitudes toward trans man, trans woman, and nonbinary targets instead of the single “transgender” umbrella. Results of multiple regression analyses indicated that gender was a significant predictor of attitudes toward trans men and trans women. Higher levels of RWA, traditional masculinity, and anti-egalitarianism (a domain of SDO) predicted negative attitudes toward all TGNB identities, with RWA generally being the strongest predictor. Traditional femininity and the dominance domain of SDO did not significantly contribute to our predictive model for most groups, although we were surprised to find that for nonbinary people, higher levels of traditional femininity predicted positive attitudes. These results can inform targeted interventions aimed at reducing transprejudice.

T1  - Expatriate demographic characteristics and host country national support: an empirical investigation in Central/South America
TT  - Expatriate demographic and HCN support
AN  - 2562443796
AB  - PurposeThe support of host country nationals (HCNs) is critical for expatriate adjustment and performance. Drawing from social identity theory and self-categorization theory, this study investigates the antecedents of HCNs' support toward expatriates in Central/South America, focusing on cultural similarities and expatriate race.Design/methodology/approachWe conducted a quasi-experimental study to understand the antecedents that promote the willingness of HCNs to offer required support to expatriates. Data were gathered from 117 Latin American participants, who were asked to respond to questions about their perceptions of expatriates from the USA and their willingness to offer support to those expatriates.FindingsOverall, our findings suggest that HCNs are likely to provide support to expatriates when they perceive the expatriates as similar in terms of culture and race. Specifically, African Americans received more positive attitudes and support than White Americans in South/Central America. The effect of cultural similarity on HCN willingness to support expatriates was mediated by perceived trustworthiness.Originality/valueThe present study extends the research on HCN support to expatriates, to Central/South America, an important region that has been under-studied in the expatriate–HCN context. Another novel feature of our study is that we investigate the role of expatriate race and cultural similarity and illuminate the underlying mechanism of the relationship between expatriate race and HCN support.

T1  - Hegemonic masculinity, gender, and social distance: the mediating role of perceived dangerousness
AN  - 2509921960
AB  - Given the aggressive behaviours and negative attitudes associated with hegemonic masculinity, and the fact that men are more likely to commit violent crimes than are women, people might choose to avoid men displaying characteristics consistent with hegemonic masculinity. In a vignette-based study, we assessed whether the gender of a person displaying behaviours and attitudes consistent with hegemonic masculinity influenced people’s desire for social distance. Further, we explored whether the relationship between hegemonic masculinity and social distance was mediated by perceived dangerousness. A fictitious man displaying attitudes and behaviours consistent with hegemonic masculinity was perceived to be more dangerous than a woman displaying the same characteristics, and an increase in perceived dangerousness was associated with a desire for greater social distance. Once this was removed from the direct path, there was no link between the gender of the fictitious individual and social distance, indicating that people do not desire greater social distance from men but from anyone exhibiting ‘toxic’ attitudes and behaviours. The findings have important clinical implications, highlighting the role social connections play in changing prejudiced attitudes and recovery from depression.

T1  - Felt Age Among Racial/Ethnic Minority Older Adults Attending a Senior Center
AN  - 2500886950
AB  - Research shows that felt age among older adults is a good proxy for their current and future physical and mental health. Using both quantitative and qualitative interview data, we examined correlates of and self-reported reasons for felt age among 102 low–socioeconomic status (SES), non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic older adults who were members of a senior activity center. Fewer activities of daily living (ADL)/instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments, more positive affect, and higher self-efficacy were associated with higher odds of feeling younger, while financial stress was associated with lower odds. The most common self-reported reasons for younger felt age were staying active, followed by good health, positive attitudes, exercise/dancing, independence, interpersonal/intimate relationships, faith/spirituality, volunteering, family, driving/traveling, and being of sound mind. Poor health, lack of energy, and limited ability to engage in activities were self-reported reasons for older felt age. Senior center programs that enable older adults to stay active and socially integrated may contribute to their well-being.

T1  - Telehealth and COVID-19: Using technology to accelerate the curve on access and quality healthcare for citizens in India
AN  - 2551249976
AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic has reinstated the importance of telehealth as a business model for accelerating the accessibility of healthcare and improving the quality of healthcare for citizens of a country. Telehealth service has a tremendous potential in a developing country like India where the healthcare facilities in India are heavily concentrated in urban cities while their majority (67%) of the population resides in rural areas. At the same time, a high teledensity of almost 90% supports telehealth overall reach. However, the growth of telehealth in India till now has been sluggish but the corona virus (COVID-19) crisis has redefined the telehealth ecosystem by reducing the risk of infection through person-to-person contact. In this study, we explore the perception of healthcare users towards telehealth services and analyze the key enablers for the telehealth services in the current scenario. We collected data from 1170 participants through personal interview. The results of the study shows a considerable segment of the population is having high healthcare need, have aspirations for accessing better healthcare for themselves and their family members and use ICT to a significant extent. At the same time, they have positive attitude towards telehealth and socio-demographic factors like age, geographical location, educational qualification, family size affects the attitude towards telehealth services. The results of the study shows there is a significant market for telehealth services in India to be explored by the technology firms, hospitals and other healthcare stakeholders and going forward it has an enormous capability to transform the complete healthcare ecosystem, especially in developing countries like India post the COVID-19 crisis.

T1  - Exploring religiosity and attitudes towards Christians and non-believers among recent Muslim refugees to Finland
AN  - 2516240751
AB  - This study is among the first to investigate the religiosity patterns, identity motives and attitudes towards Christians and non-believers among recent Muslim refugees in Finland (N = 128). There are two novelties in this study. First, it applies the religious orientation framework to study religious identities among Muslim refugees in Europe. Second, it combines a variable- and person-centred approach to study religiosity in the context of intergroup relations. Using the variable-centred approach with a multiple mediation analysis, we found that refugees' extrinsic religiosity was associated with more positive attitudes towards Christians. Neither intrinsic religiosity nor participants' religious identity motives were associated with out-group attitudes. Using the person-centred approach with a Two-Step cluster analysis, we showed that individuals with higher levels of intrinsic as compared to extrinsic religiosity and those with pronounced religious identity motives were more biased towards non-believers than towards Christians. Attitudes towards Christians and non-believers were similarly positive in a group characterised by equal levels of intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity. We discuss these findings in light of the role of religiosity in understanding Muslim refugees' attitudes towards receiving societies.

T1  - Comparing story reading and video watching as two distinct forms of vicarious contact: An experimental intervention among elementary school children
AN  - 2474519727
AB  - Research has shown that vicarious contact, that is observing an interaction between ingroup and outgroup members, can improve intergroup relations. Although vicarious contact has been operationalized in different ways, mainly via story reading or video watching, an experimental comparison of these different strategies is still missing. We conducted a school intervention with the aim of comparing the two most used forms of vicarious contact, namely story reading and video watching. Elementary schoolchildren without disabilities (N = 292) were assigned to one of three different conditions: reading a story; watching a video; control. In the two vicarious contact conditions, participants read or watched the story of a child with disability becoming friends with children without disabilities; in the control condition, participants only completed the dependent measures. Results revealed that, in general, both vicarious contact conditions were equally effective in improving outgroup attitudes and behavioural intentions. In addition, they operated with the same strength through the same underlying processes (IOS, ingroup norms). We discuss theoretical and practical implications in the context of vicarious contact as a prejudice‐reduction intervention.

T1  - Gendered outgroup prejudice: An evolutionary threat management perspective on anti-immigrant bias: GPIR
AN  - 2473715946
AB  - Are male and female immigrants viewed similarly or differently? Consistent with an evolutionary threat management perspective, we suggest that the answer to this question depends upon what types of threats immigrant groups are perceived as posing. In the present study, we compared attitudes toward male and female immigrants from either a violent ecology (e.g., Syria) or a pathogen-rich ecology (e.g., Liberia). We hypothesized that people would have more negative attitudes toward male than female immigrants from a violent ecology, but that attitudes would be similar toward male and female immigrants from a pathogen-rich ecology. Internal meta-analyses of three studies (total N = 1,488) were in line with our hypothesis. They showed that attitudes toward male immigrants from a violent ecology were more negative than attitudes toward female immigrants from the same ecology. In contrast, attitudes toward male and female immigrants were similar when those immigrants came from a pathogen-rich ecology. Our findings are consistent with an evolutionary threat management perspective on outgroup prejudice and are aligned with the male warrior hypothesis: Attitudes toward male versus female outgroup members vary with the potential threats these outgroups pose.

T1  - Fitting in: How the intergroup context shapes minority acculturation and achievement
AN  - 2468556219
AB  - Children of immigrants are at risk of underachieving in school with long-lasting consequences for future life-chances. Our research contextualises the achievement gap by examining minority acculturation experiences in daily intergroup contact across different intergroup contexts. Acculturation researchers often find an adaptive advantage for minority youth with an integration-orientation (combining both cultures). But findings from Europe are inconclusive. Looking beyond individual differences in acculturation-orientations, this review shifts focus to the intergroup context of minority acculturation and achievement. We discuss longitudinal, multi-group, multi-level and experimental evidence of the up- and downsides of integration for minority inclusion and success in European societies. Our studies show that both (1) intergroup contact experiences and (2) intergroup ideologies affect achievement – either directly or through the interplay of (3) acculturation-norms, defined as shared views on acculturation in social groups, with individual acculturation-orientations. The findings suggest how schools can reduce achievement gaps through improving intergroup relations.

T1  - Text-based E-contact: Harnessing cooperative Internet interactions to bridge the social and psychological divide
AN  - 2468555998
AB  - In order to bridge the psychological and physical divide between different groups, researchers have harnessed the positive elements of the Internet to improve intergroup contact. One new and effective Internet strategy is Electronic- or E-contact. Unlike other contact approaches, E-contact is an experimental intergroup intervention that uniquely accommodates Allport’s contact theory and recategorisation processes, to create a structured, cooperative, synchronous and goal-directed online text interaction between members from different groups. E-contact has been found to successfully improve intergroup relations between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland and Muslims and Catholics in Australia; and reduce bias against lesbian women and gay men, people with schizophrenia, Indigenous Australians, and transgender individuals. This paper discusses the unique engineering and advantages of E-contact interventions in comparison to existing contact strategies, identifies the theories that guide E-contact interventions, provides meta-analytic evidence of its effects, and discusses the strengths, limitations and future directions for E-contact research.

T1  - The interplay of individual differences, norms, and group identification in predicting prejudiced behavior in online video game interactions
AN  - 2458939624
AB  - Despite the increasing popularity of video games and the diversity of people who play, prejudice remains common in online gaming. In the current study, we use structural equation modeling to test the role of social norms, individual differences, and gamer identification as predictors of how likely someone is to report engaging in prejudiced behavior while playing online video games. We also test the relative importance of these predictors to assess how likely people are to confront prejudice when it occurs in online video games. Participants (N = 384) completed a series of questionnaires to assess their attitudes and perceptions of online gaming norms, as well as to report their own prejudiced and confrontation behavior in video games. We found that both social norms and individual differences are significant predictors of behavior in online gaming. The more normative people report prejudice to be, the more they report making prejudiced comments. Similarly, the more normative confrontation of prejudice is reported to be, the more likely people are to report confronting prejudice. The more people endorsed generally prejudiced attitudes, the more likely they were to report making prejudiced remakes in online gaming and the less likely they were to report confronting prejudiced remarks. These results provide a foundation to inform interventions to reduce prejudice in gaming and indicate that both individual differences and norms are important to consider when designing interventions.

T1  - Could a rising robot workforce make humans less prejudiced?
AN  - 2453786249
AB  - Automation is becoming ever more prevalent, with robot workers replacing many human employees. Many perspectives have examined the economic impact of a robot workforce, but here we consider its social impact: How will the rise of robot workers affect intergroup relations? Whereas some past research has suggested that more robots will lead to more intergroup prejudice, we suggest that robots could also reduce prejudice by highlighting commonalities between all humans. As robot workers become more salient, intergroup differences-including racial and religious differences-may seem less important, fostering a perception of common human identity (i.e., panhumanism). Six studies (ΣN = 3,312) support this hypothesis. Anxiety about the rising robot workforce predicts less anxiety about human outgroups (Study 1), and priming the salience of a robot workforce reduces prejudice toward outgroups (Study 2), makes people more accepting of outgroup members as leaders and family members (Study 3), and increases wage equality across ingroup and outgroup members in an economic simulation (Study 4). This effect is mediated by panhumanism (Studies 5–6), suggesting that the perception of a common human ingroup explains why robot salience reduces prejudice. We discuss why automation may sometimes exacerbate intergroup tensions and other times reduce them.

AN  - 2400268190
AB  - Imagined contact can be effective at reducing social stigma. However, the effect may depend on the strength of the stigma held. We tested the robustness of imagined contact in an Asian setting where stigmatization of mental illness is stronger than in Western countries. In Experiment 1 (n = 167) with five conditions, only an enhanced version of positive imagined contact was able to decrease stigma towards people with schizophrenia through decreasing intergroup anxiety. Given the potential discrepancy between imaginations and reality about experiences with stigmatized groups, in Experiment 2 (n = 121), we tested the hypothesis that after presenting participants with factual information about a mental illness group, imagined contact might backfire, resulting in more negative perceptions. However, enhanced imagined contact alongside factual message about schizophrenia did not increase stigma. The backfiring hypothesis was therefore not supported. Nevertheless, providing realistic information did negate the positive effects of enhanced imagined contact on stigma reduction. In both experiments, we also showed that intergroup anxiety mediated the effect of enhanced imagined contact on various measures of stigma.

T1  - REFLECTIONS ON THE LIFESPAN MODEL FOR ERI DEVELOPMENT
AN  - 2496736850
AB  - A critique of the ERI Lifespan model is offered. The ERI Lifespan Model appears to place undue weight on factors inherited rather than socialized. It also appears to lean toward a political frame of refence favoring a cultural-nationalist orientation. The Model does not explain how a significant percentage of youth categorized as ER at birth, nevertheless, achieve an identity centered on something other than race or ethnicity, as adults. Overall, the model appears to theorize ERI in a manner than can be considered prescriptive and largely set at birth. The critique suggests that most ERI households raise youth with strong personality traits and a positive attitude toward life. Such positivity means that positive people will eventually make positive social identity choices and this positivity does not require choosing an ERI orientation. That the majority of ERI youth select a social identity centered by one’s ERI community is explained by contextual factors rather than inherited predispositions.

T1  - From empathy to action: Can enhancing host‐society children's empathy promote positive attitudes and prosocial behaviour toward refugees?
AN  - 2381930836
AB  - Over half of refugees are school‐aged children. In host communities, children's attitudes and behaviours are important for the integration of refugee children. This study examines the empathy–attitudes–action model in middle childhood (N = 94, 8 to 11 years old). In both the experimental and control conditions, children were introduced to a (fictional) refugee and told that he or she would be moving to their school. The experimental condition also listened to a storybook about the child's refugee experience. Empathy, outgroup attitudes, and prosocial behaviour toward the incoming child, and refugees as a group, were measured. Although mediation was not supported, the storybook condition reported more empathy and helping intentions, and attitudes predicted helping intentions but not giving to refugees. Results highlight how host‐society children can welcome refugees.

T1  - A New Approach to the Study of Tolerance: Conceptualizing and Measuring Acceptance, Respect, and Appreciation of Difference
AN  - 2561654076
AB  - Previous empirical research on tolerance suffers from a number of shortcomings, the most serious being the conceptual and operational conflation of (in)tolerance and prejudice. We design research to remedy this. First, we contribute to the literature by advancing research that distinguishes analytically between the two phenomena. We conceptualize tolerance as a value orientation towards difference. This definition—which is abstract and does not capture attitudes towards specific out-groups, ideas, or behaviors—allows for the analysis of tolerance within and between societies. Second, we improve the measurement of tolerance by developing survey items that are consistent with this conceptualization. We administer two surveys, one national (Sweden) and one cross-national (Australia, Denmark, Great Britain, Sweden, and the United States). Results from structural equation models show that tolerance is best understood as a three-dimensional concept, which includes acceptance of, respect for, and appreciation of difference. Analyses show that measures of tolerance have metric invariance across countries, and additional tests demonstrate convergent and discriminant validity. We also assess tolerance’s relationship to prejudice and find that only an appreciation of difference has the potential to reduce prejudice. We conclude that it is not only possible to measure tolerance in a way that is distinct from prejudice but also necessary if we are to understand the causes and consequences of tolerance.

T1  - Economic conditions, group relative deprivation and ethnic threat perceptions: a cross-national perspective
AN  - 2376776340
AB  - Explaining negative attitudes towards immigration in general and threat due to immigration, in particular, has been a major topic of study in recent decades. While intergroup contact has received considerable attention in explaining ethnic threat, group relative deprivation (GRD), that is, feelings that one’s group is unfairly deprived of desirable goods in comparison to relevant out-groups, has been largely ignored in cross-national research. Nevertheless, various smaller-scale studies have demonstrated that GRD can have a decisive impact on prejudice. In the current study, we examine the association between GRD and ethnic threat systematically across 20 European countries, thereby controlling for intergroup contact and value priorities. The 7th round of the European Social Survey (ESS) includes questions assessing respondents’ feelings of group deprivation compared to immigrants and offers for the first time an opportunity to contextualise the threat-inducing effect of GRD across Europe. A multilevel structural equation model (MLSEM) demonstrates a considerable association between GRD and ethnic threat both on the individual and country levels. The results indicate that GRD is not only an important mediating factor between social structural positions and perceived threat, but also fully mediates the relation between contextual economic indicators and ethnic threat.

T1  - Contact Capacity and Its Effect on Intergroup Relations
AN  - 2337005748
AB  - Although intergroup contact is an effective means to improve intergroup attitudes, it does not always have a positive impact on them. This study introduces contact capacity as a factor that may impede intergroup contact. Longitudinal social network data (N = 6,600; Mage = 14.87 years) was collected in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden and used to accurately calculate participants’ out-group, in-group, and total contact. Multilevel models (L1: students, L2: school classes) showed that the total amount of contact at Wave 1 negatively predicts individuals’ out-group friends at Wave 2 while controlling for out-group attitudes, existing out-group friendships and sociodemographic variables. An additional robustness check showed that this effect holds true for future in-group friendships. The study highlights the importance of contact capacity for whether people engage in intergroup contact and the contribution of social network analysis to contact research.

T1  - Roots of group threat: anti-prejudice motivations and implicit bias in perceptions of immigrants as threats
AN  - 2264599505
AB  - The perception of "group threat" is well known to predict opposition to immigration and negative attitudes toward ethnic minorities in Europe. However, the relationship between group threat and prejudice remains unclear, theoretically and empirically. We offer a new lens for viewing this relationship, using a dual process model of prejudice to help explain individual perceptions of threat as a function of both implicit prejudice and explicit motivation to control or avoid prejudice. Using original survey data from Britain and Germany, we employ measures of explicit motivation to control prejudice (MCP), and implicit intergroup attitudes (measured by the affect misattribution procedure) that are novel in this context. We find that perceived threat is independently associated with implicit attitudes and both internal and, in Britain, external MCP. We thereby connect group threat theory with an updated individual-level model of prejudice.

T1  - "When birds of a different feather flock together" – intercultural socialization in adolescents' friendships
AN  - 2317026993
AB  - Intercultural friendships are a powerful form of intergroup contact to reduce prejudice (Pettigrew, 1998). Little is known about if and how intercultural friendships may also foster intercultural competence. An important prerequisite for the development of intercultural competence is that adolescents reflect on cultural variations. We refer to the degree to which adolescents discuss cultural variations in intercultural friendships as intercultural socialization and explore the following research questions: (1) Does intercultural socialization in friendships mediate the relation between age, intercultural friendship characteristics (friendship group composition, and length, quality, and interaction frequency of the closest intercultural friendship), and adolescents' intercultural competence? (2) Do these relations depend on the adolescents' self-identification with majority and minority culture(s)? The sample included 571 adolescents in Germany (48% female, Mage = 13.69 years, 52% identifying only as members of the cultural majority, 48% (also) as members of a cultural minority. Intercultural competence was measured using a self-report questionnaire and open-ended questions capturing the adolescents' interpretation of and reaction to intercultural situations. Quantitative measures tapped into friendship characteristics (friendship group composition, and length, quality, and interaction frequency of the closest intercultural friendship). To test our model, we employed multigroup path analysis with latent variables in Mplus. Results showed that intercultural socialization linked age and intercultural friendship characteristics with adolescents' intercultural competence. The relations partly varied depending on student's cultural self-identification. We conclude that intercultural friendships are associated with important skills that are needed in increasingly multicultural societies if students experience and discuss cultural variations in these friendships.

T1  - Using Contact Theory to Assess Staff Perspectives on Training Initiatives of an Intergenerational Programming Intervention
AN  - 2276829298
AB  - Background and Objectives Project TRIP (Transforming Relationships through Intergenerational Programs) was developed as a sustainable intergenerational community project involving child care participants and elders attending an elder care program or volunteering at the children's program. The project focused on staff development of evidence-based intergenerational practices. To enhance available intervention research, contact theory provided a theoretical framework to explore how staff members' and administrators' perceptions of the intervention influenced their ability to implement programming in social care settings. Research Design and Methods We used a directed content analysis approach to analyze small group and individual interviews with 32 participants from 6 program sites over 5 years. Results Participants highlighted inherent challenges and subsequent benefits of academic–community partnerships. Greater on-site presence, open communication, and relationship-building proved critical to improve community partnerships, project fidelity, and program sustainability. When interactions reflected contact theory tenets, collaborators reported positive attitudes toward and interactions with research partners. Discussion and Implications Contact theory provided a useful framework to understand the researcher–practitioner partnership. Researchers should plan for partnerships that: (a) are supported by authority figures, including staff and participants, (b) utilize a shared expertise approach where partners have equal group status, (c) involve close cooperation; (d) align research and program goals, and (e) foster positive communication through frequent contact using practitioners' preferred methods and including in-person contact. We recommend future intergenerational programming interventions build on a foundation of both theory and practice.

T1  - Measuring beliefs in the instrumentality of ethnic diversity: Development and validation of the Pro-Diversity Beliefs Scale (PDBS): GPIR
AN  - 2229907571
AB  - In general, diversity beliefs are beliefs about the instrumentality of diversity for the functioning of groups. Focusing on a societal level, recent social-psychological research addressed pro-diversity beliefs as individuals’ beliefs that diversity is beneficial for the progress of society. Despite the growing interest in societal pro-diversity beliefs, no systematically validated scale measuring pro-diversity beliefs is available to date. We addressed this shortcoming and studied the reliability and validity of the newly developed Pro-Diversity Beliefs Scale (PDBS) across four samples. Results indicate that the PDBS is reliable, adequately distinct from related and established scales, and valid in predicting external criteria such as outgroup attitudes or intergroup threat.

T1  - Respect and political disagreement: Can intergroup respect reduce the biased evaluation of outgroup arguments?
AN  - 2199461071
AB  - Past research indicates that in political debates the same arguments are judged very differently depending on the perceiver’s own position on the issue, because positions on controversial issues are often tied to collective identities. In this article, we test the assumption that equality-based respect from an opposing opinion-based group can reduce such biases. Results confirmed that identification as an opponent or proponent of a contested issue was negatively related to evaluations of outgroup arguments (Study 1) and that this negative link was no longer significant when intergroup respect was experimentally induced (Study 2). Results support the notion that disagreements over political issues are intergroup conflicts, in which different socio-political groups struggle for recognition, and that approaches that protect collective identities and improve intergroup relations should be employed to de-escalate them.

T1  - Improving intergroup relations between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland via E‐contact
AN  - 2185683715
AB  - Northern Ireland is characterised by extensive segregation between its predominantly Catholic and Protestant communities. With the aim of overcoming this segregation, the current study experimentally evaluated the effectiveness of electronic or E‐contact as a novel indirect contact and prejudice‐reduction strategy. Here, Catholic and Protestant participants were not required to meet physically but were involved in a collaborative and goal‐orientated online interaction with a member of the other community. As predicted, E‐contact improved both Catholics’ and Protestants’ outgroup attitudes via improved contact expectancies and reduced intergroup anxiety. These findings provide support for the contemporary role of online interactions in actively overcoming the physical and psychological barriers that often prevent prejudice reduction in segregated communities.

T1  - Disclosing Lesbian and Gay Male Sexual Orientation in Later Life: Attitudes of Younger and Older Generations in Eight Latin American Countries
AN  - 2266703691
AB  - The purpose of this research was to explore attitudes toward older lesbians and gay men disclosing their sexual preferences in eight Latin American countries. The sample consisted of 1,539 participants belonging to three age groups (18-29 years, 60-69 years, and 70 years and over). Their answers to two open-ended questions were content-analyzed, and binary logistic regressions were run on the extreme attitudinal categories. Results showed that although most attitudes were positive, a solid percentage of participants still expressed different kinds of derogatory attitudes. Men (as compared to women) and participants who were more religious and less educated tended to hold more negative attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. Both older samples were more prejudiced than the younger one, and attitudes also varied according to country. There was a general trend showing more positive attitudes toward older lesbians and gay men in those countries where sexual minorities' rights are better assured, which suggests that measures to protect sexual minorities and to make sexual diversity in older age visible could be advisable.

T1  - Subverting Heteronormativity: An Intervention to Foster Positive Attitudes Toward Homosexuality Among Indian College Students
AN  - 2190018559
AB  - Prejudice against gay and lesbian persons remains largely an unaddressed issue in India. This experimental study involved designing, implementing, and assessing the effectiveness of an intervention to foster positive attitudes toward the homosexual community among Indian college students. The experimental group (n = 60) received a three-component module including perspective taking, education, and direct contact with gay and lesbian persons. Attitudes toward homosexuals, empathy, and self-esteem were measured using standardized questionnaires 15 days before the intervention and immediately following the intervention. No intervention was carried out with the control group (n = 55). Their attitudes were measured 15 days apart, parallel to the experimental group. Results showed that attitudes toward homosexuality improved significantly in the experimental group. The control group also showed a significant, but small, improvement in attitudes. Further, levels of empathy were found to increase only in the experimental group. Limitations, future directions, and implications of the study are discussed.

T1  - Identity Inclusiveness and Centrality: Investigating Identity Correlates of Attitudes toward Immigrants and Immigration Policies
AN  - 2151163732
AB  - Social psychology highlights ingroup identity as an important determinant of intergroup attitudes and relations; however, research has demonstrated that its effects can be positive, negative, or nonexistent depending on how such identity is conceptualized. This research explores how national identity inclusiveness (Study 1) and centrality (Study 2) are associated with immigration related attitudes in school and countrywide settings, respectively. Study 1 showed that teachers’ inclusive (i.e., overlapping) identities regarding their immigrant students related to positive attitudes toward these students, but not to attitudes about immigrants in general or immigration policy preferences. Study 2 found that national identity centrality was related to negative attitudes toward the social impact of immigrants, and to higher support for policies inhibiting the social inclusion of immigrants in the receiving community. Combined, these studies highlight the importance of considering different conceptualizations of ingroup identity in identifying relations to immigration‐based attitudes. Moreover, the studies highlight the value of promoting inclusive identities when aiming to improve attitudes toward immigrants. We conclude by discussing a new approach for promoting inclusive identities by framing immigrants as indispensable to the receiving community.

T1  - Not Just a National Issue: Effect of State‐Level Reception of Immigrants and Population Changes on Intergroup Attitudes of Whites, Latinos, and Asians in the United States
AN  - 2151163668
AB  - National discourse about immigration in the United States has become increasingly unwelcoming. In two studies, we examine whether regional‐level (state) information about welcoming (vs. unwelcoming) immigrant policies in the context of either stable or increasing rate of immigration can influence intergroup relations in receiving communities. Among Whites (Study 1), welcoming policy proposals elicited more positive attitudes toward immigrants generally and toward Latinos, the ethnic group most closely associated with immigration in the United States, but only when rate of immigration is constant. In contrast, among Latinos (Study 2), an unwelcoming reception led to more positive attitudes toward immigrants (legal and undocumented) but again only when rate of immigration is constant. Asians’ attitudes (Study 2) toward immigrants were not affected by contextual information about immigration. Together, these findings suggest that local conditions can affect community members’ attitudes toward immigrants and toward specific ethnic groups associated with immigration.

T1  - Multicolored Blindfolds
AN  - 2133339156
AB  - Past studies have found that multicultural approaches to diversity can reduce prejudice and stimulate positive intergroup relations. The current research explored a possible negative side effect of multiculturalism: whether organizational diversity structures geared toward multiculturalism can conceal racial discrimination and delegitimize racial discrimination claims. Three studies found that, even when objective information was indicative of discrimination, both Whites and racial minorities perceived organizations which had diversity policies emphasizing multiculturalism as more fair toward minorities. This perception of (false) fairness led individuals to perceive less racial discrimination and to view claims of racial discrimination against that organization as less legitimate. Furthermore, we found that organizational multiculturalism and externally granted diversity awards both produced a (false) fairness effect. The results suggest an irony of multicultural diversity structures: They can create a false fairness effect that conceals and delegitimizes discrimination.

T1  - Are they for us or against us? How intergroup metaperceptions shape foreign policy attitudes: GPIR
AN  - 2087353684
AB  - We identify public opinion polls from other countries as an important form of indirect exposure to outgroups, and an important source of intergroup metaperceptions, outgroup perceptions, and support for group-level behavior towards outgroups. Three experiments demonstrate a two-step process through which such exposure affects support for ingroup behaviors that facilitate peaceful or violent intergroup relations. When indirectly exposed to national outgroups, Americans inferred intergroup metaperceptions (Step 1), which, in turn, shaped outgroup perceptions (Step 2). This effect and its underlying process occurred in relation to both fictitious (Experiment 2) and real outgroups (Iran, Experiment 1; Germany, Saudi Arabia, Experiment 3), as well as those similar (Germany) and dissimilar (Saudi Arabia) to the ingroup (Experiment 3). Further, this effect occurred beyond ingroup perceptions (Experiments 1–3), perceived intergroup threat (Experiments 2–3), and intergroup similarity (Experiment 3). Contributions to the literatures on cross-group contact, intergroup perceptions and attitudes, and image theory are discussed.

T1  - Does the ethno-religious diversity of a neighbourhood affect the perceived health of its residents?
AN  - 2078152965
AB  - Concerns about the diversification of Britain, and its impact on social capital and health are widely debated. The literature has however produced a fuzzy discourse, full of assumptions and claims that are rarely tested. We attempt to disentangle some of these assumptions by providing empirical evidence on the mediating and moderating influence of inter-ethnic conflict and contact, and examine whether they underlie the erosion of health among minorities and white British respondents residing in diverse local areas. Analyses were conducted using multilevel models that relied on geocoded data from a random stratified sample of adults 16–75 years collected in the 2009–2011 Citizenship Survey merged to small area aggregated statistics from the 2011 UK census. The final sample comprised of minorities (n = 13,236) and white British (n = 15,021) residing in England. We find that local area deprivation matters much more for the health of minorities and whites than diversity. Yet, residing in diverse areas can be problematic for whites if it is accompanied by high levels of social distance measured by negative attitudes towards immigrants. Greater contact among minorities and whites, residing in more diverse areas appears to have no significant effect on health. Overall, the findings supported our hypothesis that residing in areas of greater diversity has a differential impact on minorities when compared to whites. In particular, diversity appear to be more beneficial for minorities, especially newly arriving migrants. The effect of contact as measured by social capital is dwarfed in comparison to the effect of deprivation, underlying the importance for policy makers to tackle structural inequalities.

T1  - Factors related to attitudes toward diversity in Australia, Malaysia, and Puerto Rico
AN  - 2064301589
AB  - In this study, we tested social identity complexity theory (Roccas & Brewer, 2002) in relation to attitudes toward diversity and the associated variables of patriotism, nationalism, religiosity, aggression, and sense of self (well-being) in a cross-cultural study of 398 Malaysian, 239 Australian, and 201 Puerto Rican students. Puerto Ricans reported the most positive attitudes toward diversity, followed by Australians, and finally Malaysians. For Puerto Ricans, pro-diversity attitudes were predicted by a positive correlation with constructive patriotism and a negative correlation with blind patriotism. For Australians, pro-diversity attitudes were predicted by a positive association with constructive patriotism, a negative association with traditional nationalism, and a negative association with physical aggression. For Malaysians, pro-diversity attitudes were predicted by positive relationships with all of the following variables: constructive patriotism, traditional nationalism, verbal aggression, hostility, and the need to bolster self through idealizing others. These results support social identity complexity theory and partially support associated predictions for Australians, Puerto Ricans, and some of the predictions for Malaysians. The results are explained in terms of local cultural contexts that may not easily be understood by a simple understanding of the variables that were measured.

T1  - Seeing the World Through the Other's Eye: An Online Intervention Reducing Ethnic Prejudice
AN  - 1990830396
AB  - We report the results of an intervention that targeted anti-Roma sentiment in Hungary using an online perspective-taking game. We evaluated the impact of this intervention using a randomized experiment in which a sample of young adults played this perspective-taking game, or an unrelated online game. Participation in the perspective-taking game markedly reduced prejudice, with an effect-size equivalent to half the difference between voters of the far-right and the center-right party. The effects persisted for at least a month, and, as a byproduct, the intervention also reduced antipathy toward refugees, another stigmatized group in Hungary, and decreased vote intentions for Hungary's overtly racist, far-right party by 10%. Our study offers a proof-of-concept for a general class of interventions that could be adapted to different settings and implemented at low costs.

T1  - Making the Case for Transgenerational Learning
AN  - 1980701731
AB  - This article evaluates existing programs designed to bring together groups from different generations, through a literature search on intergenerational learning programs in accordance with the intergroup contact theory. The theory, as described by Allport (1954) and Rothbart and John (1985), asserts that in order to reduce prejudice and achieve the positive effects of intergroup contact, each of the following conditions should be met to some degree: (1) support of established authority or institution; (2) cross-group contact facilitated regularly over time; (3) equal status within the situation; (4) common goals; (5) intergroup cooperation; (6) behavior of minority group members not consistent with their stereotype; and (7) cross-group contact facilitated in a variety of social contexts. It is the authors' hypothesis that transgenerational engagement in the academic setting is achieved when an activity or program meets all of the aforementioned criteria.

T1  - Do casual gaming environments evoke stereotype threat? Examining the effects of explicit priming and avatar gender
AN  - 1980099316
AB  - Despite relatively equal participation rates between females and males in casual gaming, females often report stigmatisation and prejudice towards their gaming competency within this sub-domain. Applying the theoretical framework of "stereotype threat", this research examined the influence of explicit stereotype priming on females' casual gameplay performance and related attitudes. It also investigated whether the gender of the game avatar heightens susceptibility to stereotype threat. One hundred and twenty females were allocated randomly to one of four experimental conditions in a 2 (Condition: Stereotype threat, Control) x 2 (Avatar gender: Feminine, Masculine) between-subjects design. They completed a short gaming task and measures of social identity, competence beliefs, gameplay self-efficacy and self-esteem. Findings indicate that priming explicitly a negative gender-related stereotype did not appear to have a significant detrimental impact on gameplay performance or gameplay-related attitudes. Additionally, gameplay performance was not affected significantly by manipulating the gender of the gaming avatar. These findings suggest that, although females appear to be knowledgeable about negative gender-gaming stereotypes, these might not impact performance. Moreover, females tend not to endorse these beliefs as a true reflection of their gaming ability, representing a positive finding in view of the prevailing negative attitudes they face in gaming domains.

T1  - Side-by-side: An evaluation of Connecticut's police and youth interaction model
AN  - 1962171356
AB  - This study evaluated a community-based intervention program designed to promote positive youth development and to create positive interactions between police and youth in a non-enforcement environment. A pre-post-design was used to compare the results of the program for participating youth and police officers, particularly changes in each group's attitudes toward the other. The results showed that participation in the program improved police officers' and youths' attitudes toward each other. For youth, the rate of change in attitudes was greatest for minority youth and for youth who had prior negative experience with the police. That is, youth who had negative prior experiences with police and began with negative attitudes toward police developed more positive attitudes toward police as a result of participating in the program. Furthermore, having opportunities for positive interactions between police and youth played an important role in decreasing negative perceptions of police for ethnic minority youth. This study suggests that community-based programs that involve police with youth can improve participants' attitude toward each other, which might impact future interactions.

T1  - Anti-Roma attitudes as expressions of dominant social norms in Eastern Europe
AN  - 1966856483
AB  - Although one of the most severe forms of bias all over Europe, anti-Roma prejudice has been neglected within social psychology. We argue that anti-Roma attitudes need to be recognized as a unique form of prejudice because (a) they reflect socially approved dominant societal norms, (b) intergroup contact increases rather than decreases prejudice, and (c) not just negative stereotyping, but also cultural distancing of Roma people is a form of social exclusion. We developed an integrative Attitudes Toward Roma Scale (ATRS) based on existing measures and theoretical assumptions about prejudice toward Roma people. We conducted a study (N = 1082) relying on student and community samples in Hungary and Slovakia. Exploratory factor analysis revealed and confirmatory factor analysis supported the structural equivalence of a three-factor solution of the16-item scale, consisting of Blatant Stereotyping, Undeserved Benefits, and Cultural Difference. Our findings confirmed that intergroup contact with Roma people is associated with more negative attitudes, and prejudice is mostly expressed in blatantly negative ways, made possible by social contexts that approve of these beliefs. The analysis also revealed that essentialist, romanticized ideas of cultural differences between Roma and non-Roma populations contribute to the psychological distancing of Roma people from the national ingroup.

T1  - Affect-based stock investment decision: The role of affective self-affinity
AN  - 1942723838
AB  - This paper studies the role of affective self-affinity for a company in the stock investment decision by investigating the factors triggering it. Based on the social identity theory and the affect literature we hypothesize that three types of identifications, namely group related, company-people related and idea/ideal related, trigger affective self-affinity for a company which results in extra affect-based motivation to invest in the company's stock. The two ideas included in the idea/ideal related affective self-affinity are socially responsible investing and nationality related ideas. Based on the survey data of 133 active individual investors, we find that the more the investors perceive the company supports/represents a specific group or idea or employ a specific person, with which the investors identify themselves, the higher is the investors' affective self-affinity for the company. This results in higher extra affective motivation to invest in the company's stock over and beyond financial indicators. Thus, investors' identification with groups, people, or ideas such as socially responsible investing and nationality results in higher affect-based investment motivation through affective self-affinity aroused in the investors. Moreover, positive attitude towards the company is another factor that explains the affect-based extra investment motivation.

T1  - Perspective taking and member-to-group generalization of implicit racial attitudes: The role of target prototypicality
AN  - 1901454714
AB  - Actively considering an individual outgroup member's thoughts, feelings, and other subjective experiences --perspective taking-- can improve attitudes toward that person's group. Here, we tested whether such member-to-group generalization of implicit racial attitudes is more likely when perspective-taking targets are viewed as prototypical of their racial group. Results supported a gendered-race-prototype hypothesis: The positive effect of perspective taking on implicit attitudes toward Black people and Asian people, respectively, was stronger when the perspective-taking target was a Black man or Asian woman (gender-race prototypical) versus a Black woman or Asian man (gender-race nonprototypical). These findings identify a boundary condition under which perspective taking may not improve intergroup attitudes and add to a growing literature on social cognition at the intersection of multiple social categories.

T1  - Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Parenting: An Effect of Gender
AN  - 1923040587
AB  - The definition of family in Australia has been continuously changing over the past four decades. The 21st century has brought with it various images of family, with an increase of awareness to same-sex families; however, the acceptance of such family structures does not appear to be widespread and is often determined by sex. Substantive literature demonstrates differences between men and women in attitudes toward same-sex parenting, with theory suggesting that gender role norms may explain this. Despite large efforts to determine sex differences in attitudes toward same-sex parenting, little research, and even less in Australia, has been done to investigate whether there are differences in reasons behind negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting between men and women. To further this understanding, an Australian sample (N= 790) ranging in age from 18-78 completed a survey regrading attitudes toward same-sex parenting, in addition to relevant demographic information. Participants reported more positive attitudes about parenting by lesbians as compared to parenting by gay men. Reasons behind attitudes toward same-sex parenting also differed between males and females. Results suggested that the impact of socially prescribed gender norms may affect prejudice toward same-sex families. Despite an increase in tolerance for sexual minorities recently, policies that continue to discriminate against same-sex parenting rights demonstrates the importance of continuing to identify potential influences of same-sex family prejudice to reduce the potentially negative impacts associated with the prejudice.

T1  - Francophone Intergroup Attitudes and Readiness for Interprovincial Migration in Canada
AN  - 1897660702
AB  - Though existing research helps account for readiness of migrants to move internationally, few social psychological studies have focused on readiness of native born citizens to move internally across regions of their own country. Francophones residing in Canada's bilingual belt comprised of Quebec, New Brunswick and Ontario rated their readiness to move internally to a French and English province compared to their readiness to migrate to the United States. Questionnaires were completed in French by three groups of undergraduates: Francophone Quebecers (n = 204), Acadians in New Brunswick (n = 227), and Franco-Ontarians (n = 227). Though readiness to emigrate to a French or English province was low across all groups, Franco-Ontarians were more willing to migrate out of Province and to the US than both Acadians and Francophone Quebecers. Predictors of readiness to migrate to Acadia (New Brunswick) or Quebec were: seeking better career prospects, perceptions that Francophones contribute to linguistic vitality, avoidance of linguistic tensions, and endorsement of integration-transformation toward Francophone migrants. Predictors of readiness to move to an English majority Province were: seeking better career prospects, English language use, and acceptance of Anglo-Canadians as migrants to own province. Predictors of readiness for emigration to the United States were very similar to those for internal migration to an English majority Province, confirming that factors accounting for internal and international migration share much in common. Results are discussed using ethnolinguistic vitality and the Interactive Acculturation Model with implications for harmony and social cohesion between Francophone and Anglophone communities within Canada's "Bilingual Belt". Alternate abstract:Cette recherche porte sur les intentions de migration interprovinciale d'étudiants universitaires francophones originaires du Nouveau-Brunswick (Acadiens : N = 227), du Québec (N = 204) et de l'Ontario (N = 227). Ces répondants francophones ont rempli des questionnaires en français comprenant une série d'échelles, de type Likert, qui ont servi à mesurer leur désir de migration interne vers une province francophone ou anglophone comparé au désir d'émigration vers les États-Unis. Les résultats démontrent que bien que la volonté d'émigrer vers une autre province canadienne ou aux États-Unis était faible chez les Acadiens et les Québécois, elle était plus soutenue chez les Franco-Ontariens dont l'identité bilingue était plus forte que celle des Acadiens et Québécois. Les prédicteurs du désir de migrer vers le Québec et l'Acadie au Nouveau-Brunswick étaient surtout pour s'assurer d'une meilleure carrière professionnelle, pour délaisser les tensions linguistiques dans la province d'origine et l'endossement de l'orientation d'acculturation intégrationniste-transformatlon à l'égard des migrants francophones. Les prédicteurs du désir de migrer vers les provinces anglophones et les États-Unis étaient semblables : pour s'assurer d'une meilleure carrière professionnelle, l'usage soutenu de l'anglais dans la vie quotidienne, et l'acceptation des migrants anglophones dans la province d'origine des répondants. La vitalité ethnolinguistique et le modèle d'acculturation interactif contribuent à l'explication de ces résultats ayant des implications pour l'harmonie et la cohésion sociale des communautés francophones et anglophones de la « zone bilingue du Canada ».

T1  - Contact, Political Solidarity and Collective Action: An Indian Case Study of Relations between Historically Disadvantaged Communities
AN  - 1855255752
AB  - Research on the contact hypothesis has highlighted the role of contact in improving intergroup relations. Most of this research has addressed the problem of transforming the prejudices of historically advantaged communities, thereby eroding wider patterns of discrimination and inequality. In the present research, drawing on evidence from a cross-sectional survey conducted in New Delhi, we explored an alternative process through which contact may promote social change, namely by fostering political solidarity and empowerment amongst the disadvantaged. The results indicated that Muslim students' experiences of contact with other disadvantaged communities were associated with their willingness to participate in joint collective action to reduce shared inequalities. This relationship was mediated by perceptions of collective efficacy and shared historical grievances and moderated by positive experiences of contact with the Hindu majority. Implications for recent debates about the relationship between contact and social change are discussed. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - "They Will Post a Law About Playing Soccer" and Other Ethnic/Racial Microaggressions in Organized Activities Experienced by Mexican-Origin Families
AN  - 1837062288
AB  - Organized activities have been found to provide positive experiences for Latino adolescents to develop confidence and learn critical life skills; however, these programs are sometimes a context where youth encounter negative experiences related to ethnic/racial microaggressions (ERMs). This qualitative study explores the types of ERMs that Mexican-origin parents and adolescents encountered in their organized activities experience. Parents were mainly concerned about SB-1070 and the associated law enforcement practices that posed a threat to transporting their children to and from the organized activity site. Adolescents reported that they encountered overt (e.g., ethnic teasing) as well as covert forms of discriminatory behavior (e.g., implicit ethnic stereotypes) from peers and adult leaders. Attention to the processes of ERM is critical to helping practitioners promote positive intergroup relations so that more Latinos will participate and stay active in organized activities.

T1  - Opposing the veil in the name of liberalism: popular attitudes to liberalism and Muslim veiling in the Netherlands
AN  - 1801901788
AB  - Is popular antagonism towards Muslim veils in Europe rooted in an exclusionary 'enlightenment liberalism'? By examining different conceptions of liberalism and readings of veiling in a Dutch survey from 2014, we present the first study that investigates this question empirically. We thus bring together two hitherto largely unconnected literatures. The first is the work on immigration and ethnicity, which has shown the centrality of enlightenment liberalism in anti-Muslim media and policy discourses. The second is the literature on anti-Muslim attitudes in public opinion, which explains support for veil bans as the result of perceiving veils as threatening the respondent's own, supposedly liberal, values - but has failed to distinguish between different conceptions of liberalism and thus reached inconclusive results. This, we show, can be remedied by distinguishing between 'enlightenment liberals', who hold negative attitudes, and 'reformation liberals', who hold positive attitudes towards Muslim veils.

T1  - Help that hurts? Perceptions of intergroup assistance
AN  - 1799875760
AB  - The current research, guided theoretically by the Intergroup Helping as Status Relations Model, explored how high and low status groups (Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs) perceive offers of help from the high to the low status group. Ninety-three Arab and Jewish participants were asked to imagine and evaluate offers of help from Jews to Arabs in Israel. Consistent with the hypothesis that members of high and low status groups would have different perspectives and goals in their relations, Israeli Arabs viewed help by Israeli Jews more as a way to reinforce existing hierarchy and as a way of asserting the higher groups' domination. Recognizing the different orientations of members of high and low status groups to potentially conciliatory actions, such as helping behavior, can enhance understanding of the dynamics of intergroup relations and conflict and reveal factors that might fuel intergroup misunderstandings and tensions, which can represent a critical step to improving intergroup relations.

T1  - Perspective Taking Explains Gender Differences in Late Adolescents' Attitudes Toward Disadvantaged Groups
AN  - 1795436293
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Understanding Diversity and Inequality: Dimensions Ranging from Race, Ethnicity, Immigration and Sexual Identity to Social Class 
Adolescents' attitudes toward disadvantaged groups are surprisingly understudied. What we know from these few studies is that adolescents' attitudes tend to become more favorable over time and that adolescent girls display more favorable attitudes than do adolescent boys. However, researchers have not offered explanations for why these effects occur. We proposed that changes in social-cognitive abilities that accompany adolescent development increase perspective taking and that the increased perspective taking facilitates more favorable attitudes toward disadvantaged groups. Because girls develop social-cognitive abilities earlier than boys, girls should show greater perspective taking and thus more positive attitudes toward disadvantaged groups than should boys. Importantly, we propose that these more positive attitudes are explained better by perspective taking than by gender. Participants were late adolescents (n = 803, 53.3 % female, ages 15-19) from high schools in north-central Florida (United States) participating in an ongoing, multi-wave study. Participants completed a measure of perspective-taking and reported their attitudes toward three disadvantaged groups (Black, gay, and poor people) during their third year of high school and, again, 6 months later during their fourth year of high school. Our findings provided strong support for our theorizing. Girls generally reported warmer attitudes than did boys toward disadvantaged groups, with the gender differences in warmth tending to diminish across time. Similarly, girls were higher than boys in perspective-taking abilities at both time points, although boys increased over time whereas girls did not. Crucially, perspective taking mediated observed gender differences in attitudes, suggesting that perspective taking is a mechanism for improving attitudes toward disadvantaged groups during late adolescence.

T1  - Disgust predicts prejudice and discrimination toward individuals with obesity
AN  - 1793852378
AB  - This study examined the relevance of disgust to evaluations of an obese target person, and the connection between disgust and prejudice toward that person. Participants (n=598) viewed an image of an obese or non-obese woman, and then evaluated that woman on a number of dimensions (emotions, attitudes, stereotypes, desire for social distance). Compared with the non-obese target, the obese target elicited more disgust, more negative attitudes and stereotypes, and a greater desire for social distance. Furthermore, disgust mediated the effect of the target's body size on all of the outcome variables (attitudes, stereotypes, social distance). Disgust plays an important role in prejudice and discrimination toward individuals with obesity, and might in part explain the pervasiveness of weight bias.

T1  - The Sociocultural Context of Mexican-Origin Pregnant Adolescents' Attitudes Toward Teen Pregnancy and Links to Future Outcomes
AN  - 1779612919
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Understanding Wanted and Unwanted Relationships 
Given the negative developmental risks associated with adolescent motherhood, it is important to examine the sociocultural context of adolescent mothers' lives to identify those most at risk for poor outcomes. Our goals were to identify profiles of Mexican-origin pregnant adolescents' cultural orientations and their attitudes toward teen pregnancy, and to investigate how these profiles were linked to adolescents' pregnancy intentions, family resources, and short-term family, educational, and parenting outcomes. With a sample of 205 Mexican-origin adolescent mothers, we identified three profiles based on cultural orientations and attitudes toward teen pregnancy: Bicultural-Moderate Attitudes, Acculturated-Moderate Attitudes, and Enculturated-Low Attitudes. The results indicated that enculturated pregnant adolescents had the least favorable attitudes toward teen pregnancy, and the lowest levels of family income, pregnancy intentions, pregnancy support, and educational expectations compared to acculturated and bicultural pregnant adolescents; acculturated adolescents (with the highest family income and high levels of pregnancy support) had the highest levels of parenting efficacy 10 months postpartum. Our findings suggest that enculturated adolescent mothers (with less positive attitudes toward teen pregnancy) may benefit from educational support programs and enculturated and bicultural adolescent mothers (with moderately positive attitudes toward teen pregnancy) may benefit from programs to increase parenting efficacy. Such targeted interventions may, in turn, reduce the likelihood of adolescent mothers experiencing negative educational and parenting outcomes.

T1  - Mapping the meaning of 'difference' in Europe: A social topography of prejudice
AN  - 1933539589
AB  - This paper draws on original empirical research to investigate popular understandings of prejudice in two national contexts: Poland and the United Kingdom. The paper demonstrates how common-sense meanings of prejudice are inflected by the specific histories and geographies of each place: framed in terms of 'distance' (Poland) and 'proximity' (United Kingdom), respectively. Yet, by treating these national contexts as nodes and linking them analytically the paper also exposes a connectedness in these definitions which brings into relief the common processes that produce prejudice. The paper then explores how inter-linkages between the United Kingdom and Poland within the wider context of the European Union are producing - and circulating through the emerging international currency of 'political correctness' - a common critique of equality legislation and a belief that popular concerns about the way national contexts are perceived to be changing as a consequence of super mobility and super diversity are being silenced. This raises a real risk that in the context of European austerity and associated levels of socioeconomic insecurity, negative attitudes and conservative values may begin to be represented as popular normative standards which transcend national contexts to justify harsher political responses towards minorities. As such, the paper concludes by making a case for prejudice reduction strategies to receive much greater priority in both national and European contexts.

T1  - Breaking down a barrier: increasing perceived out-group knowledge reduces negative expectancies about intergroup interaction
AN  - 1728660476; 201533906
AB  - Although intergroup contact is an effective way of reducing prejudice, negative expectancies about interacting with out-group members often create a barrier to intergroup contact. The current study investigated cognitive appraisals by which negative expectancies may arise. Specifically, we examined whether increasing Anglo Australians' appraisals of their knowledge about Muslims would reduce their negative expectancies about an (ostensible) upcoming interaction with a Muslim Australian. Participants (89 Anglo Australians) completed a test that provided positive feedback either on their knowledge about Muslims or on their general knowledge (control). As predicted, Anglo Australians who received positive feedback on their knowledge about Muslims had a lower threat appraisal and expected to feel less anxious during the intergroup interaction compared with those who were in the control condition. This provides support for the precursory role out-group knowledge may have as a resource that is appraised upon the prospect of an intergroup interaction. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - "The Contact Hypothesis" and Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Parenting
AN  - 1674198756
AB  - "The contact hypothesis" refers to the value of heterosexuals' interpersonal contact with gay men and lesbians in lowering negative attitudes toward them. With the increasing number of same-sex parented families worldwide, in spite of a generalized lack of appropriate social and legal protection, the issue of attitudes toward gay and lesbian parents gains special relevance. A sample of 1690 Portuguese heterosexual individuals were asked about their interpersonal contact experiences with gay men and lesbians, their attitudes toward them and toward same-sex parenting. Results revealed that women and non-religious participants were significantly more likely to have gay and lesbian acquaintances and friends, feel more comfortable in their company, and hold less negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians, and gay and lesbian parenting. A path analysis model revealed that interpersonal contact experiences were not directly linked to attitudes toward same-sex families, but were mediated by homonegativity and comfort with gay men and lesbians. These findings extend previous knowledge about the value of interpersonal contact, by highlighting the roles of homonegativity and positive affect as mediators of contact experiences on attitudes toward same-sex parented families.

T1  - The presence of the past: Identity continuity and group dynamics
AN  - 1758417025
AB  - Social psychologists are increasingly interested in the temporal dimensions of social life and in identity continuity in particular. Focusing on ethnicity and national identity we discuss the implications of perceived group continuity and collective self-continuity, and their interplay, for group dynamics. Using the social identity perspective and theories of identity motivation, we show, first, that the need for collective self-continuity forms a unique motivational basis for group identification. Second, we demonstrate that people are more likely to derive a sense of collective self-continuity from groups that are seen as relatively stable and immutable over time (i.e., essentialist in-groups). Third, we find that existential threats to group identity strengthen a sense of collective self-continuity, which, in turn, increases in-group defence mechanisms in the form of negative attitudes towards immigrant out-groups and towards social developments that potentially undermine in-group continuity. Fourth, we discuss empirical findings that indicate that group-based nostalgia for the nation is an identity management strategy in response to ingroup continuity threats and that nostalgia leads to immigrant out-group exclusion.

T1  - Contact with immigrants in times of crisis: An exploration of the Catalan case
AN  - 1700674335; 201525297
AB  - Contact theory and threat group theory offer contradictory hypothesis regarding the effect of contact with immigrants. Does contact reduce or increases negative attitudes towards immigration? This article integrates both approaches and tests the effect of contact towards immigrants when different contexts are considered. We investigate the effect of the economic environment and the immigrant group size on modifying attitudes towards immigration in the context of Catalonia, which offers a complex environment where traditional hypotheses can be tested. Results show that close contact and family contact with immigrants reduce prejudices. However, mixed results are reported regarding the effect of the economic environment or the immigrant group size. Findings also show that Catalan identity is related to lower levels of negative attitudes towards immigrants, regardless of having experienced contact with foreigners. Results have implications on the impact of context when dealing with the impact of contact on attitudes towards immigration. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Attitudes toward Immigrants in Nebraska
AN  - 1667951676; 201509453
AB  - We examined the relative effects of three theories of prejudice: perceptions of threat, contact with immigrants, and a cosmopolitanism outlook, in predicting attitudes toward immigrants in Nebraska, a state experiencing a substantial rise in immigrant populations. We found perceived threat was associated with unfavorable attitudes toward immigrants while contact with immigrants and a cosmopolitan outlook were associated with favorable attitudes. Furthermore, we found that the presence of a perceived threat of immigrants is more likely to increase negative attitudes toward immigrants than does contact with immigrants or a cosmopolitan attitude in increasing positive attitudes toward immigrants. Additionally, we found the absence of perceived threat has a stronger effect on attitudes (positively) than does its presence (negatively) in the case of respondents' view that immigrants contribute to an increase in crime. The effect of the presence of contact and a cosmopolitan outlook on attitudes toward immigrants is at least as great (positively) as the effect of their absence (negatively). We discuss implications for the changing attitudes toward immigrants in the state and differences between state and national attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Diversity and Out-Group Attitudes in the Netherlands: The Role of Authoritarianism and Social Threat in the Neighbourhood
AN  - 1660021360; 201505809
AB  - Previous studies have obtained divergent findings for the association between ethnic diversity and majority members' attitudes towards immigrants, suggesting that this relationship is moderated by individual or contextual difference variables. In a community sample of Dutch citizens (N = 399), we investigated the role of two potential moderators: right-wing authoritarianism and social threat in the local neighbourhood. Moreover, we assessed diversity and social threat in the neighbourhood with both subjective and objective measures. The results indicated that diversity was negatively related to positive attitudes towards immigrants among high authoritarians and among people experiencing their immediate environment as threatening. Conversely, diversity was positively related to out-group attitudes among low authoritarian individuals and among people residing in more secure neighbourhoods. The theoretical and practical implications of these person-environment and environment-environment interactions are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Individual values, cultural embeddedness, and anti-immigration sentiments: Explaining differences in the effect of values on attitudes toward immigration across Europe
AN  - 1738476681; 201538482
AB  - During the last decade, many European countries have faced sizeable immigration inflows accompanied by high prevalence of negative sentiments toward immigrants among majority members of the host societies. We propose that basic human values are one important determinant of such negative attitudes, and we seek to explain variation across countries in the strength of the effects of values. Based on Schwartz' (1992, 1994) basic human value theory, we hypothesize that universalism values are conducive to positive attitudes toward immigration, while conformity-tradition reinforce anti-immigration sentiments. We furthermore hypothesize that these value effects are moderated by two contextual variables. Both value effects are expected to be weaker in countries with a higher level of cultural embeddedness. Furthermore, negative effects of conformity-tradition values are hypothesized to be cushioned by a lower proportion of immigrants in the country. A multilevel analysis of data from 24 countries from the fourth round of the European Social Survey (2008-2009) supports these hypotheses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the measurement properties of the theoretical constructs exhibit equivalence across countries, thereby justifying statistical comparisons.

T1  - The Wish to Leave Ethnically Concentrated Neighbourhoods: The Role of Perceived Social Cohesion and Interethnic Attitudes
AN  - 1667952254; 201512663
AB  - This paper aims to investigate the motives behind people's wishes to move out of ethnically concentrated neighbourhoods. We focus on the impact of perceived social cohesion and negative interethnic attitudes and hypothesise on moving wishes of ethnic majority and minority residents in the Netherlands (i.e. Turks and Moroccans). Data were derived from the first wave of the 2009 Netherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study, collected in 35 municipalities covering 800 neighbourhoods. Taking into account household, housing and other neighbourhood attributes, multilevel logistic regression models show that ethnic majority residents are more likely to have a wish to move when they live in neighbourhoods with a large percentage of ethnic minorities. This can be explained by a lack of perceived social cohesion, but not by their negative attitudes towards ethnic minorities. Controlling for housing and neighbourhood conditions, the percentage of ethnic minorities neither increases nor decreases minority residents' moving wishes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnic Differences in the Attitudes and Practice of Consanguineous Marriage among Kurds and Turks in Uromiyeh District, Iran
AN  - 1586126261
AB  - Despite the spread of modem familial values and norms and the rapid pace of modernization in Iran, kinship marriages remain a common practice among some ethnic groups, including Turk and Kurd. This study is informed by modernization and development idealism theories to examine factors associated with the practice and attitude of Kurdish and Turkish women to consanguineous marriage, utilizing data from a representative sample of 768 evermarried women residing in the district of Uromiyeh in Iran. The results indicated that consanguineous marriage was more prevalent among Kurds rather than Turks, and Kurdish rather than Turkish women held more positive orientations to consanguineous. Multivariate results showed that being a Kurd than a Turk was strongly associated with the likelihood of practicing kinship marriage and having positive attitudes to consanguineous marriage, while the levels of modernization and development idealism showed no or weak association. The results suggest that ethnic belonging can reinforce consanguineous marriage regardless of being modernized or holding modern development ideals.

T1  - Late Abrahamic reunion? Religious fundamentalism negatively predicts dual Abrahamic group categorization among Muslims and Christians
AN  - 1559006334; 201431835
AB  - Although extensive research has documented the effectiveness of common or dual in-groups on improving intergroup relations, little is known about how individual-difference variables affect people's willingness to make such re-categorizations in the first place. Here, we demonstrate that individual differences in religious fundamentalism predict willingness to categorize in terms of the common Abrahamic religious origins of Christianity and Islam among Christians and Muslims. Study 1 (n = 243 Christians, 291 Muslims) uses multigroup structural equation modeling and Study 2 (n = 80 Christians) an experimental manipulation to show that religious fundamentalism causes lower dual Abrahamic categorization, which, in turn, predicts more positive attitudes toward the respective out-group, mediating the negative effects of religious fundamentalism on religious intergroup bias. While making the general case that individual differences may play important roles for dual categorizations, these results also highlight the specific positive potential of dual ecumenical categorizations for improving interreligious relations. Research and societal implications are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - FROM A DIFFERENT VANTAGE: INTERGROUP ATTITUDES AMONG CHILDREN FROM LOW- AND INTERMEDIATE-STATUS RACIAL GROUPS
AN  - 1550998859; 201428944
AB  - Social groups are often described as hierarchically ordered in terms of social status. Intergroup research has generally focused on the relationship between the highest-status group and a single lower-status group, leaving relationships among nondominant groups relatively unexplored. Focusing on low-status Black and intermediate-status Coloured (multiracial) South African elementary school-children, we examined the attitudes members of these two groups hold toward one another and toward a range of other locally salient groups, as well as their wealth-related stereotypes and preferences. Results indicated that both Coloured and Black children implicitly preferred Coloured over Black, and also strongly associated Coloured (vs. Black) with wealth, suggesting a powerful tendency to internalize the status quo. However, Black children exhibited stronger preferences for other social groups, as well as stronger preferences for wealth in general, possibly as a means of compensating for their devalued status in the domain of race. Implications for theories of intergroup attitudes are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1767328573; 201605964
AB  - This research uses standard survey items and vignettes from a recent web survey to examine the interaction of race/ethnicity, sex, and attitudes about science -- an elite domain in the US class system. The focus is on the science attitudes of young Asian Americans. Findings from standard survey questions show variation across Asian American ethnic groups on perceptions of science. They also reveal race and sex patterns involving a hierarchy of science attitudes with Asian American males at the top and White females at the bottom. Results from standard survey items and vignettes on similar issues show divergence. Asian American respondents often see more positive attitudes about science for the individual like them in the vignette than for self. Recommendations for policy are provided. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Balanced Identity in the Minimal Groups Paradigm
AN  - 1473341901
AB  - Balanced Identity Theory [1] formalizes a set of relationships between group attitude, group identification, and self-esteem. While these relationships have been demonstrated for familiar and highly salient social categories, questions remain regarding the generality of the balance phenomenon and its causal versus descriptive status. Supporting the generality and rapidity of cognitive balance, four studies demonstrate that the central predictions of balance are supported even for previously unfamiliar “minimal” social groups to which participants have just been randomly assigned. Further, supporting a causal as opposed to merely descriptive interpretation, manipulating any one component of the balance model (group attitude, group identification, or self-esteem) affects at least one of the related components. Interestingly, the broader pattern of cognitive balance was preserved across such manipulations only when the manipulation strengthens as opposes to weakens the manipulated construct. Taken together, these findings indicate that Balanced Identity Theory has promise as a general theory of intergroup attitudes, and that it may be able to shed light on prior inconsistencies concerning the relationship between self-esteem and intergroup bias.

T1  - Favorable Contact During Volunteer Service: Reducing Prejudice Toward Mexicans in the American Southwest
AN  - 1494748628; 201401925
AB  - We assessed religious volunteers' intergroup contact, realistic threat perceptions, symbolic threat perceptions, intergroup anxiety, negative stereotypes and prejudice toward Mexicans before and approximately 4-6 months into their volunteer service. Whether assigned to serve Mexicans or European-Americans, all volunteers experienced reduced prejudice toward Mexicans. A multiple mediator model suggests that changes in prejudice resulted from a mediated relationship between quality contact and prejudice. Specifically, intergroup anxiety and negative stereotypes mediated the relationship. The benefits of volunteerism as a means of fostering favorable intergroup contact and reducing threat perceptions and prejudice are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Do Academically-Engaged Adolescents Experience Social Sanctions from the Peer Group?
AN  - 1428712512; 23277293
AB  - Existing theoretical perspectives suggest that adolescents who are characterized by high achievement may experience social sanctions from peers. The central premise is that, in many North American settings, adolescent peer groups are characterized by negative attitudes toward the school environment. To test these hypotheses, we examined associations between indicators of low social power (unpopularity and victimization by peers) and academic competence for 415 adolescents (193 boys; 222 girls) attending an urban high school. This school served neighborhoods that were characterized by a moderate degree of economic distress and the students were predominately of Hispanic American descent. A short-term longitudinal design was used, with two waves of data collected over consecutive school years. The adolescents completed a peer nomination inventory assessing relational and overt victimization by peers, unpopularity, and social rejection. In addition, we obtained math and language arts grades from school records, and we assessed behavioral engagement in school with a self-report inventory. Structural equation models did not reveal a strong pattern of longitudinal change in social standing with peers or academic functioning. However, we found positive correlations between academic achievement and problematic peer relationships in both years of the project. We also found evidence that gender moderates these associations, with the effects reaching significance only for boys. Our results provide evidence that, in some settings, high achieving adolescents can be prone to negative treatment or marginalization by peers.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - National Identity and Group Narcissism as Predictors of Intergroup Attitudes Toward Undocumented Latino Immigrants in the United States
AN  - 1494748570; 201402193
AB  - The debate surrounding immigration reform to address undocumented Latino immigrants in the United States has been emotionally charged and polarizing. This study's goal was to better understand some of the psychological predictors of attitudes toward undocumented Latino immigrants in the United States, namely, collective identity as an American, group-level narcissism, and their interaction. A university sample (N = 223) completed an online survey measuring attitudes toward undocumented Latino immigrants. As anticipated, we found that, at mean and high (but not low) levels of group narcissism, national in-group identification was a significant predictor of attitudes toward undocumented Latino immigrants. The implications of these findings, limitations, and suggestions for future research are discussed in light of the current debate on undocumented immigration in the United States.

T1  - Gender Effect and Prejudice: When a Salient Female Norm Moderates Male Negative Attitudes Toward Homosexuals
AN  - 1463012944; 201345830
AB  - Men generally express more negative attitudes than women toward homosexuals. This study aims to determine if social norms saliency can rely on this 'gender effect' and influence attitudes toward homosexuals. Gender characteristics (attitudes and lexical markers) concerning homosexuality were identified in Study 1 and used to construct male- (i.e., promoting a prejudice-related norm) and female-marked (i.e., promoting an anti-prejudice-related norm) messages. Social norms saliency was primed using these messages (Studies 2 and 3) and the participant's immediate context (Study 3). Results show that promoting a prejudiced norm eases expression of males' negative attitudes toward homosexuals, whereas the promotion of an anti-prejudice norm inhibits their attitudes. Theoretical elaborations and potential applications for promotion of tolerance are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The association between media exposure of interracial relationships and attitudes toward interracial relationships
AN  - 1433108267
AB  - From an extended contact hypothesis (ECH) framework, mass-media portrayals of interracial relationships may encourage positive attitudes toward such relationships. Caucasian participants (N=218) indicated examples of media portrayals of Black-White interracial relationships, attitudes toward Blacks, attitudes toward interracial relationships, degree of identification with Whites, and the degree to which Blacks are included in self-representations. Supporting our hypotheses, extended contact with Black-White relationships via media portrayals was associated with more positive attitudes toward Blacks and interracial relationships. These relationships were mediated by the degree to which Blacks are included in self-representations. This study furthers understanding of ECH by including representations of dyadic relationships and suggests an avenue for the creation of interventions for improving attitudes toward interracial relationships.

T1  - Modifying perceived variability: four laboratory and field experiments show the effectiveness of a ready-to-be-used prejudice intervention
AN  - 1433108845
AB  - We examined whether increasing individuals' perceived variability of an out-group reduces prejudice and discrimination toward members of this group. In a series of four laboratory and field experiments, we attracted participants' attention to the heterogeneity of members of an out-group (or not), and then measured their attitudes or behaviors. Perceived variability was manipulated by portraying the out-group members as having diverse socio-demographic characteristics and different personality traits and preferences. Prejudice and discrimination were measured in terms of self-reported prejudice, stereotyping, in-group bias, social distance, and willingness to do something for the minority group under consideration. In all experiments, perceived variability decreased prejudice and discrimination.

T1  - Bridging intragroup processes and intergroup relations: Needing the twain to meet
AN  - 1773419893
AB  - Despite their shared focus on groups, research bridging intragroup processes and intergroup relations is surprisingly rare. The goal of the present article is to highlight how understanding the reciprocal relationship between intragroup processes and intergroup relations offers valuable new insights into both topics and suggests new, productive avenues for research and theory development - particularly for understanding and improving intergroup relations. The article next briefly reviews key findings from three dominant frameworks in the field of intergroup relations: social cognition, social identity, and functional relations. It then discusses the complementary role of intergroup and intragroup dynamics, reviewing how intergroup relations can affect intragroup processes and then discussing how intragroup dynamics can shape intergroup relations. The final section considers the implications, theoretical and practical, of the proposed reciprocal relationships between intragroup and intergroup processes.

T1  - Great expectations: students' educational attitudes upon the transition to post-secondary vocational education
AN  - 1438551435; 201341225
AB  - In this study, we examine students' educational attitudes upon the transition to Dutch senior vocational education (SVE), a transition associated with high dropout rates in the first year. Prior studies have identified differences in educational attitudes between sociodemographic groups. However, the mechanisms underlying those differences remain topic of debate: some studies point at differences in the school orientation and support in students' social communities outside school, others focus on differences in educational experiences between sociodemographic groups. Multilevel sequential regression analyses on a diverse sample of 1438 students in urban SVE schools reveal that students have very positive educational attitudes upon their transition to SVE. Ethnic minority students express particularly positive attitudes. School-related encouragement and support at home plays an important role in students' attitudes, but the attitudes of students from lower educated or ethnic minority communities are less related to this support. Prior school experiences play an essential, but occasionally counterproductive, role in students' attitudes upon transition, depicting the transition as a fresh new start for some, and an unwelcome threshold for others.

T1  - Bridging intragroup processes and intergroup relations: Needing the twain to meet
AN  - 1417526699; 201331707
AB  - Despite their shared focus on groups, research bridging intragroup processes and intergroup relations is surprisingly rare. The goal of the present article is to highlight how understanding the reciprocal relationship between intragroup processes and intergroup relations offers valuable new insights into both topics and suggests new, productive avenues for research and theory development -- particularly for understanding and improving intergroup relations. The article next briefly reviews key findings from three dominant frameworks in the field of intergroup relations: social cognition, social identity, and functional relations. It then discusses the complementary role of intergroup and intragroup dynamics, reviewing how intergroup relations can affect intragroup processes and then discussing how intragroup dynamics can shape intergroup relations. The final section considers the implications, theoretical and practical, of the proposed reciprocal relationships between intragroup and intergroup processes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Collective memory as identity content after ethnic conflict: An exploratory study
AN  - 1417521369; 201335013
AB  - In line with recent theorizing on identity content and intergroup attitudes, it is argued that collective memory (shared understandings of group history as narratives of the past) forms part of the narrative content of group identities and inform group members' attitudes toward outgroups. Survey data from 82 Bosnian Muslim immigrants and refugees resettled in the United States showed that endorsement of narratives of the past that emphasize prewar coexistence of groups interacted with ethnic identification to predict attitudes toward Bosnian Croats, but not toward Bosnian Serbs. Even though ethnic identification was a strong negative predictor of attitudes toward Croats, its effect was significantly reduced among participants who endorsed a narrative of past coexistence. Attitudes toward Bosnian Serbs, however, were uniformly low and only predicted by attitudes toward the other outgroup, Bosnian Croats. Implications for studies of intergroup relations and reconciliation efforts were discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Changing the Culture of Migration? Attitudes towards Education among Former Basotho Labour Migrants to South African Mines
AN  - 1641424395; 201500275
AB  - Until late in the 1990s, employment for unskilled and uneducated able-bodied Basotho men on South African mines was usually available. As a result, the education of male children in most Basotho households was not prioritised. In the 1990s, massive retrenchments took place at the mines, resulting in many Basotho men being retrenched and repatriated. Most of those retrenched did not have any formal education and were generally unskilled. Many of the ex-miners believed that they were retrenched to make way for an educated workforce. Back home, they experienced problems getting employment because of their lack of formal education. These experiences, combined with efforts by the government of Lesotho and its development partners to promote education, have led to a change in the attitudes of the former miners towards education. Most of them now have positive attitudes towards education as they perceive it as a more secure and more sustainable means of getting employment and a vehicle for economic and social mobility. Based on qualitative data obtained from former mine workers this paper provides evidence that as a result of new realities, former migrants are developing positive attitudes towards education. The change in attitude towards education can however, only evolve into a change in the culture of migration if, over time, the benefits of education outweigh those of migration.

T1  - Translating Recategorization Strategies Into an Antibias Educational Intervention
AN  - 1433107785
AB  - This experiment explored whether the benefits of a complete recategorization and a dual identity might effectively be translated into an intervention program designed to reduce prejudice among European Portuguese and African Portuguese 9- to 11-year-old children. Participants interacted for 45 minutes in weekly sessions for a month. One month after the last interaction, measures were administered to the children. Results revealed that only recategorization reduced prejudice over time relative to the control condition. Consistent with a functional perspective regarding which representation would most effectively promote their group's goals, a one-group representation was more effective for the African Portuguese minority group.

T1  - "Treating" Prejudice: An Exposure-Therapy Approach to Reducing Negative Reactions Toward Stigmatized Groups
AN  - 1448998173; 201342794
AB  - One of the ways in which therapists treat anxiety disorders is to expose patients to a fear-evoking stimulus within a safe environment before encouraging more positive stimulus-related thoughts. In the study reported here, we adapted these psychotherapeutic principles of exposure therapy to test the hypothesis that imagining a positive encounter with a member of a stigmatized group would be more likely to promote positive perceptions when it was preceded by an imagined negative encounter. The results of three experiments targeting a range of stigmatized groups (adults with schizophrenia, gay men, and British Muslims) supported this hypothesis. Compared with purely positive interventions, interventions in which a single negative encounter was imagined just prior to imagining a positive encounter resulted in significantly reduced prejudice. Furthermore, reduced anxiety uniquely derived from the mixed-valence imagery task statistically explained enhanced intentions to engage positively with the previously stigmatized group in the future.

T1  - Attitudes Towards Affectivity and Sexuality of People with Intellectual Disability
AN  - 1221407842; 201244028
AB  - The acceptance of sexuality and its manifestations has changed in recent decades to being considered a normal feature of the identity of each individual. However, the person with intellectual disability have not benefited from this change in attitude. Their sexuality remains shrouded in myths and prejudices. The study population consisted of 454 students from the University of Beira Interior, from the Medicine, Psychology and Architecture majors. The data was collected using a questionnaire specifically drafted for this research. Most surveyed students consider sexuality an important part of life for every human being. From the responses to the questionnaire, psychology students were those with a more positive attitude towards sexuality and affectivity of the individual with intellectual disability, but the variability of the distribution of student responses from the three majors did not differ significantly. A positive attitude is characteristic of those who have acquired sufficient knowledge, females and of those who have frequent contact with individuals with intellectual disability.

T1  - Family Life and Acculturation Attitudes: A Study among Four Immigrant Groups in the Netherlands
AN  - 1347781121; 201318765
AB  - This article examines the relationship between different aspects of family life and acculturation attitudes among adults of the four main immigrant groups in the Netherlands. The focus is on the importance of early parental practices and current (national and transnational) family relationships for the attitude, first, towards socio-cultural maintenance and, second, towards socio-cultural adaptation. The results show that family life matters for both attitudes, but more strongly for the endorsement of socio-cultural maintenance. Family contacts and support are positively related to the endorsement of socio-cultural maintenance but not to the attitude towards socio-cultural adaptation. Growing up with loving and supporting parents is associated with a more positive attitude towards socio-cultural adaptation. In addition to, and independent from, the individual's language proficiency, immigrants within families who speak Dutch more often have a more positive attitude towards socio-cultural adaptation and a lower endorsement of socio-cultural maintenance.

T1  - Responses to intergroup helping: Effects of perceived stability and legitimacy of intergroup relations on Israeli Arabs reactions to assistance by Israeli Jews
AN  - 1125218367; 201240616
AB  - The current research builds on work on social identity and helping and extends the Intergroup Helping as Status Relations Model theoretically and empirically by identifying the social structural conditions that moderate responses to intergroup assistance. Specifically, the study tested the hypothesis that Israeli-Arab participants would view help from an Israeli Jew more negatively when they perceived the status relations between the two groups as less stable and legitimate. As predicted, greater perceptions of the instability of status relations between the groups were related to less positive perceptions of assistance by an Israeli Jew as promoting positive intergroup relations, and that perceptions of illegitimacy exacerbated negative reactions when intergroup relations were seen as unstable. Practically, the finding that helping may be construed in different ways -- more positively or negatively -- depending on perceptions of the structural relations between groups has valuable implications for understanding and ameliorating conflict.

T1  - Racial Identity and Risky Sexual Behaviors Among Black Heterosexual Men
AN  - 925713758; 201206094
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between racial identity and risky sexual behaviors among young Black heterosexual men to better inform future HIV prevention interventions. A community sample of 80 self-identified African American heterosexual men aged 18 to 29 years completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview survey. Bivariate analyses were performed to assess the associations among variables related to demographics, racial identity, and sexual behaviors. Multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses were employed to determine the relationship between racial identity and risky sexual behaviors. Results indicate that more positive feelings toward African Americans and positive attitudes toward being Black predicted fewer sexual partners. The centrality of race was associated with a decrease in the odds of having concurrent sexual partners and marginally predicted increased condom use with a main female partner. Findings suggest that future HIV prevention interventions designed for African American heterosexual men should seek to strengthen their sense of racial identity.

T1  - Improving implicit and explicit intergroup attitudes using imagined contact: An experimental intervention with elementary school children
AN  - 1023028882; 201223708
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of imagined intergroup contact (Crisp & Turner, 2009) on elementary school children's explicit and implicit intergroup attitudes. Italian 5th-graders participated in a 3-week intervention involving imagining meeting an unknown immigrant peer in various situations. Approximately 1 week after the last session, they completed measures of self-disclosure and behavioral intentions toward immigrants. Furthermore, they were administered a measure of implicit prejudice. Results showed that those taking part in the intervention, compared to participants in a control condition, revealed more positive behavioral intentions and implicit attitudes toward immigrants. Moreover, self-disclosure mediated the effect of imagined contact on outgroup behavioral intentions. Theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed.

T1  - How intergroup friendship works: A longitudinal study of friendship effects on outgroup attitudes
AN  - 1018342788; 201212797
AB  - Cross-sectional research has shown that frequency of self-disclosure to outgroup members mediates the positive relationship between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes. The current research investigated the relationship between self-disclosure and attitudes in more depth. New undergraduate students were asked to nominate an ingroup or outgroup friend and then report the intimacy of their disclosures to them, their anxiety and attitudes towards a series of social groups, in the first week of the semester and 6 weeks later. Intimacy of disclosure predicted more positive attitudes towards outgroups over time, but this association was only found among participants who nominated an outgroup friend. In the ingroup friend condition, a negative association was found. These associations were mediated by general intergroup anxiety. These relationships highlight the importance of integrating theories of interpersonal and intergroup relations when investigating intergroup contact. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

AN  - 1283638415; 201303374
AB  - Using a survey of more than 5,000 American consumers, this study examines connections between attitudes toward same-sex marriage and media consumption. A positive attitude is predicted by being liberal and less religious, supporting gender and racial equality, willing to try anything once, considering television the primary form of entertainment, watching political talk shows, and reading blogs. The theoretical and methodological contributions and real-world implications of these findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "We Drink, Therefore We Are": The role of group identification and norms in sustaining and challenging heavy drinking "Culture"
AN  - 964198044; 201207174
AB  - We consider how ingroup norms, identification and individual attitudes interact when a behaviour (heavy alcohol consumption) is defining of an ingroup identity. We sampled 115 students at a UK university, measuring ingroup identification and attitudes to heavy drinking before manipulating the ingroup drinking norm (moderate vs. heavy). Heavy drinking intentions and tendencies to socially include/exclude two target students-one of whom drank alcohol regularly and one of whom did not-were measured. As predicted, participants with a positive attitude to heavy drinking and who identified strongly with the ingroup reported stronger intentions to drink heavily when the ingroup had a moderate, rather than a heavy drinking norm, indicating resistance to the normative information. A complementary pattern emerged for the social inclusion/exclusion measures. Implications for theory and interventions that focus on group norms are discussed.

T1  - Not Quite Color Blind: Ethnic and Gender Differences in Attitudes toward Older People among College Students
AN  - 1906124231
AB  - Attitudes toward older people can influence how they are treated and their cognitive and physical health. The populations of the United States and many other countries have become more ethnically diverse, and are aging. Yet little research examines how ethnic diversity affects attitudes toward older people. Our study addresses this research gap. Using the Aging Semantic Differential, 592 university students expressed their attitudes toward older African-American, Hispanic, and White women and men. Repeated measures analysis of variance examined attitude differences by participant ethnicity and gender, and by the ethnicity and gender of evaluated individuals. Both African-American and White students had more positive attitudes toward older women and men of their own ethnic group. Participants had more positive attitudes toward older women than they did toward older men. Findings suggest in-group favoritism, and the usefulness of training those in service industries and public service to treat older individuals equitably.

T1  - Factors Associated with Attributions About Child Health Conditions and Social Distance Preference
AN  - 896167249; 201121305
AB  - In order to better understand factors that account for the emergence and persistence of negative attitudes towards mental health problems, attributions about and stigma towards children's mental and physical illnesses were examined using National Stigma Study-Children data. Parent blame attributions were most strongly associated with attention deficit disorder, environmental causes with depression, and biology with asthma. Parent blame was more frequent for mental than physical health conditions. Child blame was associated with higher preferred social distance from the child, but no clear links were observed between social distance and attributions about genetic/biology, environment, or parent blame. Rurality was not significantly associated with attributions or social distance preference. Higher educational achievement was associated with increased endorsement of environmental stress factors and reduced odds of child blaming. The general public holds complex explanatory models of and nuanced responses to children's mental disorders that need further investigation, including effects on parents' and children's help-seeking.

T1  - American elementary school children's attitudes about immigrants, immigration, and being an American
AN  - 881466882; 201116356
AB  - The current study examined 5 to 11-year-old European American children's (N = 90) attitudes regarding immigrants, immigration policy, and what it means to be an American. The majority of children in the sample (from a predominantly European American community) held strong American identities and had distinct ideas about what it means to bean American (namely, one must love America, live by its rules, and be White). Children were in favor of legal immigration as a policy, and although they believed in allowing illegal immigrants to stay if employed, many younger children believed they should go to jail. Many children in the sample were aware of Americans' anti-immigration sentiments, largely attributing it to ethnic/cultural discrimination. Finally, children held negative attitudes about immigrants, particularly Mexican immigrants. These negative attitudes were most evident among children who held a strong, prototypical national in-group identity. In contrast, children did not hold differential attitudes about White and Black Americans. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Diversity Beliefs as Moderator of the Contact-Prejudice Relationship
AN  - 964196620; 201207188
AB  - Research on intergroup contact has recently begun to examine how individual differences moderate the reduction of prejudice. We extend this work by examining the moderating role of diversity beliefs, i.e., the strength of individuals' beliefs that society benefits from ethnic diversity. Results of a survey among 255 university students in the United States show that the relationship between contact and reduced prejudice is stronger for individuals holding less favorable diversity beliefs compared to those with more positive diversity beliefs. Likewise, the relationship between contact and perceived importance of contact is stronger for people with less favorable diversity beliefs. Together with previously reported moderator effects these results suggest that contact especially benefits people who are the most predisposed to being prejudiced. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Impact of the Group of Co-migrants on Strategies of Acculturation: Towards an Expansion of the Berry Model
AN  - 896197445; 201120126
AB  - This article proposes expanding Berry's theory of acculturation strategies into a three-fold model to be applied to the case of acculturation among migrants. The expanded model includes the community of co-migrants as a distinct referent. It addresses the dynamic and multi-directional relationship between the three referents and the individual migrant, which all interact to create the experience of acculturation among migrants. An expanded typology is presented representing positive or negative attitudes toward each referent. The typology delineates eight possible strategies of acculturation among migrants, namely positive attitudes towards all three referents, negative attitudes towards all three, and the six possible variations between these extremes. Though not previously conceptualized and formalized, examples of all eight strategies were found in the existing literature. Some examples are cited, supporting the assertion that in the socio-psychological phenomenon of acculturation among migrants, the community of co-migrants plays a role which may be differentiated from the home culture and the host culture referents of the Berry model. The model provides a structure for exploring expression of these acculturation strategies among various sub-groups within a community of co-migrants. The current article is essentially a hypothesis paper, citing support for each of the proposed strategies of acculturation from published empirical studies carried out among a wide variety of migrant populations. A preliminary testing of the typology (Taieb, 2008) found that the cultures of the home, host and co-migrant communities do play distinct roles in the acculturation process, and verified that the eight profiles may be recognized in an empirical study. Directions for further empirical verification and refining the preliminary model are suggested. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Similarities and Differences in the Pursuit of Intimacy among Sexual Minority and Heterosexual Individuals: A Personal Projects Analysis
AN  - 896185195; 201120137
AB  - Negative attitudes and discriminatory policies pertaining to same-sex relationships create social and structural inequalities, privileging heterosexuals' abilities to achieve intimacy while impeding the intimacy-related pursuits of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals. This study examined the pursuit of intimacy in the form of intimacy-related personal projects among a sample of 431 LGB and heterosexual individuals. LGBs and heterosexuals did not differ in how meaningful they rated their intimacy projects. LGBs perceived more devaluation and barriers to achieving their intimacy projects than heterosexuals. These differences were more pronounced at the macrosocial level (e.g., laws and policies). No significant sexual orientation differences were observed regarding participants' job-related projects, highlighting the domain specificity of project devaluation and barriers. Results suggest that the pursuit of intimacy is highly meaningful for both LGBs and heterosexuals. Nonetheless, LGBs experience minority stressors specific to their relational pursuits from both interpersonal and macrosocial sources, including discriminatory laws and policies.

T1  - Not Quite Color Blind: Ethnic and Gender Differences in Attitudes toward Older People among College Students
AN  - 1364699852; 201326861
AB  - Attitudes toward older people can influence how they are treated and their cognitive and physical health. The populations of the United States and many other countries have become more ethnically diverse, and are aging. Yet little research examines how ethnic diversity affects attitudes toward older people. Our study addresses this research gap. Using the Aging Semantic Differential, 592 university students expressed their attitudes toward older African-American, Hispanic, and White women and men. Repeated measures analysis of variance examined attitude differences by participant ethnicity and gender, and by the ethnicity and gender of evaluated individuals. Both African-American and White students had more positive attitudes toward older women and men of their own ethnic group. Participants had more positive attitudes toward older women than they did toward older men. Findings suggest in-group favoritism, and the usefulness of training those in service industries and public service to treat older individuals equitably. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - An identity-based understanding of intergroup conflict
AN  - 818797333; 201068158
AB  - As conflict has at its basis a contest of ideas, values or resources between two or more groups, a comprehensive understanding of intergroup conflict must take into account the psychological processes that make groups and group behavior meaningful. Because individuals value and internalize identities relevant to their social, geographic, economic, historical and political positions, any devaluation, loss or imposed change to one of those identities is likely to be particularly threatening. The Social Identity Approach formulates an understanding of how these identity-based motivations interact with social structures to predict intergroup conflict. Importantly, it also provides an explanation of how procedural justice mechanisms can be utilized to guide conflicting interests to common cooperative goals that can be accepted and pursued. By having representation and participation of relevant actors in the development of a shared identity, as is this case when nation states are formed or re-created, threat is reduced, legitimacy built and the basis for positive intergroup relations created.

T1  - Secondary Transfer Effects of Intergroup Contact: Alternative Accounts and Underlying Processes
AN  - 764417429; 201064651
AB  - Although intergroup contact is one of the most prominent interventions to reduce prejudice, the generalization of contact effects is still a contentious issue. This research further examined the rarely studied secondary transfer effect (STE; Pettigrew, 2009), by which contact with a primary outgroup reduces prejudice toward secondary groups that are not directly involved in the contact. Across 3 cross-sectional studies conducted in Cyprus (N = 1,653), Northern Ireland (N = 1,973), and Texas (N = 275) and 1 longitudinal study conducted in Northern Ireland (N = 411), the present research sought to systematically rule out alternative accounts of the STE and to investigate 2 potential mediating mechanisms (ingroup reappraisal and attitude generalization). Results indicated that, consistent with the STE, contact with a primary outgroup predicts attitudes toward secondary outgroups, over and above contact with the secondary outgroup, socially desirable responding, and prior attitudes. Mediation analyses found strong evidence for attitude generalization but only limited evidence for ingroup reappraisal as an underlying process. Two out of 3 tests of a reverse model, where contact with the secondary outgroup predicts attitudes toward the primary outgroup, provide further evidence for an indirect effect through attitude generalization. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed, and directions for future research are identified. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Imagining intergroup contact reduces implicit prejudice
AN  - 743053342; 201026419
AB  - Recent research has demonstrated that imagining intergroup contact can be sufficient to reduce explicit prejudice directed towards out-groups. In this research, we examined the impact of contact-related mental imagery on implicit prejudice as measured by the implicit association test. We found that, relative to a control condition, young participants who imagined talking to an elderly stranger subsequently showed more positive implicit attitudes towards elderly people in general. In a second study, we demonstrated that, relative to a control condition, non-Muslim participants who imagined talking to a Muslim stranger subsequently showed more positive implicit attitudes towards Muslims in general. We discuss the implications of these findings for furthering the application of indirect contact strategies aimed at improving intergroup relations. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Sources of Negative Attitudes toward Immigrants in Europe: A Multi-Level Analysis1
AN  - 60351428; 201017637
AB  - In recent times, many nations are experiencing an increase in anti-immigrant attitudes on the part of natives. Most papers only explore one or two sources of anti-immigrant attitudes at a time, which provides an incomplete picture of the effects at work. This paper tests eight different explanations for anti-immigrant attitudes: cultural marginality theory, human capital theory, political affiliation, societal integration, neighborhood safety, contact theory, foreign investment, and economic competition. Analysis is conducted using combined data from the European Social Survey and Eurostat-OECD and individual-, regional-, and national-level predictors. Results indicate that key predictors of anti-immigrant attitudes are regional and national interpersonal trust, education level, foreign direct investment, and political variables.
