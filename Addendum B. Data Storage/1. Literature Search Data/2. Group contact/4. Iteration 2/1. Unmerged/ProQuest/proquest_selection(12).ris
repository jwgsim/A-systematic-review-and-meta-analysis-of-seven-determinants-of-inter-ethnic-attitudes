T1  - Public beliefs about the black/white socioeconomic status gap: What's “upbringing” got to do with it?*
AN  - 2642200975
AB  - ObjectiveCiting the black family as the locus of responsibility for black disadvantage has a long history in the United States; however, only limited research has examined the place of family upbringing in studies of Americans’ beliefs about the causes of racial inequality.MethodsWe use data from the 2010, 2012, and 2014 General Social Surveys (GSS) to examine the prevalence and selected correlates of a newly offered (by the GSS) and culturally centered explanation of the black/white socioeconomic status gap focusing on “differences in upbringing.”ResultsThe “upbringing” explanation is the most popular of the five reasons offered by the GSS in all three waves of data available for examination. Three‐quarters of GSS respondents endorse this view, while less than half endorse the next most popular explanation. Upbringing is also the most popular explanation among all three race/ethnic groups we examine, though non‐Hispanic whites endorse this view most strongly.ConclusionOur results offer important insights for future survey design and investigations of public beliefs about racial inequality.

T1  - Age Diversity Climate Affecting Individual-Level Work-Related Outcomes
AN  - 2637699070
AB  - The present study answers the call for more studies to investigate the age diversity climate’s effect on individual-level outcomes. Building on the social identity approach and social exchange theory, we surveyed 110 Italian employees aged between 18 and 61 years old (M = 46.10, SD = 10.02) and investigated the role of age diversity climate in predicting intentions to quit (H1), job-related wellbeing (H2), and work engagement (H3). Our findings confirmed the hypotheses (H1 and H2), showing the added effect of age diversity climate over and above age, job tenure, role clarity, job demands, job control, perceived support, and perceived job and organizational fit. In fact, age diversity climate accounted for a significant increase in the variance explained for two of the three hypothesized models (i.e., intentions to quit and job-related wellbeing, but not work engagement). To conclude, this study contributes to the existing literature by showing the age diversity climate’s predictive value for turnover intentions and job-related wellbeing, and corroborating the importance of supporting age diversity through a variety of Human Resources Management strategies.

T1  - Mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic in India: an in-depth exploration of challenges and opportunities for three vulnerable population groups
AN  - 2625204120
AB  - PurposeThe COVID-19 pandemic is certain to have an unprecedented impact on the global population, but marginalized and vulnerable groups in low-income countries (LICs) are predicted to carry the largest burden. This study focuses on the implications of COVID-19-related measures on three population groups in India, including (1) migrant laborers (of which a majority come from Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), as well as Other Backward Classes (OBCs)), (2) children from low-income families and, (3) refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs).Design/methodology/approachThis study adopts a sequential mixed-method research design. A desk-based study of a selection of government reports was undertaken on the COVID-19-related mitigation measures. The desk study was followed by in-depth interviews with purposively recruited high-ranking experts in specific sectors of policy implementation and service delivery across the country.FindingsThe outcomes of this study shed light on (1) the most urgent needs that need to be addressed per population group, (2) the variety of state-level responses as well as best practices observed to deal with mitigation issues and (3) opportunities for quick relief as well as more long-term solutions.Practical implicationsThe COVID-19 pandemic has not only reduced people's means of maintaining a livelihood but has simultaneously revealed some of India's long-standing problems with infrastructure and resource distribution in a range of sectors, including nutrition and health, education, etc. There is an urgent need to construct effective pathways to trace and respond to those people who are desolate, and to learn from – and support – good practices at the grassroot level.Originality/valueThe current study contributes to the discussion on how inclusive public health might be reached.

T1  - The taboo against contact with minorities: A folk‐anthropology approach to prejudices
AN  - 2607918280
AB  - In contrast to the classic theory of contact among groups to combat prejudice against the outgroup (Allport, 1954), we propose the theory of the taboo of contact according to which prejudice against minorities does not arise due to lack of contact, but precisely in order to avoid contact. We summarise a series of themata whereby in the West the majority's fears of losing the purity of their religious, ethnic, or racial identity have been ontologised in four minorities (Jews, gypsies, natives, and black people). The hypothesis is that the greater the proximity to – or danger of mixing with – those vilified minorities, the greater the taboo of contact will be. We conclude that the prejudice against minorities who are victims of current ethnic and racial discrimination is an hysteresis effect of folk‐anthropology themata.

T1  - "Come and share a story with me": Promoting engagement between Ethiopian and Non-Ethiopian Israelis via joint digital narratives
AN  - 2617692357
AB  - Does building a collaborative digital story lead to reduction of intergroup tension? Studies show that joint storytelling can help reach deeper levels of understanding through exposure to another group's narrative. We hypothesized that engagement in a collaborative digital storytelling task would lead to reductions of negative emotions and attitudes. In our study, dyads of Ethiopian and non-Ethiopian Israelis interacted via a unique digital platform that supports storytelling in a comics-like format aiming to reduce intergroup tension. Their responses to this task were measured before and after the joint activity. Findings showed a decrease in negative emotional states in intergroup contexts (STAI) between pre-and post-intervention for members of both groups, and a slight decrease in negative attitudes toward the out-group. In other words, joint-digital storytelling sessions lead groups in complex relations to be more likely to support engagement. This study has implications for the effect of contact on intergroup tension.

T1  - Why Do Immigrant and Swedish Adolescents Engage in Ethnic Victimization? Common and Distinct Underlying Factors
AN  - 2580805930
AB  - Youth of immigrant background are at risk of experiencing victimization due to their ethnic or cultural background. However, limited knowledge is available regarding why youth victimize their immigrant peers, and whether the factors associated with engagement in ethnic victimization vary across adolescents of different background. To address this gap in knowledge, the present study aimed to elucidate the common or differential factors associated with engagement in ethnic victimization among immigrant and native youth. The analytical sample included seventh grade students residing in Sweden from 55 classrooms (N = 963, Mage = 13.11, SD = 0.41; 46% girls; 38% youth of immigrant background). The results showed that being morally disengaged and engaging in general victimization are the common denominators of engagement in ethnic victimization for immigrant and Swedish youth. Low levels of positive attitudes toward immigrants provide a foundation for ethnic victimization among Swedish youth, but not youth of immigrant background. Classroom ethnic composition was not significantly related to engagement in ethnic victimization in either group. Predictors of engagement in ethnic victimization seem to have similarities and differences among immigrant and Swedish youth. The factors involved require further attention in developing strategies to combat bias-based hostile behaviors in diverse school settings.

T1  - Contact-implicit preference relationships: Two large sample tests
AN  - 2567817337
AB  - This work examines relationships between friendships and implicit preferences across two large samples. There is considerable evidence in the contact literature suggesting that friendships relate to more favorable attitudes toward outgroups, however, most evidence reflects explicit self-report measures. Using samples of 235,543 participants who completed the Disability IAT and 533,220 participants who completed the Sexuality IAT on the Project Implicit website, results indicate that participants reporting either a disabled friend or close acquaintance demonstrated weaker implicit preferences for abled over disabled people. Similarly, those with gay friends demonstrated weaker implicit preference for “straight” over gay. The size of these relationships were considerably smaller than found for explicit evaluations. These effect size estimates should be useful to researchers studying contact-implicit preference relationships as it informs power analyses and sample size planning decisions.

T1  - In the Ear of the Listener: The Role of Foreign Accent in Interethnic Friendships and Partnerships: IMR
AN  - 2560029905
AB  - This article examines the association between accented speech and the formation of friendships and partnerships among immigrants and native-born majority residents in Germany. Drawing on the sixth wave of the German extension of the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries, we analyze a neglected aspect of language — pronunciation — and find that speaking with a foreign accent is a more important correlate of the incidence of interethnic partnerships than of interethnic friendships. We argue that beyond its primary function of understandability, accented speech possesses socially communicative power. Accent transmits signals of an individual’s foreignness and cultural differences and, thus, becomes an additional marker of social distance. Such signals serve as a greater obstacle to more consequential intimate interethnic relations such as partnerships. Our findings extend the scholarly debate on the role of symbolic boundaries in social interactions between ethnic groups by yet another important boundary maker — accent.

T1  - ‘Peasants are peasants’: Prejudice against displaced villagers in newly-built urban neighbourhoods in China
AN  - 2526045791
AB  - This article explores contemporary prejudice against displaced villagers in urban China, drawing on a project on urban sprawl in Yinchuan where rural villages are absorbed into the urban area. The research demonstrates that media discourses about chaiqian baofahu and suzhi that stigmatise displaced villagers are being actively reproduced in everyday life in newly built urban neighbourhoods. Urbanites’ prejudice against displaced villagers can be viewed as, on the one hand, a result of the feelings of relative deprivation from unfavourable comparisons with displaced villagers, while on the other hand, a response to maintain a positive ingroup identity – in this case, an urban and ‘civilised’ way of life. The article then examines the effectiveness of contact as a means for reducing prejudice, and reveals that intergroup contact in urban neighbourhoods does not necessarily create mutual understanding and trust. The article highlights the structural causes of prejudice and concludes by arguing for social transformation to challenge and reduce prejudice.

T1  - A matter of flexibility: Changing outgroup attitudes through messages with negations
AN  - 2518431192
AB  - Attitudes toward outgroups are an important determinant of peaceful coexistence in diverse societies, but it is difficult to improve them. The current research studies the impact of messages with negations on outgroup attitudes, more specifically on outgroup trust. All studies were preregistered. Using different target groups, Studies 1 and 2 provide evidence for the prediction that communicating negations (e.g., "they are not deceptive") enhances outgroup trust (more so than affirmations, such as "they are reliable," and no messages) among people who are initially low in outgroup trust. Three additional studies (Studies 3a, 3b, and 4), using both a causal chain approach and (moderated) mediation analysis, demonstrate that negations promote cognitive flexibility which in turn enhances outgroup trust among those initially low in outgroup trust. One final study suggests that these findings generalize to outgroup attitude change per se by showing that communicating negations also results in more moderate attitudes when the dominant initial attitude is positive (Study 5: high warmth) rather than negative (Studies 1–4: low trustworthiness). As such, communication that negates people's initial outgroup attitudes could be an effective (previously discounted) intervention to reduce prejudice in intergroup settings.

T1  - A Comparison of Juror Decision Making in Race-Based and Sexual Orientation–Based Hate Crime Cases
AN  - 2502151686
AB  - Several constructs have been identified as relevant to the juror decision-making process in hate crime cases. However, there is a lack of research on the relationships between these constructs and their variable influence across victim group. The purpose of the current study was to reexamine factors relevant to the juror decision-making process in hate crime cases within a structural model, and across victim group, to gauge the relative strength and explanatory power of various predictors. In the current study, 313 participants sentenced a perpetrator found guilty of a hate crime committed against either a Black man or a gay man; participants also responded to individual difference measures relevant to mock juror hate crime decision making, including prejudice toward the victim’s social group. Using path analysis, we explored the role of juror prejudice on sentencing decisions in hate crime cases as well as similarities and differences based on the victimized group. Results indicated that, when the victim was a Black man, modern racism influenced sentencing both directly and indirectly through perpetrator blame attributions, explaining 18% of the variance in sentencing. In contrast, when the victim was a gay man, modern homophobia did not directly predict sentencing, and the overall model explained only 4% of the variance in sentencing, suggesting variables beyond juror prejudice may be better suited to explain juror decision making in sexual orientation–based hate crimes. The current study suggests that the role of juror prejudice in hate crime cases varies as a function of the victimized group and raises questions about the importance of juror prejudice in the sentencing of hate crime cases, particularly antigay prejudice. The importance of blame attributions, social dominance orientation, and juror beliefs regarding penalty enhancements for hate crime cases, as well as policy implications, are also addressed.

T1  - How Often Have You Felt Disadvantaged? Explaining Perceived Discrimination
AN  - 2534814128
AB  - Based on longitudinal data from Germany, we analyze how perceptions of discrimination change once migrants’ integration evolves. Individuals who identify more strongly with the host country, speak the language, have native friends, and are adequately employed report less discrimination overall. However, group-specific analyses reveal that German-born Turks feel more rather than less discriminated against after their language skills and their identification increase. For this group, we find evidence for the “integration paradox”, i.e., the finding that better educated migrants have more rather than less negative attitudes about the host society. Results suggest that attributional processes rather than rising exposure to discrimination might be the main mechanism linking integration to higher levels of perceived discrimination. Obviously, discrimination does not disappear for groups facing salient ethnic boundaries and is met with growing awareness and sensitivity among individuals that have become more similar to the majority of members. This, in turn, by no means implies that perceived discrimination is detached from reality.

T1  - Outgroup prejudice and perceptions of prosocial intergroup behaviors
AN  - 2509211723
AB  - How people perceive outgroup prosocial behaviors is an important but under‐researched aspect of intergroup relations. In three experiments conducted in two cultural contexts (Italy and Kosovo) and with two different populations (adolescents and adults; N = 586), we asked participants to imagine being offered help by an outgroup versus ingroup member. Participants attributed fewer prosocial motives to and were less willing to accept help from the outgroup (vs. ingroup) member. This was particularly true for highly prejudiced participants and when the outgroup was described negatively. Participants' perceptions of the outgroup helper's prosocial motives and expected quality of the interaction with the helper mediated the effect of helper's group membership on willingness to accept the help (Experiment 3). We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for intergroup relations.

T1  - The affective lives of doubled‐up Latinx youth: Influences of school experiences, familism, and ethnic identity exploration
AN  - 2457200409
AB  - Doubled‐up Latinx youth experience many daily challenges associated with ethnic minority status and residential instability. Doubled‐up youth share housing with noncustodial caregivers such as friends and/or extended family members primarily because of economic hardship and a breakdown in available parental support. Using data from baseline and 10 days of twice‐a‐day surveys, this study examined how in‐school positive experiences, familism (i.e., a perspective that gives precedence to the family), and ethnic identity (i.e., affirmation, exploration, and resolution) influence after school positive (e.g., feeling joyful/happy) and negative (e.g., feeling stressed/anxious) affect among doubled‐up Latinx youth (70% female; Mage = 16.5). Results indicate that in‐school positive experiences were associated with more after school positive affect and less after school negative affect. In addition, youth with higher levels of familism reported experiencing less after school negative affect. However, gender moderated the relation of ethnic identity exploration and experiences of after school positive affect. Specifically, females with higher levels of ethnic identity exploration reported relatively lower levels of after school positive affect compared with males. Overall, study findings highlight the importance of both person‐level and varying contextual influences on the affective lives of doubled‐up Latinx youth.Alternate abstract:Practitioner Points1) Doubled‐up Latinx youth (i.e., youth who share housing with a series of friends and/or extended family) encounter complex and challenging experiences in their daily lives, such as prejudice and residential instability, which can place them at a higher risk for emotional difficulties and mental health concerns.2) The current study's main findings revealed that daily positive school experiences and cultural factors (i.e., familism and ethnic identity) were positively associated with youth's end‐of‐day positive affect and negatively associated with end‐of‐day negative affect.3) These findings support the notion that culture and context are necessary to consider in supporting Latinx youth to cultivate a pattern of daily resilience in spite of their unstable residential circumstances.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Opposition to Same-Sex Parents: the Mediation Effect of Satisfaction with Contact
AN  - 2449451148
AB  - IntroductionThe intergroup contact variable has been widely studied in the literature, and it has been shown to be closely related to less prejudice. The present article analyzes the role of an affective mediator in the relationship between the degree of contact-rejection of the outgroup (same-sex parents) variables, linked to the variable quality of contact or satisfaction with contact with people with a homosexual sexual orientation.MethodsThe sample is composed of 401 Spanish university students (67 males, 16.2%, and 347 females, 83.8%) with a mean age of 21 years (SD = 3.20). The data collection took place between November 2016 and March 2017.ResultsThe results show a complete mediation effect in the case of open or traditional prejudice (individual opposition), and partial mediation when analyzing modern or subtle rejection of same-sex parents (normative opposition).ConclusionsOur findings suggest that efforts to reduce the rejection of same-sex parents must take into account the individual’s positive evaluation of the contact because it is a mechanism that mediates the relationship between degree of contact and rejection.Social policy implicationsHomophobia intervention programs must consider the intergroup contact variable, taking into account that it is also necessary to act on positive emotions and affectivity toward relationships with people with a homosexual sexual orientation. Increasing positive contact with same-sex parents could be a key element in reducing rejection toward the effects of their child-rearing on their children.

T1  - Good Cop, Bad Cop: Race-Based Differences in Mental Representations of Police
AN  - 2429413282
AB  - The current work investigates race-based biases in conceptualization of the facial appearance of police. We employ a reverse correlation procedure to demonstrate that Black Americans, relative to White Americans, conceptualize police officers’ faces as more negative, less positive, and more dominant. We further find that these differential representations have implications for interactions with police. When naïve participants (of various races) viewed images of police officers generated by Black Americans (relative to those generated by White Americans), they responded with greater anticipated anxiety and reported more fight-or-flight behavioral intentions. Across four studies, findings suggest Black and White Americans conceptualize police and police–citizen interactions fundamentally differently. These findings have important theoretical (e.g., using reverse correlation to document the mental representations held by minority group members) and practical implications (e.g., identifying race-based differences in representations of police that may affect community–police relations).

T1  - Population Diversity and Ancestral Diversity As Distinct Contributors to Outgroup Prejudice
AN  - 2401735316
AB  - Previous research has shown conflicting findings on how population diversity influences outgroup prejudice. In some cases, prejudice is greater when minority groups make up a larger portion of the population, whereas in other cases, prejudice is lower as diversity increases. This article examined how the diversity of a culture’s ancestry—or its historical heterogeneity—would be related to outgroup attitudes. Historically heterogeneous populations descend from ancestors who have migrated from many parts of the world over the past 500 years and, as a result, have a longer legacy of contact with diverse groups of people. The results of two cross-cultural studies found that greater heterogeneity predicted lower levels of outgroup prejudice, and some evidence that diversity in the current population was related to increased prejudice. The findings suggest that intergroup attitudes have deeply entrenched roots that cannot be fully understood by looking at current indicators.

T1  - What children want to know about in‐ and out‐groups, and how knowledge affects their intergroup attitudes
AN  - 2388834772
AB  - One of the key factors contributing to the development of negative attitudes toward out‐groups is lack of knowledge about them. The present study investigated what type of information 3‐ to 4‐ and 5‐ to 6‐ year‐old Jewish Israeli children (N = 82) are interested in acquiring about unfamiliar in‐ and out‐group individuals, and how providing children with the requested information affects their intergroup attitudes. Children were shown pictures of individuals from three groups—an in‐group (“Jews”), a “conflict” out‐group (“Arabs”), and a “neutral” out‐group (“Scots”)—and were asked what they would like to know about them. The experimenter responded by either answering all of children's questions, half of the questions, or none. Children's attitudes toward the groups were also assessed. It was found that children asked the most questions in regard to conflict out‐group individuals. Moreover, the older age group asked more questions regarding the psychological characteristics, and fewer questions regarding the social identity, of the conflict out‐group than of the other two groups. Finally, full provision of information improved attitudes toward the groups, especially among 3‐ to 4‐year olds, and especially regarding the conflict out‐group. These findings have implications for understanding the sources of intergroup biases, and for developing interventions to reduce them.

T1  - Searching for a Roommate: A Correspondence Audit Examining Racial/Ethnic and Immigrant Discrimination among Millennials
AN  - 2474445826
AB  - Survey research finds that millennials have less prejudiced views of racial/ethnic minorities than other generations, leading some to label millennials as postracial. However, attitudinal survey research may be subject to social desirability bias because it documents statements or beliefs instead of actions. Moreover, most audit studies focus on people who make hiring decisions or own rental property and are therefore often older than millennials. This study uses a correspondence audit to investigate discrimination among millennials via “roommate wanted” advertisements. We sent over 4,000 emails and found a tiered pattern of discrimination against Asian (Indian and Chinese), Hispanic, and Black room-seekers. However, whether Asian and Hispanic room-seekers face significant discrimination varies based on whether they use predominantly White first names or traditional first names. Our findings shed light on the future of our racial system, expand our knowledge of discrimination beyond the traditional Black/White binary, and illustrate the persistence of anti-Blackness.

T1  - Bean Preferences Vary by Acculturation Level among Latinas and by Ethnicity with Non-Hispanic White Women
AN  - 2383588133
AB  - With high levels of protein, fiber, folate, iron and other micronutrients, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends eating beans for optimal nutrition. Low-income women are at greater risk of nutrition-related health disparities. Use of beans may change among Hispanic women (Latinas) during acculturation, but few studies exist that describe specific preferences of this important traditional food. Preserving or promoting beans in the diets of all low-income women could improve dietary quality. The study objectives were to describe consumption frequency, purchasing patterns, and attitudes toward dry and canned beans, by acculturation level among Latinas and by ethnicity with non-Hispanic White women. Survey data were collected from 356 women (µ 32 y ± 9 y; 81% Latina), who were enrolled in, or eligible for, a federal nutrition assistance, or unemployment, program in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. Participants had positive attitudes toward beans overall. Less acculturated and bicultural Latinas bought dry beans more often than their peers. Price was considered important in canned bean selection for Non-Hispanic White women, and less acculturated Latinas had poorer attitudes toward canned. Awareness of these attitudes and preferred traits of low-income women suggests ways to message populations to maintain or increase bean consumption. Negative views of canned beans by Latinas should be investigated further. Inclusion of canned beans in nutrition assistance programs may benefit those unfamiliar with preparing dry beans.

T1  - Economic conditions, group relative deprivation and ethnic threat perceptions: a cross-national perspective
AN  - 2376776340
AB  - Explaining negative attitudes towards immigration in general and threat due to immigration, in particular, has been a major topic of study in recent decades. While intergroup contact has received considerable attention in explaining ethnic threat, group relative deprivation (GRD), that is, feelings that one’s group is unfairly deprived of desirable goods in comparison to relevant out-groups, has been largely ignored in cross-national research. Nevertheless, various smaller-scale studies have demonstrated that GRD can have a decisive impact on prejudice. In the current study, we examine the association between GRD and ethnic threat systematically across 20 European countries, thereby controlling for intergroup contact and value priorities. The 7th round of the European Social Survey (ESS) includes questions assessing respondents’ feelings of group deprivation compared to immigrants and offers for the first time an opportunity to contextualise the threat-inducing effect of GRD across Europe. A multilevel structural equation model (MLSEM) demonstrates a considerable association between GRD and ethnic threat both on the individual and country levels. The results indicate that GRD is not only an important mediating factor between social structural positions and perceived threat, but also fully mediates the relation between contextual economic indicators and ethnic threat.

T1  - A collective blame hypocrisy intervention enduringly reduces hostility towards Muslims
AN  - 2344289312
AB  - Hostility towards outgroups contributes to costly intergroup conflict. Here we test an intervention to reduce hostility towards Muslims, a frequently targeted outgroup. Our ‘collective blame hypocrisy’ intervention highlights the hypocrisy involved in the tendency for people to collectively blame outgroup but not ingroup members for blameworthy actions of individual group members. Using both within-subject and between-subject comparisons in a preregistered longitudinal study in Spain, we find that our intervention reduces collective blame of Muslims and downstream anti-Muslim sentiments relative to a matched control condition and that the effects of the intervention persist one month and also one year later. We replicate the benefits of the intervention in a second study. The effects are mediated by reductions in collective blame and moderated by individual differences in preference for consistency. Together, these data illustrate that the collective blame hypocrisy intervention enduringly reduces harmful intergroup attitudes associated with conflict escalation, particularly among those who value consistency in themselves and others.An intervention highlighting the hypocrisy involved in blaming Muslims but not ingroup members reduces collective blame of Muslims. This reduction was maintained for a year, despite an attack by Muslim extremists that was carried out during this time.

T1  - Teaching Note—Learning About Segregation and Cultural Competence
AN  - 2474294712
AB  - The Council on Social Work Education requires students to understand how diversity and difference shape human experience. But segregation prevents students from appreciating the circumstances of others’ lives and how widely human experience differs by race, religion, and other social identities. This teaching note presents the Social Contact Survey, a pedagogical tool designed to help students understand their level of segregation, its effect on their daily lives, and its relationship to social work practice. Aversive racism and intergroup contact theories suggest a relationship between segregation and prejudice and frame the survey. Following a review of the literature and theory, the survey instrument and pedagogical suggestions are provided.

T1  - All the lonely people, where do they all belong? An interpretive synthesis of loneliness and social support in older lesbian, gay and bisexual communities
TT  - An interpretive synthesis of loneliness
AN  - 2307086608
AB  - PurposeLoneliness is a phenomenon which affects people globally and constitutes a key social issue of our time. Yet few studies have considered the nature of loneliness and social support for older lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people; this is of particular concern as they are among the social groups said to be at greater risk. The paper aims to discuss this issue.Design/methodology/approachPeer-reviewed literature was identified through a search of Scopus, PsycINFO and PubMed. A total of 2,277 papers were retrieved including qualitative and quantitative studies which were quality assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme.FindingsIn total, 11 papers were included in the review and findings were synthesised using thematic analysis. The studies were conducted in five countries worldwide with a combined sample size of 53,332 participants, of whom 4,288 were drawn from among LGB communities. The characteristics and circumstances associated with loneliness including living arrangements, housing tenure, minority stress and geographical proximity.Research limitations/implicationsThe review suggests that among older LGB people, living alone, not being partnered and being childfree may increase the risk of loneliness. This cohort of older people may experience greater difficulties in building relationships of trust and openness. They may also have relied on sources of identity-based social support that are in steep decline. Future research should include implementation studies to evaluate effective strategies in reducing loneliness among older LGB people.Practical implicationsReaching older LGB people who are vulnerable due to physical mobility or rural isolation and loneliness because of bereavement or being a carer is a concern. A range of interventions including individual (befriending), group-based (for social contact) in addition to potential benefits from the Internet of Things should be evaluated. Discussions with the VCS suggest that take up of existing provision is 85:15 GB men vs LB women.Social implicationsFormal social support structures which were provided by voluntary sector agencies have been disproportionately affected by recent austerity measures.Originality/valueThe authors sought to interrogate the tension between findings of lower levels of social support and discourses of resilient care offered by families of choice.

T1  - The mobilizing and protective role of national identification in normative and non‐normative collective action
AN  - 2287775379
AB  - In the context of the financial crisis in Europe and drawing on social identity and perceived disadvantage literature, this research explored national identification, perceived prejudice, perceived ostracism, and anger as predictors of intentions to engage in normative collective action and support for non‐normative and destructive action. Correlational data were collected in Greece (N = 218), Portugal (N = 312), and Italy (N = 211) during the financial crisis that affected several European countries in the early 2010s. Hierarchical regressions showed that national identification, above and beyond all other variables, positively predicted normative collective action intentions, and negatively predicted support for non‐normative action. That is, people who were identified more strong with their national identity were more likely to report that they will engage in collective action to enhance the position of their (national) in‐group, and less likely to support destructive collective action. Mediation analyses revealed that in the case of Portugal and Italy, national identification associated negatively with anger, while anger positively predicted normative collective action. The findings of this research point to the importance of national identification as a factor, that, on the one hand motivates people's mobilization toward supporting the rights of the ingroup but on the other hand impedes the more negative and destructive side of collective action. The contextual and instrumental role of national identity in contexts of threat is discussed.

T1  - Sport and peacebuilding in post-conflict societies: the role of Open Fun Football Schools in Kosovo
TT  - Sport and peacebuilding in post-conflict societies
AN  - 2246112641
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to fill the gap in the research literature on how sport can be used more productively as a peacebuilding device in post-conflict countries.Design/methodology/approachThis paper uses interviewing method that includes both semi-structured and unstructured interviews with trainers, instructors and children involved in implementing Open Fun Football Schools (OFFSs) in Kosovo.FindingsFindings show that OFFSs have played a vital role in peacebuilding in Kosovo by bringing together people from different ethnic backgrounds in Kosovo, which contributed to social inclusion of Albanians and Serbs, and other communities by changing their initial attitudes toward one another.Research limitations/implicationsThe main research limitation is the usage of semi-structured and unstructured questionnaires instead of structured questionnaires, which would provide more generalized conclusions about the OFFSs. More research is needed on this topic to investigate the effect of similar programs in other country contexts.Practical implicationsThe most important practical implication of the research is that conflict mitigation through football sports programs and activities can be used in other similar contexts by donors and the international community. OFFSs offer a hope for peacebuilding, and if adequately implemented can contribute to peacebuilding in post-conflict societies similar to Kosovo’s context. The positive attitude changes as a result of participation in the OFFS programs shows that these joint programs can promote better ethnic relations. There is a need for the expansion of such programs to reach more people.Originality/valueThe study provides an original contribution as there has been almost no prior research which actually measured the effects of OFFSs on change of youth attitudes through the integrated sport programs with different ethnicity in Kosovo.

T1  - Differentiated Threat and the Genesis of Prejudice: Group-Specific Antecedents of Homonegativity, Islamophobia, Anti-Semitism, and Anti-Immigrant Attitudes
AN  - 2237858780
AB  - In this article, we argue that an exclusive focus on the generalized aspect of prejudice limits understanding of the structure and genesis of prejudice towards particular outgroups. In order to conceptualize the specific nature of particular prejudices, we propose the differentiated threat approach. This framework postulates that different outgroups challenge diverse realistic and symbolic interests, and that these outgroup specific threats affect various socioeconomic strata and cultural groups differentially. The differentiated threat approach is applied to analyse majority-group Belgians' attitudes towards immigrants, Muslims, Jews, and homosexuals. The results show that a common denominator of prejudice can be distinguished, but that the prejudices towards the various outgroups contain substantively relevant unique components that are influenced by socio-demographic and attitudinal predictors in diverging ways. Gender traditionalism is found to reinforce Homonegativity and temper Islamophobia at the same time. Feelings of relative deprivation are more strongly related to Islamophobia than to other forms of prejudice, and are unrelated to homonegativity. Religious involvement plays a more decisive role in the formation of anti-Semitism and Homonegativity than it does in the other forms of prejudice. Anti-immigration attitudes show a class gradient that is absent in attitudes towards other outgroups. Our results evidence that the concrete realization of attitudes towards a specific outgroup cannot be understood without paying attention to structural and contextual factors, such as social positions, the nature of intergroup relations, power balances, and elite discourses.

AN  - 2268284260
AB  - In this article, new knowledge related to managing gender bias provides a context to discuss women in leadership. This study explored how women on corporate boards coped with gender bias. Social identity theory and the role congruity theory of prejudice provided a conceptual lens of the study. Through semistructured interviews with six women on corporate boards from Canada, reflective journaling, and analysis ofphysical artifacts related to women revealed seven emergent themes using Yin's five phases of analysis. The findings of this study can be used by women to be more effective in managing gender bias in their leadership roles.

T1  - An association between multiculturalism and psychological distress
AN  - 2151195466
AB  - Amidst increasing focus on rising rates of substance abuse and suicide among white Americans and extending prior research on intergroup attitudes and health, this study examines a novel factor associated with psychological distress: disagreement with multiculturalism. Using the Portraits of American Life Study (N = 2,292), logistic regressions indicate that for Whites and Hispanics, increased likelihood of psychological distress (depression, hopelessness and worthlessness) is associated with stronger disagreement with multiculturalism, measured as “If we want to create a society where people get along, we must recognize that each ethnic group has the right to maintain its own unique traditions.” For Blacks, however, attitudes toward multiculturalism are not associated with psychological distress. Future research might determine if these results can be replicated, and if so, identify the causal mechanism(s) at work.

T1  - Intergroup Threat and the Linguistic Intergroup Bias: A Stress Biomarker Study
AN  - 2127083072
AB  - This study investigates the physiological consequences of derogation. In the face of an ingroup threat, an opportunity to derogate the outgroup is associated with increases in salivary cortisol, a stress biomarker. These findings support the intergroup anxiety model, which suggests that following an anxiety-inducing threatening experience, outgroup evaluations can amplify emotional reactions and stress. In this study, we investigated whether threatened participants who derogated would show higher cortisol levels. Canadian undergraduates (N = 169) read either a threatening or favourable passage about Canadians. They then engaged in either a linguistic intergroup bias (LIB) or control task. Salivary samples were collected prethreat, postthreat, and posttask. The results suggest that ingroup threat was associated with increases in cortisol levels. Threatened participants who displayed LIB showed higher cortisol levels than those who were threatened and did not show LIB. These findings illustrate the importance of incorporating a neuroscientific approach.

T1  - Machismo Predicts Prejudice Toward Lesbian and Gay Individuals: Testing a Mediating Role of Contact
AN  - 1968295286
AB  - This study examined the relationship between traditional machismo and prejudice toward lesbian and gay individuals as mediated by contact in a Latino college sample. Gender was examined as a potential moderator. Undergraduate students from a public university in South Texas (128 males and 447 females; mean age = 22.1. SD = 4.75) completed online measures of prejudice toward lesbian and gay individuals, machismo, and contact experience with lesbian and gay individuals. Contact significantly mediated the relationship between machismo and anti-gay prejudice, yet this indirect effect was relatively small. Significant direct and indirect effects of machismo on prejudiced attitudes toward lesbian and gay individuals were found. Gender did not moderate the relationship between machismo and contact. Our findings suggest that efforts to reduce Latinos’ prejudice toward gay men and lesbian women should take cultural views toward gender roles into consideration. Increased positive contact experience with lesbian and gay individuals may be a possible avenue to decrease anti-gay prejudice that stems from heightened traditional machismo.

T1  - Linguistic Cultural Capital among Descendants of Mixed Couples in Catalonia, Spain: Realities and Inequalities
AN  - 2081349727
AB  - Spain, along with the region of Catalonia in particular, has seen a significant increase in mixed unions between immigrants and natives, which, in turn, has given rise to a growing number of young people with mixed origins. Yet little is known about how these mixed families and individuals negotiate cultural differences and view their 'mixed cultural capital.' Drawing on 29 in-depth interviews with youth of diverse mixed cultural, racial, and religious backgrounds residing in Catalonia and 58 in-depth interviews with immigrants in mixed unions, this paper focuses on the role of language as a form of cultural capital. Do mixed families use a number of languages in their everyday lives? Which languages are transmitted, preferred, and used, and why? We find that mixed families are generally multilingual, as the knowledge of different languages is thought to contribute to communication with relatives, social integration, and social mobility. However, children and youth of mixed descent who belong to minoritized ethnic or racial groups may resist learning or actively using the language of their immigrant parent to avoid stigmatization and socially imposed categories of 'foreignness.' Therefore, stigmatization and prejudice may be limiting linguistic cultural capital - a key benefit of mixedness - in Catalonia.

T1  - Who should be on the $10 and $20 bills? Preferences based on gender, sexism, race, racism, political affiliation, and political ideology
AN  - 2051120135
AB  - In June 2015, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced that a woman would replace Hamilton on the $10 bill. In April 2016, it announced that Harriet Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill, instead. After each announcement, we surveyed nationally representative samples of American adults and asked them what they thought of these proposed changes for the $10 bill (Study 1, N = 209) and the $20 bill (Study 2, N = 208). Predictors of currency preferences were gender, race, political affiliation and their respective prejudices and biases—sexism, racism, and political ideology. On the basis of social identity, system justification, and social dominance theories we predicted that privileged groups (i.e., males, Whites) and groups who desire to maintain the status quo (i.e., Republicans, conservatives, sexist and racist individuals) would prefer to leave Hamilton on the $10 bill and Jackson on the $20 bill. Results were consistent with these predictions: Overall, we found that under‐represented groups and more liberal individuals support the proposals from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. These findings suggest a bill of money is not just a piece of paper. The person depicted on U.S. currency can be perceived as an in‐group or out‐group member and this can affect judgements in line with relevant social psychological theories.

T1  - TORN IN CONTRADICTORY DIRECTIONS: WORKING CLASS AMBIVALENCE AND THE POLITICS OF DECLINE IN A CASE-STUDY EXAMPLE
AN  - 2298711032
AB  - We argue that one of the primary issues in the recent Presidential election of 2016 was the rise of a new racialized identity among non-college educated whites. Donald Trump became the Republican nominee based largely on overt racism against Mexicans in particular, and ethnocentrism against Muslims and foreigners more generally. His success legitimated the so-called alt-right, a collection of right-wing racists and assorted invasion conspiracies about non-white and Islamic takeover of the United States. This paper uses a case-study dataset to consider the attitudes of a white working-class non-college population. Results show strongly ambivalent attitudes about race and cultural freedom. We place these findings within the decline of the middle-class in the United States but also within longstanding prejudice and paranoia in American social identity.

T1  - Racial Attitudes of PreK-12 and Postsecondary Educators: Descriptive Evidence From Nationally Representative Data
AN  - 1943426023
AB  - PreK-12 and postsecondary educators' racial attitudes have important consequences for students' learning and development, yet we know little about educators' racial attitudes overall, how their attitudes might differ from those of noneducators, or how attitudes might be changing over time. I investigate these questions using the nationally representative General Social Survey. Some educators hold worrisome racial attitudes, yet compared to noneducators, educators are less opposed to governmental equalizing efforts, give more politically liberal explanations for racial inequalities, express less negative racial stereotypes, and report less social distance and collective resentments toward minoritized groups. Many educator/noneducator differences were explained by demographics, particularly education level. Time trends mostly show progress in Americans' racial attitudes, with generally similar trends for educators and noneducators.

T1  - Racial attitude (dis)similarity and liking in same-race minority interactions: GPIR
AN  - 1928333122
AB  - Two studies investigate the relationship between racial attitude (dis)similarity and interpersonal liking for racial minorities and Whites in same-race and cross-race pairs. In nationally representative and local samples, minorities report personally caring about racial issues more than Whites do (Pilot Study), which we theorize makes racial attitude divergence with ingroup members especially disruptive. Both established friendships (Study 1) and face-to-face interactions among strangers (Study 2) provided evidence for the dissimilarity-repulsion hypothesis in same-race interactions for minorities but not Whites. For minorities, disagreeing with a minority partner or friend about racial attitudes decreased their positivity toward that person. Because minorities typically report caring about race more than Whites, same-race friendships involving shared racial attitudes may be particularly critical sources of social support for them, particularly in predominately White contexts. Understanding challenges that arise in same-race interactions, not just cross-race interactions, can help create environments in which same-race minority friendships flourish.

T1  - Management of a Concealable Stigmatized Identity: A Qualitative Study of Concealment, Disclosure, and Role Flexing Among Young, Resilient Sexual and Gender Minority Individuals
AN  - 1881444814
AB  - Disclosure of a sexual or gender minority status has been associated with both positive and negative effects on wellbeing. Few studies have explored the disclosure and concealment process in young people. Interviews were conducted with 10 sexual and/or gender minority individuals, aged 18-22 years, of male birth sex. Data were analyzed qualitatively, yielding determinants and effects of disclosure and concealment. Determinants of disclosure included holding positive attitudes about one's identity and an implicit devaluation of acceptance by society. Coming out was shown to have both positive and negative effects on communication and social support and was associated with both increases and decreases in experiences of stigma. Determinants of concealment included lack of comfort with one's identity and various motivations to avoid discrimination. Concealment was also related to hypervigilance and unique strategies of accessing social support. Results are discussed in light of their clinical implications.

T1  - Racial Attitudes of University Faculty Members: Does Interracial Contact Matter?
AN  - 2116061034
AB  - Using primary data from a Midwestern university, this study examines racial attitudes of white faculty members. Contact theory is used to understand the variation in the number of racial minority students that white faculty members advise, independent of individual characteristics and social organizational factors. Findings indicate that white faculty members rate Asian/Asian American college students most favorably overall. In general, faculty then ranked white, African American, Latino, and Native American college students in descending order with respect to a host of characteristics. Finally, supporting contact theory, white faculty members who went to high schools with more racial minorities and who work with more colleagues who are racial minorities are significantly more likely to advise racial minority students. One implication of these outcomes is that greater interracial contact between white faculty members and racial minority colleagues and students is likely to have a positive impact on campus climate race relations.

T1  - Making Everyday Microaggressions: An Exploratory Experimental Vignette Study on the Presence and Power of Racial Microaggressions
AN  - 1888628532
AB  - The term "microaggression" has experienced a lively existence in the field of psychology since its introduction in 1970s. Sociology has recently come to study microaggressions, yet serious gaps remain in the study of microaggressions. In particular, sociological analysis has not taken into account how exposure to microaggressive interactions may affect racial attitudes, how variations in microaggressive interactions have different effects, and what racial and gender positions render one more or less likely to engage in, or fail to oppose, microaggressions. Based on a GSS-based survey and an experimental vignette design, we address the following two questions: First, how might the presence of racial microaggressions affect racial attitudes? Second, what is the power of specific types of interactional microaggression? Results indicate that both exposure to microaggressions and the type of microaggressions are correlated with changes in specific racial attitudes associated with the marginalization, problematization, and symbolic and physical repression of people of color.

T1  - "It's Almost Like They Were Happier When You Were Down": Microaggressions and Overt Hostility Against Native Americans in a Community with Gaming
AN  - 1888628528
AB  - In this article, we use qualitative data from 100 Native Americans living in mid-Michigan to document the changing nature of interactions between whites and tribal members. The community studied has seen significant changes in the economic and social position of the tribal community thanks to two decades of successful gaming operations. We find that, while Native Americans attest to positive changes in the community, many of which originate within the tribe itself, hostile and negative attitudes on the part of whites persist. Some of these contemporary attitudes are carry-overs of traditional anti-Native prejudice, while others reflect a reworking of old stereotypes to reflect new realities, while maintaining an unequal racial order. Hostile attitudes are accompanied by discriminatory behavior, often in the form of microaggressions. We suggest that, while old-fashioned racism has not disappeared, modern racism is more subtle and complex. While contemporary Native Americans react to and resist racism in a variety of ways, modern racist attitudes and the microaggressions that accompany them serve to reinforce an unequal racial status quo and the maintenance of a racial hierarchy of group positions.

T1  - Contact with Counter-Stereotypical Women Predicts Less Sexism, Less Rape Myth Acceptance, Less Intention to Rape (in Men) and Less Projected Enjoyment of Rape (in Women)
AN  - 1877731688
AB  - Intergroup contact--(positive) interactions with people from different social groups--is a widely researched and strongly supported prejudice-reducing mechanism shown to reduce prejudice against a wide variety of outgroups. However, no known previous research has investigated whether intergroup contact can also reduce sexism against women. Sexism has an array of negative outcomes. One of the most detrimental and violent ones is rape, which is both justified and downplayed by rape myth acceptance. We hypothesised that more frequent, higher quality contact with counter-stereotypical women would predict lower levels of sexism and thus less rape myth acceptance (in men) and less sexualised projected responses to rape (in women). Two studies using online surveys with community samples supported these hypotheses. In Study 1, 170 male participants who experienced more positive contact with counter-stereotypical women reported less intention to rape. Similarly, in Study 2, 280 female participants who experienced more positive contact with counter-stereotypical women reported less projected sexual arousal at the thought of being raped. Thus, the present research is the first known to show that contact could be a potential tool to combat sexism, rape myth acceptance, intentions to rape in men, and sexualisation of rape by women.

T1  - Is the Lack of Specific Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer/Questioning (LGBTQ) Health Care Education in Medical School a Cause for Concern? Evidence From a Survey of Knowledge and Practice Among UK Medical Students
AN  - 1858766512
AB  - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) people frequently report negative health care encounters. Medical professionals may inadequately manage LGBTQ persons' health if they have not received training in this area. An anonymous survey measuring efficacy in health situations among LGBTQ persons was answered by 166 medical students across all years of a UK university. Results show that 84.9% of participants reported a lack of LGBTQ health care education, with deficits in confidence clarifying unfamiliar sexual and gender terms, deciding the ward in which to nurse transgender patients, finding support resources, and discussing domestic abuse with LGBTQ patients. Most participants reported that they would not clarify gender pronouns or ask about gender or sexual identity in mental health or reproductive health settings. Participants reported infrequently observing doctors making similar inquiries. Participants held positive attitudes toward LGBTQ patients, with attitude scores positively correlating with LGBTQ terminology knowledge scores (rs = 0.5052, p < .01). Addressing gender identity and sexuality issues within medical curricula may remove barriers to accessing health care and improve encounters for LGBTQ patients.

T1  - Is Gaydar Affected by Attitudes Toward Homosexuality? Confidence, Labeling Bias, and Accuracy
AN  - 1904238177
AB  - Previous research has largely ignored the relationship between sexual orientation judgement accuracy, confidence, and attitudes toward homosexuality. In an online study, participants (N = 269) judged the sexual orientation of homosexual and heterosexual targets presented via a series of facial photographs. Participants also indicated their confidence in each judgment and completed the Modern Homonegativity Scale (Morrison & Morrison, 2002). We found that (1) homosexual men and heterosexual women were more accurate when judging photographs of women as opposed to photographs of men, and (2) in heterosexual men, negative attitudes toward homosexual men predicted confidence and bias when rating men's photographs. Findings indicate that homosexual men and heterosexual women are similar in terms of accuracy in judging women's sexuality. Further, especially in men, homophobia is associated with cognitive biases in labeling other men but does not have a relationship with increased accuracy.

T1  - Whose family fits? Categorization and evaluation of same-sex and cross-race-parent families: GPIR
AN  - 1854784978
AB  - As family structures diversify, attitudes towards "nontraditional" families (e.g., same-sex-parent and cross-race families) appear to be becoming more favorable. Despite more favorable attitudes, we propose that explicitly and implicitly people view nontraditional families as less family-like than traditional (i.e., heterosexual, same-race) families. We also propose that people will hold the behavior of nontraditional (vs. traditional) families to higher standards. In Study 1, participants explicitly rated nontraditional (vs. traditional) family photos as less family-like and as less loving. In Study 2, using a reaction-time measure, participants took longer to correctly categorize nontraditional (vs. traditional) families into the family category, suggesting that at an implicit level people have greater difficulty recognizing nontraditional families as "family." In Studies 3 and 4, ambiguous (i.e., positive and negative) behavior licensed more harsh evaluations of a nontraditional family--but did not affect evaluations of a traditional family--relative to learning only positive family behavior. Despite survey data that suggest that people's views of nontraditional families are becoming more favorable, our evidence indicates that people nonetheless harbor prejudice against certain family structures. Beyond documenting two biases against nontraditional families, this work highlights the need for prejudice researchers to examine meaningful levels of social identity, such as family units, that are intermediate between individuals and broad social classes.

T1  - Backlash
AN  - 1851015856
AB  - Research suggests that members of advantaged groups who feel dehumanized by other groups respond aggressively. But little is known about how meta-dehumanization affects disadvantaged minority group members, historically the primary targets of dehumanization. We examine this important question in the context of the 2016 U.S. Republican Primaries, which have witnessed the widespread derogation and dehumanization of Mexican immigrants and Muslims. Two initial studies document that Americans blatantly dehumanize Mexican immigrants and Muslims; this dehumanization uniquely predicts support for aggressive policies proposed by Republican nominees, and dehumanization is highly associated with supporting Republican candidates (especially Donald Trump). Two further studies show that, in this climate, Latinos and Muslims in the United States feel heavily dehumanized, which predicts hostile responses including support for violent versus non-violent collective action and unwillingness to assist counterterrorism efforts. Our results extend theorizing on dehumanization, and suggest that it may have cyclical and self-fulfilling consequences.

T1  - Collective Self-Esteem and Depressive Symptomatology in Lesbians and Gay Men: A Moderated Mediation Model of Self-Stigma and Psychological Abuse
AN  - 1827659489
AB  - The context of stigma, in which lesbians and gay men live in most countries, exposes them to possible discrimination and promotes the internalization of negative attitudes about their own sexual orientation, which may have negative consequences for their mental health. Their psychological distress may increase when lesbians and gay men are exposed to other sources of stress such as intimate partner violence. With the aim of analyzing the relationship between these variables, this study intends to present a moderated mediation model that proposes: (a) self-stigma mediates the relationship between private collective self-esteem and depressive symptomatology; (b) receiving psychological abuse within same-sex couples moderates the relationship between self-stigma and depressive symptomatology. For this purpose we conducted an online survey with a sample of 357 Spanish lesbians and gay men. Our findings show that self-stigma mediates the relationship between private collective self-esteem and depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, participants who had higher levels of self-stigma and received more psychological abuse by the partner showed stronger negative effects on depressive symptomatology. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - A Foreigner Who Does Not Steal My Job: The Role of Unemployment Risk and Values in Attitudes toward Equal Opportunities: IMR
AN  - 1821572308
AB  - Immigration has become systematically politicized and opposed by many individuals. We examine individual attitudes toward equal opportunities for foreigners and Swiss citizens, using cross-sectional data from the Swiss Household Panel. Individuals with low levels of education tend to oppose foreigners, while the opposition by individuals with high levels of education increases with the risk of unemployment. Values and beliefs explain the negative attitudes of individuals with low levels of education, but not the association with the risk of unemployment for individuals with high levels of education. Clearly, both values and economic factors are important for explaining attitudes toward foreigners.

T1  - Attitudes toward interracial marriages and the role of interracial contacts in Sweden
AN  - 1802366319
AB  - This paper examines attitudes toward interracial marriages and the relationship between the amount of prior interracial contact and attitudes in Sweden. The analysis is based on an anonymous postal survey conducted in Malmö, Sweden answered by 461 white-European respondents. Several studies in the US address the question of contact and attitudes and find that those who have more interracial contact, especially interracial friendships, have more positive attitudes toward intermarriage. The results show that the majority of the white European respondents can imagine marrying interracially; however, there are clear preferences toward different racial groups. Moreover, as in the US context, respondents who reported interracial friendships, and not general or superficial contacts, are more apt to answer the question about interracial marriage positively.

T1  - After migration: Acculturation of attitudes towards homosexuality among Polish immigrants in Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK
AN  - 1819538992
AB  - Public opinion on homosexuality remains unfavourable in Poland, one of the main sending countries of migrants to Western Europe. This contrasts sharply with public opinion in many of the Western European receiving countries. Using data collected shortly after migration and in a second wave one and a half years later, this contribution investigates the extent to which Polish migrants' anti-gay attitudes change over time. Focusing on four Western European countries (Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK), it examines factors that act as barriers and facilitators of acculturation. We find that intention to settle permanently and greater social integration in the host country are associated with greater acculturation, while the opposite is the case for religious involvement and negative attitudes about the host society.

T1  - Wealth Inequality Among Immigrants: Consistent Racial/Ethnic Inequality in the United States
AN  - 1777281812
AB  - Wealth is a strong indicator of immigrant integration in U.S. society. Drawing on new assimilation theory, we highlight the importance of racial/ethnic group boundaries and propose different paths of wealth integration among U.S. immigrants. Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation and quantile regression, we show that race/ethnicity shapes immigrant wealth inequality across the entire distribution of net worth, along with immigrants' U.S. experience, such as immigrant status, U.S. education, English language proficiency, and time spent in the United States. Our results document consistent racial/ethnic inequality among immigrants, also evidenced among the U.S. born, revealing that even when accounting for key aspects of U.S. experience, wealth inequality with whites for Latino and black immigrants is strong.

T1  - Demand and Supply: Racial and Ethnic Minority Candidates in White Districts
AN  - 1951415284
AB  - Do voters in white districts systematically obstruct minority representation? Despite a great deal of public and scholarly attention, this question remains largely unresolved. We demonstrate that the narrow focus on the relationship between white voters and minority representation is inadequate to understand why we do not see more minority-elected officials in the United States. We use a matching technique to investigate three theoretical perspectives of descriptive representation using a unique dataset from the 2012 general elections for state legislative seats in 14 states, the first elections after the 2010 redistricting process. Our findings challenge the venerable notion that minority candidates consistently underperform in white districts, and complicate our understanding of the political expression of bigotry in the voting booth.

T1  - REVITALIZED ORTHODOXY AND LGBT PEOPLE IN CONTEMPORARY SERBIA
AN  - 1844559613
AB  - The paper deals with the relation of the dominant religious confession in Serbia towards non-heterosexuality. After considering the attitude of Christianity in general, and Orthodoxy in particular, towards "different" sexual orientations, some of the statements of senior Church officials are cited as an illustration of that attitude. After that, some of the findings of the research of the Serbian population on the attitude towards religion and homosexuality are provided. A special form of religious nationalism that exists in Serbia is associated with the intensity and content of the negative attitude towards homosexuality. At the end of the paper the results of research attitudes towards homosexuality in 39 countries are presented, where special attention is given to the connection of religion with (non)acceptance of homosexuality.

T1  - The importance of racial tolerance for anti-racism
AN  - 1744735761
AB  - Tolerance has an ambiguous role in anti-racism strategies. On the one hand, it is a clear antidote to racial intolerance. Yet on the other, not only is it not the only antidote to racial intolerance (respect for difference and indifference to difference are also possibilities), but the fact that it involves a negative attitude or belief and the power to act on it suggests it is far from ideal. These problems are compounded by the fact that racial tolerance can only deal with racial intolerance, which because of its intentionality seems to be only a small part of racism. In this paper, I defend racial tolerance by arguing that conceptually it does have a role in anti-racism strategies and normatively describes an important minimum for those at risk of committing acts of racial intolerance.

T1  - Media-Induced Elevation as a Means of Enhancing Feelings of Intergroup Connectedness
AN  - 1662632631
AB  - The majority of research on media counter-stereotyping of race/ethnicity has tended to employ positive portrayals or counter-stereotypical exemplars as a primary strategy in eliciting positive attitudes among White participants. In contrast, this article reports the results of an experiment on the unique role of affective responses to media messages as a mechanism in inducing greater feelings of connectedness with a diversity of racial/ethnic groups. Our focus is on the affective response of elevation specifically, which refers to feelings of being moved, touched, and inspired by images of people engaged in morally beautiful acts such as love, generosity, and kindness. Results show that the experience of elevation in response to inspiring videos was associated with heightened feelings of overlap between the self and humanity, with this overlap associated with greater feelings of connectedness with those from a diversity of racial/ethnic groups. This connection was also associated with more favorable attitudes.

T1  - Perceptions and behaviors of Hispanic workers: a review
AN  - 2138083717
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to summarize research about Hispanic workers in the USA and identifies directions for future research. Design/methodology/approach – The paper identifies, analyze, and summarize 112 peer reviewed publications that deal with Hispanic workers in the USA. Findings – The findings are grouped into major categories that deal with prejudice, discrimination, and diversity; job-related attitudes and behaviors; job search and careers; the interface with gender, sexual harassment and work/family issues. The paper report the 53 most prevalent and well-supported findings. Research limitations/implications – Given the paucity of research about Hispanics in the workplace, the conclusions derived from this literature review should be interpreted with caution. Originality/value – A literature review of Hispanic workers in the USA has not been conducted to date. This review sets identifies the need for several areas of research in relation to Hispanic workers in the USA.

T1  - Assimilation of Foreigners in Former West Germany
AN  - 1650148270; 201502269
AB  - Migration movements to industrialized countries have grown in number and size, and the presence of large numbers of immigrants has raised concerns about their integration and assimilation into host societies. This article is an empirical study of assimilation of foreign nationals in Germany. Their experience may hold lessons for other relatively recent immigration destinations. As expected, language is one of the most critical factors for determining integration and assimilation at the workplace and in society. Our results indicate uneven success in these two areas, and suggest that greater language skills may be required for social assimilation, compared to economic assimilation. Among the most important findings of our study are the strong and statistically significant effects of the attitudes by Germans toward immigrants, the significant influence of the region of residence, and the ambivalence of German-born foreign residents toward naturalization and continued stay. This signals the failure of past integration and assimilation policies. The results show that negative attitudes by ethnic Germans against others at work or in society, in general, reduce interest in integration and assimilation. This is neither new nor surprising and this research does not contribute new theoretical insights, but it demonstrates the magnitude and significance of the effects. The question of why different locations seemed to have different impacts on citizenship aspirations is beyond the scope of this article. The data do not provide information to pursue this question and we suspect that the causes are too complex for a short answer. As expected, non-EU citizens showed greater interest in acquiring German citizenship than EU citizens. Finally, the results also indicate that the immediate post-World War II notion of 'guest workers' was not completely false. There has been significant return migration and a significant number of respondents to the survey say that they intend to return. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Imagine that: examining the influence of sport-related imagined contact on intergroup anxiety and sexual prejudice across cultures
AN  - 1552385877
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine (a) the relationship among sport-related imagined intergroup contact, intergroup anxiety, and sexual prejudice, and (b) how these relationships varied across cultures. Students enrolled at major public universities in South Korea (n=100) and the United States (n=100) participated in an experiment in which they imagined playing basketball and then engaging in a conversation with a gay man or with a friend. They then responded to a post-experiment questionnaire. South Koreans' intergroup anxiety significantly decreased when they imagined contact with a gay man, but the same was not necessarily the case for Americans. Intergroup anxiety mediated the relationship between imagined contact and sexual prejudice for Americans, but not for Koreans.

T1  - Reconciling the contact and threat hypotheses: does ethnic diversity strengthen or weaken community inter-ethnic relations?
AN  - 1660023951; 201505688
AB  - The literature on whether community diversity has a positive effect on individuals' inter-ethnic attitudes (contact hypothesis) or a negative effect (threat hypothesis) remains inconclusive. Most studies infer mechanisms of contact or threat based on the relationship between diversity and mean levels of prejudice in a community. We suggest that both processes of threat and contact may be occurring with increasing diversity. By applying a measure of individual-level contact, this paper demonstrates that increasing community diversity does have a negative effect on inter-ethnic attitudes but only among individuals without inter-ethnic ties. Among those who do form ties, increasing diversity has no effect - that is, contact moderates the negative effect of community diversity. However, this relationship is further moderated by levels of disadvantage in the community. This paper has important implications for the use of the contact/threat hypotheses in studies of contextual diversity and the wider debate on rising diversity in the UK.

T1  - Medical Xenophobia and Zimbabwean Migrant Access to Public Health Services in South Africa
AN  - 1531933947; 201423257
AB  - Xenophobic attitudes and actions are all-pervasive in South Africa in civil society and the state. Medical xenophobia refers to the negative attitudes and practices of health professionals and employees towards migrants and refugees based purely on their identity as non-South African. This paper examines the extent to which xenophobia manifests itself within the public institutions that offer health services to citizens and non-citizens, based on primary research with Zimbabwean migrants who try to access the system. The paper argues that medical xenophobia is deeply entrenched in the South African public health system despite being a fundamental breach of the country's Constitution and Bill of Rights, international human rights obligations and the existence of professional codes of ethics governing the treatment of patients.

T1  - Policing terrorism and police-community relations: views of the Arab minority in Israel
AN  - 1551002694; 201431371
AB  - Police involvement in counterterrorism has special ramifications on minority groups that may be viewed as presenting high risk to homeland security. Our public survey shows that the Jewish respondents in our sample expressed positive attitudes toward police involvement in mission of counterterrorism, while Israeli Arabs expressed more concern with the ramifications of police involvement in counterterrorism on its relations with the Arabs in particular. The results show that both communities recognized the central role that the police may play in dealing with terrorism, and they both expressed high levels of willingness to cooperate with the police to fight against terrorism.

T1  - The role of social values and psychosocial variables in Brazilian racial prejudice
AN  - 1728662195; 201534162
AB  - In the drive of comprehending the racial prejudice, social psychology has sought to identify factors that influence their presence or absence in societies. A factor to be explored is its relationship to social values. This article aims to analyze the relationship between social values, certain expressions of prejudice (blatant, symbolical) and political-ideological variables. Four hundred and twenty university students took part in this research. Classic measures were used to identify the mentioned expressions of prejudice: a questionnaire of psychosocial values, a scale of perceived distances and a scale of positive attitudes towards the first and the third worlds. It was identified that the accession to hedonistic and materialistic values, as well as the adoption of favorable attitudes towards developed countries, might predict prejudice against black people. On the other hand, the adherence to social justice values, and the closeness to black people are related with the non-expression of prejudice. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Hate Speech or Genocidal Discourse? An Examination of Anti-Roma Sentiment in Contemporary Europe
AN  - 1718069542; 201530786
AB  - The above proposition for a 'final solution to the Gypsy question,' strongly reminiscent of Nazi genocidal propaganda, was made during the 2009 European Parliament elections in the Czech Republic by the far-right National Party (Albert 2012: 139). This statement is symptomatic of the pervasive negative attitudes present in many European states towards members of the Romani community. Physical persecution of Roma is also common, often manifested in racially motivated violence that is frequently ignored and occasionally encouraged by state authorities (Amnesty International 2011: 4-5; Council of Europe 2012: 39-40,64; Stewart 2012: xiii-xix). This context of persecution, exclusion, and stigmatisation is informed by a discourse that renders some extremely negative actions largely acceptable, such as the segregation of Roma into villages (and often ghettos) enclosed by walls or monitored by guards and video cameras (Amare 2010; Hollinger 2010; Council of Europe 2012: 93-99). The stigmatisation of Roma (as well as their persecution and exclusion) in contemporary European states has been widely recognised and discussed.[1] It is questionable, however, if previous approaches have been adequate to explain the nature of the discourse present in many European states towards Romani people.

T1  - EFFECTS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE ON ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY OF WATER POLLUTION
AN  - 1531931711; 201423197
AB  - We conducted 2 studies to investigate the role of psychological distance in the assessment of degree of severity of water pollution. In Study 1, 132 participants evaluated the severity of water pollution with 3 dimensions of psychological distance, that is, temporal, social, and probability, each comprising 3 levels. Results showed that temporal distance did not have a significant influence on the assessment of the severity of water pollution, whereas probability and social distance did. In Study 2, 146 participants evaluated the severity of water pollution in three 2 * 2 designs and one 2 * 2 * 2 design. Results demonstrated that, when the 3 psychological distances coexisted, the main effect of probability distance on severity assessment was significant, but neither temporal nor social distance had a significant effect.

T1  - An Examination of Color-Blind Racism and Race-Related Stress Among African American Undergraduate Students
AN  - 1448995576; 201342815
AB  - This study examined the role of color-blind racial ideology among a sample of 152 African American undergraduate students in relation to race-related stress. We hypothesized that those who endorsed relatively higher color-blind racial attitudes would experience greater race-related stress because experiences with racism would be interpreted as more taxing without an operating framework of extant racism in the United States. Contrary to our hypothesis, after controlling for overall well-being, trait-level positive and negative affect, and racial identity, we found color-blind racial attitudes to be a negative predictor of race-related stress. This finding indicates that moderate levels of color-blind attitudes may act as a buffer against race-related stress among undergraduate students who possess an overall sense of well-being. A detailed discussion of the findings and implications for future research is provided. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright The Association of Black Psychologists.]

T1  - Predicting ethnic and racial discrimination: A meta-analysis of IAT criterion studies
AN  - 1416405629
AB  - This article reports a meta-analysis of studies examining the predictive validity of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and explicit measures of bias for a wide range of criterion measures of discrimination. The meta-analysis estimates the heterogeneity of effects within and across 2 domains of intergroup bias (interracial and interethnic), 6 criterion categories (interpersonal behavior, person perception, policy preference, microbehavior, response time, and brain activity), 2 versions of the IAT (stereotype and attitude IATs), 3 strategies for measuring explicit bias (feeling thermometers, multi-item explicit measures such as the Modern Racism Scale, and ad hoc measures of intergroup attitudes and stereotypes), and 4 criterion-scoring methods (computed majority-minority difference scores, relative majority-minority ratings, minority-only ratings, and majority-only ratings). IATs were poor predictors of every criterion category other than brain activity, and the IATs performed no better than simple explicit measures. These results have important implications for the construct validity of IATs, for competing theories of prejudice and attitude-behavior relations, and for measuring and modeling prejudice and discrimination.

T1  - Ethnicity and social cohesion in the post-Soviet Baltic states
AN  - 1448992675; 201342898
AB  - This article examines the efforts of post-Soviet Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to promote social cohesion by addressing the ethnic and linguistic cleavages that are part of the legacy of Soviet rule. In examining the particular situation of each Baltic state and the response to international pressure for integration and social inclusion policy, Muiznieks, Rozenvalds and Birka note the roles of threat-perception, the historic context, the linguistic and citizenship policy, as well as socio-economic inequality, in facilitating Russian-speakers' sense of belonging to their respective Baltic state. While ostensibly aimed at fostering a sense of belonging to the national state, Baltic integration and social inclusion policy has often had a contradictory effect, especially in Estonia and Latvia, where the emphasis on the majority language and culture as a prerequisite for access to citizenship and formal membership has enhanced the threat-perceptions of minorities, and led to their alienation or identification with the external homeland of Russia. In Lithuania, early inclusion of minorities into the polity has had a beneficial long-term impact in terms of their identification with their country of residence, demonstrated by the fact that Russian-speakers express a greater sense of belonging to Lithuania. A review of the available survey data on the Baltic states suggests that the same cannot be said for Estonia and Latvia, where minorities express a weak sense of belonging to the state. This suggests a challenging road ahead for Estonia and Latvia in achieving social cohesion, understood by minorities as a sense of membership in the community and feelings of mutual recognition. Furthermore, all three Baltic states, Latvia in particular, have yet to address growing socio-economic inequality, which threatens to cause long-term difficulties for social cohesion.

T1  - Relocating Prejudice: A Transnational Approach to Understanding Immigrants' Racial Attitudes
AN  - 1531933923; 201423364
AB  - Immigration is changing the racial composition of many societies. Yet leading theories of racial prejudice, even in a multiracial context, focus on dynamics in a single nation-state and fail to account for the experiences of the foreign-born. We adopt a transnational approach that incorporates processes creating prejudice from both inside and outside the receiving society and that shows how attitudes move across borders through immigration, transnationalism, and globalization. We draw upon two in-depth studies of immigrants and those who stay in the home countries, focusing on Koreans' and Dominicans' attitudes toward Black Americans. By situating existing theories of racial prejudice within a transnational framework, we illustrate how models of transnationalism are relevant not just within immigration scholarship, but to more general processes of social change.

T1  - Attitudinal and Individual Differences Influence Perceptions of Mock Child Sexual Assault Cases Involving Gay Defendants
AN  - 1438556007; 201340290
AB  - Many people hold negative attitudes and stereotypes about gay men, including the stereotype that gay men are likely to be child molesters. This article explored the implications of this stereotype for judgments made in a hypothetical legal case involving child sexual abuse accusations against a male teacher by either a male or female victim. Mock jurors who held the most anti-gay attitudes and those who endorsed the stereotype of gay men as child molesters made the most pro-prosecution judgments in scenarios involving gay defendants. A new scale (the Stereotypes about Gays and Child Abuse scale) was developed to assess the extent to which participants endorsed the stereotype of gay men as being likely to sexually abuse children. This scale was a stronger predictor of case judgments than existing, more general scales measuring biases against homosexuality. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Working Twice as Hard to Get Half as Far: Race, Work Ethic, and America's Deserving Poor
AN  - 1364704803; 201323369
AB  - Attitudes toward racialized and redistributive policies like welfare are often thought of as a function of both principled ideological positions and the underlying racial attitudes a person holds. Look at racial resentment as one explanation, while Sniderman and his colleagues look to principled conservatism and authoritarianism as viable alternatives, claiming that racial resentment is merely proxying a legitimate race-neutral commitment to equality of opportunity. This article engages this debate through an experimental design which tests whether "hard work" is rewarded in a color-blind manner. The experimental design also affords scholars the opportunity to separate the effects of the two components of racial resentment: principled values and racial animus. The results show that American norms and implicit racism serve to uniquely privilege whites in a variety of ways. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Race, ethnicity and religion: emerging policies in Britain
AN  - 1551002823; 201429003
AB  - Britain's integration model is recurrently held up as the epitome of the multiculturalist model in Europe. Moreover, it tends to be presented as though it was intrinsic to British society and had always existed. This is not the case. In reality the model has passed through successive phases of an ongoing evolution and was constructed through the interaction between British society and the ethnic minorities of immigrant origin who settled in Britain after the Second World War. After a brief period of assimilationism, a race relations paradigm was formulated, followed by the establishment of a multicultural policy. It is often assumed that multicultural policy is a simple continuation of a race relations approach under another name. But Joly argues that this is inaccurate and that each corresponds to distinct policy parameters and to different stages. Moreover, this was not the end of the line. The multiculturalist model has come under a barrage of criticism emanating from various sources and different viewpoints. Nevertheless, Joly maintains that it has not been eliminated but has metamorphosed into a Muslim paradigm. Her paper explores the different stages of integration policies directed at immigrants and how those were constructed. The paradigms were developed through the categorization of immigrants by the majority and the mobilization of immigrants as a result of their interaction with British society. The paper draws the contours of each of these stages, examines the fault lines and areas of tension, and explores the underpinnings of the evolution. It argues that policies were forged through and beyond discourses largely by the immigrants themselves. In the main it can be posited that the process started with action that began at local level at the initiative of the immigrants and subsequently progressed to the national level. This prompted responses and funding programmes from central government. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - What's so insidious about "Peace, Love, and Understanding"? A system justification perspective
AN  - 1417525174; 201331961
AB  - We agree that promoting intergroup harmony "carries insidious, often unacknowledged, 'system-justifying' consequences" (sect. 4.1.3, para. 2) and identify several ways in which "benevolent" and "complementary" stereotypes, superordinate identification, intergroup contact, and prejudice reduction techniques can undermine social change motivation by reinforcing system-justifying beliefs. This may "keep the peace," but it also prevents individuals and groups from tackling serious social problems, including inequality and oppression. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Politics Of Heritage In Singapore: The Malay-Muslim legacy of Kampong Glam
AN  - 1373429814; 201328744
AB  - The representation of Malay-Muslim heritage in Singapore has changed repeatedly in relatively short periods of time. Until the l990s, an exclusively rural legacy was showcased as the ethnic heritage of Singapore's Malay community. The alleged Malay failure' to function in urban society is rooted in administrative shortcomings of the colonial era when other Muslim migrants interacted with the British leaders on behalf of the Malay community. When attempts to redress the situation did not show immediate success in the 1950s, the Malay ineptness for participation in urban economic and cultural life was believed to be proven. In terms of socio-demographic indicators, this negative attitude quickly became a self-fufilling prophecy contributing to the marginalisation of Malays. Urban Malay heritage would be rare and, where existing, in squalid conditions and better complemented by the built legacy of Arab trading history. This orientalisation of Malays continues to hinder a representation of their heritage as part of Singapore's cosmopolitan legacy. The current representation of Kampong Glam as 'less Malay than Arab' is a consequence of a particular conceptualisation of Malayness. New initiatives to boost the Malay character of Kampong Glam are best understood in the context of the longstanding neglect of existing Malay contributions to cosmopolitan connections.

T1  - Direct and Mediated Intercultural Contact: Koreans' Attitudes toward U.S. Americans
AN  - 1033026447
AB  - Guided by the intergroup contact hypothesis, this study tested two models examining the associations among Korean young adults' consumption of U.S. dramas, direct contact with a U.S. American person, and their attitudes toward U.S. Americans in general. Results demonstrated that personal contact and mediated contact had a positive effect on intergroup attitudes, but that frequency of personal contact was a negative contributor. Mediated contact had different and stronger influences on participants' intergroup attitudes when they did not have personal contact with U.S. Americans. In addition, intergroup anxiety played a significant role in the contact modes and attitudes links. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Some New Perspectives on South African Indians and 'Non-Racialism': Findings from the AKF Non-Racialism Focus Group Data
AN  - 1221409562; 201244114
AB  - A significant finding from the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation/Gauteng City-Region Observatory non-racialism focus group data is the prevalence of negative attitudes expressed toward Indian South Africans. Using the data as a valuable analytic window into the complex race, class, ethnicity and gender politics that characterise post-apartheid South Africa, this article reflects on the implications of strong anti-Indian sentiments in post-apartheid South Africa. The article critically reflects on the historically configured identity or identities of Indian South Africans in relation to the project of 'non-racialism'. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Not all prejudices are experienced equally: Comparing experiences of racism and sexism in female minorities
AN  - 1023028898; 201223700
AB  - Research exploring the perspectives of stigmatized people has examined general processes related to experiencing prejudice. Past work, however, has invoked the assumption that prejudices against different group memberships are experienced in a similar manner. Across three studies we directly compare experiences of racism and sexism among female minorities and show, in contrast, that people respond to different forms of prejudice in distinct ways. In Study 1 we examined the attributions invoked by Asian women to explain prejudice and discovered that participants made stronger internal attributions to explain racism than sexism. In Study 2 we investigated emotional reactions to prejudice and found that Asian women report experiencing more depression following a race-based rejection than a gender-based rejection. In Study 3 we observed that Asian women reported perceiving more racism than sexism in their environments. Implications for advancing theories of prejudice experiences are discussed.

T1  - Football team identification in Norway: spectators of local and national football matches
AN  - 925712891; 201204386
AB  - Football spectators (N=760) at two local and two international matches were surveyed with the aim of investigating how identity is created and sustained in relation to top-level sport in general, and local and national football teams in particular. Two-way between-groups analyses of variance were applied, and effect sizes calculated. There was a statistically significant main effect for gender, showing that male spectators identify more strongly with their favourite team than female spectators. The findings also include an interaction effect between gender and level of matches, indicating different effects on male and female spectators. Male spectators identify more strongly with the national team than the local team, whereas female spectators identify more strongly with the local team. Strong identification with the national team goes together with more positive attitudes towards the nation. The results are analysed within the theoretical framework of social identity theory (SIT) and self-categorization theory (SCT). Team identification is context-dependent and partly explained with reference to the principle of meta-contrast implied in SCT. Positive attitudes towards the nation are interpreted as beneficial from a nation-building point of view, but have possible negative consequences concerning the evaluation of social groups not included in the in-group.

T1  - Exploring the Relationship Between Public Opinion and Personal Attitudes and Behavior Toward Lesbians and Gay Men: Social Conformity Revisited
AN  - 1283638425; 201303341
AB  - This study investigated the relationship between social conformity, gender-role egalitarianism, and personal levels of heterosexism, or prejudice based on same-sex orientation. Mock public opinion polls of a positive or negative nature regarding same-sex orientation were used to study attitudinal and behavioral change of participants and attitude-behavior consistency. The study sample included 194 undergraduate students from a Midwestern university. A correlation existed between participants' traditional gender role beliefs and heterosexism. Participants who viewed the positive public opinion poll demonstrated behavioral support for a lesbian and gay organization, as did participants with positive attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. Findings are analyzed within a social prejudice framework. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Focus groups as a tool in the construction of questionnaires: the case of discriminatory attitudes
AN  - 898217708
AB  - The aim of the present article is twofold First, it tests and demonstrates the supplementary use of focus groups to construct quantitatively oriented survey on anti-minority sentiment. Second, it clarifies two major theoretical concepts-prejudice versus perceived threat-in the research on discriminatory attitudes towards minority populations. More specifically, by using data from focus group discussions on foreign workers in Israel, the study examines the use of such groups for measurement of prejudice and perceived threat within the social and cultural context of Israeli society. The analysis of focus group discussions provides adapted questionnaire scales for measuring prejudice and perceived threat. The findings support the premise that prejudice and perceived threat are two distinct theoretical concepts.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Biphobia Scale a Decade Later: Reflections and Additions
AN  - 1125224505; 201240464
AB  - Biphobia, which has been defined as negative attitudes about bisexuality and bisexual individuals, is a psychological construct that is, at present, not well understood. Ochs described the denigration that bisexual individuals face as "double discrimination," which she defined as discrimination from both heterosexual and homosexual communities. A 30-item instrument, the Biphobia Scale, was developed to measure negative cognitions, affects and behaviors regarding bisexuality and bisexual individuals. The instrument has provided empirical support for the existence of the construct of biphobia and suggests that it exists in the heterosexual and homosexual communities. The results support the theory that bisexual individuals are subjected to "double discrimination.". Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Categorization and Communication in the Face of Prejudice: When Describing Perceptions Changes What Is Perceived
AN  - 925714254; 201204087
AB  - In the face of prejudice against an ingroup, common ground for communication exists when people use similar social categories to understand the situation. Three studies tested the hypothesis that describing perceptions of prejudice can fundamentally change those perceptions because communicators account for the common ground in line with conversational norms. When women (Study 1), African Americans (Study 2), and Americans (Study 3) simply thought about suspected prejudice against their ingroup, categorization guided their perceptions: Participants assimilated their views of the prejudiced event toward the perceptions of ingroup members but contrasted away from the perceptions of outgroup members. Conversely, when participants described their perceptions, they contrasted away from the given category information and actually arrived at the opposite perceptions as those who merely thought about the prejudiced event. Study 3 identified an important qualification of these effects by showing that they were obtained only when participants could assume their audience was familiar with the common ground. Implications are discussed for understanding the role of communication in facilitating and inhibiting collective action about prejudice. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Essentialist beliefs predict automatic motor-responses to social categories: GPIR
AN  - 1910239663
AB  - Essentialist thinking has been implicated in producing segregation between social groups even in the absence of negative attitudes. This mode of category representation brings social group information to the fore in social information processing, suggesting that the social consequences of essentialism are associated with basic categorization processes. Drawing on recent work demonstrating that automatic approach and avoidance behaviors are directly embedded in intergroup categorization, we show that people who hold essentialist beliefs about human attributes are faster to approach their ingroup. Moreover this relationship is not accounted for by explicit prejudice towards the outgroup and essentialist beliefs were unrelated to implicit evaluation of either group. The findings demonstrate that essentialist beliefs are associated with immediate behavioral responses attached to social category exemplars, highlighting the links between these beliefs and basic categorization processes.

AB  - This study examined ecstasy use and associated risk and protective factors among Asian American youth. Data from 996 Asian American adolescents and 1,108 Asian American young adults were used. Ecstasy use was relatively common among Asian American youth. Among adolescents, it was associated with older age, poor parent-child communication, having been approached by drug sellers, living in a metropolitan area, and positive attitudes toward substance use. Among Asian American young adults, it was associated with having been born in the United States, having been approached by drug sellers, criminal justice system involvement, and positive attitudes toward substance use. Implications for designing substance use prevention/intervention programs for this minority group are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Effects of Death Reminders on Sex Differences in Prejudice Toward Gay Men and Lesbians
AN  - 881465439; 201116485
AB  - Terror management research shows that death reminders (mortality salience) increase prejudice toward worldview violators. Two studies investigated whether death reminders exacerbated differences in heterosexual men's and women's reports of sexual prejudice (negative attitudes based on sexual orientation). Results showed that following death reminders, sex differences in anti-gay discrimination and affective prejudice toward gay men (but not toward lesbians) were larger, and that these increased sex differences were mediated by gender role beliefs. The current studies suggest that researchers may attenuate the effects of death reminders by lessening the perceived worldview violation in addition to alleviating the existential terror of death.

T1  - Racial Attitudes in City, Neighborhood, and Situational Contexts
AN  - 862595866; 201109682
AB  - Multiple social contexts have been shown to affect racial attitudes both positively and negatively when considered at different levels. In this article, context is simultaneously considered at three different levels: the metropolitan area, the census block group, and the interview situation (as measured by race of interviewer/race of respondent matching). Significant effects can be classified into three categories: the effects of the racial composition of the city, the effects of the racial composition of the neighborhood, and the effects of a "different-race" interviewer. Neighborhood income and race of interviewer effects are direct; by contrast, racial composition effects are typically cross-level interaction effects. This indicates that the modeling of cross-level interactions is essential for future studies of the effects of racial composition on attitudes.

T1  - The "Obama Effect" and White Racial Attitudes
AN  - 862595549; 201109744
AB  - To what extent did the presidential candidacy and election of Barack Obama affect whites' more general perceptions of African Americans? Responses to survey questions in which respondents were asked to place blacks on scales running from "stupid" to "intelligent" and from "lazy" to "hardworking" revealed that whites' views of blacks' intelligence and work ethic have become somewhat more positive, though whites continued to be rated higher on these attributes than were blacks. The fact that negative stereotypes of blacks were least pronounced among younger whites implies that these stereotypes will continue to fade in the future. These data do not constitute proof positive of an "Obama effect" on whites' racial attitudes, but they are largely consistent with that idea.

T1  - Problems Encountered in the Teaching of Religious Education: A Case Study in Botswana
AN  - 925712213; 201204206
AB  - The Government of Botswana and Botswana as a nation have long realized that the preservation, development and promotion of the nation's culture through religious education and freedom are prerequisites for the creation of a stable social environment. Botswana promotes freedom of religion, worship, spirituality, morality, and tolerance where people can enjoy the freedoms to engage in any type of religious associations and doctrines as written in the national constitution of 1966. Based on a qualitative case study of 100 Primary School teachers and 100 students conducted in October 2007 to January 2008 in selected areas of Botswana, this paper argues that the proliferation of religions other than Christianity makes it difficult for teachers, in practice, to effectively and efficiently impart knowledge, positive attitudes, skills and best practice in the teaching of religious education as an examinable subject in Botswana's primary schools. However, despite hiccups in practice, legally Botswana's national constitution accords different types of freedom, and the national vision 2016 encourages tolerance and religious freedom as cornerstones of democratic governance. Teachers therefore experience a multiplicity of problems (partly due to the gaps between theory and practice). These problems also have implications for teacher preparation and training in the teaching of Religious Education. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Ingroup Reappraisal: Examining the Deprovincialization Thesis
AN  - 907550495
AB  - According to the deprovincialization thesis, interethnic contact involves a reappraisal and distancing from the ingroup. Contact can broaden one's horizon by acknowledging and recognizing the value of other cultures and thereby putting the taken-for-granted own cultural standards into perspective. The current research uses data from three surveys to examine the relationship between quantity of outgroup contact and ingroup distance (ingroup identification and ingroup feelings) among native Dutch participants. More positive contact with ethnic outgroups was expected to lead to a higher endorsement of multiculturalism, that, in turn, is related to a stronger distancing from the ingroup. Findings in all three studies support the deprovincialization thesis. In addition, in Study 3, mediation is found independently of outgroup threat. Findings across the three studies confirm the stability of the results and cross-validate the deprovincialization thesis. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Divided Loyalties? Understanding Variation in Latino Attitudes Toward Immigration
AN  - 754041781; 201053395
AB  - Objective. In this article, we develop and test a model of competing theoretical explanations of Latino attitudes toward immigration; specifically examining their policy preferences on legal immigration, illegal immigration, and a proposed policy for dealing with illegal immigrants. We also consider whether Latino attitudes toward legal and illegal immigration are related and comprise a single coherent structure. Method. Using data from a 2004 national survey of Latinos, we perform regression, logit, and ordered logit analyses to examine the determinants of Latino attitudes toward immigration. Results. We highlight three important findings. First, our results demonstrate 'within-group' differences in immigration attitudes among Latinos, based on both national origin and generational status; we find that Mexicans are more pro-immigration than Latinos from other countries and that foreign-born Latinos have much more positive attitudes about immigration than second-generation and third-generation Latinos. Second, we find that Latino support for various aspects of immigration is primarily a function of ethnic and linguistic identity and attachment to American culture, with self-interest, contextual variables, and political and demographic attributes playing a smaller, more specialized role. Finally, we demonstrate that Latino attitudes toward legal and illegal immigration are highly interrelated. Conclusion. There is a coherent structure underlying Latino attitudes toward legal immigration, illegal immigration, and a policy option for dealing with illegal immigrants. Our tests of competing theoretical approaches reveal the importance of national origin and ethnic attachment and acculturation in explaining differences among Latinos on their attitudes toward immigration.

T1  - Ingroup Identification and Group-Level Narcissism as Predictors of U.S. Citizens' Attitudes and Behavior Toward Arab Immigrants
AN  - 1928308170
AB  - In four studies, the authors explored factors contributing to negative attitudes and behavior toward Arab immigrants in the United States. In Study 1, Americans reported greater threat from Arabs, compared to other groups (e.g., Latino, Asian). In Study 2, they tested the effects of ingroup identification and group-level narcissism on attitudes toward Arab, Latino, Asian, and European immigrants. Identification interacted with group narcissism in predicting attitudes toward Arab (but not other) immigrants, such that identification predicted negative attitudes toward Arab immigrants only at mean and high levels of group narcissism. Study 3 explored the convergent and discriminant validity of the group narcissism construct. In Study 4, the authors added a behavioral dependent measure. Again, ingroup identification predicted negative behavior and attitudes toward an Arab immigrant group (but not comparison groups) only at mean and high levels of group narcissism. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - Psychological Antecedents of Heterosexuals' Pro-gay Activism Behavior
AN  - 758123619; 201057120
AB  - Previous research on heterosexuals' attitudes toward gays is characterized by a focus on negative attitudes and minimal use of behavioral dependent variables. In an attempt to rectify this situation, the present study explored the psychological antecedents of heterosexuals' pro-gay activism behavior in an undergraduate sample using the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991). Findings suggest that intentions predict activism behavior (in the form of signing an online petition supporting the construction of a new lesbian, gay, and bisexual resource center on their campus). In addition, attitudes toward the possible outcomes of the behavior, attitudes toward the behavior itself, and self-identity were found to predict intentions. Directions for future research on pro-gay activism are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Empathic Experience and Attitudes Toward Stigmatized Groups: Evidence for Attitude Generalization
AN  - 1866473598
AB  - Two studies investigated the extent to which empathizing with a single member of a stigmatized group can yield positive attitudes toward other stigmatized groups. Participants read a scenario in which a member of a socially stigmatized group described the experiences of group membership. Participants then reported their attitudes toward the target group and a second group. Both studies revealed a generalization effect such that experiencing empathy for the target was associated with more positive attitudes, both toward the target group and the second group. Study 2 demonstrated that this generalization effect is confined to those groups located within the same superordinate category. Implications of these findings for attempts to structure people's orientation to stigmatized groups are discussed.

T1  - Social insertion and racial prejudice: Distance from black people and socio-political variables: [1]
AN  - 1540513725
AB  - This article analyses the relationships between racial prejudice (flagrant and symbolic) and university students' membership of socio-political groups, their adhesion to political ideologies, and their attitudes related to the developed and developing worlds. A total of 418 students participated in the study. The results show a negative correlation between adhesion to left-wing ideology and social distance from black people. They also show that favourable attitudes to the developed world are positively correlated to the distance from black people. Finally, group memberships in social movements and in affective-religious communities inhibit the expression of symbolic racial prejudice. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Prejudice at the Nexus of Race and Gender: An Outgroup Male Target Hypothesis
AN  - 743065728; 201043324
AB  - Adopting an evolutionary approach to the psychology of race bias, we posit that intergroup conflict perpetrated by male aggressors throughout human evolutionary history has shaped the psychology of modern forms of intergroup bias and that this psychology reflects the unique adaptive problems that differ between men and women in coping with male aggressors from groups other than one's own. Here we report results across 4 studies consistent with this perspective, showing that race bias is moderated by gender differences in traits relevant to threat responses that differ in their adaptive utility between the sexes-namely, aggression and dominance motives for men and fear of sexual coercion for women. These results are consistent with the notion that the psychology of intergroup bias is generated by different psychological systems for men and women, and the results underscore the importance of considering the gender of the outgroup target as well as the gender of the agent in psychological studies on prejudice and discrimination.

T1  - The Contact Space: A Novel Framework for Intergroup Contact Research
AN  - 1928167421
AB  - This article presents a new framework for understanding research on the intersection between language, communication, and intergroup contact. Contact theory has described a variety of ways in which contact between groups can reduce prejudice and improve intergroup relations. However, the field has become fragmented by the study of a variety of forms of contact whose interconnections have not been elucidated, and it has paid insufficient attention to the language and communicative dynamics of the contact event itself. This article accounts for the variation in forms of contact studied by arraying them in two-dimensional space organized by (a) involvement of self in contact and (b) richness of self-outgroup experience. The former pertains to whether an individual is directly involved in interaction with an outgroup member (vs. merely observing such contact); the latter pertains to the multiplicity of channels and senses through which one experiences the outgroup member. These two dimensions are argued to be largely orthogonal. The two-dimensional space is used to organize mediators and moderators in the field, to specify in detail the intersection between contact and issues of language and communication, as well as to outline areas of particular promise for specific contact interventions.

T1  - Concerns about appearing prejudiced: Implications for anxiety during daily interracial interactions
AN  - 743047783; 201031481
AB  - We investigated the relationship between Whites' and ethnic minorities' concerns about appearing prejudiced and anxiety during daily interracial interactions. College roommate pairs completed an individual difference measure of concerns about appearing prejudiced at the beginning of the semester. Then they completed measures of anxiety and perceptions of their roommates' anxiety-related behaviors for 15 days. Results indicated that among interracial roommate pairs, Whites' and ethnic minorities' concerns about appearing prejudiced were related to their self-reported anxiety on a daily basis; but this was not the case among same-race roommate pairs. In addition, among interracial roommate pairs, roommates who were concerned about appearing prejudiced began to 'leak' their anxiety towards the end of the diary period, as indicated by their out-group roommate who perceived their anxious behaviors as increasing across time, and who consequently liked them less. The implications of these findings for intergroup relations are discussed in this article. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Young people's attitudes towards Muslims in Sweden
AN  - 743047852; 201031563
AB  - With the use of multiple regression technique, the principal objective of this study is to clarify and examine young people's attitudes towards Muslims, and the relationships between these attitudes and a large number of background factors. We use a representative sample of 9,498 non-Muslim youths between 15 and 19 years of age. The main results show that, when controlling for several background variables simultaneously, the country of birth, socio-economic background and school/programme factors all have an effect on the attitude towards Muslims. Moreover, socio-psychological factors, the relationship to friends and the perceptions of gender role patterns are found to be important. In addition, local factors like high levels of unemployment, high proportions of immigrants in a local environment also have an effect. No differences in the attitudes of boys and girls were found. Further, the study establishes a correlation between negative attitudes and right-wing populist seats in local government. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Changing Face of Racial Discrimination: Hispanics as the Dominant Minority in the USA - a New Application of Power-Threat Theory
AN  - 1928744558
AB  - According to Hubert Blalock's 1967 power-threat theory, the larger the minority group's size the greater the threat to the majority group. Most of Blalock's examples, and much of the subsequent empirical investigation into the power-threat thesis, focus on Anglo and African American relations. Changing demographics will likely alter existing majority-minority relations as Hispanics displace African Americans as the largest minority. This will change the face of racial discrimination in the country. Indeed, this paper suggests that the animosity toward Latinos by both the majority white and minority black populations may be more intense than those shaping contemporary white-black relations. Two key lifestyle features that have not contaminated black-white relations may exacerbate hostility toward Hispanics: their perceived illegal status in the country, and the perception that Hispanics resist learning English. The role of the media in perpetuating these stereotypes and inflaming hostility toward Latinos is also discussed.
