T1  - “United in diversity”: The interplay of social network characteristics and personality in predicting outgroup attitudes: GPIR
AN  - 2693010231
AB  - Diversity in social relations is important for reducing prejudice. Yet, the question of when this occurs remains open. Using a social network approach, we test whether the link between outgroup attitudes and number of intra- and intergroup contacts is moderated by type of relationship (strong vs. weak ties) and personality (openness to experience) while also considering network structure (connections between contacts). In a culturally diverse sample of 122 immigrants residing in Barcelona, positive outgroup attitudes were predicted by several network characteristics: low proportion of intragroup contacts and high proportion of intergroup contacts among strong ties, high ethnic diversity among strong ties, low connectedness among contacts in the country of origin, and high connectedness between coethnic local and host national contacts. Openness to experience moderated these effects. These results affirm the intergroup benefits of having compositionally and structurally diverse networks, and the gain in examining intergroup dynamics at the meso level of analysis.

T1  - A study on the influencing factors of the public’s willingness to donate funds for critical illness crowdfunding projects on network platforms
AN  - 2638268375
AB  - As an emerging charity model, critical illness network crowdfunding provides a source of funds for some critically ill patients in China who have difficulty paying their high treatment costs by themselves. This study aims to investigate the influencing factors of the public’s willingness to donate to critical illness crowdfunding projects on Internet platforms. From a perspective combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, a complex and comprehensive structural equation model is proposed. We randomly selected 1,000 members of the public in China and empirically verified the study framework through structural equation modeling (SEM) based on 710 valid questionnaires. The results show that the public’s donation willingness and the social distance to a critical illness crowdfunding project on an online platform positively affect the public’s donation behavior, and donation attitude positively affect donation willingness; perceived usefulness and empathic concern positively affect the public’s donation attitude, which in turn affects its donation willingness. This study confirms that members of the public are more likely to help people who have similar demographic factors or people who are similar to themselves and have the same values, i.e., people who have a close social distance. It innovatively proposes and verifies the hypothesis that empathic concern can significantly positively affect users’ perceived usefulness and donation attitude. Strong empathic concern triggers donation willingness and behavior.

T1  - Hated but still human: Metadehumanization leads to greater hostility than metaprejudice: GPIR
AN  - 2638251288
AB  - Metadehumanization, the perception that members of an outgroup dehumanize your group, has been found to exacerbate intergroup conflict by inspiring reciprocal dehumanization of the offending outgroup. Moreover, metadehumanization is distinct from metaprejudice (i.e., the perception that an outgroup hates your group). Given the mutual animosity reported in public opinion polls toward the other side, we believed US–Russia relations would be a worthwhile context in which to extend this model. Therefore, we measured Americans’ levels of metadehumanization and metaprejudice of Russians to determine the association between these perceptions and their hostility toward Russians (Study 1). In this novel intergroup conflict, metadehumanization remained a consequential predictor of outgroup hostility over and above metaprejudice, suggesting that it can exacerbate a broader range of intergroup conflicts than those heretofore examined. Given these findings, we then sought to experimentally differentiate between metadehumanization and metaprejudice. In Study 2, we manipulated both metadehumanization and metaprejudice to (a) determine whether one or both cause greater outgroup hostility and (b) elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which they may produce this effect. Whereas metadehumanization produced greater hostility, metaprejudice did not. Moreover, although both metaperceptions inspired greater prejudice, only metadehumanization led to greater dehumanization. We conclude that metadehumanization may be a particularly potent fomenter of hostility because it inspires reciprocal dehumanization over and above more general negative bias.

T1  - The effect of the 2020 racial justice protests on attitudes and preferences in rural and urban America
AN  - 2642201408
AB  - ObjectiveThis paper seeks to understand the impact of sustained protests for racial justice on attitudes toward racial minorities, the police, and policies that would benefit racial minorities.MethodsUsing a large, nationally representative survey collected before and after the death of George Floyd and the protest movement that followed it, I employ a propensity score matching to identify the causal impact of these protests on perceptions of discrimination against blacks, favorability of the police, racial prejudice, and support for reparations for slavery. I also identify heterogeneous effects in rural America to identify the limits of these attitude shifts.ResultsI find evidence that George Floyd's death caused an increased perception of discrimination against blacks, decreased favorability of the police, decreased racial prejudice, and increased support for reparations. I also find muted and heterogeneous effects in rural America.ConclusionThese findings speak to the power of social protest to shift attitudes and policy preferences and to the persistent divide between urban and rural Americans.

T1  - The plight of racialised minorities during a pandemic: migrants and refugees in Italy and Australia
AN  - 2625203347
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to draw on data from interviews with six Italian migrant service providers and media stories in Italy and Australia to weave a comparative snapshot of the plight of precarious migrant and refugee communities in these two countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.Design/methodology/approachThe article draws attention to prejudicial shortcomings towards vulnerable migrant communities enacted by the states of Italy and Australia in response to COVID-19.FindingsWhile the unequal ecology of the pandemic has flared up the need for the State to strengthen participation and inclusion policies, it has also provided opportunities to foreground the disadvantages vulnerable communities face that also demand policy attention and sustained funding. Governments in migrant-receiving countries like Australia and Italy need to articulate culturally sensitive and inclusive responses that foreground agencies give vulnerable migrants, asylum seekers and refugees clear, supportive messages of solidarity leading to practical solutions.Originality/valueThis paper relays preliminary data from the coalface (migrant service providers) and media as the pandemic evolved in the two countries, whose support mechanisms had never before been critically compared and evaluated through the lens of racial inequality in the face of a health and social crisis.

T1  - The educational divide over feelings about ethnic minorities: does more education really lead to less prejudice?
AN  - 2624032717
AB  - Virtually all studies on inter-ethnic attitudes in Western Europe and North America find that higher educated individuals report greater tolerance towards migrants and ethnic minorities. The overwhelming evidence on this link has even led scholars to call for educational expansion as a policy measure to increase social cohesion in today’s ever more diverse societies. But most of this evidence comes from cross-sectional correlations, and it is still unclear whether increasing education actually causes greater levels of tolerance. In this study, we follow a cohort of students aged 15 years over a period of 8 years from the German Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey (CILS4EU-DE). We focus on students who change from lower tracks into upper secondary and later tertiary education (the ‘treatment’ group) and compare them to a control group of similar students who stay in the lower track and leave school without entering university. Matching and fixed-effects panel regressions provide no evidence for a causal effect of changing into a higher educational track on subsequent prejudice towards ethnic minorities. We conclude that the descriptive difference between educational groups in their attitudes towards ethnic minorities is evident, but attending higher education per se does not seem to cause this difference.

T1  - Disentangling contact and socialization effects on outgroup attitudes in diverse friendship networks
AN  - 2622616623
AB  - Friendships with members of our own group (ingroup) and other groups (outgroups) shape our attitudes toward outgroups. Research on intergroup contact has shown that the numbers of outgroup and ingroup friends we have influence our outgroup attitudes, whereas research on socialization has shown that the attitudes held by our friends influence our outgroup attitudes. Past research, however, examined these processes in isolation, which precludes discerning whether having friends, or the attitudes held by our friends, are both important in shaping our outgroup attitudes, and, if so, which is more important. To disentangle these effects, we conducted a 5-wave social network study in 2 ethnically diverse schools (N = 1,170 students). By applying a novel longitudinal coevolution model, we were able to separate the effects of having ingroup and outgroup friends (contact effects), and the effects of those friends' attitudes (socialization effects), on individuals' outgroup attitudes, while controlling for friendship selection processes. In so doing, we found that it is principally the attitudes of ingroup friends-not outgroup friends' attitudes or having ingroup and outgroup friends alone-that predict individuals' outgroup attitudes. Our findings have important theoretical implications, as we demonstrate that combining the divergent approaches of intergroup contact and socialization enables us to better understand outgroup attitude development. Our findings also have practical implications, as we show that, even in diverse environments, individuals rely primarily on friends from their own group to inform their attitudes toward other groups.

T1  - Can past intergroup contact shape support for policies in a pandemic? Processes predicting endorsement of discriminatory Chinese restrictions during the COVID-19 crisis: GPIR
AN  - 2621963559
AB  - A survey of 340 UK residents was conducted when the COVID-19 virus first reached the UK in February 2020. We measured past experiences of positive and negative intergroup contact with Chinese people as predictors of intergroup threat and emotions in the context of the pandemic; and how these processes in turn predicted support for discriminatory policies designed to restrict the freedom of Chinese people in the UK. We tested a novel threat-matching hypothesis which draws upon models of outgroup-specific social perception to predict that the emotional processes underlying contact effects will depend on the specific threat posed by the outgroup. In the present epidemiological context, Chinese people posed a salient threat to individuals’ physical health and welfare. Accordingly, we show that whilst intergroup contact predicted both fear and anger towards the outgroup, the indirect effect of contact on support for Chinese restriction policies via fear was significantly stronger than the indirect effect via anger. Our findings provide a more nuanced understanding of how specific threat and emotions drive intergroup contact effects, and offer important insights for efforts to maintain positive intergroup relations in the face of the crisis.

T1  - Turkish Speaking Young Adults Attitudes Toward Transgender Individuals: Transphobia, Homophobia and Gender Ideology
AN  - 2607088489
AB  - There is wide research investigating negative attitudes and behaviors toward gays and lesbians within Western societies. However, only a small amount of studies have addressed attitudes toward transgender individuals, particularly in non-Western societies with younger populations. This study, therefore, aimed to examine the predictors of transphobic attitudes in north Cyprus using young adults. Participants were 148 (96 women, 51 men) Turkish speaking young adults, aged between 18 and 25 years (M =  20.29, SD =  2.38). Participants completed a questionnaire package containing measures of intergroup contact, ambivalent sexism, social dominance orientation, homophobic feelings and attitudes, and transphobia. As expected, results showed that intergroup contact, hostile sexism, and homophobia predicted transphobic attitudes. Implications to ameliorate discriminatory attitudes toward transgender individuals in non-Western cultures are discussed.

T1  - White parents’ racial socialization and young adults’ racial attitudes: Moral reasoning and motivation to respond without prejudice as mediators: GPIR
AN  - 2609042692
AB  - This study examined relations between parental racial socialization messages (i.e., egalitarianism, racemute, and preparation for bias) and racial attitudes in a sample of 282 White young adults (ages 18–22) in the United States. Egalitarianism messages were positively related to warmth toward racial outgroup members, whereas preparation for bias was negatively related to warmth toward racial outgroup members. In both cases the relation between racial socialization and racial attitudes was mediated by internal motivation to respond without prejudice and fairness/reciprocity moral orientation. Contrary to our expectations, racemute socialization messages were not directly related to participants’ warmth toward racial outgroup members. However, racemute socialization predicted internal motivation to respond without prejudice and fairness/reciprocity moral orientation, which in turn predicted outgroup warmth. These findings suggest possible mechanisms by which parents’ messages about race and racism may shape youths’ racial attitudes.

T1  - Modes of victim blaming in a case of stabbing: Victim and offender ethnicity and observer ethnicity and religious affiliation
AN  - 2621592211
AB  - This study examined the effects of ethnicity on victim-blaming in a case of stabbing by addressing victim and offender ethnicity as well as observer ethnicity and religion. Jewish (n = 285), Muslim Arab (n = 249), and Christian Arab (n = 51) students from Israeli universities and colleges read a single stabbing scenario, in which we manipulated victim (Arab/Jewish) and offender ethnicity (African/Arab/Jewish). The results showed that participants blamed a Jewish victim more than an Arab victim. Also, our findings indicated that Christian Arabs expressed significantly higher victim-blaming than Jews. However, victim-blaming among Christian Arabs did not significantly differ from victim-blaming among Muslim Arabs, and victim-blaming among Muslim Arabs did not significantly differ from victim-blaming among Jews. Furthermore, the interactions between observer and victim ethnicity and between observer and offender ethnicity were significant. The discussion addresses the findings in the context of prejudice against members of African and Arab communities, the black sheep effect, and defensive attribution. In addition, the discussion suggests that observer ethnic and religious background may be related to blame-attribution mode: fixed (not affected by victim and offender ethnicity) or modular (affected by victim and offender ethnicity). From the practical standpoint, our findings suggest a need for further education on prejudice against minorities and promoting ethnic diversity among practitioners assisting and treating victims.

T1  - Shared disadvantage as a determinant of the relationship between White Americans’ socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic prejudice
AN  - 2623504364
AB  - The present studies examined the conditions under which low subjective socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with greater racial/ethnic prejudice among White Americans. Using theories of intergroup threat and inclusive victim consciousness, we predicted that describing racial/ethnic minorities as disadvantaged (vs. as competitive or in neutral terms) would increase empathy and reduce prejudice among White Americans who consider themselves low in SES. Study 1 provided correlational evidence that White Americans who perceived themselves as low‐SES (but not high‐SES) were less prejudiced against racial/ethnic minorities the more they perceived minorities as disadvantaged. In Study 2, portraying the target outgroup (Arab immigrants) as disadvantaged increased outgroup empathy, and in turn reduced prejudice, among participants induced to think of themselves as low‐SES. Study 3 conceptually replicated these results using a different outgroup (Mexican Americans) and a behavioral measure of prejudice. Implications for reducing prejudice among White Americans of different socioeconomic backgrounds are discussed.

T1  - Gendered racial boundary maintenance: Social penalties for White women in interracial relationships
AN  - 2601602005
AB  - Throughout American history, formal laws and social norms have discouraged interracial romantic relationships. Interracial relationships blur the boundaries between racial groups, challenging the essentialized racial categories that define Whiteness as an exclusive, high status identity. Whites, who are the most resistant to interracial marriage of any racial group, have used their dominant position in American society to enforce norms against interracial relationships. Despite the importance of racial homogamy to White identity and status, we argue that gender roles make violating norms against intimate intergroup contact more costly for women than men, leading to Whites' greater resistance to interracial relationships involving White women. In a representative American sample using a natural quasi-experiment, as well as 3 follow-up lab experiments, we find that White women face differential social penalties for intimate intergroup contact-being perceived as gender deviant and low status within the group. By contrast, having a racial out-group partner did not influence status perceptions of men or Black women. Status perceptions of both individuals in the couple predicted attitudes toward the couple as a unit, leading to greater prejudice toward interracial relationships involving White women than White men. This research demonstrates the existence of a gendered double standard for intimate intergroup contact among Whites, revealing that gender norms play a critical role in the maintenance of American racial boundaries.

T1  - The psychosocial implications of social distancing for people with COPD: some exploratory issues facing a uniquely marginalised group during the COVID-19 pandemic
AN  - 2555236098
AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an illness associated with intersectional poverty and stigma in old age; people with COPD are susceptible to anxiety, loneliness and isolation. People with COPD who contract COVID-19 are at high risk of serious complications, intensive medical needs and death and are, therefore, required to socially distance particularly assiduously. This paper offers an embodied phenomenological analysis of the emerging theoretical literature exploring the impact of social distancing upon people with COPD. Firstly, people with COPD are aware of how respiratory illness feels, are anxious about COVID-19 and afraid of being denied care. Future research might consider how people with COPD may be susceptible to “coronaphobia” and mental health consequences of the pandemic. Secondly, COPD tends to affect older people within the most intersectionally marginalised socioeconomic groups. Future research should remain mindful that people with COPD may be among the most lonely and least able to access health and social care services online than others. Thirdly, pandemics are known to intensify pre-existing social stigmas. Researchers and practitioners alike should be conscious that people with COPD may become increasingly stigmatised, especially those from intersectionally disadvantaged minorities.

T1  - The Reconciliation Of Opposites: Challenging Group Categorization And Stereotypes In Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's "A Private Experience" And César Mba A. Abogo's "Hora De Partir"
AN  - 2638773379
AB  - Social Identity Theory (Tajfel; Tajfel and Turner) is rooted in the premise that individuals construct their own identities based on social categorization and group membership, and this attachment of people to groups is sufficient "to produce prejudices both in favor of members of one's own group and sometimes against members of another group" (Dovidio et al. 4). In this article, I analyze how the characters in "A Private Experience" (2009), by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and "Hora de Partir" (2007), by César Mba A. Abogo, resist group categorization and minimize stereotyping and group distinctions by experiencing intergroup relationships and enhancing their individualities. While the story "A Private Experience" portrays a Muslim and a Christian woman who defy the Muslim-Christian conflict in Nigeria by means of their peaceful and close connection, the interracial couple in "Hora de Partir" challenges racial and social prejudices through their love relationship. Thus, both narratives depict resistant subjects who confront the hegemonic ideologies resulting from group categorizations by the mutual interest between individuals who belong to conflicting groups and the depiction of a fruitful amalgam of transcultural elements within the stories that endorses diversity as a positive social value. By means of establishing harmonious relationships with outgroup members, these literary voices delegitimize intergroup conflict, trigger a transcultural dialogue, and find an effective way to resist the social constraints imposed by group categorization.

T1  - How Black Teen Girls Navigate Social Media to Form Romantic Relationships
AN  - 2583827263
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the use of social media within the context of heterosexual Black teen girls’ romantic partner selection processes. To better understand Black teen girls’ experiences, five focus groups (N = 27; aged 14–18 years) were conducted over Zoom. An inductive thematic analysis revealed four major themes: (1) the use of different platforms to gather different types of information, (2) the rules of social media scouting, (3) detecting partner qualities through social media, and (4) exploring Black teen girls’ experience with social media and dating. Participants in our study primarily used Instagram to understand a potential partner’s true self, while Twitter was used to assess a potential partner’s political leanings. Our participants shared numerous “rules” related to the partner-scouting process. Black teen girls in our study explained that photos index a potential partner’s style and hygiene, while memes were used to gauge sense of humor compatibility. More specific to Black teen girls, across all focus groups, participants shared their experiences of racism and bias, such as being associated with Black stereotypes, cultural invalidation, and being accused of “acting White.” Although teen girls of various racial and ethnic groups may use social media to vet romantic partners, findings reveal that Black teen girls navigate social media in a unique way, including being highly attuned to signs of bias. Our findings suggest that in the first few months of COVID-19 social distancing had little impact on our participant’s practice of using social media to vet potential romantic partners.

T1  - Adolescent development of interethnic attitudes following a social intervention to increase intergroup contact: The moderating role of affective forecasting
AN  - 2570234864
AB  - This longitudinal, quasi-experimental field study investigated affective forecasting as a moderator of positive intergroup contact effects among adolescents. We also examined a novel mediating mechanism that underlies this effect, namely accuracy of perceived outgroup willingness for intergroup contact. Three annual waves of survey data were used from 1,169 adolescents (Mage = 13.88 at Wave 1; 50% girls; 66% White British, 44% Asian British) whose schools were merged, in a unique intervention that resulted in one school where ethnic groups were evenly mixed (i.e., balanced school) and two White British majority schools (i.e., majority skewed schools). Results showed that positive intergroup contact and attitudes improved more in the balanced school than in the majority skewed schools. In all schools, change in adolescents' positive intergroup contact predicted change in positive intergroup attitudes indirectly via (a) increased accuracy of perceived outgroup willingness for contact and (b) reduced intergroup anxiety. Indirect effects via accuracy of perceived contact willingness were stronger for adolescents who made more negative affective forecasts than for other adolescents. These moderated mediation effects were stronger in the balanced school than in the majority skewed schools. Thus, more balanced ethnic mixing in schools seemed to directly enhance positive intergroup relations and attitudes for all adolescents, but to particularly benefit adolescents who made more negative affective forecasts about positive contact before the school merger.

T1  - A Phenomenological Approach to the Study of Social Distance
AN  - 2541127043
AB  - From its very beginning, sociological thought has been concerned with a topic central to our daily lives: social distance. Since inception, the concept of social distance has referred to the relationships of familiarity and strangeness between social groups, which is experienced in the social world in terms of “We” and “They”. This article covers the main tenets of a Schutzian phenomenological approach to the study of social distance and group relationships. Specific focus is placed on the different attitudes and valuations of the in-group towards the out-group considered as a stranger, the invisible excess of meaning that emerges in these types of social relationships and the conceptual construction of the Other that explains the phenomenon of discrimination.

T1  - Sexual Orientation Beliefs and Identity Development: A Person-Centered Analysis among Sexual Minorities
AN  - 2531429817
AB  - We conducted person-centered analysis of sexual orientation beliefs among sexual minorities to explore potential relationships between these beliefs and sexual orientation, developmental milestones, race and ethnicity, and attitudes about sexual orientation. We recruited participants (N = 416) via Amazon Mechanical Turk who completed measures of beliefs about sexual orientation and attitudes about their own sexuality, as well as assessments of mental health and age of sexual identity development milestones. We conducted a latent profile analysis and found three distinct sexual orientation belief profiles, similar to those previously observed in predominantly straight samples. We found that sexual orientation and race-ethnicity predicted belief profile membership, with the latter exhibiting the most substantial effect. Of the four identity developmental milestones tested, only the age of first same-sex attraction predicted belief profile membership. Across profiles, members differed significantly in their mean endorsement of both positive and negative attitudes regarding sexual orientation and psychological distress. Thus, the current research suggests that sexual orientation beliefs are powerful constructs in the lives of sexual minorities, with relationships to sexual orientation, other social identities, and mental health.

T1  - "Pride and prejudice" pathways to belonging: Implications for inclusive diversity practices within mainstream institutions
AN  - 2540773508
AB  - Within mainstream institutions such as colleges and universities, scientists and social leaders, alike, are faced with persistent and new challenges to forging paths toward inclusion among marginalized group members (e.g., Latino/a/x and African Americans). Integrating theoretical perspectives that conceptualize identity among marginalized groups as tied to culture and strengths with literatures on threat and stigma, we propose a "pride and prejudice" approach to inclusion. We provide support for the efficacy of inclusion as 2 pathways-one route that is associated with recognizing "pride" or the history and culture of marginalized groups and another that is related to reducing "prejudice" or perceived discrimination toward marginalized groups. Specifically, we demonstrate using actual demands for inclusion generated by students attending 80 colleges and universities that a pride and prejudice approach is consistent with collective calls for institutional change voiced by marginalized group members and their allies (Study 1). Then, Study 2, using longitudinal data of Latino/a/x and African American students (N = 1,967) attending 27 colleges and universities we reveal the impact of pride (e.g., taking an ethnic studies course) and prejudice (e.g., perceived discrimination) experiences on sense of belonging, and in turn academic and health outcomes (e.g., graduation rates, depression). We provide evidence for 1 theory-based process whereby individual experiences tied to pride and prejudice can impact belongingness through intragroup and intergroup relations. Theory and policy implications for institutional inclusion efforts including the importance of fostering ties to ingroup and outgoup members are discussed.

T1  - From Student to Employee: Group Compatibility Predicts Group Identification and Intergroup Attitudes
AN  - 2521296386
AB  - Transitions go along with the need to integrate a previous outgroup into the self-concept. This study examines whether this integration follows cognitive consistency principles. In line with recent theorizing, we test whether the perceived compatibility of a previous and a current ingroup determines identification with these groups and intergroup attitudes. We primed employees who were former students (N = 269) to perceive the groups of students and employees as either more compatible or less compatible, and measured the strength of identification and group attitudes with regard to both groups. The findings largely confirmed predictions. Greater compatibility between social groups increased identity integration and reduced intergroup bias. Identity integration mediated the effect of compatibility on intergroup bias. In line with predictions, the voluntariness of group change explained which of the groups people identified more strongly with when groups were perceived low in compatibility. The results of the study provide evidence that integrating identities into the self-concept follows cognitive consistency principles and suggests that emphasizing similarities between previous and current ingroups fosters identity integration and reduces intergroup bias.

[...]several theoretical perspectives (e.g., cognitive dissonance) suggest that engaging in behaviors inconsistent with attitudes may lead to attitude change [17].

[...]in the current study, we examined whether the prevention behaviors of mask usage, social distancing, handwashing, and stocking up on food/supplies were associated with COVID-19 vaccine intentions as a positive association could both help guide the development of interventions to improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake as well as predict individuals and potentially geographic regions to target based on current levels of COVID-19 prevention behaviors.

Individuals who responded, “no, I will not get a coronavirus vaccine,” were also asked, “Which of the following are reasons you would not get a coronavirus vaccine?” Respondents could select multiple reasons and response options included “I am allergic to vaccines,” “I don’t like needles,” “I’m not concerned about getting seriously ill from the coronavirus,” “I won’t have time to get vaccinated,” “I would be concerned about getting infected with the coronavirus from the vaccine,” “I would be concerned about side effects from the vaccine,” “I don’t think vaccines work very well,” and “the coronavirus outbreak is not as serious as some people say it is.”

T1  - Homeownership Intention among Igbo Ethnic Group in Ilorin
AN  - 2603456631
AB  - The extant literature has previously shown that attitude towards homeownership and pressure from reference groups may significantly affect individual's homeownership intention especially in many western societies. The authors assumed that Nigerian citizens might also have similar experience especially for non-indigenes living and working in states in geo-political zones outside their own ethnic areas. The study surveyed 300 members of Igbo ethnic group residents in Ilorin metropolis. Simple random sampling method was adopted and data was gathered through structured questionnaire. The authors questioned participants about their attitude and intention towards owning personal home in the city. They also asked participants to relate to questions about the perceived easiness to acquire properties for personal use in the city and about the social (families' and relatives') pressure on their homeownership intention. Analytical techniques include simple frequency and percentage distributions, pearson chi-square and independent t-test. Research findings show that while many sampled participants have positive attitude towards homeownership in Ilorin, length of stay in the city, level of education and the perceived control affect homeownership intention among the participants. A surprising result was that subjective norms appear to exert little or no influence on participants' homeownership intention. Hence, the finding demonstrates the interactive nature of social influence/personal norms dimension in homeownership through availability of and access to information and sources of homeownership funding.Alternate abstract:La littérature existante a déjà montré que l'attitude envers l'accession à la propriété et la pression des groupes de référence peuvent affecter de manière significative l'intention d'accession à la propriété d'un individu, en particulier dans de nombreuses sociétés occidentales. Les auteurs ont supposé que les citoyens nigérians pourraient également avoir une expérience similaire, en particulier pour les non-indigènes vivant et travaillant dans des États situés dans des zones géopolitiques en dehors de leurs propres zones ethniques. L'étude a interrogé 300 membres du groupe ethnique Igbo résidant dans la métropole d'Ilorin. Une méthode d'échantillonnage aléatoire simple a été adoptée et les données ont été recueillies au moyen d'un questionnaire structuré. Les auteurs ont interrogé les participants sur leur attitude et leur intention de posséder une maison personnelle dans la ville. Ils ont également demandé aux participants de se rapporter à des questions sur la facilité perçue d'acquérir des propriétés à usage personnel dans la ville et sur la pression sociale (familles et proches) sur leur intention d'accession à la propriété. Les techniques analytiques comprennent des distributions simples de fréquence et de pourcentage, le chi carré de Pearson et le test t indépendant. Les résultats de la recherche montrent que si de nombreux participants échantillonnés ont une attitude positive envers l'accession à la propriété à Ilorin, la durée du séjour dans la ville, le niveau d'éducation et le contrôle perçu affectent l'intention d'accession à la propriété chez les participants. Un résultat surprenant est que les normes subjectives semblent exercer peu ou pas d'influence sur l'intention des participants d'accéder à la propriété. Par conséquent, les résultats démontrent la nature interactive de la dimension influence sociale/normes personnelles dans l'accession à la propriété grâce à la disponibilité et à l'accès à l'information et aux sources de financement pour l'accession à la propriété.

T1  - Police brutality against Blacks in the United States and ensuing protests: Implications for social distancing and Black health during COVID-19
AN  - 2510493909
AB  - The pandemic of respiratory disease spreading from person-to-person, named “coronavirus disease 2019” (abbreviated “COVID-19”), presents a public health emergency of international concern. This pandemic is occurring during renewed attention to the persistent issue of police brutality against Blacks in the United States. Protests have ensued to highlight perceived and observed injustice against minorities, particularly Black people. Concerns arise that these protests may complicate efforts to adhere to social distancing and increase risks of COVID-19 exposure among Black persons, who are already disproportionality affected by COVID-19 outcomes due to systemic barriers within the healthcare system and society. This article discusses police brutality against Blacks in the United States and subsequent protests, considerations for social distancing and racial disparities in health during COVID-19, and the need for policies to ensure fair and equitable enforcement of social distancing mandates. We also discuss the need for policies to improve access to COVID-19 testing, diagnosis, and management among underserved and minority communities.

T1  - Beyond dislike: Blatant dehumanization predicts teacher discrimination: GPIR
AN  - 2407985297
AB  - School teachers have been shown to favor ethnic majority over minority students. However, it is unclear what psychological processes motivate ethnicity-based discrimination. Of the studies that have examined the psychological roots of teacher discrimination, most have focused on implicit or explicit prejudice. We propose an alternate predictor: dehumanization. Using a within-subject paradigm with a small-scale experiment (N = 29) and a larger scale replication (N = 161), we find that Hungarian preservice teachers consistently discriminate against Roma minority students by recommending that they be denied entry to higher track secondary schools, and preferentially placing them into lower track schools, relative to equally qualified ethnic majority Hungarian students, and that the severity of the ethnic tracking bias is predicted by dehumanization (but not prejudice). In fact, the relationship between dehumanization and discrimination holds (and may be significantly stronger) for teachers who express the lowest levels of prejudice towards the Roma.

T1  - The Electoral Success of the Extreme Right: Is the Presence of a Minority Important?*
AN  - 2454692602
AB  - Anti-minority rhetoric as an almost universal feature of extreme-right parties is often analytically and empirically linked to their electoral success. This article tests the link between the presence of an outgroup and the vote for the extreme right in an attempt to explain the electoral success of the first openly anti-system extreme-right party to enter the Slovak parliament in 2016. A multilevel approach is used to analyse the connection between Roma presence in a municipality and extreme-right support while controlling for the individual characteristics of voters. Analysis using exit-poll data covering 161 municipalities and 20 128 voters reveals no relationship between the presence of Roma in a municipality and support for the extreme right. A partial exception seems to be observed for older voters and the university-educated, who are generally the least inclined to far-right support. Interaction effects suggest that, for these groups, Roma presence might be connected to a higher probability to cast a vote for the extreme right. However, a notably higher chance of voting for the extreme right was associated with young, male, manual labourers and people without university education.

T1  - Interethnic Prejudice Against Muslims Among White Dutch Children
AN  - 2401694803
AB  - Interethnic prejudice in children has been studied mostly in the United States, but less often in Europe, where the public discourse is increasingly negative about ethnic minorities, especially the Muslim minority. This study examined in-group favoritism (White preference) and out-group rejection of children of Middle Eastern descent (representing the Muslim minority) among White children in the Netherlands. Social preference for and rejection of children of Middle Eastern descent are compared with preference for and rejection of Black children. Social preference and rejection were measured using a task in which participants were presented with pictures of children with different ethnic appearances, and asked to select who they wanted to (not) play with, (not) sit next to, and invite for their birthday party. In addition, maternal implicit prejudice against people of Middle Eastern descent and explicit attitudes toward their children’s interethnic contact were assessed. The study included 140 children aged 6 to 8 years (M = 7.26, SD = 0.77) and their mothers. The results reveal both in-group favoritism and out-group rejection. The Middle Eastern out-group was preferred less than the Black out-group. Reporting absolutely no reservations about children’s interethnic contact by mothers was associated with less rejection of children of Middle Eastern descent. Findings reveal that young children already show interethnic prejudice and that particularly people of Middle Eastern descent are devalued. The results show that maternal acceptance of child interethnic contact seems to play a role, and provide starting points for further investigation of the relation between parental and child interethnic attitudes.

T1  - How to Enhance the Effects of Mediated Intergroup Contact? Evidence from Four Countries
AN  - 2334265612
AB  - We bridge the theorizing on mediated and imagined contact and integrate these two contact forms in one sequence within a single design. We experimentally examine whether (1) encouraging people to imagine a positive intergroup encounter prior to reading a personal story of an outgroup member as well as (2) mediated contact with an outgroup member similar or dissimilar to the ingroup prototype, improve outgroup attitudes. We also test the affective and cognitive mediators through which these effects emerge. Data from four different countries that test attitudes toward four distinct immigrant groups find that although imagined contact and similarity do not consistently improve outgroup attitudes, enhanced interest in the story of an outgroup member and positive emotions mediate the effects from similarity, and - in two countries - from imagined contact. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.

T1  - The social identity approach: Appraising the Tajfellian legacy
AN  - 2331728540
AB  - Since its original formulation, Tajfel’s Social Identity Theory (SIT) has broadened considerably from its original focus on intergroup relations and is now applied to a wide range of phenomena. Indeed, the ‘social identity approach’ has become one of the most widely used perspectives in contemporary social psychology. In this article, I examine the popularity of Tajfel’s writings on social identity and intergroup relations, especially over the last thirty years when they started to become more generally used. I offer a critical appraisal of the original SIT, both as a theory of intergroup relations and as a theory of identity, concluding that its real value lies in its success in offering an over‐arching perspective on the importance of groups in social life and its ability to stimulate new areas of research. I then widen the discussion to consider how the social identity perspective has been used in a number of other fields of enquiry.

T1  - Stay away or stay together? Social contagion, common identity, and bystanders’ interventions in homophobic bullying episodes: GPIR
AN  - 2330295351
AB  - Two studies explored the link between social contagion concerns and assertive bystanders’ behavioral intentions in homophobic bullying episodes. Study 1 (N = 216) examined if adolescents’ social contagion concerns (i.e., fear of being misclassified as gay/lesbian) relate to decreased behavioral intentions to help victims of bullying, by increasing negative attitudes towards lesbians and gay men. Study 2 (N = 230) further explored if inclusive identity representations (i.e., one-group or dual-identity) were related to decreased concerns of social contagion, thereby increasing adolescents’ assertive behavioral intentions. Results (partially) confirmed both expected mediations: social contagion concerns were associated with decreased assertive behavioral intentions via increased negative attitudes towards lesbians and gay men (Study 1); one-group representations, but not dual-identity representations, were associated with more assertive behavioral intentions via decreased social contagion concerns (Study 2). These findings extended previous studies illustrating the underlying mechanisms through which social contagion concerns and common identity affect assertive bystanders’ behavioral intentions.

T1  - National frenemies: linguistic intergroup attitudes in Canada
AN  - 2309190623
AB  - Intergroup sentiments have been shown to be an important determinant of social stability in multinational countries. The present study explores the present state of linguistic intergroup tensions in Canada to contribute to the understanding of outgroup attitudes among minorities and majorities. Four main findings are derived from the results of empirical analyses on survey data. (1) Cultural threat impacts outgroup attitudes in both the national minority and the national majority. (2) Education has a strong impact on feelings towards the linguistic outgroup. (3) Unexpectedly, age does not display a statistical influence on intergroup attitudes. (4) Specifically relating to Canada, intergroup feelings between Francophones and Anglophones have over the last quarter century become considerably more positive, both groups hold quite positive attitudes towards one another.

T1  - From Insult to Estrangement and Injury: The Violence of Racist Police Jokes: PROD
AN  - 2300927973
AB  - This article examines racially derogatory police jokes, what we call “racist blue humor,” as discourse that negatively targets and ridicules racial and ethnic minorities as inferior, dangerous, or as objects of symbolic and cultural violence. We argue that racist blue humor fosters the social acceptability of prejudice and discrimination among officers, normalizing a culture of dehumanization that legitimizes structural and direct violence. We analyze illustrative cases of racist blue humor in the light of critical race theory, humor studies, and other work in behavioral science to elaborate this violence and its potential for harm across multiple contexts. Racist blue humor engenders legal estrangement, diminishes protection and representation in law, and heightens exposure to police and other state violence. We conclude with considerations for research and policy, including order-maintenance policing of racist blue humor.

T1  - Income Inequality, Ethnic Diversity, and State Minimum Wages
AN  - 2209592351
AB  - ObjectivesThe objective of the current study is to examine the determinants of wage floors set by state governments in the United States, with a particular focus on the effects of income inequality and ethnic diversity.MethodWe estimate the effects of income inequality, ethnic diversity, and their interaction on real state minimum wages using a state‐level panel of Census demographic data from 1981 to 2010. We also control for state‐level demographics and additional state‐level information, such as measures of voter and government liberalism, along with time and state fixed effects.ResultsWe find that the impact of income inequality is mediated by ethnic diversity. When states are highly ethnically homogeneous, increases in income inequality are associated with higher state minimum wages. When states are highly ethnically heterogeneous, increases in income inequality are associated with lower state minimum wages. The impact of income inequality lacks statistical significance when levels of ethnic diversity are either average or somewhat below average.ConclusionsOverall, our results suggest that the negative impact on state minimum wages in heterogeneous states could stem from rising income inequality, which increases the social distance between whites and other ethnic groups and weakens mass support for wage policies that are believed by the public to be beneficial to the poor.

T1  - The Intention to Discuss Advance Care Planning in the Context of Alzheimer's Disease Among Korean Americans
AN  - 2196497423
AB  - Background and Objectives Advance care planning (ACP) is crucial for quality end-of-life care for patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, limited evidence is available about ACP among ethnic minorities, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease. The purpose of this study was to examine intention to discuss ACP for a family member with Alzheimer's disease among Korean Americans. Guided by the theory of planned behavior and prior research, we examined the relationships between acculturation, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived control, and intention to discuss ACP for a family member with Alzheimer's disease. Research Design and Methods Path analyses were conducted on a cross-sectional convenience sample of 261 Korean Americans. Age, gender, education, and knowledge about Alzheimer's disease and ACP were included as covariates. Results Our descriptive findings showed positive attitudes, strong subjective norms, and a high level of perceived control toward ACP discussion among the participants. The path analyses revealed that attitudes and subjective norms were positively related to intention for ACP discussion. Perceived control was not related to intention for ACP discussion. Among the covariates, greater knowledge about Alzheimer's disease was the only factor shown to be associated with the intention for ACP discussion. Discussion and Implications To promote ACP among this population, educational interventions designed to address positives attitudes and subjective norms toward ACP are suggested.

T1  - When "They" Become "Us": The Effect of Time and Ingroup Identity on Perceptions of Gay and Lesbian Group Members
AN  - 2190018157
AB  - Prejudice change manipulations rarely produce the expected attitude change effects. Our research suggests that attitude change depends on time-dependent memory consolidation processes. This study tested the effects of group information and time on perceptions of gays and lesbians. Heterosexual participants (N = 90) were randomly assigned to a condition where their ingroup, or an outgroup, included gay and lesbian individuals. We measured participants' gay and lesbian political attitudes and evaluations of the groups' members at a short or long delay. Results showed no effect of our manipulations on political attitudes, F(1, 86) = 0.14, p = .72. Contrary to predictions, participants evaluated gay and lesbian ingroup members less positively at the long versus short delay, t(49) = 3.72, p = .0004, d = 1.01. Results suggest that members of stigmatized groups are perceived more negatively when associated with one's ingroup.

T1  - Theories for Race and Gender Differences in Management of Social Identity-Related Stressors: a Systematic Review
AN  - 2171209726
AB  - Sociodemographic group-specific strategies for stress management may contribute to racial and gender disparities in health outcomes in the USA. We aimed to systematically review theoretical and empirical investigations of factors influencing variation in response to and management of identity-related stress among black and white Americans. OvidPsychInfo and PubMed databases were searched to identify eligible studies. Criteria were participant age of ≥ 18 years, conducted in the US sampling black or white participants, and published in English in a peer-reviewed journal. The final sample included 167 articles. Theories suggesting social status inequities as the primary contributor to disparate strategies employed by black and white women and men to manage social identity-related stress were most frequently tested and supported. Studies disproportionally focused on how women and black persons cope as targets of prejudice and discrimination rather than on how management strategies of men or white persons are affected as perpetrators. Finally, there was theoretical support for an interactive effect of race and gender on stress management, but empirical evidence was lacking, particularly among black men, white women, and white men. The literature could be strengthened through the use of prospective cohorts and nationally representative samples, as well as study designs accounting for potential within-race and within-gender variation in the effects of social identity-related stressors on coping. With greater consistency in methodology, future empirical studies may yield additional information regarding group differences in stress management pertinent to clarifying mechanisms for the health consequences of exposure to social inequity among black and white women and men.

T1  - The polarizing effects of group discussion in a negative normative context: Integrating societal‐, group‐, and individual‐level factors
AN  - 2162391920
AB  - In this research, we investigate how a negative (or hostile) norm regarding minorities at the societal level can fuel polarization between majority subgroups at the local level. We hypothesize that rapid social change in the form of polarization results from the interplay between small group processes and perceptions of society at large. By employing a novel analytic approach that uses variances to capture non‐linear societal change, we were able to study polarization processes. In three studies among high school and university students (N = 347), we manipulated the majority norm about a minority category (positive vs. negative). Subsequently, participants read about a minority member's ambiguous behaviour and evaluated this target. All studies used a similar paradigm, but they varied in whether or not participants discussed the ambiguous behaviour within local groups. Results showed that the majority norm at the societal level affected perceptions of the minority member's behaviour when people discussed this behaviour in a local majority group but not when they reflected on it individually. Specifically, group discussions led to polarization between local groups within a broader social category, but only in the context of a negative majority norm. This effect was predicted by the a priori perception of the local group norm. Results are discussed in terms of the integration of society‐ and group‐level processes when studying the development of intergroup attitudes and practical implications for the coarsening climate of the societal debate about current societal issues.

T1  - Is racism the new sectarianism? Negativity towards immigrants and ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland from 2004 to 2015
AN  - 2103357901
AB  - Negativity towards ethnic minorities is a serious problem in Northern Ireland. Its history of the Troubles around religious identities makes Northern Ireland a special case in Europe. This paper examines negativity towards Muslims, Eastern Europeans and immigrants in Northern Ireland using data from the Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey and the British Social Attitudes Survey. The results from regressions show that anti-immigrant negativity is no more prevalent in Northern Ireland than elsewhere in the UK. However, levels of negativity towards Muslims and Eastern Europeans are significantly higher than in Great Britain and have increased in recent years, particularly among young adults aged 18-24 years, although older cohorts are more intolerant on average. Our regression analyses found strong positive relationships between anti-immigrant negativity, sectarianism and perceived neighbourhood segregation. Higher education, contacts with minority members and (religiously) mixed schooling are negatively related to negativity towards immigrants.

T1  - The Paradox of Rising Ethnic Prejudice in Times of Educational Expansion and Secularization in the Netherlands, 1985–2011
AN  - 2085602551
AB  - We aim to clarify a puzzling paradox: while shares of highly educated and non-religious individuals—who generally hold less prejudice—have increased in the Netherlands, levels of prejudice against ethnic minorities have yet risen over time. To solve the paradox, we use cross-sectional data from 1985 to 2011 in counterfactual analyses. In these analyses we simulate that levels of ethnic prejudice within categories of education, church membership, and church attendance are kept constant at the 1985 level and a new simulated trend in prejudice is estimated for the 1985–2011 period. Our findings show that changing levels of prejudice within categories of education are partly responsible for the trend. We conclude that the increasing share of highly educated individuals has not resulted in a decline of prejudice in the Netherlands over time, because all Dutch have become more prejudiced over the years and in particular the higher educated.

T1  - The world is a scary place: Individual differences in belief in a dangerous world predict specific intergroup prejudices: GPIR
AN  - 2043540633
AB  - Research suggests that people chronically concerned with safety, as measured by the Belief in a Dangerous World (BDW) Scale, are prone to intergroup prejudice and likely to endorse negative stereotypes under conditions eliciting concern for safety. Using a sociofunctional, threat-based approach to prejudice, the current research tested whether people with high BDW report increased prejudice specifically toward groups stereotypically associated with safety-related threats compared to groups associated with unrelated threats. Studies 1 and 2 found that higher BDW predicts increased negativity, safety-related concern, and fear toward groups stereotypically associated with threats to safety (e.g., illegal immigrants and Muslims) compared to groups thought to pose unrelated threats (e.g., gay men and obese people). Study 3 activated concern for safety using a news story detailing increased crime (vs. a control story), finding an interaction between safety concern activation, target group, and BDW, such that situational threat concern elicited greater prejudice toward Mexican Americans, but not toward Asian Americans, from those participants with higher BDW. These studies suggest that individual differences in concern for safety predict specific prejudices (e.g., fear and social distancing) toward distinct groups rather than general outgroup negativity.

T1  - Race-based experiences of ethnic minority health professionals: Arab physicians and nurses in Israeli public healthcare organizations
AN  - 2012859218
AB  - Increasing workforce diversity was found to contribute to the narrowing of disparities in health. However, racism toward ethnic minority health professionals has not been adequately researched. In Israel, public healthcare organizations that serve a mixed Jewish-Arab population employ Arab minority healthcare professionals. Instances of prejudice and manifestations of racism toward them, which frequently surface in public discussion and the media, have unfortunately gained little scholarly attention. We used the intergroup contact approach and the theory of the social process of everyday racism as a theoretical framework. The objective of the research was to study race-based experiences of Israeli Arab healthcare professionals.Methodology: We used a qualitative research method that allows respondents to describe their views, experiences, beliefs and behavior in the way they think about them. During 2013 and 2014 we conducted in-depth interviews with a snowball sample of 10 Arab physicians and 13 Arab nurses who work in Israeli public hospitals. The study protocol was ethically approved.Findings: Interviewees noted institutional efforts to maintain egalitarianism and equality. However, at the micro-level, interviewees, mostly nurses, reported instances that ranged from refusal to accept treatment from an Arab nurse, through verbal abuse, to the use of physical violence against them. At the meso-level, interviewees, mostly physicians, reported experiences of institutional discrimination. At the macro-level, one physician reported policy-related discrimination in the context of the immigration of Russian Jewish physicians to Israel.Conclusions: We recommend combining the intergroup contact approach with the social process theory of racism to examine minorities' subjective perceptions, especially in conflictual and violent contexts; conducting broad-based quantitative research in Israeli healthcare organizations, which may have important implications for the specific strategies to be used; and emphasizing the importance of institutional support. By reconstructing race-based experiences of ethnic minority health professionals, health organizations can better manage racial situations and reduce their frequency.

T1  - Initial prejudices create cross-generational intergroup mistrust
AN  - 2030877949
AB  - The present investigation modeled the emergence and persistence of intergroup bias and discrimination in artificial societies. Initial unfair prejudices held by members of a dominant group elicit confirmatory behavior (diminished cooperation) from members of a subordinate group via a self-fulfilling prophecy. Further, when individual learning is tempered by conformity to peers, inaccurate beliefs about the stigmatized subordinate group persist long-term. Even completely replacing dominant group members with enlightened individuals through generational change is inadequate to break the cycle of intergroup distrust and non-collaboration. The longer the enlightenment of a society is delayed, the more intergroup trust is irretrievably lost.

T1  - Neighborhood and Identity: An Explorative Study of the Local and Ethnic Identities of Young Ethnic Minorities in Belgium
AN  - 1973336725
AB  - In this paper, a qualitative study is conducted in different neighborhoods in the Belgian city of Ghent to investigate the local attachments of young ethnic minorities and how these are related to ethnic identities. Analysis of the narratives of the young people shows that ethnic and local identities do not have to be mutually exclusive but are in a complex interaction. The first narrative distinguished is characterized by the expression of a strong neighborhood identity along with positive attitudes toward others. A second narrative contains the expression of a strong ethnic identity in the form of ties with a small local ethnic community, accompanied with negative attitudes toward other inhabitants. A third narrative is characterized by the expression of a strong anti-neighborhood identity and a disconnection of their ethnic identity from the local environment, as a strategy to cope with the bad reputation of the neighborhood.

T1  - Reducing intergroup bias through intergroup contact: Twenty years of progress and future directions: GPIR
AN  - 1932685048
AB  - Classic research on the contact hypothesis focused on the direct relationship between the antecedents (conditions under which contact occurs) and the outcomes (primarily, the reduction of prejudice) of intergroup contact. Recent work has taken a broader view of contact processes and effects. We review key developments over the past 20 years, identifying different forms of contact, factors that mediate and moderate the effects of contact, and both the nature and temporal stage and the varied outcomes of contact. We then identify several research directions to address pressing theoretical and practical issues. These issues concern (a) group processes and intergroup relations, (b) intergroup contact in the context of multiple categorization, (c) structural- and individual-level processes, (d) a broader range of individual-level outcomes (e.g., health), and (e) impact on social change. Contact theory and research provides a comprehensive conceptual foundation, allied to a range of powerful empirical techniques, for important new advances and practical applications for improving intergroup relations and producing more equitable outcomes across groups.

T1  - Tweetment Effects on the Tweeted: Experimentally Reducing Racist Harassment
AN  - 1928618790
AB  - I conduct an experiment which examines the impact of group norm promotion and social sanctioning on racist online harassment. Racist online harassment de-mobilizes the minorities it targets, and the open, unopposed expression of racism in a public forum can legitimize racist viewpoints and prime ethnocentrism. I employ an intervention designed to reduce the use of anti-black racist slurs by white men on Twitter. I collect a sample of Twitter users who have harassed other users and use accounts I control ("bots") to sanction the harassers. By varying the identity of the bots between in-group (white man) and out-group (black man) and by varying the number of Twitter followers each bot has, I find that subjects who were sanctioned by a high-follower white male significantly reduced their use of a racist slur. This paper extends findings from lab experiments to a naturalistic setting using an objective, behavioral outcome measure and a continuous 2-month data collection period. This represents an advance in the study of prejudiced behavior.

T1  - Impact of Pre-War and Post-War Intergroup Contact on Intergroup Relations and Mental Health: Evidence From a Bosnian Sample
AN  - 1961001655
AB  - Using a sample of Bosnian adults (N = 381) we investigated the association between intergroup contact, measures of intergroup relations, and mental health. Structural equation models with latent variables showed that postwar contact had beneficial effects, being positively related to outgroup trust and intergroup forgiveness, and negatively associated with social distance. Moreover, postwar contact had indirect effects on reduced morbidity and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms via increased intergroup forgiveness and reduced social distance. We also analyzed the role of potential inhibitors and facilitators of the beneficial effects of postwar contact, and found that experience of violence played a detrimental role, while prewar contact was related to positive outcomes. Moderation analyses revealed the interactive effects of prewar and postwar contact, as positive effects of present-day contact on intergroup relations (promoting trust and reducing social distance) were strongest when prewar contact was high. Conversely, postwar contact was positively associated with outgroup trust only for respondents with low levels of experience of violence. Findings underline the value of promoting intergroup contact in postconflict settings. [web URL: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-08689-001]

T1  - Direct, extended, and mass-mediated contact with immigrants in Italy: their associations with emotions, prejudice, and humanity perceptions
AN  - 1883989487
AB  - Two correlational studies investigated the associations between different forms of intergroup contact, on the one hand, and Italians' prejudice and humanity attributions toward immigrants in Italy, on the other. Study 1 examined the effects of direct contact, extended contact, and parasocial contact through mass-media, assessing separately contact through TV news and newspapers and contact through entertainment programs. Study 2 analyzed the distinct effects of positive and negative episodes of the contact forms considered in Study 1. Across the studies, we tested the mediational role of intergroup anxiety, empathy, and trust. Overall, results showed the importance of taking into account different forms of contact and considering the emotional processes during contact experiences to understand intergroup attitudes.

T1  - Interculturalism as a New Framework to reduce Prejudice in Times of Crisis in European Countries
AN  - 1876465467
AB  - With the socio-economic crisis that is affecting Europe particularly negatively, immigrants have been often reported as additional threats in the job market for established residents. Theories of prejudice, such as the Theory of Self-interest or that of the Perceived Group Threats, have suggested economic factors to explain these kinds of attitudes towards immigrants. More recently, some scholars have advanced theories of intercultural values to account for individuals' dispositions towards those perceived as newcomers. The aim of this work is to understand whether or not intercultural values are able to modify the effects that economic factors exert on prejudice in times of crisis. The main objective is to identify whether the kinds of values instilled within societies play a stronger role than other variables, particularly economic factors. The findings show that Interculturalism plays a much greater role than economic factors in influencing attitudes towards outsiders.

Here we examine the relationship between television news coverage and differences in attitudes toward minority groups. We rely on intergroup threat theory, tone, and framing theories to formulate our hypotheses and conduct a multimethod study: All prime-time television news items in Flanders (N = 1,487) reporting on five minority groups (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender; Jews; Eastern Europeans; North Africans; Roma) were coded in terms of tone and framing and subsequently combined with individual-level survey data. Patterns in news coverage reflect differences in prejudice: Groups that are most negatively/positively evaluated by the public receive the most negative/positive coverage. Prejudice is especially high for minority groups associated with problems and criminal threat frames in the news. We conclude that news content is an important characteristic of the intergroup context reflecting differences in minority group appraisals in society.

T1  - Perspective taking and member-to-group generalization of implicit racial attitudes: The role of target prototypicality
AN  - 1901454714
AB  - Actively considering an individual outgroup member's thoughts, feelings, and other subjective experiences --perspective taking-- can improve attitudes toward that person's group. Here, we tested whether such member-to-group generalization of implicit racial attitudes is more likely when perspective-taking targets are viewed as prototypical of their racial group. Results supported a gendered-race-prototype hypothesis: The positive effect of perspective taking on implicit attitudes toward Black people and Asian people, respectively, was stronger when the perspective-taking target was a Black man or Asian woman (gender-race prototypical) versus a Black woman or Asian man (gender-race nonprototypical). These findings identify a boundary condition under which perspective taking may not improve intergroup attitudes and add to a growing literature on social cognition at the intersection of multiple social categories.

T1  - Social distance and quality ratings in charity choice
AN  - 1885164588
AB  - We conduct a laboratory experiment to examine how third-party ratings impact charity choice and donative behavior, particularly in regards to preferences for local charities. Subjects are given a menu of ten charities, with a mix of local and non-local organizations included. We vary whether third-party ratings are displayed on this menu. Subjects perform an effort task to earn money and can choose to donate to their selected charity. We find evidence that subjects' choice of charity Is impacted by third-party evaluations but, somewhat surprisingly, there are no obvious preferences for local charities. These third-party assessments have some impact on the percent of earnings that subjects allocate to their selected charity: local charities also accrue more donations, though these results are imprecise.

T1  - Ethnicity and Sexual Attitudes Affect Women's Judgments of Sexual Victimization Risk
AN  - 1857963163
AB  - This study evaluated the effects of ethnicity, sexual attitudes, and sexual victimization history on women's judgments of sexual victimization risk in a set of dating and social scenarios. An ethnically diverse sample of undergraduate women (n = 408) were asked to rate how risky the situations were in terms of having an unwanted sexual experience. American Indian women rated the situations as more risky than did non-Hispanic White or Hispanic women. In addition, participants with more positive attitudes toward a range of sexual experiences rated the situations as less risky than did women with less positive attitudes. Possible implications are discussed.

AB  - Present study was designed to develop a perceived discrimination questionnaire. To address the theme of perceived discrimination, an open ended interview was conducted on 30 subjects (15 OBC, 15 SC/ST). Initially a questionnaire was developed on the basis of these themes. And again, questionnaire was administered 120 subjects (40 Gen, 40 OBC and 40 SC/ST). Questionnaire has good psychometric properties. Findings of obtained data reveal that SC/ST categories members are victim of perceived discrimination. Other backward category manifested lower perceived discrimination but not equal to general category. Results support the evidence of social identity theory.

T1  - Can Caring Create Prejudice? An Investigation of Positive and Negative Intergenerational Contact in Care Settings and the Generalisation of Blatant and Subtle Age Prejudice to Other Older People
AN  - 1855255674
AB  - Caring is a positive social act, but can it result in negative attitudes towards those cared for, and towards others from their wider social group? Based on intergroup contact theory, we tested whether care workers' (CWs) positive and negative contact with old-age care home residents (CHRs) predicts prejudiced attitudes towards that group, and whether this generalises to other older people. Fifty-six CWs were surveyed about their positive and negative contact with CHRs and their blatant and subtle attitudes (humanness attributions) towards CHRs and older adults. We tested indirect paths from contact with CHRs to attitudes towards older adults via attitudes towards CHRs. Results showed that neither positive nor negative contact generalised blatant ageism. However, the effect of negative, but not positive, contact on the denial of humanness to CHRs generalised to subtle ageism towards older adults. This evidence has practical implications for management of CWs' work experiences and theoretical implications, suggesting that negative contact with a subgroup generalises the attribution of humanness to superordinate groups. Because it is difficult to identify and challenge subtle prejudices such as dehumanisation, it may be especially important to reduce negative contact. © 2016 The Authors.

T1  - Why do majority members prefer immigrants who adopt the host culture? The role of perceived identification with the host nation
AN  - 1842821373
AB  - Research has shown that members of the national majority group generally consider host culture adoption by immigrants as desirable. However, so far, this positive effect of perceived host culture adoption on attitudes toward immigrants has not been explained. We argue that majority members infer national identification of immigrants from their cultural adoption. Moreover, we predict that this inference should decrease majority members' feeling of ingroup threat, therefore also improving their attitudes toward immigrants. We conducted two experimental studies. In Study 1, majority members who were presented an immigrant group that adopted the host culture held more positive attitudes than those who were presented one that disregarded it. In line with our hypothesis, this effect was fully mediated by perceived identification of the immigrants with the host nation, itself decreasing perception of ingroup threat. Study 2 reproduced the same experimental design, but used descriptions of individual immigrants' acculturation strategies, and the immigrant group's status -- valued vs. devalued origin -- was also manipulated. In addition, Study 2 focused on dimensions of the "Big Two" of social perception. Results replicated the mediational effect of perceived identification on attribution of both warmth and competence traits. The status manipulation had no significant effect and did not interact with cultural adoption. These two studies provide robust evidence that perception of host nation identification explains the effects of perceived cultural adoption on attitudes towards immigrants.

T1  - Representations and Discourse about Religion and Chinese Descendants in 2012 Jakarta's Election
AN  - 1847466758
AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyze rhetorical rejections from Muslims, a majority group, who refused a non-Muslim Chinese candidate in the 2012 Jakarta gubernatorial election. The study focuses to explore (1) the social representations of the Chinese and how it was used to attack the Chinese candidate and (2) a construction process of a "new" social representation on how a religious teaching was constructed to have nothing to do with negative sentiments or hatred. The field study focused on analyzing the sequential events related to the sermon of a prominent Islamic figure, his denial of the hate contents in his sermon, and the support he received from his Muslim supporters. The results showed that when the Chinese are negatively represented, a Chinese is considered unfit to lead Jakarta as he may disgrace the nation. Moreover, it is found that when a rhetorical rejection toward a non-Muslim is supported by a religious teaching, such rejection is considered not related to negative sentiments.

T1  - Does diversity matter? Evidence from a survey of political science faculty
AN  - 2571074004
AB  - Does diversity in political science departments matter? In addressing the question, this article helps assess the value of increasing diversity in the discipline overall. Members of gender, race, and sexual orientation minority groups remain underrepresented in political science departments. What effects does underrepresentation have? To answer this question we rely upon a 2009 American Political Science Association (APSA)-sponsored survey of all faculty in U.S. political science departments. We study responses to questions about the number of female; racial minority; and lesbian, gay, or bisexual faculty members in political science departments. We test hypotheses about the relationship between the degree of departmental diversity and the friendliness, collegiality, and productivity of the associated faculty. We find that diversity, significantly affects intra-departmental relations, productivity, and perceptions of the treatment of female and racial/ethnic minorities. For both attitudes toward racial minorities and attitudes toward sexual minorities, greater diversity is generally associated with more positive attitudes. Women and racial/sexual minorities perceive their departments as less “friendly” than men and non-minorities. The presence of five or more women triggers a rise in the unfriendliness of a given department; this pattern does not appear for racial/sexual minorities.

T1  - A Cook's Tour Abroad: Long-Term Effects of Intergroup Contact on Positive Outgroup Attitudes
AN  - 1817591199
AB  - This mixed-methods, longitudinal study documents the short- and long-term impact of a cook's tour of Vietnam by 14 U.S. chef students. Over 3 weeks, travelers engaged in myriad intergroup interactions to experience Vietnam's cuisine and culture, exemplifying a positive intergroup orientation consistent with allophilia and xenophilia. Measures included a pretrip questionnaire, daily journal, and posttrip questionnaire, as well as participant observation. Short-term attitude change included significant increases in positive affect toward the Vietnamese, negative stereotypes, and intergroup understanding. Nearly 10 years later, the author interviewed 10 of the original trip participants. Consistent with allophilia theory, participants expressed continued affection, kinship, and enthusiasm toward the Vietnamese people and remained motivated to engage the Vietnamese culture and cuisine. Additional evidence of allophilic specificity, openness to experience, and deprovincialism is also discussed.

T1  - Friendship Development and Intergroup Attitudes: The Role of Interpersonal and Intergroup Friendship Processes
AN  - 1817460987
AB  - Although there is a growing body of work concerning cross-group friendship and intergroup attitudes, this work typically focuses on a limited number of interpersonal processes among established friendships. In addition, little is known about the role of group-related processes within such friendships. Two studies were conducted to address this gap. Results from a retrospective online survey and a longitudinal study reveal that both interpersonal friendship processes (e.g., intimacy, affection, trust, self-disclosure) and intergroup friendship processes (e.g., belief that outgroup friend respects one's own group, spending time with outgroup friend's family members and friends) are associated with positive intergroup attitudes. Specifically, the current findings suggest that interpersonal friendship processes are vital to fostering positive attitudes for the outgroup early in the relationship, but that intergroup friendship processes become more strongly linked to attitudes once the relationship progresses. Results may inform interventions designed to promote positive interactions across "real-world" group boundaries.

T1  - Obstacles to socioeconomic integration of highly-skilled immigrant women
AN  - 2084926719
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of obstacles to socioeconomic integration faced by highly-skilled immigrant women (HSIW) to Quebec, followed by a discussion of Quebec’s socio-political context and interculturalism, in an effort to better situate these obstacles. With these in mind, implications for diversity management are discussed. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is largely based on a review of the immigrant integration, interculturalism and diversity management literatures pertaining to the socioeconomic integration of highly-skilled immigrants. It focusses on the socioeconomic integration of HSIW in the Quebec context. Findings – The authors find that researchers should continue to examine aspects of the social and political contexts in which immigrant integration and diversity management take place when conducting studies in these areas. The authors also encourage continued research pertaining to specific groups, as these may bring to light-specific dynamics that can lead to exclusion. Practical implications – This paper includes implications for diversity management in organizations seeking to foster inclusive practices with regards to ethnic minorities and immigrants in general, and HSIW in particular. Originality/value – The paper sheds new light on immigrant integration and diversity management in Quebec by bridging the gap between three areas of study that are interconnected but seldom discussed together: socioeconomic integration of immigrants, interculturalism and diversity management in organizations.

T1  - THE OTHER AMERICA: AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN LIVING IN POVERTY
AN  - 1867156636
AB  - The economic injustice of poverty continues to influence the discrimination and inequality of women rights across the nation, specifically African American women. The United States Census Bureau reports the current poverty rate of America is 15.9 percent. Of that percentage, the top ten states with the highest poverty rate included seven southern states. According to the 2013 American Community Survey, 48,810,868 people live below the current economic indicator of poverty; hence the need to confront the prejudices that plague the African American woman demographic. According to a study published in the Journal of Marriage and the Family about African American mothers in poverty deep Chicago neighborhoods, " ... households headed by never-married mothers experience more persistent poverty and longer spells of welfare receipt than do other types of motheronly households" (Franklin, Smith, McMiller, 1995). Even though the study is decades old, today's U.S. Census report, the federal minimum wage and U.S. poverty rate all support those findings. At this time, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. Before taxes and other deductions, an African American woman head of household can earn $217.50 for a 30-hour work-week or $11,310 annually working for the federal minimum wage. This paper will look at the Top 10 States with the highest poverty rates as reported in the U.S. Census and analyze how African American women are living in poverty in America. More specifically, it will also review the economic conditions of African American women who reportedly struggle financially to sustain income in order to live in what is considered by the United States Census Bureau "sufficient" economic conditions.

T1  - JEAN-LUC NANCY'S COMMUNITIES AND DEBUTANTE SOCIETY IN NEW ORLEANS
AN  - 1867156584
AB  - Using Jean-Luc Nancy's analysis of communities in The Inoperative Community, this essay endeavors to separate and account for the tradition of Mardi Gras in New Orleans, Louisiana. Wrapped up in this tradition is the economy and society of the city, yet the "High Societies" that establish and perpetuate the celebration are demonstrably prejudiced. Therefore, this highly exclusive, all white, all male community is an excellent representation of Nancy's immanent community. "High Society" puts both the death of their Confederate brothers-inarms and the births of their daughters to work. Springing from this sexist and racist community, however, is the ontological community of Mardi Gras. The city of New Orleans grinds to a halt and enables its population to stream into the streets where the primary relation of humans can be seen. By removing all the coded behavior of society, people simply experience a being-with.

T1  - THE EFFECT OF KNOWLEDGE ON ATTITUDES TOWARD HOMOSEXUAL BEHAVIOR
AN  - 1867156476
AB  - During the showing of the NFL draft on national television (ESPN) in 2014, Michael Sam kissed his male partner in the mouth in celebration of getting drafted by the St. Louis Rams professional football team. Students in the cafeteria appeared to be shocked and surprised while others seemed to accepting of the fact that two men were shown kissing on national television. The publicly televised kiss by the two men and the behavior of the students facilitated me to pose three questions: First, are homosexuality and homosexual behavior more prevalent and accepted in today's society than in the past? Second, are American citizens ignorant of homosexual behavior? And third, if people are knowledgeable of homosexuality and homosexual behavior, would their attitudes toward homosexuality and homosexual behavior change? Therefore, this research attempts to answer the following hypothesis: What effect does knowledge have on attitudes toward homosexuality and homosexual behavior? Using primary data collected from participants and using a variation of the before and after research design, this research was conducted at through telephone surveys. The dependent variable is attitude towards or support for homosexuality and homosexual behavior while the independent variable is knowledge about homosexuality and homosexual behavior based on factual questions gathered from previous scholarly research and the documentary entitled "Gay Rights/Special Rights". In a nutshell, the results indicate that the stimulus, the movie "Gay Rights/Special Rights" did not have an impact on support for homosexual behavior mainly because most respondents consider themselves Christian, African-American, Older, and Democrat. Of those four variables religion trumped all others. The participants based their negative attitude toward homosexuality and homosexual behavior on their religious beliefs. I am not sure if I would say that the participants were homophobic. However, I would say that the participants were anti-homosexual before the stimulus (the documentary) was applied.

T1  - The denial of racism in Latina/o students' narratives about discrimination in the classroom
AN  - 1763751075
AB  - This study examines how Latina/o students perceive and frame experiences of prejudice against them in the classroom through narratives told in informal interviews in Spanish. This project started as an inquiry about these students' general perceptions and experiences in their Advanced Spanish-language classes and how these compared to their experiences in other classes on campus. Narratives are essential to understanding how speakers perceive and evaluate the experiences narrated and how they position themselves in relation to their group as well as to outsiders. The results show that, in most cases, when recounting narratives of discrimination or situations that can be considered instances of prejudice, students were hesitant to recognize that they were the subjects of discrimination or to qualify the story as an occurrence of racism. Different strategies were used to avoid this recognition, including assigning others the role of recognizing the situation as discriminatory and also using narrative evaluations or introductions to justify or mitigate the reasons that motivated these incidents. Discourses of prejudice and racism denial have been broadly documented, yet most studies focus on those who deny being racist themselves or being part of a racist group. This study shows how the underrepresented group might incorporate these discourses of denial and also how their discourses support or, at least, do not challenge the ideologies of majority groups about race, language, and immigration.

TT  - Odmevi odpora: druzbene skupine in mnozicno nasilje v Nigeriji
AN  - 1771763455
AB  - This article recognizes the gap in existing literature, regarding the capability of social groups in resistance to mass violence. The basic assumption of this article is that social groups as networks could serve as platforms of resistance to mass violence, regardless of their organizational goals and objectives. In order to explore this fundamental assumption, one research question was formulated: what is the utility of social groups in resisting mass violence? In a bid to provide an answer to this question, the article analyses the religious affiliation, geographical location and spread, ethnic stock and dynamics of selected social groups in Nigeria. The article is based on a review of academic articles, published newspaper reports and articles, and commonly used reports from the human rights circle. The article notes the linkage between social groups, on one hand, and prejudices, fears, and identities within societies, on the other. It recommends empowerment, which would allow social group members to find paths towards the solution to the problem of mass violence.

Participants imagined a positive interaction with a person with schizophrenia, or in a control condition, a person who did not have schizophrenia.

              
They then interacted with a confederate whom they believed had schizophrenia. Participants in the imagined contact condition reported more positive attitudes and less avoidance of people with schizophrenia, displayed smaller anticipatory physiological responses, specifically smaller changes in interbeat interval and skin conductance responses, and had a more positive interaction according to the confederate. These findings support applying imagined contact to improve interactions with people with severe mental illnesses.

T1  - Do natural kind beliefs about social groups contribute to prejudice? Distinguishing bio-somatic essentialism from bio-behavioral essentialism, and both of these from entitativity: GPIR
AN  - 1933572567
AB  - Do essentialist conceptions of racial groups foster prejudice and negative attitudes? Existing literature provides mixed results. We propose that relations between essentialism and negative attitudes will become clearer in light of a new conceptualization of essentialism derived from literature on how laypersons reason about biological inheritance. Accordingly, we propose a distinction between two types of essentialism: Bio-somatic essentialism and bio-behavioral essentialism. Further, we distinguish both of these types of essentialism from entitativity, and argue that essentialism and entitativity exert independent effects on prejudice and negative attitudes. Study 1 shows that bio-behavioral essentialism--but not bio-somatic essentialism--contributes to prejudice, and that bio-behavioral essentialism and perceived entitativity exert independent effects on prejudice. In Study 2, we manipulate whether participants hold a bio-somatic essentialist, bio-behavioral essentialist, or antiessentialist theory about a novel group and show that bio-behavioral essentialism is uniquely facilitative of negative attitudes toward a negatively behaving outgroup. Finally, in Study 3 we manipulate both essentialist theories and entitativity and show that bio-behavioral essentialism and strong perceptions of entitativity independently increase negative attitudes. Because both bio-somatic essentialism and bio-behavioral essentialism involve seeing a group as a "natural kind," our work suggests that only particular types of natural kind beliefs are related to negative attitudes.

T1  - Racial Identity and Intergroup Attitudes: A Multiracial Youth Analysis
AN  - 1708525571; 201529823
AB  - Objective This article examines the racial identity attitudes of white, black, and Hispanic youth and explores how these identities shape their feelings toward various racial and ethnic groups (whites, blacks, Asians, Hispanics, Arabs, and biracial individuals). Methods Using the 2005 Youth Culture Survey data set, we test our theoretical expectations using descriptive statistics and multiple regression models. Results The relationship between racial identification and out-group attitudes varies among racial groups; specifically, racial identity variables do not have a significant impact on whites' out-group attitudes, but they do matter for blacks and Hispanics. Conclusion While American society has changed in many ways (i.e., increased number of minorities and more tolerance, or at least more discussion of acceptance, for racial groups), our research finds that race still plays a consequential role in the lives of young racial minorities.

T1  - Race and attitudes toward police: the mediating effect of social distance
AN  - 1752994925; 201601142
AB  - Purpose - Given the consistent finding in the literature that members of minority groups hold less favorable views of the police than white citizens, social distance may be an important, yet untested, mediator. The purpose of this paper is to examine the mediating effect of social distance net of other established correlates. Design/methodology/approach - A sample of students attending a university in the northeastern USA completed an online survey in 2013. The survey was about their contact with the police, attitudes toward the police, and lifestyles, among others. Findings - Race, along with other predictors, significantly influenced confidence in police. However, race is the only factor that turns nonsignificant when social distance is included in the model. Mediation tests confirmed that social distance mediates the relationship between race and confidence in the police. Research limitations/implications - To maximize confidence in the police, administrators should focus on closing the social distance between the public and the police through initiatives like community policing. Originality/value - While there is extensive research on public attitudes toward the police, social distance has been neglected as a determinant, despite movements like community policing that promote citizens' relational closeness to the police - that is, to decrease the social distance between police and the public. The current study would be an exploratory study and reference for future studies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Applying the contact hypothesis to anti-fat attitudes: Contact with overweight people is related to how we interact with our bodies and those of others
AN  - 1738477004; 201538930
AB  - This paper is the first to apply the contact hypothesis, a social psychological theory of prejudice reduction, to the field of weight bias. It aims to investigate whether contact with overweight people is associated with the extent to which people report weight bias, as well as vigilance around their own bodies. In 2013 we recruited 1176 American participants to complete surveys regarding prejudice toward overweight people, as well as a suite of measures capturing people's relationships with their own weight (fat talk, drive for thinness, and body-checking behavior). Positive contact with overweight people predicted decreased prejudice, regardless of whether participants were overweight (p < .001) or not (p = .003). However, negative contact was a stronger predictor of increased prejudice (p < .001 for both samples). For non-overweight participants, any contact with overweight people (whether positive or negative) predicted increased body-checking behaviors (positive-p = .002, negative-p < .001) and fat talk (positive-p = .047, negative-p < .001), and negative contact predicted increased drive for thinness (p < .001). However, for those who were overweight a different picture emerged. While negative contact predicted increased body-checking behaviors (p < .001) and fat talk (p < .001), positive contact was protective, predicting decreased drive for thinness (p = .001) and body-checking behaviors (p < .001). This paper demonstrates that the interactions we have with overweight people are inherently tied to both our attitudes towards them and our relationship with our own bodies. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Improving Intergroup Attitudes through Televised Vicarious Intergroup Contact: Social Cognitive Processing of Ingroup and Outgroup Information
AN  - 1738477514; 201538487
AB  - In an experiment, participants exposed to depictions of an intergroup interaction between a border patrolling U.S. citizen and an illegal immigrant demonstrated changed attitudes toward illegal immigrants depending on the valence of the portrayal. Negative effects were enhanced among people who identified more strongly with the U.S. citizen character, and positive effects were moderately, although nonsignificantly enhanced among those who viewed the illegal immigrant character as more typical of illegal immigrants in general. Liking of the illegal immigrant character was a significant mediator of the effects. The positive effects on attitudes toward illegal immigrants transferred to more positive attitudes toward other social groups as well. The study is framed in terms of a social cognitive theory approach to vicarious intergroup contact. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Representation Despite Discrimination: Minority Candidates in Germany
AN  - 1708525502; 201528685
AB  - Immigrant-origin minorities are underrepresented in many democratic legislatures. This paper evaluates the direct effects of voter discrimination on the electoral performance of minority political candidates in Germany. Using evidence from both a survey experiment and actual election data, the paper tests two mechanisms of discrimination-negative attitudes toward minority groups and assumptions about candidate ideology-and shows that neither results in a substantial penalty for the small numbers of minority candidates who actually compete for office. Minority candidates in Germany typically run for political parties that discriminating voters would not have supported in any case. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Embodying imagined contact: Facial feedback moderates the intergroup consequences of mental simulation
AN  - 1559005144; 201431764
AB  - Imagined contact is a fruitful strategy of improving intergroup attitudes. There are several mechanisms responsible for the effectiveness of such contact. This article presents a test of an affective mechanism of imagined contact by applying a facial feedback procedure. We used a physical blockade of the zygomaticus major muscle, known to constrain people's experience of emotional states. Participants imagining intergroup contact expressed more positive attitudes towards an outgroup when they could physically mimic a positive affective state by smiling, but there was no such effect when embodiment was constrained. The interactive effects on attitudes appeared due to greater perception of outgroup warmth. This study presents the first attempt to explain the role of embodiment in the improvement of intergroup relations. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Forming impressions of in-group and out-group members under self-esteem threat: The moderating role of the need for cognitive closure and prejudice
AN  - 1559007551; 201432136
AB  - This study aims to investigate whether and how participants' need for cognitive closure (NCC) and their level of the prejudice moderate the self-esteem threats' influence on their perception of in-group and out-group members. There is still an open debate concerning the relationship between in-group favoritism and out-group negativity, as well as concerning factors that may increase these two phenomena and their reciprocity. Participants (78 students) completed a questionnaire containing the scales of prejudice and NCC. Subsequently, after they watched a short movie clip showing an interaction between an in-group member behaving negatively and an out-group member behaving positively, participants were exposed to a self-esteem threat (vs. self-enhancement), and, finally, they were requested to evaluate these in-group and out-group members. Results, as hypothesized, show that self-esteem threats increase negative evaluations of the out-group members and decrease negative evaluations of the in-group members only among participants with a high need for closure and a high level of prejudice.

T1  - Has multiculturalism failed in Britain?
AN  - 1531933809; 201423290
AB  - This paper subjects the criticisms advanced against multiculturalism to empirical test. It asks whether ethno-religious groups lead 'parallel lives' and, in consequence, fail to integrate with the wider society. It looks in particular at the alleged corrosive effects of multiculturalism, specifically at the maintenance of an ethnic rather than a British identity, social distance from white people and willingness to contemplate violent protest, but finds that all groups alike have displayed major change across the generations in the direction of a British identity and reduced social distance. It finds no evidence that rates of intergenerational change have been slower among ethno-religious groups that have made successful claims for cultural recognition. In contrast, lower levels of integration are associated with perceptions of individual or group discrimination. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Prejudice and 'Vladimir's choice' among Israeli Arabs and Jews: Symmetrical vs. asymmetrical trends
AN  - 1504423815; 201405300
AB  - The study adopted a group status perspective to examine the relationships between social dominance orientation (SDO), prejudice, and 'Vladimir's choice' tendency. It was hypothesized that for high-status group members (Israeli Jews), high SDO levels will be followed by increases in prejudice and 'Vladimir's choice' tendency, while for the low-status group (Israeli Arabs), a negative relationship should appear between SDO and the intergroup measures. The research sample comprising 100 Israeli Jews and 85 Israeli Arabs completed SDO and prejudice questionnaires, and performed a resource allocation task. As hypothesized, group status moderated the relationship between SDO and group prejudice. Contrary to our expectations, however, both samples exhibited a positive relationship between SDO and negative group prejudice. A positive relationship was also found between SDO and the positive prejudice factor in the Jewish sample, while no significant relationship was found between SDO and the positive prejudice factor in the Arab sample. Only group status correlated with Vladimir's choice preferences. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - When ideology clashes with reality: racial discrimination and black identity in contemporary Cuba
AN  - 1512219404; 201408773
AB  - This article examines the commonality and types of racial discrimination among blacks in Cuba. Using survey data I determine that an experience of racial discrimination is common for black Cubans and these experiences are often consequences of structural racism, rather than just isolated incidents of individual prejudice, which is the claim made by the Cuban government and supported by scholars as well. The existence of racism and racial discrimination creates group differences and survey results show that feelings of group identity are present in the majority of the sample. The project finds a relationship between experiences of discrimination and group identity so that the salience of race in Cuba through experience is connected to levels of black consciousness.

T1  - Can Numbers Lie? Race, Data Collection, and Black and Italian Infant and Maternal Health Care in Early Twentieth Century New York City
AN  - 1462012846
AB  - In 1899, W. E. B. Du Bois warned in The Philadelphia Negro, the first sociological study produced in the United States, that persons creating statistical studies must be aware that, left unchecked, inaccuracies fueled by individual biases may distort their work as much as errors arising from flawed methodologies and observations. Building upon this early caveat and contemporary admonitions from sociologists Tukufu Zuberi and Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, the author examines two 1924 pamphlets, Health Work for Mothers in a Colored Community and Protecting the Mother and Child. Both were compiled and published from data created by the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor which, respectively, covered infant and maternal health demonstrations conducted among two neighborhood groupings of impoverished African American and British West Indian mothers and children, and Southern Italian mothers and children. When these pamphlets are compared against internal unpublished data, inconsistencies arise which may have resulted from then commonly held racially-gendered biases against blacks and Italians. In turn, these biases-coupled with the desire to publish efficacious outcomes-mav have led the AICP to change the initial focus of its health experiment with black mothers and children from respiratory diseases to syphilis; to explain failed morbidity and mortality outcomes among Southern Italian infants by attacking mothers for their cultural preference for midwives; and, in both cases, to publish statistical data more positively than that contained in source materials. In sum, Du Bois' exhortation stands as powerfully today as over a century ago: even well-meaning researchers should check personal biases at the door before creating, conducting, and publishing statistical studies of racialized minority groups. To do otherwise may result in flawed data supporting the very biases that they may aim to overcome. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Modifying perceived variability: four laboratory and field experiments show the effectiveness of a ready-to-be-used prejudice intervention
AN  - 1433108845
AB  - We examined whether increasing individuals' perceived variability of an out-group reduces prejudice and discrimination toward members of this group. In a series of four laboratory and field experiments, we attracted participants' attention to the heterogeneity of members of an out-group (or not), and then measured their attitudes or behaviors. Perceived variability was manipulated by portraying the out-group members as having diverse socio-demographic characteristics and different personality traits and preferences. Prejudice and discrimination were measured in terms of self-reported prejudice, stereotyping, in-group bias, social distance, and willingness to do something for the minority group under consideration. In all experiments, perceived variability decreased prejudice and discrimination.

T1  - Imagined intergroup contact promotes cooperation through outgroup trust
AN  - 1364700973; 201323148
AB  - The present research aims to investigate whether salience of memberships during imagined contact is necessary for producing generalized positive attitudes toward the outgroup and promoting intergroup cooperation. After a warm-up task that involved reciprocal self-disclosure during the imagined interaction with an outgroup member, we manipulated interpersonal versus intergroup features of imagined contact. Results indicated that participants who imagined a conversation with a Muslim focusing on intergroup differences subsequently reported more positive attitudes and cooperative intentions toward Muslim immigrants compared to either participants who imagined the interaction at the interpersonal level or participants in a control condition. Moreover, these effects were found to be mediated by outgroup trust. These findings attest to the strength of interventions based on imagined intergroup contact and suggest a possible implementation of the technique.

AN  - 1417524164; 201331761
AB  - In this review, we highlight the importance of understanding diversity ideologies, or people's beliefs and practices regarding diversity, for social psychological research on intergroup relations. This review focuses on two diversity ideologies, colorblindness and multiculturalism, and their impact on core issues related to intergroup conflict, such as stereotypes, prejudice, attitudes toward inequality, interracial interactions, and disparate outcomes between minority and majority group members. We close by highlighting some of the areas in which future research has the potential to be especially illuminating. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Honk if you like minorities: Vuvuzela attitudes predict outgroup liking
AN  - 1347783072; 201319945
AB  - The 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa generated extensive controversy over spectators' use of the African vuvuzela trumpet. We asked 123 White American participants about their opinions of vuvuzelas as well as their attitudes towards a variety of racial/ethnic minority groups including immigrants, African Americans, and Latinos. We found that the less participants liked vuvuzelas, the less positively they also tended to feel toward minority groups. Furthermore, respondents who liked vuvuzelas the least were also less generally open to change. These findings suggest that the vuvuzela controversy was about more than just a plastic trumpet -- it was also an episode of differential ingroup/outgroup perceptions and a lack of openness to new things.

T1  - Foreigners and Outsiders: Exclusionist Attitudes towards Labour Migrants in Israel
AN  - 1315601669; 201307677
AB  - This paper examines theoretical propositions regarding the social mechanisms that produce hostility and discriminatory attitudes towards out-group populations. Specifically, we compare the effect of perceptions of socio-economic and national threats, social contact and prejudice on social distance expressed towards labour migrants. To do so, we examine exclusionary views held by majority and minority groups (Jews and Arabs) towards non-Jewish labour migrants in Israel. Data analysis is based on a survey of the adult Israeli population based on a stratified sample of 1,342 respondents, conducted in Israel in 2007. Altogether, our results show that Israelis (both Jews and Arabs) are resistant to accepting and integrating foreigners into Israeli society. Among Jews, this is because the incorporation of non-Jews challenges the definition of Israel as a Jewish state and poses a threat to the homogeneity of the nation. Among Arabs, this is probably due to threat and competition over resources. The meanings of the findings are discussed within the unique ethno-national context of Israeli society and in light of sociological theories on ethnic exclusionism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Improving intergroup attitudes via mediated intergroup contact in a bilingual setting
AN  - 1463012904; 201345887
AB  - This paper explores the role of mediated intergroup contact in improving intergroup attitudes between Italian speakers and German speakers in South Tyrol, Italy. Specifically, we examine how German-language television consumption affects attitudes towards the German-speaking group among Italian-speaking youth. The data (N = 229) were collected among Italian-speaking secondary school students in 2011. As expected, the results indicated that more German TV use was associated with more positive attitudes toward German speakers. A cognitive mediator (intergroup understanding) had a greater influence than an affective one (intergroup anxiety) in mediating the effect of TV use on attitudes. The effect of TV use on attitudes was greater among those who had less personal intergroup contact, but there were no differences in the effects of television based on variations in the local ethnolinguistic vitality of the two groups. Findings and implications are discussed, and suggestions for future research are made. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - US host nationals' attitudes toward Japanese: the role of communication and relational solidarity in the intergroup contact hypothesis
AN  - 1373428425; 201328620
AB  - Guided by the intergroup contact hypothesis and intergroup contact theory, the authors examined US Americans' (N = 403) communication experiences and relational solidarity with their most frequent Japanese contact and associations with their attitudes toward Japanese as a cultural group. Structure Equation Modeling (SEM) results showed that both communication frequency and quality had an indirect effect through relational solidarity on affective, behavioral, and cognitive attitudes, demonstrating the critical mediating role of relational solidarity. Results also revealed that communication quality was positively and directly associated with the attitudinal measures. Implications of the findings are discussed with respect to prior literature on relational communication in intergroup and intercultural contexts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The dynamics of ethnic discrimination, identities and outgroup attitudes: A pre-post longitudinal study of ethnic migrants
AN  - 1373428369; 201328406
AB  - This longitudinal study among ethnic migrants from Russia to Finland (N = 127) examined the relationships between anticipated and perceived discrimination, ethnic and national identities, and outgroup attitudes towards the national majority group. The study included one pre-migration and two post-migration assessments. First, associations between the variables studied were tested using a conventional autoregressive sample-level modelling approach. Second, individual trajectories and the associations between the individual-level changes in the variables included in the models were tested. Although there were no sample-level effects over time, there were significant relationships between changes in discrimination and changes in identification and outgroup attitudes at the individual level. The results indicated that changes in perceived discrimination were not reflected in increased ethnic identification. However, participants who perceived higher levels of discrimination after migration than they anticipated before migration were, in the post-migration stage, more likely to disidentify from and to increasingly show negative attitudes towards the national majority group. The study complements previous research by examining the identity and attitudinal reactions to perceived ethnic discrimination starting from the pre-migration stage and highlights the value of incorporating both group and individual perspectives to the research on perceived discrimination.

T1  - Portuguese Adolescents' Attitudes Toward Sexual Minorities: Transphobia, Homophobia, and Gender Role Beliefs
AN  - 1567043808; 201435091
AB  - Research has shown that negative attitudes toward lesbians and gay men are common and widespread in Western societies. However, few studies have addressed attitudes toward transgender individuals. In addition, although research has shown that homophobic harassment and bullying is highly common among adolescents, little is known about adolescent's attitudes toward sexual minorities. This study aimed to fill these gaps in knowledge, by investigating adolescents' attitudes toward transgender individuals and possible attitudinal correlates of those attitudes. Participants (N = 188; 62 males and 126 females) were recruited in high schools in Lisbon, Portugal. Age ranged from 15 to 19 years (M = 17; SD = .96). Participants completed a questionnaire booklet measuring attitudes toward transgender individuals, lesbians, and gay men, and gender role beliefs. Results revealed that attitudes toward transgender individuals were significantly correlated with all attitude measures. Specifically, it was revealed that those participants who endorsed negative attitudes toward transgender individuals were also endorsing of negative attitudes toward lesbians and gay men and tended to adhere to traditional gender roles. A significant gender effect was found with males being more negative toward sexual minorities than females, but these negative attitudes were more extreme toward gay men than toward lesbian women. Implications of these findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racism and Social Capital: The Implications for Social and Physical Well-Being
AN  - 1125223745; 201240361
AB  - Racism can be manifest at the cultural, institutional and individual levels, and can exert effects at the intrapersonal level if targeted individuals internalize attitudes toward their own racial/ethnic groups. The general aim of this article is to examine the ways in which all levels of racism undermine the development of peer relations, one component of social capital; and consequently affect the health and well-being of targeted individuals. The evidence suggests that cultural racism inculcates attitudes that may foster race-related social distancing; institutional racism isolates individuals from the opportunities to develop the skills needed to develop cross race-relations and promotes engagement with peers who exhibit antisocial behavior; interpersonal racism may erode the quality of routine interpersonal exchanges and engender anxiety about interacting with cross-race peers; and internalized racism may undermine the benefits of cross-race peer interactions. To the degree that racism affects the ability to form, maintain and benefit from peer relationships, it can contribute to racial disparities in economic, social and health-related outcomes and undermine the types of social cohesion that promote national unity.

T1  - Authoritarianism, Social Dominance, and Prejudice Among Junior Police Officers: The Role of the Normative Context
AN  - 1221411901; 201243923
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the respective impact of group socialization and social projection to explain prejudice among newly recruited police officers (N = 301). The first approach predicts that both Eight-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO), two fundamental determinants of prejudice, should be driven by specific norm. The second approach predicts that the perceived norms of the reference group reflect the social projection of our own altitudes and norms. These two models were tested with structural equation modeling. Emphasizing the determinant role of social norms and social influence, the results provide stronger support for the group socialization model (GSM) than the social projection model (SPM).

T1  - Behavioural consequences of imagining intergroup contact with stigmatized outgroups
AN  - 1023028878; 201223706
AB  - We investigated whether imagining contact with an outgroup member would change intergroup behaviour. Participants who had imagined a positive interaction with an outgroup member or an unspecified stranger were told that they were about to take part in a discussion task with an outgroup member. They were taken to a room and asked to set out two chairs ready for the discussion while the experimenter left, ostensibly to find the other participant. The distance between the two chairs was then measured. Undergraduate students who imagined talking to an obese individual (Experiment 1) or a Muslim individual (Experiment 2) placed the chairs significantly closer than those in the control condition. They also reported more positive feelings and beliefs regarding Muslims. These findings highlight an important practical application of imagined contact: preparing people for successful face-to-face contact.

T1  - Polyculturalism and openness about criticizing one's culture: Implications for sexual prejudice
AN  - 1023028857; 201223702
AB  - Abundant research on the relationship between ideologies and sexual prejudice has not focused on intergroup ideologies such as colorblindness, multiculturalism, and polyculturalism. In three studies with racially and ethnically diverse college and community samples, endorsement of polyculturalism-an ideology focusing on the interactions, influences, and connections among racial and ethnic groups-was associated with lower sexual prejudice (as measured by affective prejudice toward gay men and lesbians, traditional heterosexism, denial of discrimination against homosexuals, and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians). Polyculturalism's relationship with lower sexual prejudice was mediated by greater openness to criticizing elements of one's culture that marginalize some groups. Polyculturalism accounted for unique variance in sexual prejudice even when controlling for colorblindness, multiculturalism, social dominance orientation, ethnic identity, conservatism, as well as race and gender. Colorblindness and multiculturalism were not consistently related to lower sexual prejudice. Future work on intergroup ideologies and sexual prejudice is discussed.

T1  - Core American Values and the Structure of Antigay Prejudice
AN  - 870432848; 201114252
AB  - This work presents a new scale to measure conflicting attitudes toward sexual minorities. This scale parallels existing measures of conflicting racial attitudes (anti-Black and pro-Black attitudes; Katz & Hass, 1988). After constructing and validating measures of antigay and progay attitudes, we tested relationships among core American values with racial and sexual minority attitudes. We examined relations among the Protestant Work Ethic (PWE), Traditional Family Ideology (TFI), and egalitarian values with attitudes toward racial outgroups and sexual minorities. The results revealed that both PWE values and egalitarian values predicted anti-Black attitudes. By contrast, endorsement of egalitarian values, but not PWE values, predicted pro-Black attitudes. Results also revealed a similar but distinct pattern among values and heterosexuals' attitudes toward sexual minorities. TFI, but not egalitarian value endorsement, predicted antigay attitudes, whereas both TFI and egalitarian value endorsement predicted progay attitudes. The implications of these findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Prejudice among Peruvians and Chileans as a Function of Identity, Intergroup Contact, Acculturation Preferences, and Intergroup Emotions
AN  - 835111548; 201100491
AB  - A special Latin American acculturative context is currently developing in Chile in which native Chileans have contact with several immigrant groups, particularly newcomers from Peru. This study examines several intergroup variables including contact, national and Latino American identities, group distinctiveness, realistic threat, intergroup anxiety, and acculturation preferences as predictors of prejudice on the part of both Chilean natives and Peruvian immigrants. Three hundred Peruvian immigrants (194 females and 106 males) and 300 Chileans (199 females and 101 males) participated in the study. Acculturation preferences, perceived group distinctiveness, and especially intergroup contact were shown to be important predictors of prejudice toward out-group members. Intergroup anxiety and realistic threat mediated some of these effects. The pattern of these results also varied as a function of nationality. Theoretical as well as practical implications for further research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social Insertion and Racial Prejudice: Distance from Black People and Socio-Political Variables
AN  - 764425043; 201064801
AB  - This article analyses the relationships between racial prejudice (flagrant and symbolic) and university students' membership of socio-political groups, their adhesion to political ideologies, and their attitudes related to the developed and developing worlds. A total of 418 students participated in the study. The results show a negative correlation between adhesion to left-wing ideology and social distance from black people. They also show that favourable attitudes to the developed world are positively correlated to the distance from black people. Finally, group memberships in social movements and in affective-religious communities inhibit the expression of symbolic racial prejudice. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Perceptions About The Amount Of Interracial Prejudice Depend On Racial Group Membership And Question Order
AN  - 754039810; 201050386
AB  - Few studies have attempted to examine how racial group membership may interact with survey context to influence responses to questions about race. Analyzing over 9,000 respondents from split-ballot experiments embedded in national polls, this research examines the extent to which question order interacts with one's self-reported racial group to influence beliefs about the amount of interracial prejudice that exists between Blacks and Whites. The results show that in-group members (e.g., Blacks) tend to view out-group members (e.g., Whites) as having more dislike toward their in-group (e.g., Whites dislike Blacks) only when the in-group is asked about first-a contrast. When in-group members (e.g., Blacks) are evaluated after out-groups (e.g., Whites), they will view their in-group's dislike as similar to that of the out-groups-an assimilation. The results serve to remind survey researchers and practitioners of the careful attention that must be paid to context and response biases. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racial Contact and Change in South Africa
AN  - 743066398; 201043235
AB  - We investigate the effects of sociopolitical change on intergroup contact and social distance attitudes in South Africa, and the effect of these variables on intergroup attitudes and racial policy attitudes. The data come from secondary analysis of surveys conducted between 1991 and 2005, as well as a dedicated survey conducted in 2006. The results reveal widespread racial isolation among Black people; ambivalent attitudes to racial integration among Whites, who support integration in principle but are opposed to it personally; and contrasting outcomes of contact for Blacks and Whites. Increased intergroup contact was associated with reduced stereotyping and increased support for transformation policies among Whites but was associated with increased opposition to transformation policies among Blacks. Contrary to the predictions of contact theory, attitudes of Blacks and Whites toward Coloured and Indian compatriots were generally more negative in provinces with high levels of intergroup contact between these groups.

T1  - College Students' Racial Attitudes and Friendship Diversity
AN  - 743065835; 201043311
AB  - Using the contact hypothesis as a theoretical framework, this study investigates the relationship between college students' racial attitudes and the diversity in their intercultural friendship networks. The results tend to support a conventional view of racial hierarchy, as students in this study categorized ethnic/racial groups into fairly dichotomized categories of Whites and non-Whites. In addition, students who reported fewer ethnically/racially different friends are more likely to define race by skin color than those who have more diverse friendship networks. Further, White students were more much more likely to see race as defined by skin color than students of color. Overall, results reveal an interesting relationship between these college students' racial attitudes and their friendship choices. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - Panethnicity, Ethnic Diversity, and Residential Segregation
AN  - 743049433; 201031693
AB  - The theoretical and empirical implications of the structural basis of panethnicity and of the layering of ethnic boundaries in residential patterns are considered while simultaneously evaluating the "panethnic hypothesis," the extent to which homogeneity within panethnic categories can be assumed. Results show a panethnic effect-greater residential proximity within panethnic boundaries than between, net of ethnic group size and metropolitan area-that is dependent on immigration. A lower degree of social distance between panethnic subgroups is observed for blacks, whites, and Latinos, and less for Asians, yet ethnonational groups continue to maintain some degree of distinctiveness within a racialized context.

T1  - Profiles of British Muslim identity: Adolescent girls in Birmingham
AN  - 60354973; 201017518
AB  - By asking students to fill in 10 statements beginning with 'I am...' and a further 10 statements beginning with 'I am not...' we constructed profiles of British Muslim ethnic and national identity. Participants were 108 British Muslim girls of mean age 12.6 years studying in a single sex girls' school in Birmingham, UK. Using content analysis we found that some adolescent girls are rooted only in their personal identity. Others are rooted in their social identity. We found a number of major categories: rooted in ethnic identity only, rooted in ethnic identity but differentiating self from other groups, rooted in bicultural identity, rooted in national identity and confused ethnic and national identity. Significantly a number of participants were concerned to transcend group identities and described themselves as 'not racist' or 'not prejudiced'. A model of ethnic and national identity is presented incorporating rootedness, differentiation, confusion and transcendence. [Copyright Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

T1  - Why Don't We Practice What We Preach? A Meta-Analytic Review of Religious Racism
AN  - 1928179681
AB  - A meta-analytic review of past research evaluated the link between religiosity and racism in the United States since the Civil Rights Act. Religious racism partly reflects intergroup dynamics. That is, a strong religious in-group identity was associated with derogation of racial out-groups. Other races might be treated as out-groups because religion is practiced largely within race, because training in a religious in-group identity promotes general ethnocentrism, and because different others appear to be in competition for resources. In addition, religious racism is tied to basic life values of social conformity and respect for tradition. In support, individuals who were religious for reasons of conformity and tradition expressed racism that declined in recent years with the decreased societal acceptance of overt racial discrimination. The authors failed to find that racial tolerance arises from humanitarian values, consistent with the idea that religious humanitarianism is largely expressed to in-group members. Only religious agnostics were racially tolerant.
