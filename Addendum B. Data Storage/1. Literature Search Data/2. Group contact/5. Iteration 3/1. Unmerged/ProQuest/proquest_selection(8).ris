T1  - Older adults’ experiences of social distancing and the role of the community center during COVID-19
AN  - 2680176424
AB  - Purpose>Although very much needed from an infection control perspective, there is deep concern about the impact of social distancing during COVID-19, particularly on older adults.Design/methodology/approach>A phenomenological design was used to gain insight into older adults’ experiences of living with social distancing during the first wave of COVID-19. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight older adults.Findings>Six themes were identified: a smaller life, feelings of unease, resilience, connection to the community centre, technology: a boon, but one with limitations, and the way through social distancing.Originality/value>This study captures older adults’ experiences early in COVID-19. Findings indicate that there is much we can learn from these older adults regarding social isolation that could apply to other older adults and potentially other age groups during the time of pandemic and beyond.

T1  - Reducing social distance caused by weight stigma: Nostalgia changes behavior toward overweight individuals
AN  - 2673616621
AB  - Weight stigma, a negative attitude toward the overweight, can lead to discriminatory practices, as well as increase overweight individuals' vulnerability to depression, anxiety, and low self‐esteem. We propose that a nostalgia induction can attenuate weight stigma. Participants identified an overweight individual, before writing about an interpersonal encounter with that individual, characterized by either central (e.g., “keepsakes” and “childhood”) or peripheral (e.g., “wishing” and “daydreaming”) features of the construct “nostalgia.” Participants who recalled a central (vs. peripheral) nostalgic encounter reported more positive feelings and beliefs toward overweight individuals in general. Moreover, nostalgia influenced behavior: Nostalgic (vs. control) participants reduced their social distance when anticipating an interaction with an overweight individual. The effect of nostalgia on all three outcomes (i.e., positive feelings, beliefs, and behavior) was mediated by greater social connectedness, which in turn was associated with higher inclusion of the outgroup in the self and increased outgroup trust.

T1  - Unobserved Heterogeneity between Individuals in Group-Focused Enmity
AN  - 2660147429
AB  - Group-focused enmity (CFE) and related research have mostly focused on variable-centred analyses such as structural equation modelling and factor analysis, implicitly assuming that the results apply uniformly to all participants in the sample. Person-centred research questions and analysis methods, which investigate unobserved heterogeneity in the sample, have been lacking in CFE research. Nonetheless, initial evidence exists from research on Islamophobia and CFE that various unobserved latent classes (i.e., subgroups) differing in their average prejudice can be identified within one dataset. In this manuscript, we applied factor mixture modelling to investigate unobserved heterogeneity using the data of the German CFE survey 2011. We found two latent classes of equivalent factor-analytical composition with consistently high versus low expressions of target-specific prejudice. No comparison of latent CFE means was possible. Membership in the high prejudice latent class was associated with higher age, right-wing political orientation, high right-wing authoritarianism and high social dominance orientation. Our findings demonstrate the importance of exploring unobserved heterogeneity in attitudes research and outline how person-centred research can complement variable-centred research in order to understand social-psychological phenomena.1

T1  - Can past intergroup contact shape support for policies in a pandemic? Processes predicting endorsement of discriminatory Chinese restrictions during the COVID-19 crisis: GPIR
AN  - 2621963559
AB  - A survey of 340 UK residents was conducted when the COVID-19 virus first reached the UK in February 2020. We measured past experiences of positive and negative intergroup contact with Chinese people as predictors of intergroup threat and emotions in the context of the pandemic; and how these processes in turn predicted support for discriminatory policies designed to restrict the freedom of Chinese people in the UK. We tested a novel threat-matching hypothesis which draws upon models of outgroup-specific social perception to predict that the emotional processes underlying contact effects will depend on the specific threat posed by the outgroup. In the present epidemiological context, Chinese people posed a salient threat to individuals’ physical health and welfare. Accordingly, we show that whilst intergroup contact predicted both fear and anger towards the outgroup, the indirect effect of contact on support for Chinese restriction policies via fear was significantly stronger than the indirect effect via anger. Our findings provide a more nuanced understanding of how specific threat and emotions drive intergroup contact effects, and offer important insights for efforts to maintain positive intergroup relations in the face of the crisis.

T1  - Emerging Attitudes Regarding Decriminalization: Predictors of Pro-Drug Decriminalization Attitudes in Canada
AN  - 2607248802
AB  - Canada and the United States have recently evaluated the decriminalization of drugs as multiple provinces and states put motions forward to consider drug decriminalization legislation. The influence of factors such as demographics, substance use, perceived substance use risk, and personality have not been widely studied in predicting attitudes toward drug decriminalization. A total of 504 participants were drawn from university (n = 269, 53.37%) and community samples (n = 235, 46.63%) through online social media groups and posts (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc). Analyses indicated that male gender, single or non-married relationship status, living outside of Atlantic Canada, higher problematic alcohol use scores, lower Extraversion, higher Open-mindedness, and lower perceived risk of using substances emerged as significant predictors of support for drug decriminalization. These findings have important implications as public attitudes toward a substance influence drug policy.

T1  - Automation and public support for workfare
AN  - 2582542380
AB  - Automation has permeated workplaces and threatens labour in the production process. Concurrently, European governments have expanded workfare which imposes stringent conditions and sanctions on unemployed workers after the onset of austerity. We explore how automation risk affects workfare support. Recent research finds that most routine workers ‘survive’ in their routine jobs. Despite avoiding unemployment, routine workers may face the threat of status decline as automation erodes the value of routine work. They may respond by differentiating themselves from lower-ranked social groups such as unemployed workers. Such boundary drawing may manifest views that the unemployed are less deserving of welfare. We thus posit that routine workers may support workfare to assuage their fears of status decline. We further explore if worsening economic hardship, proxied as rising unemployment rates over time, increases their support for workfare. We conducted pooled and multilevel analyses using data from the European Social Survey. We find that routine workers significantly support workfare. We also find that routine workers support workfare when economic hardship worsens, but oppose it when conditions ameliorate. Findings suggest that status threat is an important channel by which automation risk may affect workfare support, but its impact depends on social context, hence yielding country-differences. Worsening economic hardship may exacerbate routine workers’ status decline fears, and intensify their harsh views against unemployed workers. Automation risk may thus have a greater impact on workfare support under such conditions. Policymakers can use these findings to assess how workfare may be publicly received and under various economic conditions.

T1  - The Political Culture of Asian Brazilians
TT  - A Cultura Política dos Brasileiros Asiáticos
AN  - 2685100676
AB  - Few studies have examined the relationship between race and politics for Asian Brazilians. Using data from the Latin American Public Opinion Survey, we examine this relationship along two axes: cognitive orientation towards politics and institutional confidence. We use factor analysis to create representative indices of these axes and estimate regression models using race as a predictive variable. We find no evidence that Asian Brazilians differ from white Brazilians along either of these two axes. However, we find that a university education has an especially strong relationship with cognitive orientation towards politics for Asian Brazilians. On average, Asian Brazilians with a university education had a cognitive orientation towards politics score 17% higher than Asian Brazilians without a university education, though we do not find a similar effect for institutional confidence. Overall, we find that ethnic identity, particularly for Asians, does not have a strong effect on either of the axes but education has different effects on them between different ethnic groups.Alternate abstract:Poucos estudos têm examinado a relação entre raça e política para Brasileiros Asiáticos.

No geral, descobrimos que a identidade étnica, particularmente para os asiáticos, não tem um forte efeito em nenhum dos eixos, mas a educação tem efeitos diferentes entre os diferentes grupos étnicos.

T1  - Dividing without Conquering: Generation, Class, Ethnicity, and Nationalism in Taiwan's 2016 Presidential Election
AN  - 2585493665
AB  - Based on the literature about the role of rising nationalism in recent world politics, this paper proposes a nationalism-oriented causal model to explain the voting choices of different social groups. With an interest-identity framework, this generic model is applied to Taiwan s 2016presidential election to examine whether and to what extent 11 causal mechanisms influence the voting choices of four groups defined by generation, class, and ethnicity. The findings not only reveal generational, class-based, and ethnic differences in Taiwanese voting behavior; they also show that the election was largely one of identity politics centered around the issues of national identity and democratic identification, making the "interest card" played by Beijing less effective in swaying voter choices. This explains why Beijings divide-and-conquer economic policy successfully divided Taiwanese voters but failed in the end to prevent the pro-independence candidate from winning the election. The findings also indicate that the economic concerns of voters promoted both their Taiwanese identity and support for Taiwan independence, while identification with Taiwan's democracy contributed directly to the former and only indirectly to the latter. Overall, the model presents a more fine-grained analysis of nationalist politics and may be applied to the studies of other political behaviors involving nationalism.

T1  - Customers' social interactions and panic buying behavior: Insights from social media practices
AN  - 2572209853
AB  - The Covid‐19 pandemic led to social distancing and lockdown practices, which increased social interactions and information exchange on social media for timely decision making. This study explores how social practices and social influence generated through social media created panic buying behavior among customers. A social constructionist epistemological position was taken in order to understand the social practice of information sharing and to ask why different meanings were ascribed to Covid‐19 pandemic. Qualitative data collection and analysis methods were used to understand these subjective realities. A total of 40 UK customers participated in semi‐structured interviews in which they were asked about their usage of social media during the pandemic. Results revealed that social media increased the sharing of viral video evidence, such as empty shelves and quarreling in grocery stores, which increased fear and uncertainty; as a result, people shared recommendations to stay at home and buy extra for survival. Analysis revealed that social media increased awareness of stock unavailability in other parts of world, such as the USA, China, and Germany; therefore, people took proactive actions, such as stockpiling or panic buying, to avoid risks and uncertainties. The major theoretical contribution of this study is that the researcher merged social practice theory and social influence theory, and constructed a research framework which provides understanding of the social factors generated through social media platforms that increased socially influenced panic buying practices among UK customers. This study suggests that there is a need to control socially shared information and panic buying behavior and how socially shared information can influence different people in different contexts.

T1  - In the Ear of the Listener: The Role of Foreign Accent in Interethnic Friendships and Partnerships: IMR
AN  - 2560029905
AB  - This article examines the association between accented speech and the formation of friendships and partnerships among immigrants and native-born majority residents in Germany. Drawing on the sixth wave of the German extension of the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries, we analyze a neglected aspect of language — pronunciation — and find that speaking with a foreign accent is a more important correlate of the incidence of interethnic partnerships than of interethnic friendships. We argue that beyond its primary function of understandability, accented speech possesses socially communicative power. Accent transmits signals of an individual’s foreignness and cultural differences and, thus, becomes an additional marker of social distance. Such signals serve as a greater obstacle to more consequential intimate interethnic relations such as partnerships. Our findings extend the scholarly debate on the role of symbolic boundaries in social interactions between ethnic groups by yet another important boundary maker — accent.

T1  - Ambivalent Effects of Positive Contact Between Women and Men on Collective Actions for Women’s Rights
AN  - 2556958989
AB  - Positive intergroup contact, under some conditions, can undermine the interest of members of both socially disadvantaged and advantaged groups to act for equality. However, little is known about whether similar effects appear in a unique form of intergroup relations, gender relations. In two correlational studies and two experiments, we investigated the relationships among quality of contact, perceived discrimination, fusion with the feminist movement, and willingness to engage in collective action for women’s rights. For women (Study 1a), positive contact with men was associated with less perceived discrimination, less fusion, and less collective action. For men (Study 1b), the relationships were in the opposite direction. Studies 2a and 2b revealed that recalling experiences of gender discrimination nullified the effects of contact for both women and men as compared to a control condition. Thus, when discrimination is not explicitly recognized, positive contact might have sedative effects on women, but mobilizing effects on men.

T1  - Trust in everyday life
AN  - 2570234423
AB  - Although trust plays a pivotal role in many aspects of life, very little is known about the manifestation of trust and distrust in everyday life. In this work, we integrated several prior approaches to trust and investigated the prevalence and key determinants of trust (vs. distrust) in people's natural environments, using preregistered experience-sampling methodology. Across more than 4,500 social interactions from a heterogeneous sample of 427 participants, results showed high average levels of trust, but also considerable variability in trust across contexts. This variability was attributable to aspects of trustee perception, social distance, as well as 3 key dimensions of situational interdependence: conflict of interests, information (un)certainty, and power imbalance. At the dispositional level, average everyday trust was shaped by general trust, moral identity, and zero-sum beliefs. The social scope of most trust-related traits, however, was moderated by social distance: Whereas moral identity buffered against distrusting distant targets, high general distrust and low social value orientation amplified trust differences between close vs. distant others. Furthermore, a laboratory-based trust game predicted everyday trust only with regard to more distant but not close interaction partners. Finally, everyday trust was linked to self-disclosure and to cooperation, particularly in situations of high conflict between interaction partners' interests. We conclude that trust can be conceptualized as a relational hub that interconnects the social perception of the trustee, the relational closeness between trustor and trustee, key structural features of situational interdependence, and behavioral response options such as self-disclosure.

T1  - Socially-supportive norms and mutual aid of people who use opioids: An analysis of Reddit during the initial COVID-19 pandemic
AN  - 2522847425
AB  - Background: Big events (i.e., unique historical disruptions) like the COVID-19 epidemic and its associated period of social distancing can transform social structures, social interactions, and social norms. Social distancing rules and the fear of infection have greatly reduced face-to-face interactions, increased loneliness, reduced ties to helping institutions, and may also have disrupted the opioid use behaviors of people who use drugs. This research used Reddit to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the social networks and social processes of people who use opioids. Methods: Data were collected from the social media forum, Reddit.com. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. (March 5, 2020, to May 13, 2020), 2,000 Reddit posts were collected from the two most popular opioid subreddits (r/OpiatesRecovery, r/Opiates). Posts were reviewed for relevance to COVID-19 and opioid use resulting in a final sample of 300. Thematic analysis was guided by the Big Events framework. Results: The COVID-19 pandemic was found to create changes in the social networks and daily lives among persons who use opioids. Adaptions to these changes shifted social networks leading to robust social support and mutual aid on Reddit, including sharing and seeking advice on facing withdrawal, dealing with isolation, managing cravings, and accessing recovery resources. Conclusions: Reddit provided an important source of social support and mutual aid for persons who use opioids. Findings indicate online social support networks are beneficial to persons who use opioids, particularly during big events where isolation from other social support resources may occur.

T1  - "Pride and prejudice" pathways to belonging: Implications for inclusive diversity practices within mainstream institutions
AN  - 2540773508
AB  - Within mainstream institutions such as colleges and universities, scientists and social leaders, alike, are faced with persistent and new challenges to forging paths toward inclusion among marginalized group members (e.g., Latino/a/x and African Americans). Integrating theoretical perspectives that conceptualize identity among marginalized groups as tied to culture and strengths with literatures on threat and stigma, we propose a "pride and prejudice" approach to inclusion. We provide support for the efficacy of inclusion as 2 pathways-one route that is associated with recognizing "pride" or the history and culture of marginalized groups and another that is related to reducing "prejudice" or perceived discrimination toward marginalized groups. Specifically, we demonstrate using actual demands for inclusion generated by students attending 80 colleges and universities that a pride and prejudice approach is consistent with collective calls for institutional change voiced by marginalized group members and their allies (Study 1). Then, Study 2, using longitudinal data of Latino/a/x and African American students (N = 1,967) attending 27 colleges and universities we reveal the impact of pride (e.g., taking an ethnic studies course) and prejudice (e.g., perceived discrimination) experiences on sense of belonging, and in turn academic and health outcomes (e.g., graduation rates, depression). We provide evidence for 1 theory-based process whereby individual experiences tied to pride and prejudice can impact belongingness through intragroup and intergroup relations. Theory and policy implications for institutional inclusion efforts including the importance of fostering ties to ingroup and outgoup members are discussed.

T1  - From Student to Employee: Group Compatibility Predicts Group Identification and Intergroup Attitudes
AN  - 2521296386
AB  - Transitions go along with the need to integrate a previous outgroup into the self-concept. This study examines whether this integration follows cognitive consistency principles. In line with recent theorizing, we test whether the perceived compatibility of a previous and a current ingroup determines identification with these groups and intergroup attitudes. We primed employees who were former students (N = 269) to perceive the groups of students and employees as either more compatible or less compatible, and measured the strength of identification and group attitudes with regard to both groups. The findings largely confirmed predictions. Greater compatibility between social groups increased identity integration and reduced intergroup bias. Identity integration mediated the effect of compatibility on intergroup bias. In line with predictions, the voluntariness of group change explained which of the groups people identified more strongly with when groups were perceived low in compatibility. The results of the study provide evidence that integrating identities into the self-concept follows cognitive consistency principles and suggests that emphasizing similarities between previous and current ingroups fosters identity integration and reduces intergroup bias.

The present research examines whether transference effects emerge even when the target belongs to an ethnic out-group. In two experiments, participants received descriptions of in-group and out-group targets who partly resembled their own (or another’s) positive significant other. The findings showed that resemblance to one’s own significant other improves attitudes and behavior toward both in-group and ethnic out-group targets, as found across 2 nations and 3 different ethnic out-groups. The present research hence provides evidence of robust transference effects across ethnic group boundaries.

T1  - Allport meets internet: A meta-analytical investigation of online intergroup contact and prejudice reduction
AN  - 2549948763
AB  - Since Allport's optimal conditions for reducing prejudice by interpersonal contact were defined, numerous empirical studies have confirmed the efficacy of intergroup contact in reducing prejudice towards outgroups. Given that the Internet is changing the way people communicate and interact daily, it is very possible that the Web plays an important role in reducing prejudice. Assuming that the virtual environment fits Allport boundary conditions for effective contact that reduces prejudice, we undertook this meta-analysis. Our aim was to demonstrate that online intergroup contact is a successful means of improving intergroup relations. Results from 23 studies (20 journal articles and 3 unpublished records) showed that the effect is significant. Effect size was independent of the characteristics of samples, including their countries. There were stronger effects when the induced contact focused on cooperation but not for support of the interaction by an authority figure or the presence of common goals.

T1  - Living Through COVID-19: Social Distancing, Computer-Mediated Communication, and Well-Being in Sexual Minority and Heterosexual Adults
AN  - 2489964518
AB  - COVID-19 has had far-reaching effects on people’s lives, with evidence of a disproportionate impact on marginalized groups. Given existing health disparities and research on minority stress, COVID-19 may have uniquely impacted psychological well-being among sexual minorities. In an online survey of adults in the U.S. (N = 1,007) conducted in April 2020, we examined differences between sexual minority and heterosexual participants in psychological well-being, social distancing, computer-mediated communication, and COVID-19-related worry and experiences. Sexual minorities reported lower thriving and greater psychological distress, social distancing, computer-mediated communication, and COVID-19 worry and experiences than heterosexual participants. Social distancing and distress were positively correlated among sexual minorities and more frequent computer-mediated communication predicted greater thriving across groups. Path analyses showed sexual minorities’ poorer psychological well-being was mediated by their greater COVID-19 worry and social distancing, in particular. These findings shed light on the distinct impact of COVID-19 on sexual minorities.

T1  - Request for Changes from Russian Citizens: Political and Axiological Dimension
AN  - 2509310350
AB  - Social perturbations of the early 2020s stirred up many of the contradictions that have been accumulating in Russian society for several previous years. It has become clear that different social groups assess differently the current course on stability that the people in power have been pursuing for many years, understood as preserving the political and economic system and its rules of the game, so to speak. According to monitoring studies carried out by the Institute of Sociology of the Federal Center of Theoretical and Applied Sociology RAS (FCTAS RAS), Russian society is divided into two practically equal parts. One of part needs change, because without deepcutting economic and social reforms, stagnation will be inevitable. The other part insists on stability and is convinced that rash changes are unwelcome. The working group of the research project the Social Transformation of Russian Society: Actors of the Request for Change has already analyzed the causes and content of the public request for change. In this article, I have focused on the causes behind the subjective change/stability choice and concluded that the choice depends not so much on the social but on the political specifics of those who want changes and those who do not want them. Today, many people have realized that in Russia, the border between the private and the public is an illusion. I have relied on public opinion polls to demonstrate that there is a correlation between the steadily growing number of "self-sufficient Russians" determined to realize themselves and never expecting any support from the state, and the gradually emerging demand for change; its key factor being a combination of this position and ideas about the future. The fact that the authorities prefer not to respond to the request is molding a specific identity that might transform resentment into collective efforts to realize their ideas about the future.

T1  - Accuracy and bias in perceptions of racial attitudes: Implications for interracial relationships
AN  - 2485544220
AB  - The current research examined accuracy and bias in racial metaperceptions-perceptions of others' attitudes toward one's racial group-within the context of interracial relationships, as well as implications of these metaperceptions for the quality of interracial relationships. Two dyadic studies of interracial relationships involving Black and White participants suggest that racial metaperceptions were partly accurate, related to relationship partners' racial attitudes. In addition, 3 distinct biases in racial metaperceptions were identified, including assumed reciprocity (i.e., perceivers assuming their attitudes toward their partners' racial group are reciprocated by those partners), projection (i.e., perceivers assuming their attitudes toward their own group are shared by partners), and confirmation bias (i.e., perceivers viewing partners' racial attitudes in ways that are consistent with their chronic expectations about being the target of prejudice). In turn, both accurate and biased racial metaperceptions appeared to have implications for the quality of interracial relationships, including relationship satisfaction, perceived regard, relationship commitment, and prosocial behavior. Implications of these findings are discussed.

T1  - Attitudes Toward Separating Immigrant Families at the United States–Mexico Border
AN  - 2472327759
AB  - The primary aims of this project were to estimate levels of agreement or opposition with immigrant family separation at the U.S.–Mexico border and to identify psychological variables that account for variability in attitudes toward immigrant family separation. In Study 1, a sample designed to be representative of Americans in the United States responded to a question about the zero‐tolerance policy that resulted in immigrant family separation. In Study 2, participants in two convenience samples completed online surveys with measures of perceived threat posed by immigrants, dehumanization, social dominance, political ideology, religiosity, and immigrant family separation. Across samples, the majority of respondents opposed separating immigrant families. Conservative political ideology was a consistent correlate of support for immigrant family separation. Dehumanization of immigrants and social dominance orientation also accounted for unique variability in support for immigrant family separation. Given the potentially harmful effects of extended parent‐child separation caused by the zero‐tolerance policy, it is important to understand the roles of dehumanization, social dominance, and ideology in attitudes toward immigration policies. Predictors of support for restrictive policies could be targets of individual or community‐level interventions designed to reduce immigrant prejudice. Directions for future research and implications for U.S. communities and policies affecting immigrants are discussed.

T1  - Population Size and Social Contact as Predictors of Religious Thought and Intergroup Attitudes: The Case of Muslims in Forty Countries
AN  - 2470251105
AB  - This paper examines the effects of different percentages of Muslim population and their interactions with non-Muslims on their religious views and intergroup attitudes. By analyzing three different datasets of Pew Research Center, with an aggregation of more than 39,000 Muslims' responses from 40 different countries, this paper offers a counter-argument against the use of the previously mentioned approach. This will be presented by analyzing these datasets from three different levels of analyses. Unlike the present social contact literature in which the primary focus is on the host/majority population's nature of interaction with minorities and its effects on the former's intergroup attitudes, this research focuses on minorities' contact with majority members and its impact on their religious and intergroup views. Consequently, our findings indicate a more meaningful and factual understanding of Muslim minorities' religious views and intergroup attitudes emerges when their social experiences are taken into consideration.

T1  - Motivating social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic: An online experiment
AN  - 2509313227
AB  - Rationale Maintaining social distance during the COVID-19 pandemic can save lives. We therefore set out to test communication strategies to promote social distancing. Objective We aimed to test two novel public health messages against a control message. The first was designed to exploit the "identifiable victim" effect by highlighting the risk of transmission to identifiable vulnerable persons. The second sought to counteract intuitive underestimation of exponential transmission. Method In total, 500 Irish adults undertook a pre-registered, online experiment. They were randomly assigned to a control group or one of two treatment groups. The control group viewed a current poster that encouraged a 2-m separation between people. The two treatment groups saw posters of similar design, but with narrative messages describing how an individual had infected a specific vulnerable person or multiple other people. Later questions measured intentions to undertake three specific types of social interaction over the coming days and the stated acceptability of three other types of social interaction. Pilot work had identified these six behaviors as "marginal" – people were unsure whether they were advisable. Results Participants in the treatment conditions were more cautious about undertaking the behaviors and less accepting of them. This positive effect occurred despite participants rating the treatment posters as likely to be less effective and memorable than the control poster. Conclusions Messages that invoke thoughts of infecting vulnerable people or large numbers of people can motivate social distancing and, hence, help to limit the spread of COVID-19. Stated public evaluations (obtained via focus groups or surveys) may underestimate the actual effectiveness of such emotional messages.

T1  - With or without you: The paradoxical role of identification in predicting joint and ingroup collective action in intergroup conflict
AN  - 2464641458
AB  - While we have a rich understanding of the motivations of disadvantaged group members to act collectively with their group, especially the important role played by identification, we know less about the disadvantaged's motivations to engage in joint action with the advantaged. This research examines the role of identification in predicting joint and ingroup collective action in intergroup conflicts. Since joint action inherently diffuses the perception of “us versus them”, we propose that identification predicts ingroup action, but not joint action. We also examine conflict intensity as a moderator, and examine how changing identification is linked to change in support for joint action. We test these hypotheses in a three‐wave longitudinal study in the Palestinian–Israeli conflict. Results support our hypotheses, demonstrating that identification positively predicts ingroup action but not necessarily joint action, and that when conflict intensifies, changes in identification are negatively related to joint action with outgroup members.

T1  - “How do you like them now?” Expected reactions upon discovering that a friend is a political out-group member
AN  - 2435149702
AB  - Republican or Democrat participants imagined how they would respond upon learning about the political group membership of a potential or established friend. Four vignettes (friend political in-group; friend political out-group; potential friend political in-group; potential friend political out-group) were presented in a random order. After each, participants provided expected reactions. Overall, reactions (e.g., hope of the relationship lasting, intentions to engage in friendship maintenance behaviors, trust) were most positive toward the established in-group friend, followed by potential in-group friend, then the established out-group friend, and lastly the potential out-group friend. That is, participants expected to be more positive toward a person they just met than an established close friend, simply due to knowing these individuals’ political group memberships. Some of these differences were moderated by intergroup attitudes or political identification. Discoveries of political group membership may influence the development or maintenance of friendships.

T1  - Aggressive confrontation shapes perceptions and attitudes toward racist content online: GPIR
AN  - 2447808038
AB  - With more people using social media on a daily basis and the prevalence of racial discrimination online, it becomes imperative to understand what factors impact minority individuals’ perceptions of these transgressions in an online context. Confrontation to discrimination in the form of comments on social media may meaningfully shape perceptions of racism online. Across three studies, we examine how confrontation type (aggressive vs. passive) and confronter group membership (ingroup vs. outgroup) influence Asian Americans’ perceptions of online prejudice and attitudes towards the confronters. In Study 1, we find that aggressive confrontations alter perceptions of a racist online post to be more offensive as compared to passive confrontations. In Study 2, these findings extend to participants’ likelihood to report the content as offensive. Lastly, in Study 3, we find that aggressive confronters are evaluated more positively than passive confronters. These findings have important implications for understanding racial discrimination in an online context by demonstrating the impact of confrontation type on minority individuals’ perceptions and behaviors.

T1  - Do they want contact with us? The role of intergroup contact meta‐perceptions on positive contact and attitudes
AN  - 2440857680
AB  - This research examined the role of contact meta‐perceptions on positive intergroup contact and outgroup attitudes. Specifically, perceptions of the ingroup's and outgroup's desire for intergroup contact were simultaneously tested as predictors of intergroup contact and outgroup attitudes. Three correlational studies were conducted in three distinct contexts, international students' view of British students, general public views of people with schizophrenia, and both Muslims' and non‐Muslims' views of one another. Among these three intergroup relationships, the role of outgroup contact meta‐perceptions was consistently highlighted as predictor of intergroup contact. In stark contrast, ingroup contact meta‐perceptions did not emerge as a significant predictor of contact. Intergroup contact then predicted outgroup attitudes (Studies 1, 2, and 3) and stereotyping (Studies 2 and 3) via reduced anxiety (Studies 2 and 3). The results demonstrate the importance of explicitly highlighting outgroups' openness for intergroup interactions and are discussed in the context of intergroup relations literature.

T1  - Don’t hurt my outgroup friend: A multifaceted form of imagined contact promotes intentions to counteract bullying: GPIR
AN  - 2429520944
AB  - A growing body of research has shown that imagined intergroup contact can improve outgroup attitudes. The aim of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of a multifaceted form of imagined contact in counteracting bullying in school children, and additionally to test the underlying processes of this effect. Two hundred and fifteen Italian elementary school children took part in a 3-week intervention, where they were asked to imagine a scenario in which they become friends with an unknown disabled child, interact in various social settings, and react to forms of discrimination toward the newly acquired friend. After each session, they discussed collectively what they had imagined. The dependent measures were administered 1 week after the last session. Results revealed that inclusion of an outgroup member in the self mediated the effect of imagined contact on intentions to counteract social exclusion and bullying of disabled children, as well as helping intentions. Imagined contact also promoted greater willingness for outgroup contact via more positive outgroup attitudes and empathy. Our findings are important in delineating new forms of imagined contact, and understanding ways to promote behaviors that defend victims of social exclusion and bullying in school environments.

T1  - Theorizing the virus: abjection and the COVID-19 pandemic
TT  - Abjection and the COVID-19 pandemic
AN  - 2465951465
AB  - PurposeUsing Kristeva's theory of abjection, this article analyzes the psychosocial reality of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, advancing the understanding of exclusion and stigmatization as forms of social abjection.Design/methodology/approachThe article applies abjection to understand how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is both a medical emergency but also a cultural challenge. The analysis is structured in three dimensions: (1) the transgressive potential of the virus, (2) forms of cultural coping with its threat and (3) the moral order of abjection.FindingsThe virus is an existential challenge to cultural boundaries and subjectivity. Strategies to prevent its further spread (e.g. handwashing, “social distancing” and closing national borders) are thus culturally significant. The virus triggers the processes of abjection, (re-)establishing challenged boundaries and exclusionary social hierarchies. Collateral consequences of protective measures vary across regions and social groups, creating and exacerbating social inequalities.Research limitations/implicationsPractices of abjecting the virus go far beyond handwashing, masking, etc. The virus, an invisible enemy to be expunged, is also a hybrid of threatening pathogen and human body; it is not the virus but people who experience exclusion, discrimination and disrespect. Thus, cultural sociology must address the moral economy of abjection.Social implicationsAs Kristeva insists, the abject threatens both the subject and the symbolic order. Overcoming social abjection means recognizing and strengthening individual and community agency and requires understanding vulnerability as an anthropological condition, enacting caring relationships and acting in solidarity.Originality/valueThis article demonstrates that abjection is a suitable theoretical tool for analyzing the social dynamics of the COVID-19 crisis.

T1  - Positive intergroup contact decreases the likelihood that prejudicial attitudes become avoidant behavioral tendencies
AN  - 2384449672
AB  - We investigated whether existing intergroup contact experiences moderated the associations between prejudicial attitudes and behavioral tendencies towards outgroups across five studies in Turkey (total N = 1,281). Findings showed that among Turks who reported higher levels of cross‐group friendship quantity (Study 1) and greater positive (but not negative) contact (Study 2) with Kurds, prejudicial attitudes did not predict negative outgroup behavioral tendencies. Confirming these studies, Study 3 indicated that the association between homophobic attitudes and outgroup avoidance/approach tendencies was weaker among individuals who reported more LGBTI friends. Study 4 replicated the latter finding among children using Syrians as the target outgroup. Study 5 further showed that the buffering role of intergroup contact occurred only among participants who held less certain attitudes towards Syrian refugees. Findings provide insights into how existing contact experiences shape the relationship between negative attitudes towards outgroups and relevant behavioral intentions.

T1  - Closeted love? Borders of (mediated) belonging in ‘minority radio broadcasting’
AN  - 2407556788
AB  - Ethnic minority communities have been utilizing various forms of media for the struggle for rights and recognition for ethnic minorities and migrants, aiming to subvert mainstream discourses, and engage in creative tactics and strategies to struggle for equal rights, opportunities, supportive public opinion and inclusive policy-making/policy change. Whilst social media has become the major platform for ethnic minorities to express these struggles, there has been growing concerns on the role of (radio) broadcasting as a better/more effective channel for ethnic ‘activism’. This article aims to unravel the divergent narrativity and politics of ‘minority recognition’ in the broadcasting space: How have the technological and institutional features of public service broadcasting enabled minority mediated belonging. At the same time, has this also hampered their chances of being heard? Through sample surveys, textual analysis as well as focused interviews, the article hopes to articulate the nuanced strategic and diverse ‘regimes’ of minority recognition by way of discussing the role of broadcasting as a space of (mediated) belonging. I also hope to contribute to the debates about the intricate bordering and politics of affective listening, in the case of public service broadcasting, and particularly in an ethnoscape such as Hong Kong

T1  - Parallel Lives: Intergroup Contact, Threat, and the Segregation of Everyday Activity Spaces
AN  - 2360027179
AB  - Although intergroup contact can reduce prejudice, opportunities to experience such contact are often constrained by systems of segregation. Work on this problem has focused on divisions entrenched within institutions of residence, education, and employment. Our research employed a complementary approach, which treated segregation as the outcome of individuals' movements over time within everyday life spaces. Taking as a case study Catholics' and Protestants' use of public environments in north Belfast, we used GPS tracking technology, combined with GIS analytics, to explore the time geography of residents' activity space use over a 2-week period (Study 1). We also conducted a field survey to explore how psychological factors shaped their willingness to use activity spaces beyond their own communities (Study 2). Analysis based on around 1,000 hr of raw movement data revealed that north Belfast is marked by high levels of segregation, expressed via residents' limited use of public spaces, facilities, and pathways located in outgroup areas. However, use of shared spaces is also common, with Catholics spending more time in such spaces than Protestants. Structural equation modeling suggested that residents' self-reported willingness to use activity spaces outside their own communities was associated with both negative and positive intergroup contact-relationships partially mediated by realistic threat, symbolic threat, and anxiety over interaction across sectarian lines. Both kinds of contact and realistic threat were also associated with the time residents actually spent in spaces beyond their own communities. Opportunities for integrating psychological and geographic research on contact and segregation are highlighted.

T1  - Countries and Cultural Differences in the Stigma of Mental Illness: The East–West Divide
AN  - 2380017811
AB  - Mental illness is a global public health crisis. Although rates of untreated cases stand as a primary problem, stigma is a significant obstacle. Yet, global differences in levels and roots of stigma remain poorly understood. Using the Stigma in Global Context–Mental Health Study (SGC-MHS) data, we analyzed data on two components of stigma—prejudice and discriminatory potential—attached to clinically diagnostic cases of depression and schizophrenia. We examined whether stigma was higher in the East than West. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the link between prejudice and discriminatory potential in the East was due, in part, to cultural differences in the attributions about mental illness. With SGC-MHS’ nationally representative vignette data from over 11,000 respondents in 11 relevant countries (four Eastern, seven Western), analyses replicated past research of higher levels of stigma and more moral attributions in Eastern countries, particularly for depression. Moreover, prejudice-related disclosure spillover concerns predicted discriminatory potential (social distance) in the East, but not the West; this was driven by a greater emphasis on moral attributions in the East. Finally, exploratory analyses found that Western respondents endorsed higher discrimination for minority (vs. majority) group members with mental illness. In Eastern countries, the same pattern emerged for schizophrenia, but the reverse occurred for depression—greater stigma for majority as compared with minority group members. Together, these findings suggest that cultural differences in the sources of prejudice and attributions about the etiology of mental illness contribute, at least in part, to global differences in the profile of stigma.

T1  - Support for National Flag‐Displays in Times of Change: A Question of National Identification?
AN  - 2323309643
AB  - Flag‐displays can be used within national groups to communicate majority supremacy over ethnic minorities. In two studies set in an Australian context (N = 88 and N = 102), we explain how mode of national identification (glorifying identifiers versus attached identifiers) differently predicts support for multicultural values and national flag‐displays. In line with the hypotheses, we found that attached identifiers were more supportive of multicultural values and national flag‐displays by ethnic minorities than glorifying identifiers. In contrast, glorifying identifiers supported flag‐displays by the majority more than did the attached identifiers. Study 2 demonstrates that glorifying identifiers’ use of the national flag is explicitly meant to exclude other groups. As expected, support for multicultural values and endorsement of the flag as an exclusion tool helped to explain the relationship between identification and flag‐displays. As such, results revealed the attitudes behind a novel form of prejudice that is currently on the rise.

T1  - Double standards? Attitudes towards immigrant and emigrant dual citizenship in the Netherlands
AN  - 2309190351
AB  - Despite increasingly liberal practices around the world, dual citizenship acceptance is still contested. Surprisingly, few studies exist on what drives public attitudes towards political membership in two or more states. Based on data from the 2012 Dutch Parliamentary Election Study (N = 1,677) we investigate the discrepancy in negative attitudes in the Netherlands towards dual citizenship of immigrants who acquire Dutch citizenship, on the one hand, and more positive attitudes towards Dutch citizens acquiring a foreign citizenship, on the other. We find that negative views of immigrant dual citizenship are associated with strong in-group identification and out-group derogation, whereas experiencing a sense of symbolic group threat is associated with negative views of both immigrant and emigrant dual citizenship.

T1  - Knowledge about the "others", perspective taking, and anxiety about intergroup contact in a natural intergroup contact
AN  - 2319470543
AB  - Intergroup contact can facilitate the ability of the majority group to learn about the minority's collective identity. However, in the context of intergroup conflict, it can also increase intergroup anxiety. The current study investigated this hypothesis in a shared school program of Jewish and Negev-Arab adolescents in Israel. Matched questionnaires were administered to 141 Jews (96 females) and 88 Negev-Arabs (59 females) at the beginning and end of the school year. Both groups were requested to estimate the salience of the collective identity orientations of the Negev-Arabs and to report on their own feelings of anxiety during intergroup contact. The findings illuminated the Jewish participants' tendency to underestimate the levels of Arab and Muslim collective identity orientations of their peers at the first research stage and overestimated the salience of these identities at the second stage, while the average level of their anxiety about intergroup contact was not changed. On the basis of these findings, we have suggested an integrative explanation to describe how a long period of equal real-life encounters with a highly identified minority can change the majority's knowledge about the "others."

T1  - Understanding Public Responses to Emerging Technologies: A Narrative Approach
AN  - 2287818139
AB  - Previous studies aimed at understanding public responses to emerging technologies have given limited attention to the social and cultural processes through which public concerns emerge. When probed, these have tended to be explained either in cognitive social psychological terms, typically in the form of cognitive shortcuts or heuristics or the influence of affective variables, or in social interactionist terms, as a product of the micro dynamics of the social interaction. We argue for an alternative approach that examines how public attitudes are formed in relation to the interplay of wider cultural narratives about science and technology. Using data from recent qualitative research with publics on nanotechnology and other emerging technologies, we develop a typology of five cultural narratives that underpin and structure public talk. The narratives we identify within focus group talk are familiar stories that are deeply embedded in contemporary culture, and which provide cultural resources for navigating the issues posed by emerging technology. Substantively, they inform a 'tragic' mood on the prospects of emerging technology, reflecting the loss of belief in science, when coupled to neo-liberal logics, as guaranteeing social progress. The implications for policy-making are discussed.

T1  - Rethinking human-animal relations: The critical role of social psychology: GPIR
AN  - 2285045382
AB  - People deeply value their social bonds with companion animals, yet routinely devalue other animals, considering them mere commodities to satisfy human interests and desires. Despite the inherently social and intergroup nature of these complexities, social psychology is long overdue in integrating human-animal relations in its theoretical frameworks. The present body of work brings together social psychological research advancing our understanding of: 1) the factors shaping our perceptions and thinking about animals as social groups, 2) the complexities involved in valuing (caring) and devaluing (exploiting) animals, and 3) the implications and importance of human-animal relations for human intergroup relations. In this article, we survey the diversity of research paradigms and theoretical frameworks developed within the intergroup relations literature that are relevant, perchance critical, to the study of human-animal relations. Furthermore, we highlight how understanding and rethinking human-animal relations will eventually lead to a more comprehensive understanding of many human intergroup phenomena.

T1  - When contact goes wrong: Negative intergroup contact promotes generalized outgroup avoidance: GPIR
AN  - 2251006314
AB  - This paper broadens our understanding of the consequences of negative intergroup contact. Study 1 reports cross-sectional evidence that negative contact with European immigrants in Britain is not only associated with increased prejudice, but also the avoidance of future contact with this group. Studies 2A and 2B provided an experimental replication in a different intergroup context. A negative encounter with an outgroup member, but not an ingroup member, was found to reduce intentions to engage in contact with the outgroup in the future. Study 3 went on to demonstrate that the effect of negative contact on outgroup avoidance is not limited to the contacted outgroup, but is indirectly associated with reduced intentions to engage with other, secondary outgroups—an effect we refer to as avoidance generalization effect. Negative contact was also associated with lower general contact self-efficacy. Together, findings suggest that negative contact is damaging not just because it increases prejudice but also because it compromises future engagement with diversity.

T1  - Cognitive and affective expectation of stigma, coping efficacy, and psychological distress among sexual minority people of color
AN  - 2268687711
AB  - There is a paucity of research on the potentially distinctive functions of cognitive and affective expectation of stigma. Moreover, expectation of stigma has received limited research attention with sexual minority people of color who may anticipate interlocking heterosexist and racist stigmatization. In this study, data from 209 sexual minority people of color were analyzed using path analysis and bootstrap procedures to test direct and indirect relations among perceived discrimination, expectation of stigma, coping self-efficacy, and psychological distress. Analyses disaggregated expectation of stigma into its cognitive (i.e., perceived likelihood of stigma) and affective (i.e., worry and anxiety about stigma) components. Results revealed that perceived discrimination had a unique direct link with psychological distress. In addition, perceived discrimination was linked indirectly with greater distress through affective expectation of stigma and problem-focused and emotion-focused coping self-efficacy. These findings suggest the importance of social justice interventions to reduce discrimination. Additionally, the findings suggest that interventions should attend to affective worry and anxiety about stigma and foster problem-focused and emotion-focused coping self-efficacy.

T1  - Anxieties toward Outgroup Members: Use of an (Elaborated) Imagined Contact Intervention with Undergraduate Students
AN  - 2171892115
AB  - Negative emotional reactions toward those of differing social identities is both common and detrimental to the development of relationships that are essential for effective work, living, and educational spaces. In this study we assessed the impact of an (elaborated) imagined contact intervention (eICI) on undergraduate students’ anxiety levels toward those of other social groups in a course entitled “Counseling Diverse Populations.” Participants (n = 20) who completed an eICI reported reductions of anxiety in comparison to participants (n = 22) in an assessment-only condition who did not complete the intervention. At follow-up, however, decreases in anxiety were observed among all participants. Student qualitative commentary on the eICI reflected perceptions of increased awareness of personal biases and greater humanization of those from outgroups. Students also expressed a desire to increase contact with other groups so as to have opportunities to transcend group differences.

T1  - Are today’s youth more tolerant? Trends in tolerance among young people in Britain
AN  - 2170172834
AB  - Attitudes towards social groups that have traditionally been marginalised or discriminated against have changed markedly in Britain over the past three decades. This change is particularly marked in attitudes towards homosexuality and racial diversity which, as public opinion surveys have regularly shown, have become more accepting over time. This change is often attributed to older, less tolerant generations being replaced by young cohorts who are more inclusive and open minded in their attitudes to cultural others. The paper explores this argument by examining trends in people’s attitudes towards a variety of minorities, including the said groups, but also immigrants and foreign workers. It starts with a discussion of several perspectives predicting different trends with regards to these attitudes. A distinction is made between optimistic ones (i.e. those anticipating rising levels of tolerance) and pessimistic ones (i.e. those expecting stable or declining levels of tolerance). Subsequently, the paper presents trend analyses and an analysis of age, cohort and period effects to broadly assess the explanatory power of these perspectives. Using these approaches, we find that tolerance towards racial minorities and homosexuality has indeed risen across the board, and that young people are also more accepting of these groups than their parents or grandparents and previous generations of young people. These trends broadly support the optimistic perspectives. However, we also find that prejudice has not disappeared from youth attitudes altogether; for a sizeable minority of youth, it has merely shifted its focus to immigration. Not only have unwelcoming attitudes towards immigrants generally become stronger, young people are not always the most tolerant age group regarding this social group. These findings are thus more in line with the expectations of the pessimistic perspectives.

T1  - Improving outgroup attitudes in schools: First steps toward a teacher‐led vicarious contact intervention
AN  - 2167016425
AB  - Despite the urgent need for promoting positive intergroup relations in schools, research on intergroup relations is not systematically translated into prejudice‐reduction interventions. Although prejudice‐reduction interventions in schools based on indirect contact have been conducted for decades, they have all been carried out by researchers themselves. In a field experiment in Finland in autumn 2015, we tested for the first time a vicarious contact prejudice‐reduction intervention for its effectiveness among adolescents (N = 639) when implemented independently by school teachers instead of researchers. In addition, we tested the extent to which the intervention's effect depends on initial outgroup attitudes, previous direct outgroup contact experiences, and gender, hypothesizing that the intervention improves outgroup attitudes particularly among adolescents with more negative prior attitudes and less positive prior direct contact, and more among girls than among boys. We found an unanticipated overall deterioration in the outgroup attitudes during intervention in both the experimental and control groups. However, attitudes seemed to deteriorate somewhat less in the experimental than in the control group, and the intervention had a significant positive effect on outgroup attitudes in one experimental subgroup that needed it most: girls who had negative rather than positive outgroup attitudes at the outset. We discuss our results in light of previous research and contextual particularities.

T1  - Public opinion and collective subjectivity: a conceptual approach
AN  - 2566047703
AB  - This paper discusses the concept of public opinion at a theoretical level. It starts from the recognition of the importance of this concept for sociology and reconnects with older strands in sociology and neighboring disciplines which focused on it, such as social psychology and political science. In reviewing the literature, it collects its insights and endeavours to surmount its shortcomings, drawing upon the concept of collective subjectivity. It thus tackles the theorization of public opinion regarding varied levels of centering and intentionality, social interaction, individuals and sub-collectivities, as well as the dimensions of the constitution of collective subjectivities (hermeneutic-symbolic, material, of power and space-time). Finally, the paper discusses how permanence and change take place in what regards public opinion, pointing to the mechanisms related to social memory and creativity, as well as to rhythms of social development. Evaluative and political issues relative to public opinion as a decentred collective subjecivity are also discussed.

T1  - Effects of social identity and schadenfreude on attitude toward brand sponsoring an instant replay review: The moderating role of rivalry and suspense
AN  - 2131058668
AB  - Used during sport games to guard against incorrect calls by referees, instant replay review has provided sponsoring brands an additional advertising opportunity. Although instant replay video (IRV) encourages sport spectators to stay focused on the screen, no study has examined how viewer perception of and attitude toward an ad or brand tied to IRV are formed or how such formations might vary in different circumstances. Applying social identity theory and the concept of schadenfreude (i.e., the experience of joy when observing another's misfortune), the current study examined sport fan perceptions of an IRV‐sponsoring ad and its sponsoring brand. Results from an experiment using a 2 (rivalry level: high vs. low) × 2 (suspense level: high vs. low) between‐subjects design revealed that the positive emotion induced by a negative instant replay outcome for the opposing team (i.e., schadenfreude) led to positive attitude toward the ad (Aad‐IRV) and the sponsoring brand (Ab‐IRV). Importantly, the results indicate that the effects of schadenfreude on Aad‐IRV were greater when the level of rivalry was higher. Participants exposed to the high rivalry game condition showed a stronger relationship between schadenfreude and Aad‐IRV than the low rivalry game group. In addition, when the participants felt high suspense during the game, the schadenfreude resulting from a negative outcome of the rivalry team produced a significantly positive effect on Aad‐IRV. However, no such schadenfreude effect was observed in the low suspense situations. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.

T1  - Diversity in Canada: Predictors of the perceptions of social interactions
AN  - 2126766905
AB  - Canada is one of the most diverse countries in the world, but do Canadians accept diversity? This study examines the factors that predict the perceptions of social interactions among individuals in Canada. The data were obtained from the Ethnic Diversity Survey (EDS) conducted by Statistics Canada and the Department of Canadian Heritage in 2002. Multivariate analyses were applied to investigate whether individuals' racial, linguistic, religious, socioeconomic, and immigrant status influence their perceptions of their social interactions. The data comprised 41,695 responses from individuals in ten provinces of Canada, using a computer-assisted telephone interview method. The logistic regression results indicate that it is likely that people who belong to a visible minority, have lower socioeconomic status, speak non-official languages, and follow a religion other than Christianity feel discriminated against, uncomfortable/out-of-place, and worried about becoming a victim of hate-crime in Canada. The French-speaking people also feel discriminated against and out-of-place in Canada. This study informs us about the public attitude on the dynamics of social interactions in a multi-cultural and multi-racial society. It reinforces the need for community-based researchers, community development workers and policy makers to address discrimination and hostility and to invest in programs and policies that promote an inclusive society in Canada.

T1  - Do individuals with problematic and non-problematic internet game use differ in cooperative behaviors with partners of different social distances? Evidence from the Prisoner's Dilemma and Chicken Game
AN  - 2110226455
AB  - Numerous studies have reported deficits in non-social decision-making tasks and reward-related impulsivity in individuals with problematic Internet game use (PIGU). However, those findings may not generalize to situations that involve social interactions. Therefore, this study aimed to examine how PIGU may relate to behavior during cooperative dilemmas and the potential moderating influences of social distance. Twenty-three subjects with PIGU and 23 with occasional Internet game use (OIGU) were recruited to participate in the experiment. Participants played League of Legends cooperatively with one of their real-life friends and one strange confederate game-mate under non-face-to-face conditions, and then completed Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) and Chicken Game (CG) tasks with their friend, game-mate, and stranger, respectively. Results showed no between-group difference on cooperation in the PD, but participants with PIGU (as compared to those with OIGU) exhibited lower cooperation during the CG. Compared with friends and stranger partners, short-time cooperation in online gaming did not improve cooperation toward game-mates in the PD, but elevated cooperation in the PIGU group toward game-mates in the CG. The results of this work suggest that risk-taking-related preferences in individuals with PIGU may extend to some aspects of social decision-making.

T1  - Entertainment-education effectively reduces prejudice: GPIR
AN  - 2109035266
AB  - We show that entertainment-education reduces prejudice and does so more effectively than several established prejudice reduction methods. In Experiment 1, participants exposed to an educational television sitcom with diverse, yet relatable Arab/Muslim characters had lower scores on implicit and explicit measures of prejudice than participants exposed to a control sitcom featuring an all White cast. The prejudice reduction effect persisted 4 weeks after exposure. In Experiment 2, viewing of a 4-minute music video that portrayed Arabs/Muslims as relatable and likable resulted in a larger reduction in prejudice against Arabs/Muslims than two established prejudice reduction methods (imagined contact exercise and group malleability article), which produced no improvements. In both experiments, increased identification with target group members was associated with greater prejudice reduction. Entertainment-education, in addition to being scalable, is likely to be one the most effective methods for improving intergroup relations and promoting diversity.

T1  - Emotional Integration across Immigrant Generations in Baden‐Württemberg, Germany: the Role of Discrimination
AN  - 2037002382
AB  - Immigrants’ integration is a multi‐faceted process, involving structural, cultural, social, and emotional dimensions. This study focuses on the emotional dimension of integration, investigating immigrants’ emotional attachments to their national origin and their host country. Specifically, we ask what role perceived discrimination plays in shaping identification preferences among immigrants and immigrant descendants in Germany. The contribution of this study is twofold: First, we present results for three generations of post‐WWII labour migrants of Turkish and Italian descent. Second, we estimate the consequences of perceived individual discrimination for national and ethnic identification separately. The findings indicate that while discrimination is not related to ethnic identification, it is negatively correlated with national identification. Regarding future challenges, we believe that our findings suggest that the German society can come closer to achieving integration of migrants by reducing perceptions of rejection by the immigrant population, or better yet, fighting off discrimination against immigrant minorities.

An important question, largely ignored in previous research, concerns empathy to ingroup and outgroup members’ pain in the contexts of ongoing intergroup conflict. In the present study we examined how implicit and explicit ethnic social categorization of others affects empathy to pain in the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. To meet this aim, we assessed the evaluation of pain by Jewish and Arab participants who viewed a series of visual stimuli depicting painful and non-painful familiar situations. The stimuli were associated with explicitly or implicitly primed typical names depicting ingroup, neutral outgroup, and adversary outgroup members. Results demonstrate that pain ratings in the explicit priming condition provide support for the ingroup empathy hypothesis, positing that empathy is higher for ingroup than for outgroup members for both Jews and Palestinian Arabs. Conversely, when the targets’ categories are primed implicitly, results revealed difference in empathy by the two ethnic groups where an ingroup bias was detected only for Palestinian Arabs. This suggests that the activation of ingroup bias on the subliminal implicit level among Palestinian Arab participants might be mediated by the amount of conflict permeating in their daily lives and by deeply rooted cultural values and behavioural patterns.

T1  - Race-based experiences of ethnic minority health professionals: Arab physicians and nurses in Israeli public healthcare organizations
AN  - 2012859218
AB  - Increasing workforce diversity was found to contribute to the narrowing of disparities in health. However, racism toward ethnic minority health professionals has not been adequately researched. In Israel, public healthcare organizations that serve a mixed Jewish-Arab population employ Arab minority healthcare professionals. Instances of prejudice and manifestations of racism toward them, which frequently surface in public discussion and the media, have unfortunately gained little scholarly attention. We used the intergroup contact approach and the theory of the social process of everyday racism as a theoretical framework. The objective of the research was to study race-based experiences of Israeli Arab healthcare professionals.Methodology: We used a qualitative research method that allows respondents to describe their views, experiences, beliefs and behavior in the way they think about them. During 2013 and 2014 we conducted in-depth interviews with a snowball sample of 10 Arab physicians and 13 Arab nurses who work in Israeli public hospitals. The study protocol was ethically approved.Findings: Interviewees noted institutional efforts to maintain egalitarianism and equality. However, at the micro-level, interviewees, mostly nurses, reported instances that ranged from refusal to accept treatment from an Arab nurse, through verbal abuse, to the use of physical violence against them. At the meso-level, interviewees, mostly physicians, reported experiences of institutional discrimination. At the macro-level, one physician reported policy-related discrimination in the context of the immigration of Russian Jewish physicians to Israel.Conclusions: We recommend combining the intergroup contact approach with the social process theory of racism to examine minorities' subjective perceptions, especially in conflictual and violent contexts; conducting broad-based quantitative research in Israeli healthcare organizations, which may have important implications for the specific strategies to be used; and emphasizing the importance of institutional support. By reconstructing race-based experiences of ethnic minority health professionals, health organizations can better manage racial situations and reduce their frequency.

T1  - A multi-group path analysis of the relationship between perceived racial discrimination and self-rated stress: how does it vary across racial/ethnic groups?
AN  - 2006846539
AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to answer three questions: (1) Is perceived discrimination adversely related to self-rated stress via the social capital and health care system distrust pathways? (2) Does the relationship between perceived discrimination and self-rated stress vary across race/ethnicity groups? and (3) Do the two pathways differ by one's race/ethnicity background?Design: Using the Philadelphia Health Management Corporation's Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Survey, we classified 9831 respondents into 4 race/ethnicity groups: non-Hispanic White (n = 6621), non-Hispanic Black (n = 2359), Hispanic (n = 505), and non-Hispanic other races (n = 346). Structural equation modeling was employed to simultaneously estimate five sets of equations, including the confirmatory factor analysis for both social capital and health care distrust and both direct and indirect effects from perceived discrimination to self-rated stress.Results: The key findings drawn from the analysis include the following: (1) in general, people who experienced racial discrimination have higher distrust and weaker social capital than those without perceived discrimination and both distrust and social capital are ultimately related to self-rated stress. (2) The direct relationship between perceived discrimination and self-rated stress is found for all race/ethnicity groups (except non-Hispanic other races) and it does not vary across groups. (3) The two pathways can be applied to non-Hispanic White and Black, but for Hispanic and non-Hispanic other races, we found little evidence for the social capital pathway.Conclusions: For non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic, perceived discrimination is negatively related to self-rated stress. This finding highlights the importance of reducing interpersonal discriminatory behavior even for non-Hispanic White. The health care system distrust pathway can be used to address the racial health disparity in stress as it holds true for all four race/ethnicity groups. On the other hand, the social capital pathway seems to better help non-Hispanic White and Black to mediate the adverse effect of perceived discrimination on stress.

T1  - Racial and Ethnic Differences in Perceptions of Everyday Discrimination
AN  - 2406941746
AB  - This study examines differences in perceptions of discrimination across multiple racial and ethnic minority groups. We focus on structural factors such as race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) and psychosocial factors such as racial/ethnic identities as predictors of perceived everyday discrimination. Data come from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES), and analyses reveal several important patterns. First, perceived everyday discrimination is highly prevalent among racial/ethnic minorities in the United States and these perceptions largely reflect existing racial/ethnic hierarchies: African Americans and Afro-Caribbeans report the highest level of discrimination, whereas most Asian and Latino groups report less. Second, education, income, and immigration-related factors such as duration of residence and English language proficiency are positively associated with perceived discrimination. Third, the effects of racial/ethnic identity on perceived discrimination vary across ethnic groups, showing stronger associations among Afro-Caribbeans than among other racial and ethnic minorities. Findings from this study help to advance our theoretical understanding and empirical knowledge of racial/ethnic stratification and perceived discrimination in the United States.

T1  - Threat and Prejudice against Syrian Refugees in Canada: Assessing the Moderating Effects of Multiculturalism, Interculturalism, and Assimilation
AN  - 1966856374
AB  - A survey experiment (N = 529) was used to test the moderating effects of intergroup ideologies (assimilation, multiculturalism, and interculturalism) on the relationship between social dominance orientation (SDO) and expressions of prejudice under conditions of intergroup threat. Moderated multiple regression analyses suggest a multicultural integration frame moderates the relationship between SDO and feelings toward Syrian refugees in Canada when the target outgroup is portrayed as a source of intergroup threat. This moderating effect was unique to the relationship between SDO and feelings toward Syrians and did not extend to other correlates of prejudice including beliefs in zero-sum group competition or a multicultural ideology, nor did it extend to more general measures of prejudice (i.e., attitudes toward immigrants or evaluations of intercultural contact). Findings suggest the prejudice-reducing effects of a multicultural integration narrative affect group evaluations and functions by targeting beliefs in social dominance, rather than zero-sum group competition or ideological support for cultural diversity. The results offer insights into the prejudice-reducing potential for two alternative integration narratives that are institutionalized in Canada.

T1  - The importance of social-cognitive development and the developmental context for group dynamics: GPIR
AN  - 1932700126
AB  - A developmental approach provides a unique vantage point for understanding the origins, acquisition, and nature of change regarding intergroup attitudes and behavior. Developmental research has focused predominantly on understanding and addressing negative intergroup attitudes and behaviors. We assert that group identity and group dynamics do not have to lead to discriminatory and prejudicial behavior but can actually contribute to an inclusive orientation. Moreover, these orientations do not occur in a vacuum but depend on the broader social context and the specific group distinctions. A broader social and cultural approach is important for understanding the implications of intergroup attitudes for healthy social development as well as the creation of a fair and just society.

T1  - Identity, legitimacy and "making sense" of police use of force
AN  - 1948720052
AB  - Purpose 
The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which police legitimacy and social identity explain variation in public acceptance of police use of force. The authors assess whether there is an association between legitimacy and public acceptance of apparently illegal or unethical police action; and the extent to which identification with a particular social group predicts judgments of police behavior. 
Design/methodology/approach 
The study draws upon cross-sectional data from a 2015 survey of a representative sample of adults in England and Wales. Structural equation modeling is used to model conditional correlations between latent constructs. 
Findings 
There are two main findings. First, identifying more strongly with a social group that the police may be seen to represent was consistently associated with greater acceptance of police use of force, whether or not that force seemed to be justified. Second, beliefs about the legitimacy of the police were also associated with acceptance, but primarily only in relation to the use of force in situations where it appeared prima facie justifiable. 
Social implications 
Results suggest one possible set of reasons why police retain public support in the face of scandals concerning excessive use of force. 
Originality/value 
This is one of only very few studies that have used survey data to explore lay justifications for police use of force.

T1  - Are the ethnically tolerant free of discrimination, prejudice and political intolerance?
AN  - 1929389479
AB  - We hypothesized that the ethnically tolerant (i.e., people who are anti-ethnocentric and score very low on a measure of ethnocentrism) would perceive people with extremely incompatible values and beliefs as out-groups and would engage in discrimination, prejudice and political intolerance against them. Experiments among Australian citizens in Studies 1 (N = 224) and 2 (N = 283) showed that the ethnically tolerant perceived supporters of a message in favour of mandatory detention of asylum seekers as out-groups and consequently exhibited discrimination, prejudice and political intolerance against them. Study 3 with 265 U.S. citizens showed that, controlling for liberalism, ethnic tolerance led to prejudice against out-groups. This was replicated with 522 UK citizens in Study 4, which also showed that social identity, and not moral conviction, mediated the link between ethnic tolerance and prejudice. The findings suggest that the ethnically tolerant can be discriminatory, prejudiced and politically intolerant against fellow humans.

T1  - The Internet, Social Capital, and Civic Engagement in Asia
AN  - 1902057850
AB  - In this paper, we seek to explain (1) how the rise of Internet communication is related to the level of social capital and (2) the role of internet and social capital in shaping civic engagement in Asia. We use cross-national public opinion data of thirteen Asian countries from 2010 to 2012 to investigate these questions. Our results show that social capital is still measured best by traditional membership in social organizations. While the Internet increases social contacts, we could not find evidence that social capital is directly increased by the Internet. We also find that social capital developed through voluntary participation in social organizations most effectively promotes civic engagement activities, except for non-electoral actions that involve joining a demonstration or using violence. Internet usage turns out to be the most effective means of civic engagement for these cases.

T1  - Congregational Composition and Explanations for Racial Inequality Among Black Religious Affiliates
AN  - 1899808751
AB  - Prior research suggests that congregational characteristics are associated with the racial attitudes of Black churchgoers. This study examines the relationship between congregational diversity and beliefs about the Black/White socioeconomic gap among Black religious adherents. Drawing upon pooled data from the General Social Survey and the National Congregations Study, we fit binary logistic regression models to estimate the association between congregational diversity and the explanations of Black/White economic inequality among Black religious adherents. Findings from our study reveal that congregational diversity is one factor that accounts for intragroup differences in racial attitudes among Black religious affiliates. Relative to Blacks that attend religious services in overwhelmingly Black congregations, Blacks that attend religious services in congregations that are overwhelmingly White are significantly less likely to attribute Black/White socioeconomic gaps to a lack of educational opportunities. Our study demonstrates that congregational diversity is a source of intragroup variation in racial attitudes among Black religious affiliates, which may attenuate the ability of such congregations to bridge racial divisions.

T1  - Contact with Counter-Stereotypical Women Predicts Less Sexism, Less Rape Myth Acceptance, Less Intention to Rape (in Men) and Less Projected Enjoyment of Rape (in Women)
AN  - 1877731688
AB  - Intergroup contact--(positive) interactions with people from different social groups--is a widely researched and strongly supported prejudice-reducing mechanism shown to reduce prejudice against a wide variety of outgroups. However, no known previous research has investigated whether intergroup contact can also reduce sexism against women. Sexism has an array of negative outcomes. One of the most detrimental and violent ones is rape, which is both justified and downplayed by rape myth acceptance. We hypothesised that more frequent, higher quality contact with counter-stereotypical women would predict lower levels of sexism and thus less rape myth acceptance (in men) and less sexualised projected responses to rape (in women). Two studies using online surveys with community samples supported these hypotheses. In Study 1, 170 male participants who experienced more positive contact with counter-stereotypical women reported less intention to rape. Similarly, in Study 2, 280 female participants who experienced more positive contact with counter-stereotypical women reported less projected sexual arousal at the thought of being raped. Thus, the present research is the first known to show that contact could be a potential tool to combat sexism, rape myth acceptance, intentions to rape in men, and sexualisation of rape by women.

T1  - Contextualizing Migrants' Strategies of Seeking Medical Care in Russia*
AN  - 1819117172
AB  - Russia is an important destination for labour migrants from the former Soviet Union republics especially Central Asian low-income countries: Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The life of migrants from Central Asia is characterized in Russia by scarce resources and social exclusion. Limited access to healthcare is aggravated by the negative attitudes and discrimination that migrants face when visiting state hospitals and clinics. In our study, we aim to describe the medical infrastructure available to migrants in Moscow. We investigate how migrants use formal and informal strategies to overcome the barriers to their receiving medical care in the urban environment. The study is based on the analysis of qualitative interviews with 60 labour migrants from Central Asian countries and 23 caregivers working in Moscow-based medical facilities such as state hospitals, outpatient clinics, ambulance stations, and private medical centres including the so-called Kyrgyz clinics.

T1  - Self-Expansion and Intergroup Contact: Expectancies and Motives to Self-Expand Lead to Greater Interest in Outgroup Contact and More Positive Intergroup Relations
AN  - 1817460974
AB  - Sixty years of research on intergroup contact demonstrates that positive interactions across group boundaries can improve intergroup attitudes and can contribute to forging tolerant, integrated, multicultural societies. However, to fully realize the benefits of growing diversity around the globe, individuals need to exploit opportunities for intergroup contact that are available to them. Yet, it is relatively unknown why people might deliberately engage in cross-group interactions and how individuals' expectations and motives prepare them to develop positive interpersonal relationships with outgroup members. In this article, we begin to address these research gaps. We discuss the self-expansion model and present new evidence that is consistent with this model. Two studies, one correlational in a cross-cultural setting and the other experimental, show the value of high self-expansion expectancies and motivation in promoting interest in and producing more and higher quality interactions across group boundaries. We discuss implications of these findings for policy and intervention.

T1  - Ethnic and Civic Leadership in the Progressive Era: Charles H. Wacker and Chicago
AN  - 1802480129
AB  - When Charles H Wacker died in 1929, local and national newspapers praised him as a civic leader who had made Chicago a greater and more beautiful city Wacker was a successful businessman who gave his time and money to address local problems, most notably as the first president of the United Charities of Chicago and the first chairman of the Chicago Plan Commission. Although the obituary in Chicago's German-language Abendpost recognized Wacker as both a leader of the city's German Americans and a civic leader, English-language newspapers entirely ignored his role in the German American community. This marked a major departure from past practice. Before the 1920s, Chicago's English-language newspapers gave extensive coverage to the leadership that Wacker and other civic leaders provided to their ethnic communities. This highlighted the fact that these men played an important dual role in Chicago both within their ethnic groups and in the city at large, and that they facilitated unity in the multiethnic city By the 1 920s, however, the major organs of public opinion no longer deemed ethnic identity a positive attribute of civic leaders. Exploring Wacker's life and work provides a window onto how a multiethnic American city functioned and suggests why that world was lost. Here, Hirsch discusses Wacker's civic and ethnics the leadership in Chicago in the progressive era.

T1  - The Enterprising Self and Prejudices toward Unemployed Persons: Analyses of Intergroup-mechanisms that Substantiate Neoliberal Inequalities
AN  - 2167841583
AB  - This research tries to build bridges between sociological and social psychological theoretical ideas for the study of social inequality in neoliberal societies. It adds to research on social inequality by examining amplifiers of prejudices toward unemployed persons. A conceptual model has been developed which draws upon social dominance theory and governmentality studies. The empirical analyses guided by this model assess the mediating effects of the enterprising self - a newly developed attitude measure based on sociological analyses of contemporary self-help literature - and the Protestant Work Ethic in the relationship between social dominance orientation and prejudices toward unemployed persons, both depending on social status. Conditional process models reveal the phenomenon of ideological asymmetry relevant for the enterprising self, indicating that this neoliberal guiding principle serves as a dominant driving force in reproducing social inequality through mechanisms at the intergroup-level.Alternate abstract:Dieser Artikel baut für die Untersuchung neoliberaler sozialer Ungleichheiten über die Soziale Dominanztheorie und eine Analyse von Verstärkern von Vorurteilen gegenüber arbeitslosen Personen Brücken zwischen soziologischen und sozialpsychologischen Theorietraditionen. Ein konzeptionelles Modell wurde entwickelt, worin mediierende Effekte von Einstellungen entlang des Leitbildes des unternehmerischen Selbst – eine neu entwickelte quantitative Einstellungsmessung die auf gouvernementalitätstheoretisch soziologischen Analysen gegenwärtiger Selbsthilfeliteratur basiert – unter Kontrolle der Protestantischen Arbeitsethik und des subjektiven Statusempfindens empirisch getestet wurden. Die Methode des Conditional Process Modeling ergab eine moderierte Wirkung des unternehmerischen Selbst auf die Abwertung von arbeitslosen Personen, die mit zunehmenden Status stark zunimmt, leicht in der Mittelschicht auftritt und in der (subjektiven) Underclass nicht vorliegt. Dieses Resultat wird in Anknüpfung an die gouvernementalitätstheoretische Literatur diskutiert.

T1  - Bias in the Flesh: Skin Complexion and Stereotype Consistency in Political Campaigns
AN  - 1766806890
AB  - There is strong evidence linking skin complexion to negative stereotypes and adverse real-world outcomes. We extend these findings to political ad campaigns, in which skin complexion can be easily manipulated in ways that are difficult to detect. Devising a method to measure how dark a candidate appears in an image, this paper examines how complexion varied with ad content during the 2008 presidential election campaign (study 1). Findings show that darker images were more frequent in negative ads -- especially those linking Obama to crime -- which aired more frequently as Election Day approached. We then conduct an experiment to document how these darker images can activate stereotypes, and show that a subtle darkness manipulation is sufficient to activate the most negative stereotypes about Blacks -- even when the candidate is a famous counter-stereotypical exemplar -- Barack Obama (study 2). Further evidence of an evaluative penalty for darker skin comes from an observational study measuring affective responses to depictions of Obama with varying skin complexion, presented via the Affect Misattribution Procedure in the 2008 American National Election Study (study 3). This study demonstrates that darker images are used in a way that complements ad content, and shows that doing so can negatively affect how individuals evaluate candidates and think about politics.

T1  - When do high and low status group members support confrontation? The role of perceived pervasiveness of prejudice
AN  - 1773420692
AB  - This paper examines how perceived pervasiveness of prejudice differentially affects high and low status group members' support for a low status group member who confronts. In Experiment 1 (N = 228), men and women read a text describing sexism as rare or as pervasive and subsequently indicated their support for a woman who confronted or did not confront a sexist remark. Experiment 2 (N = 324) specified the underlying process using a self-affirmation manipulation. Results show that men were more supportive of confrontation when sexism was perceived to be rare than when it was pervasive. By contrast, women tended to prefer confrontation when sexism was pervasive relative to when it was rare. Personal self-affirmation decreased men's and increased women's support for confrontation when prejudice was rare, suggesting that men's and women's support for confrontation when prejudice is rare is driven by personal impression management considerations. Implications for understanding how members of low and high status groups respond to prejudice are discussed.

T1  - Stigma-Based Solidarity: Understanding the Psychological Foundations of Conflict and Coalition Among Members of Different Stigmatized Groups
AN  - 1905134767
AB  - With growing diversity and increased media attention to inequality, it is likely that stigmatized-group members will have increased political influence on social issues affecting other stigmatized groups. When might members of different stigmatized groups see commonality in their experiences or disadvantaged status, and when might another stigmatized group be treated solely as an out-group? This article provides an overview of new and important lines of research examining how perceived discrimination may shape intergroup relations among members of different stigmatized groups. Specifically, perceived discrimination is highlighted as a potentially common experience for members of different stigmatized groups that at times elicits coalitional attitudes, but is often solely experienced as a threat to social identity and thus elicits intergroup derogation. The dimensions on which individuals are stigmatized, aspects of their discrimination experiences, and contextual factors are important for predicting whether perceiving discrimination will spur coalition or derogation. This topic is vital for understanding intergroup relations and political behavior in the 21st century.

T1  - Prejudice in person memory: Self-threat biases memories of stigmatized group members
AN  - 1782205211
AB  - The present research investigated whether self-threat biases memory via retrieval-induced forgetting. Results show that people under self-threat whose goal is to restore their self-worth by making prejudicial judgments that deprecate others are more likely to exhibit an enhanced RIF effect for positive items and a reduced RIF for negative items ascribed to a stereotyped target (i.e., homosexual). Overall, the present findings are consistent with the view that motivation can affect the magnitude of RIF effects in person memory and that, in turn, they can serve as mechanisms for justifying desired conclusions.

T1  - Relative Deprivation and Relative Wealth Enhances Anti-Immigrant Sentiments: The V-Curve Re-Examined
AN  - 1721911191
AB  - Previous research has shown that negative attitudes towards immigrants and support for anti-immigrant parties are observed both among those experiencing relative deprivation and those experiencing relative gratification (so called v-curve). Whereas the effect of relative deprivation is intuitive, the effect of relative gratification is more difficult to explain. Why would economic prosperity provoke negative attitudes towards immigrants? We first present correlational (Study 1) and experimental (Study 2) support for the v-curve. In Study 1, in a national Swiss referendum, a higher percentage anti-immigrant voting was found in cantons with relatively lower and relatively higher relative disposable income. In Study 2, in a hypothetical society, more opposition to ‘newcomers’ joining society was found among poor or above average wealth group members than among those in a moderate wealth group condition. In Study 3, we replicate this finding and also show that opposition to immigration is higher for all wealth groups when societal inequality is growing rather than declining. In a final study, we examine different forms of relative gratification and mediators of the relationship between relative gratification and opposition to immigration (i.e., identification, collective self-definition as competent and cold, and fear about future wealth). Only fear about future wealth mediates this relationship. We conclude that, paradoxically, relative gratification effects are partly due to the fear of future deprivation.

T1  - Changing Perspectives? Public Opinion, Perceptions of Discrimination, and Feelings Toward the Family
AN  - 1719242482
AB  - The current study broadens our understanding of the range and diversity of attitudes relevant to the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer (GLBTQ) civil rights debate, specifically toward those who identify as gay and lesbian. We first examine which factors best explain variation in perceptions of discrimination toward individuals who identify as gay and lesbian. A second analysis explores feelings toward or being upset upon learning that a child is gay or lesbian. Analyzing survey data collected by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press in May 2013 (N = 1,504), the results suggest that while demographics and political predispositions are important predictors of perceptions of discrimination, religious objections and church attendance are more central to the case of family acceptance. The influence of social contact and preexisting attitudes are explored as well. Implications for those engaged in family practice are discussed along with directions for future public opinion research on attitudes toward the GLBTQ population.

T1  - Prejudice and Openness to the Other: Investigating Responses to Testimonies of Race-Based Suffering
AN  - 1700928364
AB  - The present study employed a variety of existing measures to assess openness to the other in the ecologically valid context of listening to real-life testimonies of race-based suffering. Variation in system threat, and individual differences in two measures of prejudice--right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO)--were all investigated for their impact on respondent openness. Among 36 student volunteers, it was found that a woman's testimony featuring a high degree of system threat engendered less openness to the other among participants high in SDO than less threatening testimony offered by a man. Additionally, participant levels of RWA explained a significant amount of variance in their openness to the other across both male and female testimonies. This study quantitatively confirms that testimonies of race-based suffering--utterances that have great potential to interrupt master narratives and invite deep learning--are likely to be met with a complex and interactive pattern of resistance that must be more fully understood.

T1  - The work of Sisyphus: Squaring the circle of Roma recognition
AN  - 1700674320; 201525334
AB  - Most special issues on Roma minorities want to alert readers to the devastating consequences of racist public attitudes and misdirected public policy. Here we don't shy away from such issues, but we also want to challenge our own scholarship and ask some fundamental questions about how we, as academics, are approaching such research. In this introduction the context of the special issue is explored, both in terms of the historic backdrop of an expanding European Union and the academic theoretical framework of minority integration. Major critical questioning - such as broader questions around migration, race and ethnicity discourses - are still lacking when it comes to research on or with Roma minorities. Our main aim is to move debates on from continually describing who Roma people are and what they are doing, to questioning: who defines who is Roma, when and why? What happens in policy-making, research, everyday interactions? This approach sees an understanding of recognition, representations and power dynamics as fundamental to understanding the positionings of minorities who can also be marginalised or feel disenfranchised. This introduction to the special issue highlights the importance of deeply conceptualising issues around minority integration alongside empirical knowledge of how Roma identities become implicated in and through different modalities of mobilisation. Contributions to this special issue speak to debates in minority politics and identity studies along with migration and race/ethnicity discourses. This indicates that the experiences of, and discourses surrounding Roma minorities reflect the fundamental concerns of social science research about identity, ethnicity, cohesion and change.

T1  - Interethnic attitudes in urban neighbourhoods: The impact of neighbourhood disorder and decline
AN  - 1708527530; 201529225
AB  - Previous studies of the relationship between interethnic attitudes and the ethnic composition of neighbourhoods have overlooked the impact of neighbourhood problems in ethnically concentrated neighbourhoods. This paper examines the influence of neighbourhood disorder and decline (i.e. increasing disorder) on interethnic attitudes, controlling for the ethnic composition of the neighbourhood. Neighbourhood disorder and decline are measured by indicators of social and physical neighbourhood problems. Additionally, we examine the extent to which the impact of (increasing) disorder on interethnic attitudes depends on the particular ethnic composition of the neighbourhood. Using a geocoded data set covering 1435 neighbourhoods in The Netherlands, we analyse interethnic attitudes among four ethnic minority groups and the native Dutch population. Multilevel analyses show that for both ethnic minority and native Dutch residents neighbourhood decline is associated with negative attitudes towards ethnic minority groups, particularly in neighbourhoods with many ethnic minority residents.

T1  - Invention of a Nation: The Druze in Israel
AN  - 1700674604; 201526321
AB  - Ethnic and national identities are shaped and evolve in the context of complex negotiations sustained among multiple players, each with its own and often contradicting interests. This study focuses on one unique cultural group, the Druze in Israel, and examines a multifaceted identity constructed as a direct result of policies and expectations of members and institutions of majority groups. My aim is to explore how this identity is defined within the complex intergroup context, the various components and their inter-relations (congruent or conflictual), and the way its boundaries are shaped through interaction with other identities in Israel. The analysis of the interviews conducted with 50 Druze university students in Israel yielded three major content categories: 'Druze by blood;' 'Arab, but less so;' and 'Being Israeli.' The Druze identity is constructed in primordialist terms, and a central role is assigned to the belief in reincarnation. The Arab identity is categorized primarily as a national one, and it is strongly affected by the negative attitude of Arabs toward the service of the Druze in the Israeli army. Three major aspects emerged in relation to the Israeli identity of the Druze: the fact of their being citizens of the State of Israel, the attitude of the state and of Jews toward them, and the army service. Our study portrays a highly complex and problematic constellation of group identities, shaped as a delicate adaptation to the unique position of a group subject to multiple political forces in the past and present.

T1  - Social Distance in the United States: Sex, Race, Religion, Age, and Education Homophily among Confidants, 1985 to 2004
AN  - 1650145156; 201502278
AB  - Homophily, the tendency for similar actors to be connected at a higher rate than dissimilar actors, is a pervasive social fact. In this article, we examine changes over a 20-year period in two types of homophily - the actual level of contact between people in different social categories and the level of contact relative to chance. We use data from the 1985 and 2004 General Social Surveys to ask whether the strengths of five social distinctions - sex, race/ethnicity, religious affiliation, age, and education - changed over the past two decades in core discussion networks. Changes in the actual level of homophily are driven by the demographic composition of the United States. As the nation has become more diverse, cross-category contacts in race/ethnicity and religion have increased. After describing the raw homophily rates, we develop a case-control model to assess homophily relative to chance mixing. We find decreasing rates of homophily for gender but stability for race and age, although the young are increasingly isolated from older cohorts outside of the family. We also find some weak evidence for increasing educational and religious homophily. These relational trends may be explained by changes in demographic heterogeneity, institutional segregation, economic inequality, and symbolic boundaries. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Americans' Perceptions of Commitment to Strong Families Across Race and Ethnic Groups
AN  - 1551001332; 201430614
AB  - Theories of prejudice examining perceptual differences of in-groups and out-groups, such as social dominance and group threat perspectives, have found them to be important in generating hegemonic identity formations. This study uses data from the General Social Surveys to explore how these hegemonic group perceptions influence attitudes toward stronger families using race and ethnic groups as proxy measures where Whites are considered the in-group. A modified ecosystemic-interactionist approach along with elements from group threat and social dominance theories as support was used to investigate the underlying premise that group membership influenced respondents' perceptions of their own family vis a vis others. Overall, the study found support for the underlying premise that membership influenced group perceptions, group knowledge, and group beliefs about commitment to strong families. Additionally, these findings suggest that groups develop most of their beliefs and subsequently their attitudes from limited interaction with those they perceived to be in the out-groups. Other social factors, including media portrayals, geographic propinquity, and education, also play a role in group perceptions, group knowledge, and group beliefs about commitment toward strong families. They support the social dominance and group threat theories that give rise to hegemonic structure within the United States. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The racial foundations of whites' support for child saving
AN  - 1567049223; 201436676
AB  - Scholars emphasize that attitudes toward rehabilitation and views about punitive polices are distinct phenomena with seemingly unique etiologies. However, few existing studies examine the sources of public views about juvenile rehabilitation, or 'child saving,' and none engage a measure of racial attitudes. At the same time, recent theoretical work implicates racial concerns as a central foundation of public opinion about youth justice. This paper thus provides the first assessment of whether whites' perceptions of the racial makeup of delinquents and animosities toward blacks are associated with their views about juvenile rehabilitation. Findings show that whites who more strongly associate delinquency with blacks and those who are racially resentful both tend to be less supportive-in absolute and relative terms-of rehabilitation. The results also suggest that contextual threat moderates the effect of racial typification of delinquency, but not that of racial resentment, on whites' views about rehabilitation.

T1  - PERCEIVED DISCRIMINATION AND SOCIAL IDENTITY AS ADOLESCENTS' PATHWAYS TO EARLY SUBSTANCE USE
AN  - 1795920376
AB  - This study investigated the influence of discrimination and social identity on adolescent's substance use in selected secondary schools in Ibadan -- an investigation predicated on the argument that angry, maladaptive and externalizing behaviours such as substance use could emerge from sustained social hostility and one's identity confusion. Three hundred and forty-six (346) adolescents were randomly selected from four schools to take part in the study. Results of univariate analysis show that social stress associated with perceived and actual discrimination led highly discriminated adolescents to report high levels of substance use compared to adolescents who experienced low levels of discrimination(F=8.84, df=1, 338, p<.001). Also, adolescents' social identity did not show significant influence on substance use but a tendency to use drugs among adolescents with low social identity compared to those with high social identity reported. This situation suggests the experience of identity confusion by adolescents who experience group hostility and discrimination. Also, a comparison of gender on drug use reveals males using more drugs than females (F=14.10, df=1, 338, p<.001). Based on these outcomes it was recommended that several social and governmental organizations starting from families should work together in the enlightenment of adolescents and the general populace on the need to respect the rights of every individual and live harmoniously. With this, adolescents will share more social acceptance and reduce the frequency of involvement in emotion-regulated substance use and other maladaptive and externalizing behaviours.

T1  - Constructing racial difference through group talk: an analysis of white focus groups' discussion of racial profiling
AN  - 1512220677; 201408748
AB  - Overtly racist statements are socially and politically unacceptable in the USA. Yet black people in the USA continue to experience discrimination and prejudice at both the individual and institutional levels. This paper examines white people's talk about race in focus groups from the North Carolina Traffic Violation Study. The participants discussed race obliquely, by talking about hypothetical behaviour related to crime and police profiling while largely avoiding direct mention of race. At the same time focus group members voice different expectations for white people and black people. By differentiating between behaviours expected from individuals perceived to belong to different racial groups, they reproduced racial difference. Focus group members legitimized racial profiling and did so using language that was largely 'colour-blind' and socially acceptable by attributing the disproportionately high rate of stops for black drivers to ostensibly non-racial factors. The groups used mostly colour-blind language, but the result was racializing discourse. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Intergroup retaliation and intra-group praise gain: The effect of expected cooperation from the in-group on intergroup vicarious retribution
AN  - 1504421878; 201405376
AB  - Intergroup vicarious retribution is the phenomenon whereby, after an out-group member attacks an in-group member, a member of the victim's group retaliates against a member of the perpetrator's group. This study examined the effect of expected cooperation from the in-group on intergroup vicarious retribution through intra-group reputation based on praise gain and exclusion avoidance. In the experiment, we conducted a one-on-one match in which, after participants learned that an out-group member (as the winner) had imposed a fine on an in-group member (as the loser) in a previous round, winning participants were allowed to impose an arbitrary fine on the other losing out-group member. As a result, participants imposed a larger fine on their out-group member opponent in retaliation when they were expected by in-group members to cooperate than when such cooperation was not expected. Furthermore, participants regarded a fine as intra-group cooperation. Since a path analysis revealed a mediating effect of praise gain, but no mediating effect of exclusion avoidance, expected cooperation from in-group members facilitated vicarious retribution because those involved in retribution sought praise from other in-group members. These findings suggest that the intra-group reputation dynamics of expected cooperation and praise gain escalate intergroup conflict. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Assessing the effect of social desirability on nativism attitude responses
AN  - 1559007195; 201431977
AB  - Attempts to measure and analyze public opinion attitudes toward racial/ethnic minorities often confront the 'social desirability' problem: those who have prejudiced attitudes are rarely willing to admit them to surveyors. Instead, they may be more likely to give a socially acceptable answer rather an accurate reflection of their views. Previous research has clearly established that this effect presents a challenge for accurately measuring self-reported racial and policy attitudes that primarily affect African-Americans. It is less clear, however, how it might affect self-reported responses to attitudes dealing with Latinos and immigration. This study thus seeks to analyze the extent to which social desirability may affect survey measures of perceived levels of cultural threat (nativism). Results from two separate analyses using the Crowne-Marlowe 'social desirability scale' and a survey 'list experiment' demonstrate that social desirability is indeed a concern for accurately measuring nativism in the American public, but that it exerts an opposite effect from what has previously been observed: nativist attitudes tend to be over-reported in opinion surveys.

T1  - Warm or competent? Improving intergroup relations by addressing threatened identities of advantaged and disadvantaged groups
AN  - 1512220035; 201408706
AB  - Applying the Needs-Based Model of Reconciliation to contexts of group disparity, two studies examined how messages from outgroup representatives that affirmed the warmth or competence of advantaged or disadvantaged groups influenced their members' intergroup attitudes. Study 1 involved natural groups differing in status; Study 2 experimentally manipulated status. In both studies, advantaged-group members responded more favorably, reporting more positive outgroup attitudes and willingness to change the status quo toward equality, to messages reassuring their group's warmth. Disadvantaged-group members responded more favorably to messages affirming their group's competence. Study 2 further demonstrated that the effectiveness of reassuring a disadvantaged group's competence stemmed from restoring its threatened dimension of identity, irrespective of a change of the status quo. In line with Social Identity Theory (Tajfel Turner, 1979), these results indicate that beyond the competition over tangible resources, groups are concerned with restoring threatened dimensions of their identities. Exchanging messages that remove identity-related threats may promote not only positive intergroup attitudes but also greater willingness to act collectively for intergroup equality. .

T1  - The social geography of ethnic minorities in metropolitan Paris: a challenge to the French model of social cohesion?
AN  - 1448992881; 201342789
AB  - In order to address the specific social challenges of immigrants and ethnic minorities in the poorest urban neighbourhoods in Paris, new policies of social cohesion have been implemented over the past three decades that focus on place of residence rather than on ethnicity or national origin. The design of a social cohesion policy that deals with socio-geographic inequality rather than with ethnicized populations as such has been a subtle way of addressing the ethnic issue without directly calling into question the postulate of republican universalism. From this perspective, Audebert attempts to understand the role of place and social geography in the formalization of collective identities that have emerged in response to decades of public policies that have been unable to respond to the social, economic and political demands of ethnic minorities. He also attempts to analyse how the French state has relied on social geography as a way to address racial and ethnic issues without directly endowing them with an institutionalized dimension. His hypothesis is that the issue of social cohesion in contemporary France and the way it is dealt with by republican institutions is above all a matter of social geography. The French approach that gives prominence to the urban territorialization of social inequalities over the ethnic categorization approach remains firmly based on republican ideals. Nonetheless, such a policy is innovative in the French context, as it differs from the French traditional assimilationist model and takes into account social and cultural diversity in large metropolitan areas. Audebert's article provides a better understanding of the influence of this integration model on the construction of Otherness. It puts into relief the role of urban geography in the emergence of ethnicity and the design of innovative policy that addresses the issue of cultural diversity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Using the Science of Psychology to Target Perpetrators of Racism and Race-Based Discrimination for Intervention Efforts: Preventing Another Trayvon Martin Tragedy
AN  - 2222750583
AB  - Psychological science offers a variety of methods to both understand and intervene when acts of potential racial or ethnic racism, bias or prejudice occur. The Trayvon Martin killing is a reminder of how vulnerable African American men and boys, especially young African American men, are to becoming victims of social inequities in our society. We examine several historical events of racial bias (the Los Angeles civil disturbance after the Rodney King verdict, the federal government’s launch of a “War on Drugs” and the killing of Trayvon Martin) to illustrate the ways in which behaviors of racism and race-based discrimination can be viewed from a psychological science lens in the hopes of eliminating and preventing these behaviors. If society is to help end the genocide of African American men and boys then we must broaden our focus from simply understanding instances of victimization to a larger concern with determining how policies, laws, and societal norms serve as the foundation for maintaining implicit biases that are at the root of race-based discrimination, prejudice, bias and inequity. In our call to action, we highlight the contributions that psychologists, particularly racial and ethnic minority professionals, can make to reduce the negative impact of racial and ethnic bias through their volunteer/pro bono clinical efforts.

T1  - CULTURAL DIVISION AMONG DIASPORIC NIGERIANS: A SYSTEMIC DILEMMA
AN  - 1464753077
AB  - In my childhood, it was quite noticeable that distinctions between Yoruba, Edo, Ibo, and Hausa were minimal. At independence in the early 1960's, Nigeria's population stood at fifty-six million, compared to about 152 million today. Between 1960 and 2008, Nigeria, a multi-ethnic and multi- religious nation with considerable development potential, fell into the ethnic clashes over distribution of scarce resources among competitive interest groups. Nigeria cultural divisions are very complicated phenomena. This essay reviews the degree of normlessness, alienation, powerlessness and cultural estrangement among diasporic Nigerians and how social dynamics, such as differentiated ideology and social distance, have affected the participation of ethnic minorities within their Nigerian counterparts. In addition, to a great extent, the cultural division faced by the diasporic Nigerians gradually increased bias among ethnic groups often against their own group interest. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Improving intergroup attitudes via mediated intergroup contact in a bilingual setting
AN  - 1463012904; 201345887
AB  - This paper explores the role of mediated intergroup contact in improving intergroup attitudes between Italian speakers and German speakers in South Tyrol, Italy. Specifically, we examine how German-language television consumption affects attitudes towards the German-speaking group among Italian-speaking youth. The data (N = 229) were collected among Italian-speaking secondary school students in 2011. As expected, the results indicated that more German TV use was associated with more positive attitudes toward German speakers. A cognitive mediator (intergroup understanding) had a greater influence than an affective one (intergroup anxiety) in mediating the effect of TV use on attitudes. The effect of TV use on attitudes was greater among those who had less personal intergroup contact, but there were no differences in the effects of television based on variations in the local ethnolinguistic vitality of the two groups. Findings and implications are discussed, and suggestions for future research are made. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - All about us, but never about us: The three-pronged potency of prejudice
AN  - 1417524742; 201331932
AB  - Three points that are implicit in Dixon et al.'s paradigm-challenging paper serve to make prejudice potent. First, prejudice reflects understandings of social identity -- the relationship of "us" to "them" -- that are shared within particular groups. Second, these understandings are actively promoted by leaders who represent and advance in-group identity. Third, prejudice is identified in out-groups, not in-groups.

T1  - Beyond prejudice: Relational inequality, collective action, and social change revisited
AN  - 1417523648; 201331883
AB  - This response clarifies, qualifies, and develops our critique of the limits of intergroup liking as a means of challenging intergroup inequality. It does not dispute that dominant groups may espouse negative attitudes towards subordinate groups. Nor does it dispute that prejudice reduction can be an effective way of tackling resulting forms of intergroup hostility. What it does dispute is the assumption that getting dominant group members and subordinate group members to like each other more is the best way of improving intergroup relations that are characterized by relatively stable, institutionally embedded, relations of inequality. In other words, the main target of our critique is the model of change that underlies prejudice reduction interventions and the mainstream concept of "prejudice" on which they are based.

T1  - US host nationals' attitudes toward Japanese: the role of communication and relational solidarity in the intergroup contact hypothesis
AN  - 1373428425; 201328620
AB  - Guided by the intergroup contact hypothesis and intergroup contact theory, the authors examined US Americans' (N = 403) communication experiences and relational solidarity with their most frequent Japanese contact and associations with their attitudes toward Japanese as a cultural group. Structure Equation Modeling (SEM) results showed that both communication frequency and quality had an indirect effect through relational solidarity on affective, behavioral, and cognitive attitudes, demonstrating the critical mediating role of relational solidarity. Results also revealed that communication quality was positively and directly associated with the attitudinal measures. Implications of the findings are discussed with respect to prior literature on relational communication in intergroup and intercultural contexts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cohesion from Conflict: Does Intergroup Conflict Motivate Intragroup Norm Enforcement and Support for Centralized Leadership?
AN  - 1373427456; 201328363
AB  - Classic work suggests that intergroup conflict increases intragroup cohesion and cooperation. But how do group members respond when their peers refuse to cooperate? Simmel ([1908] 1955) argued that groups in conflict quell dissent by sanctioning group members and supporting centralized leadership systems. This claim has important implications, but little direct support. This research investigates how intergroup conflict shapes individuals' tendencies to sacrifice for their groups, enforce norms by sanctioning their peers, and relinquish decision-making autonomy to a leader. I test the predictions with two small group experiments, which find that conflict increases enforcement of norms when outgroup participation in conflict is high and increases contribution to the group regardless of outgroup participation in conflict. Evidence on support for leaders is mixed and suggests that the performance of the group may affect support for leaders. The research has broader theoretical implications for the study of group processes, collective action, and institutions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racialized Customer Service in Restaurants: A Quantitative Assessment of the Statistical Discrimination Explanatory Framework
AN  - 1018359203; 201212827
AB  - Despite popular claims that racism and discrimination are no longer salient issues in contemporary society, racial minorities continue to experience disparate treatment in everyday public interactions. The context of full-service restaurants is one such public setting wherein racial minority patrons, African Americans in particular, encounter racial prejudices and discriminate treatment. To further understand the causes of such discriminate treatment within the restaurant context, this article analyzes primary survey data derived from a community sample of servers (N=200) to assess the explanatory power of one posited explanation-statistical discrimination. Taken as a whole, findings suggest that while a statistical discrimination framework toward understanding variability in servers' discriminatory behaviors should not be disregarded, the framework's explanatory utility is limited. Servers' inferences about the potential profitability of waiting on customers across racial groups explain little of the overall variation in subjects' self-reported discriminatory behaviors, thus suggesting that other factors not explored in this research are clearly operating and should be the focus of future inquires.

T1  - In Consideration of Social Context: Re-examining the Linguistic Intergroup Bias Paradigm
AN  - 904383192
AB  - The role of language in the transmission of prejudice, including the features of the linguistic intergroup bias (LIB) paradigm, has received much theoretical attention. This study investigates whether LIB predictions hold true within a relatively harmonious bilingual context. The LIB is examined as a function of several individual and sociocontextual factors, including second language confidence, group identification, and group vitality. Results support, but with qualification, the LIB phenomenon. While some participants demonstrated a LIB effect, others communicated out-group favoritism. Minority-group members used linguistic bias differently than majority-group members. Results are discussed within the context of social psychological theories of communication. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Priming Patriots: Social Identity Processes And The Dynamics Of Public Support For War
AN  - 875717398; 201115506
AB  - Contemporary theories of opinion dynamics-exemplified by Zaller's "receive-accept-sample" model-tend to assume that attitude change should occur only following exposure to new, attitude-relevant information. Within this prevailing view, the expected direction and magnitude of opinion change is largely a function of the tone and content of the new information to which one is exposed. In contrast, social identification theories show how opinion change can occur when a person's environmental context activates social knowledge stored in long-term memory. These theories propose that attitude change can result merely from increasing the perceived salience of a social conflict. They further propose that the direction and magnitude of opinion change should be unrelated to the tone or content of the information that draws attention to the conflict. This study examines how the ebb and flow of war news on the front page of the New York Times is related to changes in levels of domestic public support for major American military conflicts from 1950 to the present. We find no consistent or compelling evidence that levels of aggregate war support change in ways predicted by information updating models. To the contrary, a social identification process appears to be underlying the aggregate dynamics of war support. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Space Boundaries in Schizophrenia: Voluntary Action for Improved Judgments of Social Distances
AN  - 919902298; 201201509
AB  - The present study evaluates whether in schizophrenia deficits in specifying social distances appropriately for inter individual; interactions might be related to abnormal capabilities in specifying the boundaries of reachable space. Using a stop-distance paradigm, 20 patients with schizophrenia and their controls judged from seven preselected angles when a target reached the boundaries of peripersonal space. Results revealed that spatial perception was similar for patients and controls throughout the workspace with more accurate judgments in the preferred hemi-field. Nevertheless, patients were significantly more variable in their judgments; this variability was correlated with the PANSS disorganization: cluster. In task 2, participants were required to judge either the boundaries of reachable space (target was an object) or to evaluate social distances (target was a person). Results revealed here again increased judgment variability in schizophrenia, in both situations. Of key importance was that results were normalized in the patients, when judgments were made through voluntary movement. These results argue for a similar brain mechanism for the determination of space and social distances. Furthermore, they suggest an important role of voluntary movement for the creation of stronger motor representations of action goals, which provide the basis for more accurate judgments of space boundaries during both physical and social interactions. The findings are discussed in light of the embodied theory of cognition and their implications for social skills in patients suffering from mental illnesses. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Examining Public Attitudes towards Recent Foreign Policy Issues: Britain's Involvement in the Iraq and Afghanistan Conflicts
AN  - 902084724; 201122823
AB  - This article assesses which factors underpin public attitudes towards two recent and controversial foreign policy issues: Britain's involvement in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Using data from the 2005 and 2010 British Election Studies, it undertakes a statistical examination of which sociological and political factors are related to support for and opposition to British involvement in these conflicts. It shows that attitudes are structured both by social characteristics and by beliefs and evaluations rooted in domestic politics. The former include gender, age and ethnic group, while the latter include partisanship and newspaper readership. It demonstrates the need for further investigation of foreign policy attitudes among the British public. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The People Doth Protest Too Much: Explaining Away Subtle Racism
AN  - 1928171181
AB  - The present study examined whether the length of an individual's written explanation for an instance of subtle, attributionally ambiguous racism related to their perception of racism, levels of prejudice, and social dominance orientation. Individuals (n = 51) read a brief vignette describing an instance of subtle racism and then wrote a description explaining what they believed was happening in the situation. Individuals higher in prejudice and social dominance orientation wrote longer situational explanations. Individuals who wrote longer situational explanations were less likely to perceive the situation as racist and more likely to attribute that situation to a chance happening. Finally, longer explanations also contained more situational attributions unrelated to race. As the number of attributions unrelated to race increased, the perception of racism decreased. The present results suggest that longer explanations helped individuals explain away subtle racism.

T1  - Ideological Configurations and Prediction of Attitudes toward Immigrants in Chile and Germany
AN  - 865822587
AB  - The concept of ideological configuration is proposed to refer to a complex of ideological attitudes - Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) - based on a shared core of derogation of outgroups. This concept is used in two surveys, in Chile and in Germany, to predict attitudes toward foreigners. Analyses using structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that a second-order factor involving RWA and SDO predicts hostility toward foreigners in Germany and affection toward Peruvian and Argentinean immigrants in Chile. This prediction was stronger in Germany than in Chile. The difference in strength is discussed in terms of the kind of measurements, different contexts of migration, and characteristics of the immigrants. Further research using the concept of ideological configuration is proposed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Racial Contact and Change in South Africa
AN  - 743066398; 201043235
AB  - We investigate the effects of sociopolitical change on intergroup contact and social distance attitudes in South Africa, and the effect of these variables on intergroup attitudes and racial policy attitudes. The data come from secondary analysis of surveys conducted between 1991 and 2005, as well as a dedicated survey conducted in 2006. The results reveal widespread racial isolation among Black people; ambivalent attitudes to racial integration among Whites, who support integration in principle but are opposed to it personally; and contrasting outcomes of contact for Blacks and Whites. Increased intergroup contact was associated with reduced stereotyping and increased support for transformation policies among Whites but was associated with increased opposition to transformation policies among Blacks. Contrary to the predictions of contact theory, attitudes of Blacks and Whites toward Coloured and Indian compatriots were generally more negative in provinces with high levels of intergroup contact between these groups.

T1  - When personal identities confirm versus conflict with group identities: Evidence from an intergroup paradigm
AN  - 743065720; 201043110
AB  - This study provides an experimental investigation of the consequences of conflict between children's personal identities and experimentally manipulated group identities. Elementary-school-aged children (N = 82, ages 5-11) attending a summer school program rated their own academic and athletic abilities and were then randomly assigned to one of two novel groups. Children's views of the academic and athletic skills of the novel groups were assessed both before and after information about the groups' academic and athletic skills was manipulated via posters placed in their classrooms. Following the manipulation, children's self-views, ingroup identification, and intergroup attitudes were assessed. Results indicated that (a) in the absence of information about the novel groups, children projected their personal identities onto their ingroup identities, (b) children maintained their ingroup identities in the face of new information that should have altered their ingroup identities, and (c) more positive personal identities predicted ingroup bias, which in turn predicted happiness with one's ingroup membership. The latter finding suggests that a tendency for children to generalize from their idiosyncratic positive self-views, rather than an indiscriminate desire for self-enhancement or positivity, may be responsible for ingroup bias.

T1  - Influencing Trust And Confidence In The London Metropolitan Police: Results from an Experiment Testing the Effect of Leaflet Drops on Public Opinion
AN  - 754038470; 201052147
AB  - Enhancing trust and confidence has moved to the centre of policing policy in England and Wales. The association between direct encounters with police officers and confidence in the police is well-established. But is it possible for the police to increase confidence among the general population including those people who do not routinely come into direct contact with police officers? This paper presents the findings from a quasi-randomised experiment conducted on population representative samples in seven London wards that assessed the impact of a leaflet drop on public perceptions of policing. The results provide strong evidence of an improvement in overall confidence, and in perceptions of police-community engagement, specifically. The leaflets also appear to have had a buffering effect against declines in public assessments of police effectiveness. The findings support the idea that public trust and confidence can be enhanced by direct police communication of this type. Adapted from the source document.
